 BIS Review 16/2003 1 Otmar Issing: Monetary and financial stability - is there a trade-off? Speech by Professor Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Conference on “Monetary Stability, Financial Stability and the Business Cycle”, Bank for International Settlements, Basel, 28-29 March 2003. The references for the speech can be found on the European Central Bank’s website. *      *      * The question whether there is a trade-off between monetary and financial stability has been one of the most interesting areas of research for central banking since many years. Researchers at the BIS have been regular and valuable contributors to this discussion. Thus I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to convey my ideas on this subject here at the BIS in Basle. Problems with definitions Let me start by defining what I mean with monetary and financial stability. Monetary stability is a synonym for price stability. Price stability refers to a stable price level or a low level of inflation and not to stable individual prices. There is no doubt that changing relative prices play a crucial and beneficial part in economic adjustment and decision making by individual actors be it companies or households. Part of the costs of inflation can be related to the fact that these relative price signals will be blurred more and more the higher the rates of inflation.1 Although there are some issues concerning the most relevant composition and measurement of the price index and the optimal horizon over which to define price stability, in general the concept is widely accepted and relatively straightforward to handle, both conceptually and in central banking practice. An example of an explicit definition of price stability is the one chosen by the ECB, which refers to a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2 percent, which is to be maintained over the medium term.2 The same degree of clarity cannot be claimed with regard to financial stability. A generally accepted definition has to my knowledge not yet been provided. Besides the fact that most authors find it more convenient to define financial instability instead of its positive counterpart, a clear distinction exists between definitions, which are based on a system approach and those, which are related to the volatility of directly observable financial variables. An example of the former would be a definition broadly following Mishkin (1991), which can be adapted to define financial stability as the prevalence of a financial system, which is able to ensure in a lasting way, and without major disruptions, an efficient allocation of savings to investment opportunities.3 How close an economy is to the break point, exceeding which would impair the efficient allocation of savings, could be labelled the degree of financial fragility. This definition is very broad and - in my opinion - intellectually convincing. Due to the focus on the resilience of the financial system it would not classify each individual bank failure or each large swing in an asset price as proof of financial instability. To the contrary, large swings in asset prices possibly leading to some failures of monetary and financial institutions in the aftermath of a large real or financial shock could even be a sign of stability and of self-purifying powers of the system,4 as long as an efficient financial intermediation and financing process can be maintained. However, this definition contains little practical guidance for any institution trying to maintain or to contribute to the goal of financial stability. Other, less conceptually convincing, but more directly observable definitions (and therefore frequently used in theoretical work) equate financial stability with situations without banking crisis and with asset price stability, including interest rate smoothness,                                                       1  See Gaspar and Smets (2002) and Issing (2000). 2  See ECB (1999). 3  A similar definition stressing the shock resilience and the payment processing dimension of financial stability can be found in Padoa-Schioppa (2002, p. 21). 4  In this context one could think of Schumpeter’s creative destruction and the reduction of moral hazard risks. 
 2 BIS Review 16/2003 relative to some benchmark.5 But such definitions are only apparently more tangible, because a suitable benchmark would still have to be found.   The difficulties related to the definition of financial stability reveal more than problems with semantics. The central bank’s role in contributing to financial stability is at stake. The definition to some degree predetermines the role subscribed to monetary policy in contributing to the goal of financial stability and anticipates the answer to the trade-off question. For example the system-based definition of financial stability intuitively and reasonably suggests that prudential supervision should play the first violin in pursuit of financial stability objectives. The reason is that comparing the toolboxes of regulators and monetary policy authorities (in a narrow sense), it is clear that the former have an absolute advantage in caring for system wide stability of financial institutions, as they are able to define, monitor and enforce the rules of the game. The central bank’s tools primarily influence the money supply, which make price stability a natural objective. Furthermore, the definition illustrates that the central bank would not attempt to target asset prices as such, but would monitor them obviously with regard to their direct inflationary consequences but also in view of the possible systemic effects. Focusing on the impact of asset price instability rather than asset prices itself should reduce, although not abolish, moral hazard problems. If financial stability instead is defined as, for example, interest rate smoothness, a trade-off with price stability does immediately follow from Poole’s result in face of aggregate demand shocks. The central bank would have to choose to which degree it prefers to stabilise on the one hand interest rates or on the other hand output and inflation.  So the question of defining financial stability has non-negligible consequences with regard to the trade-off between monetary and financial stability. Price stability and financial stability - the conventional view Having briefly touched the substantive issue of definitions, let me turn straight away to the conventional central banker’s view concerning the trade-off between monetary and financial stability. The conventional wisdom is rather sceptical concerning the existence of a trade-off. The reason is that inflation is regarded as one of the major factors creating financial instability in the first place. This is in line with the view that inflation increases the likelihood of misperceptions about future return possibilities. Inflation can worsen the asymmetric information problem between lenders and borrowers. High inflation is always related to high inflation volatility, which adds to the problems of predicting real returns. A business cycle boom accompanied by high inflation is traditionally considered as the typical environment in which real over-investment and asset price bubbles blossom. Excess liquidity provided by the central bank is one of the main factors responsible for the development of inappropriately lax lending standards. Credit growth, which is excessive in view of realistic return expectations, is often the foundation for financial instability. In other words, stable prices and a monetary policy focused on that objective play an important role for stable financial markets. Strong protagonists of this view even claim that price stability is almost a sufficient condition for financial stability.6 Others are more careful and simply state that price stability will tend to promote financial stability.7 I think it is difficult to argue against the basic notion of the latter. Price stability and financial stability tend to mutually reinforce each other in the long run. This widespread view is supported by empirical evidence that many financial crises were caused by major shifts in the price level.8 Moreover, historically most banking crises occurred during recessions9 often following periods of high inflation. This is comforting for central bankers in the sense that the likely policy stance to maintain price stability will also be appropriate for the state of the financial system. According to the conventional view there is no general trade-off between monetary and financial stability. On the other hand we also know that the world is not always as straightforward as we might wish it were. We know that financial imbalances can build up even in an environment of stable prices - think                                                       5  See e.g. Goodfriend (1987) or Cukierman (1990). 6  Schwartz (1995). 7  Bordo and Wheelock (1998). 8 Bordo, Dueker and Wheelock (2000). 9  Gorton (1988),  Calomiris and Gorton (1991). 
 BIS Review 16/2003 3 for example of the US in the 1920s and 1990s and Japan in the late 1980s. Thus we must be aware that price stability is not a sufficient condition for financial stability.  However, just as the concrete definition of financial stability is important for the precise link of financial stability to monetary policy, the choice of the monetary policy strategy has implications for financial stability. If the central bank has a primary objective to maintain price stability over the medium term, simply pursuing an inflation targeting strategy according to an inflation forecast of one or two years horizon might not always be the optimal policy strategy. The overall costs (in terms of a standard central bank loss function mainly future deflation following a financial crisis) might not receive the appropriate weight in a limited horizon inflation forecast. Truly optimal monetary policy cannot avoid that, at times, strains in the financial system might be such that deviations from the desired inflation rate during shorter periods of time have to be accepted, in order to preserve price stability over the medium to long run.10 The argument here implies, of course, that monetary policy decisions actually bear on the state of the financial system and could at the margin even be decisive to prevent the crisis and allow the system to recover. A second argument leading to the same conclusion stems from risk asymmetries. Given the fact that consequences of a systemic financial crisis can be quite substantial, the optimal monetary policy might at times chose to err on the side of caution, in order to reduce the probability for a crisis to a very small likelihood11. Due to the asymmetries (very low probability of very large loss) involved, actual inflation is then likely to exceed expected inflation - and optimally so - for quite some time.  The above argumentation can be used to illustrate why the ECB has always stressed that its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy is more than simple inflation forecast targeting, and it is also more robust. The reason is that explicitly focusing on monetary and credit developments in order to form a judgement on consumer price inflation in the medium to long run, forces the ECB to take a sufficiently forward looking perspective. For example, Borio, English and Filardo (2003, p. 43) explicitly recognise the pre-emptive role of the first pillar of the ECB monetary policy strategy. This longer perspective highlights risks to price stability stemming from financial imbalances. As an important side effect, the optimal price stability-oriented policy reaction based on monetary and credit developments is likely to diminish financial imbalances. The latter claim rests on the observation of a positive correlation between credit growth and bubble developments. Policy would be tightened in times of rising and loosened in times of unwinding financial imbalances.12 At this point it is worth stressing that according to the previous arguments considering financial imbalances - from time to time - may lead to a different monetary policy stance than fixed-horizon inflation targeting, despite the fact that the only objective of the central bank is price stability (defined over the appropriate medium term horizon).  The “new environment” hypothesis Interestingly it has recently been suggested that the conventional wisdom that price stability is good for financial stability has to be reversed. This  - at least for central bankers of my generation - provocative view, has been presented in several very recent BIS research working papers13 but is also spreading in the academic world.14 Very first signs of a discussion along these lines can be found in the FOMC minutes of the November 13, 1996 meeting, a few weeks before Chairman Greenspan made his famous “irrational exuberance” speech. During the FOMC meeting Governor Lindsay mentioned being preoccupied by the thought that the central bank’s success of keeping inflation under control could trigger a too optimistic outlook on the future course of economic development. Peoples’ false sense of security could lead to asset valuations, which could pose problems for the future. Since then additional arguments have been forwarded to explain why low and stable inflation can make the financial system more vulnerable - and in compliance with language used in BIS research papers I will label this the                                                       10  See Kent and Lowe (1997), Brousseau and Detken (2001). 11  Bordo and Jeanne (2002) argue one should think of this aspect in terms of an insurance. 12  See Issing (2002). 13  See Borio and Lowe (2002) and Borio, English and Filardo (2003). 14 See Blinder (1999). 
 4 BIS Review 16/2003 “new environment” hypothesis in the following.15 The reasons suggested are that for quite some time inflationary pressure might not show up in inflation itself, due to a) low pricing power of firms, b) positive supply side developments and c) well anchored low inflation expectations. It has been argued that central banks’ focus on (consumer) price stability is insufficient and financial imbalances would have to be addressed directly. This direct response could consist of two parts. It would first involve trying to avoid (or at least subdue) the building up process of financial imbalances and second - if the former was unsuccessful (or insufficient) - to smooth the adverse consequences when imbalances are being unwound.  Policy implications I have at previous occasions already stated my doubts that price stability should be added to the list of causes triggering financial instability.16 I do not deny the fact that financial fragility can be significant in times of low inflation. But the latter statement that low inflation is not a sufficient condition for financial stability and the former that low inflation causes financial instability, are worlds apart. Here I would like to focus on two particular aspects, which is the trade-off question with respect to the “new environment” hypothesis and the related relevance of the problems associated with identifying asset price bubbles.17 In the spirit of Tinbergen if the central bank has one policy instrument, i.e. monetary policy, it can only achieve one independent goal, which is price stability. An intuitive division of labour is to assign the objective of financial stability to a financial regulatory authority, which sets up a prudential supervisory framework. This regulatory authority can but must not be the central bank. In this scenario with two authorities following one objective each, none of the authorities would be subject to a policy trade-off, as the number of instruments matches the number of objectives. Nevertheless this reasoning cannot be used to exclude all conflict situations. In practice central banks’ responsibilities concerning financial stability vary a lot. For example, no general financial stability objective can be derived from the Treaty or the Statute of the ECB. Nevertheless the ECB has the task to contribute to policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the stability of the financial system [art. 105(5) of the Treaty, art. 3.3 and 25.1 of the Statute]. In addition it should promote the smooth functioning of payment systems [art. 105(2) fourth indent of the Treaty, art. 3.1 and 22 of the Statute]. Given the fact that in the long run financial stability supports sustainable price stability, it is difficult to deny any central bank’s legitimate interest in financial stability. Thus despite no trade-off being possible when financial stability is not a primary objective of the central bank, the separate allocation of objectives to institutions cannot exclude situations of short-term conflict, along the lines described in previous paragraphs. How does the trade-off discussion relate to the “new environment” hypothesis? Would there exist a trade-off between monetary and financial stability? Let us assume for a moment that it is true that low and stable rates of inflation foster asset price bubbles for the reasons given above, e.g. due to excessively optimistic expectations. If we take an extreme position, the existence of a trade-off will imply that achieving less price stability would generate more financial stability.  Due to the lack of evidence that inflation in general has a beneficial effect on financial stability and quite some evidence to the contrary, I regard the existence of such an exploitable trade-off as highly implausible. And to be fair, no proponent of the ‘new environment” view did so far suggest that the central bank should purposely increase inflation and inflation volatility. The only situation I can envisage where lower inflation could actually be conducive to financial instability is a period of significant and unprecedented disinflation, typically in times of convergence from a state of high to a state of low inflation. Very often simultaneous financial deregulation adds new risks as well as opportunities to investment decisions. Although a higher level of debt is sustainable with lower interest rates, unusually (and perhaps only temporarily) low nominal interest rates might give rise to the financing of too risky projects, due to the inexperience of both lenders and borrowers in a low-interest-low-inflation rate environment and due to the fact that liquidity constraints are automatically eased. But the fragility during periods of disinflation is a transitory adjustment problem and would vanish as soon as the economy gets accustomed to the new and stable environment.                                                        15 See Borio, English and Filardo (2003). 16  Issing (2002). 17  See also Greenspan (2002). 
 BIS Review 16/2003 5 Furthermore, in a broader, longer term perspective it is again high inflation which causes the problem. Without a preceding period of higher inflation, the economy would not have to go through a potentially vulnerable period of disinflation and adaptation to a regime of low inflation in the first place.   In general, though, a “new environment” economy would rather be another example where a short-term conflict between nearer term price stability and financial stability - rather than an exploitable trade-off - could arise. The reason is that an increase in interest rates required to dampen asset price inflation, prevent over-investment and thus reduce the risk of a serious financial crisis, could come along with lower than desired near term inflation. Again, this short-term conflict would occur not because financial stability should be an independent general objective of the central bank, but because the time horizon, over which the primary objective of price stability should be pursued includes future - possibly post-crisis - periods. The “new environment” short-term conflict is thus one where financial imbalances are considered important enough to possibly constitute a long run threat to price stability. To my mind it does not imply that the ultimate objective of monetary policy should not be price stability. With regard to asset prices any central bank intervention would imply that the central bank has the ability to detect a bubble in real time. I myself have often made the argument that the central bank has no comparative advantage over market participants to dare such a judgement.18 It follows that reacting to perceived financial imbalances could easily be misleading. It remains true that one can hardly be humble enough in judging one’s ability to estimate equilibrium asset prices in general. But in the light of the most recent boom and bust phase in equity markets, I would tend to be slightly less pessimistic about the possibilities to identify an extreme bubble in real time. There has been ample evidence that stock market developments in the late 90s were to a large part unrelated to fundamentals. Of course, this information has not been available to central banks alone. But due to the uncertainty related to the timing when the bubble will burst, it often is more rewarding for market participants to follow the trend than to bet against it. This view is consistent with the recent literature on market efficiency, which finds that returns are to some degree predictable, but the horizon, over which this would be exploitable, is too long to be sustainable for individual market participants. Thus the central bank might have a role to play in providing a noisy but unbiased opinion about equilibrium prices to the public. Recently arguments have been forwarded that the uncertainty related to the identification of an asset price bubble is not fundamentally different from the uncertainty surrounding other variables, in which the central bank bases its policy decisions. In particular, estimates of the output gap rely to a large degree on very much the same information needed to identify a stock market bubble, which is underlying productivity growth and the equilibrium risk premium.19 More provokingly Cechetti et al (2003, p. 440) recently claimed that “if you cannot estimate asset price misalignments, you cannot forecast inflation either.” I consider the latter view purposely exaggerated for dramatic effect. But still there is probably more truth to it than is commonly accepted in central banking circles. I would therefore not completely disregard the possibility that situations of financial instability can be approximately identified in a relevant time horizon and that this information should find its way into policy decisions.20  There still remains the issue at which level and how strongly a central bank should react to a perceived misalignment of asset prices. The strongest form is to target the asset price level, which is considered to be in line with fundamentals. This idea has been rejected - and correctly so -many times before.21 Here, I only mention the moral hazard problems and possible indeterminacy of inflation such a policy would foster. A second less interventionist strategy would be for the central bank to lean against the wind of asset price changes. Here I must say that I share concerns that the monetary policy reaction necessary to prick a bubble in the midst of an euphoric bull market, could create immense risks for the real economy, in particular for the more interest sensitive sectors. This is even truer, when the central bank suddenly shifts gears, after having been accommodating financial market developments for an extended period of time. A third option would be that the central bank avoids accommodating asset price movements, which are deemed to move away from equilibrium. As was                                                       18  See Issing (2002) and Garber (2000). 19  See Cechetti, Genberg and Wadhwani (2003). 20  Some first steps in this direction have been provided by Borio and Lowe (2002). 21  See e.g. Issing (2002). 
 6 BIS Review 16/2003 explained above, the ECB two pillars strategy would send a “warning signal” in cases when the forecast for consumer price development is benign but monetary and credit aggregates rise strongly. In considering monetary policy actions the result of the analysis would at least ask for a more cautious approach. Finally, as a fourth option, the central bank could choose to react mainly by means of communication. Communicating its views when asset prices are considered to be out of bound with fundamentals could lead market participants to increase their own doubts about the sustainability of price developments. An example of the latter strategy can be observed during the period of undervaluation of the euro early in this millennium.22 ECB representatives issued statements that the euro would have the potential to appreciate. The Editorials of the Monthly Bulletins between March 2000 and October 2000 showed increasing concern with the divergence of fundamentals and the external value of the euro.23 Although the estimation of equilibrium exchange rates is a difficult business as model and parameter uncertainty are huge,24 it was evident at the time that such statements were correct. Again also in this case no guess on the timing of a trend reversal or on the exact equilibrium level could be made. While exchange rate and asset price misalignments raise some of the same issues, there are also some noteworthy differences. In most plausible scenarios, the likely impact of exchange rate misalignments on economic developments of the euro area is more important than asset price misalignments. Our knowledge concerning the impact of exchange rate changes is generally better founded than our understanding of the impact of asset price changes. On the other hand, in extreme scenarios the impact of major asset price adjustments could potentially be more harmful for the euro area than (even large) exchange rate changes. Thus analysing the likelihood and impact of asset price “tail events” remains a major challenge for central bank research.  Conclusions Let me conclude. I started out by discussing why defining financial stability is as difficult as it is important. Namely, it can pre-empt the answer to the trade-off question. A system definition of financial stability practically excludes a trade-off between monetary and financial stability. It does so partly by promoting a clear assignment of objectives to authorities according to comparative advantages of the major instruments in their toolboxes.  Furthermore, if the central bank employs a medium term horizon for the definition of price stability and implies a strategy encompassing a stability-oriented, forward-looking approach, financial imbalances will implicitly obtain the attention they deserve.25 This is true even if financial stability is not considered a general objective of the central bank and monetary policy aims at maintaining the objective of price stability.  This does not rule out the existence of a short-term conflict. In most cases price stability would foster financial stability. In rare circumstances though, a short-term conflict is possible. With short–term conflict I refer to a situation where it is optimal to deviate from the desired rate of inflation in the short-run in order to best maintain price stability over the medium run. Therefore, in the context of an appropriate definition of price stability and financial stability and in particular an appropriate concept for the horizon to which the policy objective should apply, the conflict disappears. The “new environment” view for central banking, according to which low inflation is detrimental to financial stability, in my opinion, does not overturn the conventional wisdom that in general price stability fosters financial stability.  Ironically, there could exist a trade-off between accepting that at times shorter-term deviations from the desired rate of inflation can be optimal and acting accordingly on the one side and the overall credibility of a central bank on the other side. If the previously described optimal policy would lead to a prolonged period of deviations from the declared inflation objective, the long-term loss of inflation fighting reputation could outweigh the gains.  Furthermore, any systematic central bank response to financial instability, which is expected by financial market participants, will most likely trigger higher                                                       22  See Gaspar and Issing (2002) concerning the role of the exchange rate for monetary policy  23  See ECB Monthly Bulletins in March, April, May, September and October 2000. 24  See Detken et al. (2002), Maeso-Fernandez et al. (2002), ECB (2002).   25  See also “The Economist, on January 18th, 2003, Economics Focus: Still bubbling, p. 66 
 BIS Review 16/2003 7 risk taking. As a consequence the financial system might not become a safer place, and the only result would be higher average inflation. Accepting the possibility of a short-term conflict between monetary and financial stability must not mean that the moral hazard problem is denied or forgotten.  And finally, a last reason for caution is that temporarily deviating from the declared price stability objective for financial stability reasons might be difficult to explain to the public. In dealing with this latter trade-off, central bankers should be risk-averse with regard to their primary objective, as the loss of inflation fighting credibility may weigh heavily. But reputation is also at stake, if a central bank is perceived as having underestimated or even neglected the issue of financial instability. Thus the final conclusion is that there is no easy choice, which is not a surprising result in a complex world.  
 BIS Review 16/2003 1 Yves Mersch: The reform of the Governing Council of the ECB Panel statement by Mr Yves Mersch, President of the Central Bank of Luxembourg and Member of the Governing Council of the ECB, at the Central Bankers' Panel, European Banking & Financial Forum Prague, 25 March 2003. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure for me to participate once again in the European Banking and Financial Forum and to be back in Prague in order to speak before such a distinguished audience. My brief presentation will perhaps not directly cover the topic "When and how Europe can again become the global superpower" but is nevertheless closely related to both Europe and power. It will deal with how power, and more specifically voting power at the ECB's Governing Council, will be reallocated in order to cope with the ongoing expansion of the EU. It is also an excellent example of how the EU works: decisions are taking after a vigorous democratic debate, and a consensus is sought whereby the interests of all those involved are taken into account. My presentation is structured as follows: 1. I will start by briefly describing the Governing Council and how, as a result of enlargement, it was considered necessary to reform its voting procedure.  2. Subsequently, I will analyse how the discussions in the Governing Council led to the approval of a dynamic rotation model and the utilisation of a composite indicator, made up of both an economic and a financial variable. I will also go in some detail in the formal ECB recommendation, notably in terms of group composition and voting frequency.  3. Before concluding, I will look at the reactions of all the institutions involved in the enabling clause procedure: the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament (EP).  1. The need for reform 1.1. The Governing Council The Governing Council is the supreme decision-making power of the ECB. It comprises the members of the Executive Board of the ECB and the Governors of the national central banks or NCBs. The Executive Board has 6 members: the President, the Vice President and 4 other members. They are all nominated by a European procedure, contrary to the NCB governors who are appointed at the national level. The Treaty and the Statute assign to the Governing Council the power to take the most important and strategically significant decisions for the Eurosystem. It defines and implements the monetary policy of the euro area. In particular when taking monetary policy decisions, the Governing Council normally acts by a simple majority of the votes cast by the members who are present in person. Each member has one vote. The principle of 'one member, one vote' reflects the status of all the members of the Governing Council, including the governors of the NCBs of the Eurosystem, who are appointed in their personal capacity and not as representatives of their Member States. For some decisions on financial matters relating to the status of the NCB as shareholders of the capital of the ECB, the votes of the Governing Council are weighted according to the NCBs' share in the subscribed capital of the ECB. On such occasions the votes of the members of the Executive Board are zero-weighted. At the time of the Maastricht Treaty, the EU counted 12 Member States and the arrival of 3 new members was widely expected.Consequently the Treaty envisaged Governing Council eventually comprising 21 members: 6 Executive Board Members and 15 NCB Governors. 
 2 BIS Review 16/2003 1.2. Enlargement 1.2.1. The enabling clause of the Treaty of Nice In order to cope with the EU's current enlargement, the Treaty of Nice, which became effective on February 1 of this year, called for a revision of the decision-making procedures for, or composition of, several European institutions such as the Commission, the Council, the European Parliament and the ECB. Indeed, many feared that the Governing Council's capacity for efficient and timely decision-making would be hampered if its membership expanded to up to 33 members, namely 6 Executive Board Members and, eventually, 27 NCB Governors. A solution therefore implies that the overall number of Governing Council members having voting rights would have to be smaller than the overall number of Governing Council members. To this end, the Treaty of Nice contained a so-called enabling clause which, in essence, enabled the Council to amend Article 10.2 of the ECB Statute on a recommendation from either the ECB or the Commission. In case of an ECB recommendation, the procedure also involved consulting the Commission and the European Parliament. It should be emphasised that the reform of the Governing Council should in no way be compared to the reform of other institutions such as the Council. It is also remarkable that the Treaty of Nice included the possibility for the ECB to come up with a recommendation for its own reform. It should also be underlined that the enabling clause is limited in scope. It concerns only the voting rights of the Governing Council and does not, for example, allow modifying the composition of the Governing Council or of the Executive Board. Similarly, it does not allow to restrict the membership of the Governing Council; or to some form of Monetary Policy Committee or Board. Moreover, the procedure is very complex. The ECB recommendation had to be taken by unanimity, and to be approved unanimously by the Council, meeting in its composition of Heads of State or Government, before ratification by all Member States according to their respective constitutional requirements. Within these constraints and on 3 February 2003, only two days after the Nice Treaty took effect, the ECB adopted unanimously a recommendation, which I will explain and discuss in more detail. However, prior to doing so, I would like to turn a moment to the expansion of the Eurosystem, in order to clearly distinguish this from EU enlargement. 1.2.2. The expansion of the Eurosystem The Eurosystem consists of the ECB and of the NCBs of all countries having adopted the euro. The timing of its expansion from the current 12 to the eventual "steady state" of 27 members is, however, highly uncertain. Currently three EU countries are outside the euro area. The United Kingdom and Denmark have an exemption, while Sweden has the statute of a country with derogation. All the new members will, upon joining the EU, automatically have the statute of countries with a derogation, that is to say with a clear commitment to join the euro area at a later stage. According to a position published by the ECB, the adoption of the euro is considered the result of a complex convergence process, rather than a mere exchange rate measure. Hence unilateral euroisation is considered unacceptable. The accession countries have to respect the converge criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty in terms of inflation, public finances and interest rates, and are expected to achieve high levels of real and nominal convergence, meaning that their economic structure and inflation levels have to converge to EU levels. In addition, they have to participate for at least two years in ERM II. 2. The ECB recommendation 2.1. Initial discussions Initially a multitude of possible solutions were analysed. Relatively soon, a constituency model, a capital key inspired voting system and a double majority system, to name only the principal proposals, were all abandoned. 
 BIS Review 16/2003 3 • A constituency model, based on regional groupings like in the IMF and the World Bank, was rejected as it was felt that this would violate the principle of total independence of the individual NCB governors because a representative of a constituency would probably feel obliged to defend the interests of his / her constituency in the Governing Council. This is contrary to the current system, whereby each NCB Governor votes with the interests of the entire euro area at heart, rather than on basis of national interests.  • A system of weighted voting which, by the way, is also used in the Bretton Woods institutions, is contrary to the "one member, one vote" principle of the EU Treaty. As we have seen earlier, the Statute of the ESCB foresees only this scenario for voting related to shareholdership, i.e. national central banks, issues. In these circumstances the Executive Board has, accordingly, a zero-weight.  • A double majority system, inspired by the revision of voting in the Council as decided by the Nice Treaty, was also rejected. First, the Council is not a relevant example for the ECB as the former is an intergovernmental body while the latter is a supranational institution. Second, many members felt this would result in a directoire, dominated by the largest countries. Under one version of this model, a proposal first requires approval by a majority of the Governing Council, including at least 3 of the 6 Executive Board Members. Moreover, any Governing Council member would have the right to request verification that a pre-set GDP level is represented. In case this representativeness level is set at for example 62%, Germany and France jointly could block any decision. Interestingly, as we shall see later, the European Parliament, with a German rapporteur, also made a proposal for a double majority, consisting of, first, the population and second, the total size of the economy and the financial sector.  • The creation of a Monetary Board, consisting of theExecutive Board and a few additional members, as sometimes suggested in the press or academia, was rejected for being incompatible with the model and the structure of the Governing Council. It violates the principle of decentralisation, on which the Eurosystem is based. When large areas of policy making are still national in the EU, the case for excessive concentration of decision making seems out of touch with political reality. As the EU is not a single nation, the structure from the ECB is different from the Fed's structure.  • An election system could appear appropriate but entails many practical difficulties in a body like the Governing Council. An unrestricted election might not fulfil the representativeness criteria and might lead to a "market" for votes and a less cooperative atmosphere in the Governing Council. Imposing certain conditions or safeguard clauses concerning representativeness, and maximum and minimum participation though simple in theory may well, in practice, present many drawbacks.  2.2. Dynamic rotation models and representativeness In order to allay fears that decisions in the Governing Council might be taken by a majority not necessarily representative of the euro area's economy, discussions turned to a system of dynamic rotation models, whereby governors are allocated to different groups with varying voting rights on basis of a to be defined economic criterion. Such a system would maintain the principle of equal treatment for the NCB governors and ensure sufficient levels of representativeness. 2.2.1. Fundamental principles A dynamic rotation system was considered the most equitable, efficient and acceptable way of assigning voting rights among the governors, particularly as the design of the rotation system was guided by a handful of guiding principles: • 'One member, one vote' and 'ad personam participation': All members of the Governing Council will continue to attend meetings in a personal and independent capacity, and the "one member, one vote" principle, as opposed to weighted voting, will continue to apply to those NCB Governors exercising a voting right.  • Representativeness: At any moment, the NCB Governors with the right to vote must, as a whole, be representative of the euro area.  
 4 BIS Review 16/2003 • Transparency: The language of the revised Article 10.2 of the Statute has to be reasonably accessible and meet the requirements of primary Community Law.  • Consistency. During the transition phase, great care should be taken in order to avoid that governors of certain NCBs move randomly up and down between certain groups.  2.2.2. Number and Composition of Groups, voting rights, composite indicator and representativeness • Two-group versus three-group models. A long debate went on concerning the number of groups and their composition. Three-group models for the steady state were favoured from the outset, although a two-group model, consisting of 15 and 12 countries was also considered. In the final event, preference was given to a three-group model, which allows, roughly speaking, to rank countries according to whether they are large, medium or small. However, in an intermediary phase a two-group model will be used.  • Voting rights. At one stage it was discussed to limit the number of votes to the current 18. A consensus was eventually reached to set the number of votes at 21, (6 for the Executive Board and 15 for the NCB Governors). It was also decided to grant the 6 Executive Board permanent voting rights, as they are appointed by a special European procedure.  • Representativeness indicator. As the ECB is an economic and not a political body, the use of the population criterion appeared as inappropriate, even if it is used for the capital key together with GDP, and initially using exclusively GDP was favoured. However, it was increasingly found that the contribution of the financial sector, through which the ECB steers liquidity and interest rates, should also be taken into consideration. Moreover, the financial criterion, in contrast to GDP or population, is not purely national, but reflects the effective contribution of the various central banks to the Eurosystem. It is also in line with the experience of the American Federal Reserve System where no reference has been made to the relative weight of the various US states. Instead, according to section 2 of the Federal Reserve Act, the criteria are based on convenience and "customary course of business". Reflecting their importance as financial centres, the Presidents of the New York and Chicago Federal Reserve Banks enjoy respectively a permanent voting right and a 50% voting right in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), against a 33% voting right for virtually all other Fed Presidents. Several financial indicators such as the monetary aggregate M3, capital of credit institutions, bank deposits / loans and the Total Aggregated Balance Sheet of the Monetary Financial Institutions were analysed. Preference was given to TABS-MFI for conceptual, legal and statistical considerations. From a conceptual point of view, TABS-MFI is the broadest measure for the size of the financial sector. A legal definition exists in Community law and the statistical framework is well established and consistent.  • Concerning the relative weights for the composite indicator, the ECB proposed in its official recommendation to give GDP a weight of 5/6 th, against a relative weight of 1/6 th for TABS-MFI  2.3. Technical elements of the ECB recommendation In its recommendation, the ECB proposed a dynamic rotation model which, in the steady state, will have 21 voting rights. The Executive Board will have 6 permanent voting rights while the 27 governors, allocated to three groups on basis of the composite GDP-TABS indicator, will have 15 voting rights. In an initial phase, the model will consist of 2 groups. The detailed implementation provisions, including the possible decision to postpone the start of the rotation system so as to avoid the situation that governors within any voting group have a voting frequency of 100%, are to be adopted by the Governing Council, acting by a two-thirds majority of all its members, with and without a voting right. The ECB recommends introducing a two-group rotation system when the number of euro area Member States ranges from 16 to 21 Member States. Once the number of euro area Member States exceeds 21, a rotation system based on three groups will start operating. 
 BIS Review 16/2003 5 Group composition in the steady state In a euro area with 27 Member States, and on basis of the available figures for GDP and TABS-MFI, the first group would consist of the 5 Governors of Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain. NCB Governors in this group would have a voting frequency of 80%. The second group would consist of 14 members, namely the NCB Governors of the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, Poland, Finland, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. These Governors would vote 8 times out of 14, equivalent to a voting frequency of 57%. The third group would consist of the remaining 8 NCB Governors and have a voting frequency of 3/8 or 37,5%. This can be compared to their cumulative share in the composite GDP-TABS indicator of less than 1 %. In the steady state, the 3 groups of NCB governors will thus be made up of respectively 5, 14 and 8 members. This is the result of a pragmatic and empirical approach, which attempted, to the extent possible, to have clear separations between the different groups. Thus, the first member of the second group, the Netherlands, has a composite indicator which is 41% inferior to the indicator for the last country of the first group, Spain. The corresponding figure for the separation between the last country of the second group -Romania- and the first country of the third group -the Slovak Republic- is an even more striking 80%. 3. Follow up to the ECB recommendation The Council unanimously accepted the ECB's recommendation on 21 March, after a positive opinion from the European Commission and a non-binding rejection by the European Parliament. The Council also confirmed that the model for voting modalities in the Governing Council of the ECB should not be seen as a precedent for other EU-institutions. It is now up to the Member States to ratify therecommendation according to their own constitutional procedure. Let me add that, as the Treaty of Nice was already ratified, there seems to be no need for national referenda, something which should facilitate this gratification process. It is noteworthy, however, that both the Commission and the EP favoured a more comprehensive revision of the functioning of the Governing Council in the framework of the upcoming Intergovernmental Conference. I will analyse the position of these two institutions in more detail. 3.1. The Commission's opinion On 19 February, roughly two weeks after the ECB made its recommendation, the Commission issued a press release in which it indicated that, and I quote, "…the proposed model constitutes a step towards securing the continued efficiency of decision-making within the ECB in the perspective of enlargement." The Commission also emphasised that, and I quote, "…the severe limitations of the enabling clause of Art.10.6. of the ECB statutes…More fundamental and comprehensive reform of the ECB's governance structures could not be envisaged on this basis, but can only be achieved in the wider framework of the Convention and the upcoming IGC." On the same occasion, the Commission reiterated also the importance it attaches to the "population" criterion, a matter I have dealt with above. 3.2. The European Parliament's opinion The EP rejected on 11 March the ECB's recommendation, notably on the grounds "that it has been widely criticised for being excessively complex". In the short term the EP "…reaffirms the existing rule whereby all central bank governors of Member States in the eurozone have full and unrestricted voting rights, and whereby the Governing Council of the ECB takes decisions by simple majority." In the longer term, however, the EP "…Calls for the adoption of a solution at the next Intergovernmental Conference, after consulting the EP, which would distinguish between operational decisions, to be taken by an enlarged Executive Board of nine Members, adequately representing the 
 6 BIS Review 16/2003 euro area economy, and strategic and general monetary policy decisions, to be taken by the Governing Council acting on a double majority, based on the population of the Member States, the total size of the economy and the relative size within it of the financial services sector;" The essential points of the EP consist therefore of: • maintaining the statu quo in the short term, meaning that each NCB Governor has a vote;  • requesting the Intergovernmental Conference to create an enlarged Executive Board of nine members. Such an enlarged Board may well turn out be similar to the Monetary Board some academics and journalists have in mind;  • Most interestingly, the EP accepts the use of a composite indicator, based partly on a financial criterion.  4. Conclusion Please let me finish my presentation with a few concluding remarks. One of my fellow countrymen, Member of the European Parliament, stated during the recent debate in this institution, less than 2 weeks ago, that the debate about the enabling clause seemed to result from the fact that larger countries suffer from a Gulliver syndrome: they fear to be bound and tied up by the Lilliputians who outnumber them and, by definition, act in an irresponsible manner. Interestingly, this MEP reminded the Parliament that most blockages to European integration originated from the large, rather than from the small nations. Similarly, the small nations are the ones who abide punctiliously by the Growth and Stability Pact. Nevertheless, the fear seems to exist among larger Member States that the smaller ones might impose a lax monetary policy, even though it is generally accepted that NCB governors vote in the Governing Council on an ad personam basis and in the interest of the entire euro area. To this MEP, the whole debate about the enabling clause seemed therefore somewhat artificial and taken under unnecessary time pressure. All this was two weeks ago and in the meantime the Council approved the enabling clause. Particularly important and heartening, in my eyes, is the fact that a handful of guiding principles which the ECB considered of particular relevance were respected such as 'one member, one vote', ad personam participation, representativeness and transparency. Moreover, the ECB recommendation managed to avoid several perilous pitfalls: • As I mentioned, the 'one member, one vote' principle is maintained, even though all governors do not vote all of the time. However, whenever they are entitled to vote, the votes of all Governors carry the same weight and this is an important element of fairness between large and smaller countries.  • There is no re-nationalisation of monetary policy, as would have been the case if the Governing Council had moved to a system of IMF-style regional constituencies.  • Similarly, the fact that no Governor member of the Governing Council has a permanent voting right, and that they are all subject to a rotation scheme, is another important element of fairness between large and smaller countries.  • Finally, in the steady state, 4 new member countries are expected to become member of the second group while many of the remaining countries will gradually move from the third to the second group as real convergence, or "catching up" in plain English, progresses. In this respect, the ECB proposal also strikes a fair balance between current and new members, an important point I wish to emphasise here in Prague.  
 BIS Review 16/2003 1 The Rt Hon Sir Edward George: A brief review of economic and financial developments in the UK  Speech by The Rt Hon Sir Edward George, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Finance and Leasing Association Annual Dinner, London, 24 March 2003. *      *      * Mr Chairman, my Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, I must confess that I was surprised when I discovered that it was seven years since I last spoke at this Finance and Leasing Association Annual Dinner.  I'm delighted to be with you here this evening.  On that earlier occasion - in 1996 - I emphasised the corrosive and debilitating effect of high and variable inflation that we had experienced in this country over much of the previous 50 years. I stressed the damage that this had done to our economy - the pervasive uncertainty and unpredictability, and the short-termism that it induced, in personal and business as well as financial behaviour, the incentive to borrow and spend rather than save and invest, the masking of real price signals as the guide to efficient resource allocation, and the masking, too, of productive inefficiency that was too easily covered up by generally rising prices and earnings. But I suggested that the tide had already then finally begun to turn. I drew attention to the growing constituency in support of stability in this country - as a necessary condition for sustainable growth - after our particularly bitter experience of boom and bust in the late 1980's and early 1990's. I was able to point to the preceding four years - during which inflation had averaged just under 3¼%, compared with almost 10% over the previous 20 years. I was able, too, to point to sixteen consecutive quarters of positive economic growth. And I was able to point to a continuing, relatively steady fall in unemployment from its peak - in terms of the claimant count measure - of almost 10% in 1993. Then I held out to you the prospect of continuing stability - with low inflation and sustained economic growth - as far ahead as I could see. You didn't believe a word of it! You listened - very courteously, as I would expect from the members of your very professional association - but you listened with a good deal of scepticism, which, I confess, I could perfectly well understand. As I left that evening, one of your members said to me "I do hope you're right, Eddie, but we've heard it all before. We'll believe it when we see it!" I suspect he spoke for most of the rest of you. Well, tonight I can tell you that inflation - on the Government's target measure - has averaged just 2.5% over the past 10 years. We have now had 42 consecutive quarters of positive economic growth - which is much the longest period of continuous growth since quarterly data became available in 1955. And unemployment has continued to decline fairly steadily to just over 3% - its lowest rate for more than a quarter of a century. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not for a moment suggesting that we have finally reached the promised land. I'm very well aware that there are many people in this country - no doubt including many here tonight - for whom economic life is still pretty tough. My post bag never let's me forget that! For most of the time since I last spoke to you we have in particular been confronted with a very difficult international economic and financial environment. This began with the Asia crisis. But it was followed a couple of years later by a sharp economic slowdown, into mild recession, in the major industrial countries. And that was accompanied by a sustained fall in global equity markets from their "irrationally exuberant" peaks - aggravated and protracted by the threat of terrorism following 9/11 and by corporate governance and accounting failures in the United States. Most recently, of course, uncertainty surrounding the possibility of war with Iraq has weighed heavily on sentiment. All of this, together with the persistent weakness - until relatively recently - of the euro exchange rate, has made conditions intensely difficult for internationally-exposed business in the UK, including much of the manufacturing sector; and that, in turn, has been reflected not just in weak net external demand but also in declining business investment in this country and elsewhere in the industrial world. 
 2 BIS Review 16/2003 It's made life pretty difficult, too, I have to say for those of us involved in macro-economic management! Macro-economic policy - that's to say monetary policy and overall fiscal policy taken together - operates, directly, on the demand side of the economy, aiming essentially to keep aggregate - external and domestic - demand growing broadly in line with the underlying supply-side capacity of the economy to meet that demand. Stable, low, inflation is in fact essentially a measure of how far we are successful in that. There has been very little, quite frankly, that either we at the Bank, through monetary policy, or the Chancellor could do to influence the international environment. The problems originated abroad and we could not avoid their effects. What we could do - and what we have tried to do - was to seek to offset those effects, and compensate for the external weakness, by stimulating domestic demand here in the UK. Given weak business confidence, that meant essentially, in the case of monetary policy, encouraging the growth of consumer demand - by cutting interest rates to their lowest level in 40 years. In the event we managed - just about - to avoid recession over the winter of 2001/2002 but we did so but at the cost of growing imbalances within the economy between domestic and external demand on the one hand and, domestically, between consumption and investment on the other. Essentially we took the view that unbalanced growth was better than no growth at all - which was the only other option we had. This "two speed" economy has, I know, been reflected in the pattern of your own activity as FLA members, with consumer finance volumes growing strongly in recent years where business volumes have been relatively flat. In the past year alone new business written to consumers was nearly three times that written to business customers. Now clearly the imbalances can't go on increasingly indefinitely. The build-up of household debt and the related strong rise in house prices we saw last year in particular must begin to moderate at some point. So much of the recent debate has been about whether the eventual adjustment will occur gradually, within the context of continuing overall expansion, or more abruptly in which case the overall expansion could prove more difficult to sustain. On the macro-economic data it seems clear that the global economy in fact bottomed out around a year or so ago, and that we have since seen the beginnings of a recovery, notably in the US, on which so much of the rest of the world currently depends. And it is also clear that monetary policy generally - and in some countries also fiscal policy - remains supportive. On that view, and given the recent moderate decline in sterling's effective exchange rate, it is reasonable to look forward to a gradual improvement - and I emphasise gradual improvement - in the external environment which would clearly be very helpful from a UK perspective. I don't deny that there are downside risks to this scenario. The Eurozone has for example recently put back its projected expansion until later this year. And financial markets, and both business and consumer sentiment, have recently been severely affected by uncertainty over Iraq - though financial markets, certainly, now that the war has started, have factored in its rapid conclusion. I hope they prove to be right - for more than purely economic reasons. Notwithstanding these risks, I still think that the most likely outcome is that we will see a gradual pick-up in the pace of global recovery over the next year or two - which is the view shared by the Monetary Policy Committee in our February Inflation Report and by most other economic commentators. On that basis we would also expect to see a gradual recovery in domestic business investment as we go through this year and into next. And, while fiscal prudence is clearly important for the stability and efficiency of the economy over the medium term, the Chancellor's projected increase in public spending is in my view positively welcome in the immediate situation confronting us. Taken together, these developments should accommodate the moderation in the rate of growth of consumer spending, which we anticipate and may now be beginning to see. In the meantime we have seen a rise in the rate of inflation - to 3% on the target measure - driven notably by last year's sharp rise in house prices and by the rise in the oil price in the run up to the invasion of Iraq. And it may well rise somewhat further, for example, as a result of the prospective rise in Council Tax and the somewhat weaker exchange rate. But most of these influences at this stage seem likely to be largely one-off effects on the level of retail prices, rather than persistent influences on the rate of inflation. There is no significant evidence at this point of continuing, second-round, effects, 
 BIS Review 16/2003 3 for example in the labour market, so that inflation seems likely to fall back to the 2½% target rate in the course of next year. On this basis - and although the MPC will of course be monitoring the inflation prospect very carefully - we concluded at our most recent meeting that policy should remain on hold.  Mr Chairman, you can see that I meant it when I said earlier that we haven't yet reached the promised land! We have in fact been going through a difficult patch, and we remain heavily dependent upon developments abroad which are beyond our control. Certainly we face risks and uncertainties in the short term. But it is important that we don't exaggerate those risks and allow them to cloud our judgement. The more likely outcome in my view - looking ahead over the next couple of years - and reflected in the Inflation Report - is for inflation close to target with growth close to trend - and with the imbalances within the economy beginning to adjust. In any event I am totally confident that Mervyn King, my successor from July, with his Deputies, Andrew Large and Rachel Lomax, and with the MPC, will be ready to adjust policy in either direction as the prospect changes, and that they will be as totally committed as I have been to maintaining stability and hitting the Government's inflation target, as a necessary condition for sustainable growth. That will provide the best possible context for the continued development of your business, and the important contribution that you make to the economy. I, myself, of course, will be looking for a new lease of life in retirement! I'm not aware that it's a lease product any of you actually provide. Given our ageing population perhaps you should develop one - though you'd better be careful how you market it! In any event I wish you well. 
 BIS Review 15/2003 1 William L Rutledge: Implementing the New Basel Accord Speech by Mr William L Rutledge, Executive Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at The British Banker’s Association Basel 2 / CAD 3 Half Day Conference, London, UK, 13 March 2003. *      *      * Introduction Thank you and good morning. It is a great pleasure for me to be here today to offer some thoughts on Basel implementation issues - thoughts that will reflect partly my role as the head of Bank Supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and partly my role as a member of the Basel Committee.  In that latter capacity, I’d like to begin by offering my thanks for all of the extremely helpful and constructive comments that the BBA has provided throughout the Basel consultative process. In my experience, having a candid dialogue between the industry and the supervisory community is the best way to develop well informed regulatory policy. Given our desire for Basel II to be consistent with the best existing and emerging risk measurement and management practices, getting specific feedback from the industry is particularly critical. It is also critical that we understand calibration issues so that we set appropriate numerical standards; in that connection, I’d like to offer my further thanks to all of the banks represented here that participated in the latest Quantitative Impact Survey. I know that gathering all the necessary data and providing it in the prescribed format was a daunting task. Just know that our task - analyzing the results of the exercise with data from nearly 50 countries and over 250 institutions - is quite a challenge as well. I expect that Patricia Jackson of the Bank of England, who has led that effort, will comment on the QIS results later on today. In his remarks, Sir Andrew shared some observations on the objectives of the New Basel Accord. My focus will be on how we expect to achieve some of those goals, through addressing various challenges that lie ahead to implementing the New Accord. First, I will offer some broad observations on implementation issues, including some thoughts on the challenges of applying it across jurisdictions. Then, I will get into more specific detail on the preparations banks and supervisors are making to implement the new framework. I will be drawing on the United States’ experience to highlight the kinds of preparations that will be needed generally.  Implementation of the New Accord Overview As you know, the Basel Committee is quite close to finalizing the new capital framework after a number of years of work. Issuance of the next consultative paper will be a tremendously important step in getting a new approach in place. But as that step is taken, other critical actions must then occur - in particular rulemaking processes, and preparations by the supervisors and the industry for the New Accord.  With respect to the former, in each country or set of countries, processes to establish specific rules must occur to ensure that more local issues are addressed in an appropriate manner. In the United States, as in the EU, that process will be a very formal one.  While the national rulemaking is going on, banks and supervisors around the world will also need to think through the practical implications surrounding implementation. To be sure, implementation of the New Accord will require a substantial resource commitment on the part of both banks and supervisors.  However, I think it is important to emphasize that the efforts banks will need to undertake to comply with Basel II build, to a very significant extent, on the good work that many large and well-managed banks already have in train to improve their own risk management and measurement approaches. For example, many banks have for some time been devoting increased attention to the tracking of loan performance, and to the more sophisticated assessment of their loan quality. Further, banks have been analyzing their managerial processes - making sure they have the right system of checks and balances, with appropriate use of independent experts who would not gain from overly favorable assessments. Time and effort has also been invested in developing richer and more meaningful data on past, and likely future, credit performance - data that are needed to fuel management information 
 2 BIS Review 15/2003 and control systems for senior management use. I expect that much of the cost to banks of adopting the advanced approaches of Basel II will come from pushing ahead on precisely these types of initiatives. This is not to minimize the costs involved in coming into full Basel compliance, but rather to emphasize the extent to which bank risk management and supervisory capital requirements share common objectives in pursuit of the benefits that Sir Andrew described. Those benefits - both to individual banks and to the financial services sector more generally - are real and valuable. We know all too well the costs to society of bank weakness and failures. As the largest banks continue to grow, to prosper and to pursue new opportunities, they must simultaneously make the investments required to understand and manage their existing risks more fully, and to address any new risks appropriately.  Likewise, the new framework is providing supervisors with both opportunities and incentives to enhance their ability to identify and respond to risk in the banks they supervise. I will discuss the challenges for individual supervisors in a moment, but let me offer a few thoughts now on the challenges for supervisors to collaborate more effectively with one another. More effective collaboration was of course a key reason for the establishment of the Basel Committee. The Committee provides an excellent forum for open and constructive dialogue among banking supervisors. This spirit of communication will be more crucial than ever as the new framework is adopted across national jurisdictions.  It is clearly very important that the New Accord be implemented in a consistent manner across various jurisdictions. Market competition should be driven by each bank’s strengths, rather than by differences in each country’s rules. Accordingly, the Basel Committee established the Accord Implementation Group. As you know, this group is responsible for promoting the consistency and quality of implementation of the New Accord and facilitating the exchange of information among national supervisors about bank and supervisory practices. Through the implementation group senior line supervisors are beginning to share among themselves very practical insights on how to assess internal risk management processes. We think that this detailed sharing of information among people who are on the front lines of supervision will go a long way to ensuring that assessments can be done in a more consistent fashion across jurisdictions.  We appreciate the very strong endorsement that both the BBA and LIBA have offered in welcoming the formation of the Accord Implementation Group. Indeed, we know that both associations are keenly interested in how the group may well help ensure that a single banking organization active in many jurisdictions not face divergent sets of expectations from different banking supervisors under the New Accord. I am pleased to note that the Accord Implementation Group has taken up this concern among its first topics for discussion. An important goal of the coordination and information sharing is to help ensure that national supervisors, in assessing the eligibility of an internationally active bank’s internal rating system, do not arrive at different conclusions. Preparing for the New Accord Let me get into more detail now on what both banks and supervisors will need to do to prepare for the Accord, by describing what we are doing in the United States. I am sure our experience will have parallels in the UK and elsewhere. Challenges for banks To begin with, we have looked to get our arms around where the major firms actually stand in preparing for Basel II, and to pinpoint the major challenges that lie ahead for them as they look towards implementing the advanced approaches to credit and operational risk.  Importantly, our dialogue with the banks has focused on where they stand in meeting the minimum standards for entry to, and on-going use of, the IRB approach. Our strong sense is that banks have both the desire and the commitment to continue to develop their internal ratings systems in a manner consistent with the requirements of the IRB framework. The discussions with the industry have, however, highlighted various areas where banks may need to expand their efforts in preparing for implementation. I will offer comments on four areas where more work is needed:  a. the design and structure of rating systems;  b. the necessary controls to ensure that ratings are accurate and up to date;  
 BIS Review 15/2003 3 c. the availability and quality of credit data; and, finally  d. the overall corporate governance approach  a. Rating system design The first area concerns the design of a risk rating system, which is, of course, central to ensuring the effectiveness of the IRB approach. The Basel Committee believes that banks’ internal rating systems should accurately and consistently differentiate between degrees of risk. The minimum IRB standards in this area build on the strongest risk management practices observed in the industry. To illustrate the point, many organizations either already have, or are in the process of developing a ratings system that captures both the risk of borrower default, as well as transaction-specific factors that shed light on the amount of loss that would arise if default occurs. In other words, these banks’ systems are now oriented to capturing the several essential components in estimating credit risk under the IRB approach. Credit risk rating systems are clearly improving in various dimensions, including how finely they seek to distinguish differing degrees of borrower risk. To do so, banks typically look to expand the number of ratings categories into which they slot their exposures. However, just establishing more rating categories is not enough. The challenge is for banks to define clearly and objectively the criteria for these ratings categories in order to provide more meaningful assessments of both individual credit exposures and, ultimately, their overall risk profile. The clarity and transparency of the ratings criteria will be critical to ensuring that ratings are assigned in a disciplined and reliable manner. b. Controls over the rating system Of course, a ratings system is useless without the necessary system of checks and balances, or control structure, which is the second area I will discuss as needing banks’ attention. Banks must have the proper controls in place to ensure that the rating system is performing as intended, and that its ratings are accurate - that is, that a "5" rating really is a "5" and that a "7" really is a "7." There are at least three major structural elements that are necessary in any good ratings system control structure: • The first is independence in the process of assigning ratings; the people assigning ratings (and even approving loans) should be independent of the marketing department and revenue producers.  • A second check is having a subsequent review of ratings by an independent review group. This group is charged with reviewing ratings after the fact - that is, after origination - for accuracy, timeliness and consistency. Moreover, both the ratings system and individual ratings should be subject to review by the internal audit department.  • A third and final critical element is transparency in the ratings process. Here, what we would expect is that the ratings criteria are objective, and that the bank has in place policies and procedures that clearly document the rationale for each ratings category. The more transparent the process is, the easier it is for a third party to audit the ratings through some form of replication of the analysis.  These three elements - independence of the ratings process, internal review of those ratings, and transparency - all contribute toward stronger controls over the ratings process. Such controls over the risk ratings process must be complemented by the collection of good data on which to base those ratings, which is the third area of focus for banks. c. Data requirements and validation Clearly, a system is only as good as the inputs that go into it. Accordingly, banks using the IRB approach will need to be able to measure the key statistical drivers of credit risk. I would emphasize that the Basel Committee clearly recognizes that there is more than one way to accomplish this purpose. The minimum Basel standards provide banks with the flexibility to rely on data derived from experience, or from external sources, as long as the bank can demonstrate the relevance of the external data to its own exposures. Regardless of source, high quality data are critical for formulating meaningful internal risk assessments. From a broader risk management perspective, access to such 
 4 BIS Review 15/2003 data will enable a bank to evaluate the performance of its internal rating and risk estimation systems in a consistent and meaningful manner.  The Basel standards outline the data history banks will need in order to use the IRB approach. The Committee recognizes that banks may not currently have all of the required information on hand. For this reason we have continued to engage market participants in a dialogue on this issue. As implementation of the New Accord approaches, we encourage banks to consider their data needs very seriously and to comprehend fully the techniques they will need to use to derive appropriate estimates of loss based on those data. In practical terms, banks will be expected to have in place - or be actively developing - a data "warehouse". By data warehouse, I mean a process that enables a bank to collect, to store, and to draw upon loss statistics in an efficient manner over time. d. Corporate governance The design, controls, and data that figure into a risk rating system must all be developed within the framework of good overall corporate governance, which is the fourth area of focus for banks that I’ll mention today. The involvement of senior management and directors will be critical to the successful implementation of the New Accord. This will be particularly true for those banks seeking to adopt the more advanced approaches to calculating regulatory capital.  As a bank’s capital requirements draw increasingly on firm-specific performance and systems, there will be a need for its board of directors and senior management to gain a deeper understanding of the conceptual underpinnings, and even operational mechanics, of a bank’s internal rating systems and the measures of risk derived from them.  Senior management, and, to a significant extent, the board of directors, will have to have a good understanding of various key elements of the organization’s ratings process - the design of the rating system, the methods of assigning and reviewing ratings, the process of developing and using the necessary data, the approach to developing reliable quantitative estimates, and ultimately the consistency of the system with Basel standards. Understanding these various elements will be important in assessing the appropriateness and reliability of the measures of credit risk that are developed - measures that are in turn needed for senior management and the board to make more informed strategic decisions.  Operational risk is another area where the Basel Committee has developed a new regulatory capital approach. In this area, as with credit risk, the Committee not only attempts to build on banks’ rapidly developing internal assessment techniques, but seeks to provide incentives for banks to improve those techniques, and more broadly, their management of risk, over time. This is particularly true of the Advanced Measurement Approaches to Operational Risk, or AMA.  Under the AMA, banks would be able to use their internal methodologies to assess their exposure to operational risk - subject to a series of qualitative and quantitative supervisory parameters that are intended to ensure that the approach used is comprehensive and that it is implemented with integrity. Moreover, the AMA is intended to be sufficiently flexible so as to accommodate the rapid evolution in operational risk management practices we expect to see over the coming years.  The primary criteria of the AMA could be summarized as falling into three broad areas: first, the development of strong corporate operational risk governance and management structures - structures that include business line integration into a firm-wide process; second, the incorporation of qualitative factors such as control self-assessments into the overall capital measurement process; and finally, loss data quantification, which includes scenario analysis. Our review of those major U.S. banks that intend to adopt the AMA indicates they are clearly in various stages of preparation. However, most of these institutions already have in place, or are well along towards establishing, a corporate level operational risk management function, with firm-wide policies for managing and assessing this risk. Moreover, many firms already have in place good, and improving, firm-wide control self-assessment methodologies. Finally, an increasing number of banks are now turning their attention to collecting internal loss data in a consistent manner across the firm. Some have already been collecting such data for a year or two and some have been particularly effective at mining their existing historical loss experience for certain risk types.  A few leading institutions have made real progress in pulling all this together - by piloting operational risk quantification methodologies that combine the quantitative and qualitative elements of the AMA into an overall economic capital assessment for operational risk.  
 BIS Review 15/2003 5 While there is much work still to be done at many institutions, those banks that have obtained senior management buy-in to embark on this approach have been able to move ahead fairly rapidly. In addition, these institutions have found significant value in the process of rolling out such a framework. The benefits include greater risk transparency within the firm, greater cost efficiency, and ultimately, less exposure to large losses, both in terms of dollars and additional reputational knock-on effects.  Challenges for supervisors I've focused on the challenges banks will confront in implementing the new Accord. Let me now spend a few moments discussing how our supervisory approach is also likely to evolve over time. Naturally, allowing banks to rely on internal models in determining their capital requirements has led, and will continue to lead, to changes in our supervisory process. Fortunately, we do have some experience on which to draw.  In 1996, under the "market risk amendment" to the original Basel Accord, qualifying banks with large market risk positions were first permitted to incorporate internal estimates of the associated risk in their regulatory capital requirements. When determining whether a bank may rely on its market risk model for capital purposes, our examiners have had to evaluate the technical underpinnings of the model, as well as the risk management and control processes surrounding its implementation and use. They review such issues as whether the model is based on reasonable assumptions, whether the firm is making appropriate use of backtesting, and how the model performs under normal and stressed market conditions. In addition, they are spending significant time on key controls related to the overall use of models, including the model validation process and the new product approval process.  Likewise, as banks rely increasingly on their own assessments of credit and operational risk when determining their capital needs, our examiners will have to become well-versed in the changing technical aspects of those models. Some of the conventional, static metrics that we now use - for example, on the credit risk side, those to judge asset quality and to assess the adequacy of credit loss reserves - are likely to be supplanted by more sophisticated quantitative measures.  As is the case with credit risk, we are in the process of developing a more integrated framework for assessing the adequacy of banks’ operational risk management and measurement approaches. We are focusing heavily on how banks are managing operational risk from a corporate-wide perspective. We begin by developing a feeling for the "tone at the top" - that is, the board of directors’ and senior management’s commitment to effectively manage its operational risk. Then we assess whether that commitment translates into an effective operational risk management and control structure - including the quality of management reporting, and the degree of integration of operational risk into a bank’s overall risk management approach.  Our analysis includes banks’ assessments of their economic capital requirements for operational risk, and how this capital is allocated to business lines to reinforce efforts to improve internal controls. With respect to those specific business lines, we are increasingly looking to drill down to test key controls. The aim is to ensure that the internal processes in place are in fact working and are effective in mitigating relevant risks. Without question, it will be important to devote the necessary supervisory resources - in terms of skilled personnel, technical training, and a targeted strategy - to these new supervisory efforts. In this regard, the Basel Committee anticipates providing much assistance, both formally and informally, to supervisory agencies around the world that are preparing for the added responsibilities we will all assume as the New Accord comes into force.  Moreover, I am pleased to note that the Financial Stability Institute (or FSI) will continue its collaboration with the Basel Committee, especially in assisting supervisors globally in understanding and implementing all aspects of the revised Accord. The FSI anticipates that more than half of its 50 seminars and programs this year will concentrate on components of Basel II. In fact, shortly after the release of the final consultative package later this spring, the FSI intends to offer three special seminars around the world to introduce other supervisors to the most important features of the new framework. 
 6 BIS Review 15/2003 Next Steps in finalizing the New Accord Most of my remarks today have been centered on implementation of the new framework. I’d like to conclude by spending a few moments discussing where we are in the process to finalize the New Accord.  As I mentioned, the Committee has just finished gathering data from the industry through its third impact study. The aim of the study was to collect and to analyze information from banks worldwide regarding the capital impact of the new proposals on their existing portfolios. The results are under review and will help us to determine whether any adjustments will be needed prior to release of the final consultative package. That final consultative paper will be issued by early May. Our goal continues to be to have a final Accord agreed to by the fourth quarter of this year. In closing, I want to emphasize that effective supervision of modern banking organizations will necessarily entail a closer and more cooperative partnership between industry participants and official supervisors. The industry’s participation in the formulation of a more risk-sensitive capital adequacy framework is a good example of this kind of constructive interaction. Indeed, the three pillars of the proposed framework reflect the understanding that regulatory requirements alone are no longer sufficient to address the growing complexity of banks’ activities and the associated risks. Consistent with this notion is the need for effective corporate governance, which plays an increasingly important role in a rapidly evolving banking environment. It is clear to me that only if the industry and supervisors work together - each meeting our responsibilities and reinforcing the other - will we be able to successfully manage and supervise a modern financial system. While perspectives may differ from time to time, our objective is the same - to maintain a strong and vibrant financial system over the long term. Thank you very much. 
 BIS Review 15/2003 1 Ben S Bernanke: A perspective on inflation targeting Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Annual Washington Policy Conference of the National Association of Business Economists, Washington, DC, 25 March 2003.The references for the speech can be found on the website of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System. *      *      * One of the more interesting developments in central banking in the past dozen years or so has been the increasingly widespread adoption of the monetary policy framework known as inflation targeting. The approach evolved gradually from earlier monetary policy strategies that followed the demise of the Bretton Woods fixed-exchange-rate system--most directly, I believe, from the practices of Germany's Bundesbank and the Swiss National Bank during the latter part of the 1970s and the 1980s. For example, the Bundesbank, though it conducted short-term policy with reference to targets for money supply growth, derived those targets each year by calculating the rate of money growth estimated to be consistent with the bank's long-run desired rate of inflation, normally 2 percent per year. Hence, the Bundesbank indirectly targeted inflation, using money growth as a quantitative indicator to aid in the calibration of its policy. Notably, the evidence suggests that, when conflicts arose between its money growth targets and inflation targets, the Bundesbank generally chose to give greater weight to its inflation targets (Bernanke and Mihov, 1997).1  The inflation-targeting approach became more explicit with the strategies adopted in the early 1990s by a number of pioneering central banks, among them the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, Sweden's Riksbank, and the Reserve Bank of Australia. Over the past decade, variants of inflation targeting have proliferated, with newly industrialized and emerging-market economies (Brazil, Chile, Israel, Korea, Mexico, South Africa, the Philippines, and Thailand, among others) being among the most enthusiastic initiates. Most recently, this policy framework has also been adopted by several transition economies, notably the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland.2 Central banks that have switched to inflation targeting have generally been pleased with the results they have obtained. The strongest evidence on that score is that, thus far at least, none of the several dozen adopters of inflation targeting has abandoned the approach.3  As an academic interested in monetary policy, several years ago I became intrigued by inflation targeting and went on to co-author a book and several other pieces about this approach.4 As I continue to follow developments in the area, I must say, however, that discussions of inflation targeting in the American media remind me of the way some Americans deal with the metric system--they don't really know what it is, but they think of it as foreign, impenetrable, and possibly slightly subversive. So, in the hope of cutting through some of the fog, today I will offer my own, perhaps somewhat idiosyncratic, view of inflation targeting and its potential benefits, at least in what I consider to be its best-practice form.5 I will also try to dispel what I feel are a few misconceptions about inflation targeting that have gained some currency. Finally, I will end with a few words, and one modest suggestion, about the implications of the experience with inflation targeting for the practice of monetary policymaking at the Federal Reserve.6 My main objective today, however, is to clarify, not to                                                       1  The interpretation of the Bundesbank as a proto-inflation targeter is not universally accepted. Certainly, the Bundesbank did not put the same emphasis on communication and transparency that modern inflation-targeting central banks do. 2  Mishkin and Jonas (forthcoming) describe the experiences of the three transition economies with inflation targets. 3  A few countries that used inflation targeting in the transition to European monetary union are a partial exception. The European Central Bank itself has an inflation objective (a ceiling of 2 percent) but does not refer to itself as an inflation-targeting central bank, largely on the grounds that (officially, at least) it also puts some weight on money growth in its policy decisions. As a newly created central bank presiding over a monetary union, the ECB is unique in more fundamental ways as well; hence, the lessons from the ECB experience for the Federal Reserve and other established central banks may be somewhat limited. 4  See in particular Bernanke and Mishkin (1997) and Bernanke, Laubach, Mishkin, and Posen (1999). 5  By focusing on what I call “best practice” inflation targeting, I must necessarily be somewhat subjective; but then my goal today is largely normative, not descriptive. 6  For a more detailed exposition of the case for inflation targeting in the United States, see Goodfriend (forthcoming). 
 2 BIS Review 15/2003 advocate. Of course, my comments today reflect my own views and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board or on the Federal Open Market Committee.  Best-Practice Inflation Targeting: One View Although inflation targeting has a number of distinguishing features--the announcement of a quantitative target for inflation being the most obvious--capturing the essence of the approach is not entirely straightforward. The central banks that call themselves inflation targeters, as well as the economies they represent, are a diverse group indeed, and (not surprisingly) institutional and operational features differ. Moreover, many central banks that have not formally adopted the framework of inflation targeting have clearly been influenced by the approach (or, if you prefer, the same ideas and trends have influenced both inflation-targeters and non-inflation-targeters). For example, over the past twenty years, the Federal Reserve, though rejecting the inflation-targeting label, has greatly increased its credibility for maintaining low and stable inflation, has become more proactive in heading off inflationary pressures, and has worked hard to improve the transparency of its policymaking process--all hallmarks of the inflation-targeting approach. In short, to draw a bright line between central banks practicing full-fledged inflation targeting and those firmly outside the inflation-targeting camp is more difficult than one might first guess--a fact, by the way, that substantially complicates economists' attempts to assess empirically the effects of this approach.  Nevertheless, for expository purposes, I find it useful to break down the inflation targeting approach into two components: (1) a particular framework for making policy choices, and (2) a strategy for communicating the context and rationale of these policy choices to the broader public. Let's call these two components of inflation targeting the policy framework and the communications strategy, for short.  The policy framework of inflation targeting By the policy framework I mean the principles by which the policy committee decides how to set its policy instrument, typically a short-term interest rate. In an earlier speech, I referred to the policy framework that describes what I consider to be best-practice inflation targeting as constrained discretion.7 Constrained discretion attempts to strike a balance between the inflexibility of strict policy rules and the potential lack of discipline and structure inherent in unfettered policymaker discretion. Under constrained discretion, the central bank is free to do its best to stabilize output and employment in the face of short-run disturbances, with the appropriate caution born of our imperfect knowledge of the economy and of the effects of policy (this is the "discretion" part of constrained discretion). However, a crucial proviso is that, in conducting stabilization policy, the central bank must also maintain a strong commitment to keeping inflation--and, hence, public expectations of inflation--firmly under control (the "constrained" part of constrained discretion). Because monetary policy influences inflation with a lag, keeping inflation under control may require the central bank to anticipate future movements in inflation and move preemptively. Hence constrained discretion is an inherently forward-looking policy approach.  Although constrained discretion acknowledges the crucial role that monetary policy plays in stabilizing the real economy, this policy framework does place heavy weight on the proposition that maintenance of low and stable inflation is a key element--perhaps I should say the key element--of successful monetary policy. The rationale for this emphasis goes well beyond the direct benefits of price stability for economic efficiency and growth, important as these are. The maintenance of price stability--and equally important, the development by the central bank of a strong reputation for and commitment to it--also serves to anchor the private sector's expectations of future inflation. Well-anchored inflation expectations (by which I mean that the public continues to expect low and stable inflation even if actual inflation temporarily deviates from its expected level) not only make price stability much easier to achieve in the long term but also increase the central bank's ability to stabilize output and employment in the short run. Short-run stabilization of output and employment is more effective when inflation expectations are well anchored because the central bank need not worry that, for example, a policy easing will lead counterproductively to rising inflation and inflation expectations rather than to stronger real activity.                                                        7  Bernanke (2003). 
 BIS Review 15/2003 3 In my earlier speech, I gave the Great Inflation of the 1970s in the United States as an example of what can happen when inflation expectations are not well anchored. Contrary to the belief in a long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment held by many economists in the 1960s, unemployment and inflation in the 1970s were both high and unstable. Even today conventional wisdom ascribes this unexpected outcome to the oil price shocks of the 1970s. Though increases in oil prices were certainly adverse factors, poor monetary policies in the second half of the 1960s and in the 1970s both facilitated the rise in oil prices themselves and substantially exacerbated their effects on the economy.  Monetary policy contributed to the oil price increases in the first place by creating an inflationary environment in which excess nominal demand existed for a wide range of goods and services. For example, in an important paper, Barsky and Kilian (2001) noted that the prices of many industrial commodities and raw materials rose in the 1970s about the same time as oil prices, reflecting broad-based inflationary pressures. Without these general inflationary pressures, it is unlikely that the oil producers would have been able to make the large increases in oil prices "stick" for any length of time.  Besides helping to make the oil price increases possible, the legacy of poor monetary policies also exacerbated the effects of the oil price increases on output and employment. When the oil price shocks hit, beginning in 1973, inflation expectations had already become very unstable, after several years of increased inflationary pressures and a failed program of price controls under President Nixon. Because inflation expectations were no longer anchored, the widely publicized oil price increases were rapidly transmitted into expectations of higher general inflation and, hence, into higher wage demands and other cost pressures. Faced with an unprecedented inflationary surge, the Fed was forced to tighten policy. As it turned out, the Fed's tightening was not enough to contain the inflationary surge but was sufficient to generate a severe recession.  The upshot is that the deep 1973-75 recession was caused only in part by increases in oil prices per se. An equally important source of the recession was several years of overexpansionary monetary policy that squandered the Fed's credibility regarding inflation, with the ultimate result that the economic impact of the oil producers' actions was significantly larger than it had to be. Instability in both prices and the real economy continued for the rest of the decade, until the Fed under Chairman Paul Volcker re-established the Fed's credibility with the painful disinflationary episode of 1980-82. This latter episode and its enormous costs should also be chalked up to the failure to keep inflation and inflation expectations low and stable.  In contrast to the 1970s, fluctuations in oil prices have had far smaller effects on both inflation and output in the United States and other industrialized countries since the early 1980s. In part this more moderate effect reflects increased energy efficiency and other structural changes, but I believe the dominant reason is that the use of constrained discretion in the making of monetary policy has led to better anchoring of inflation expectations in the great majority of industrial countries. Because inflation expectations are now more firmly tied down, surges and declines in energy prices do not significantly affect core inflation and thus do not force a policy response to inflation to the extent they did three decades ago. Indeed, rather than leading to a tightening of monetary policy, increases in oil prices today are more likely to promote consideration of increased policy ease--a direct and important benefit of the improved control of inflation.  The communications strategy of inflation targeting The second major element of best-practice inflation targeting (in my view) is the communications strategy, the central bank's regular procedures for communicating with the political authorities, the financial markets, and the general public. In general, a central bank's communications strategy, closely linked to the idea of transparency, has many aspects and many motivations.8 Aspects of communication that have been particularly emphasized by inflation-targeting central banks are the public announcement of policy objectives (notably, the objective for inflation), open discussion of the bank's policy framework (including in some cases, but not all, a timeframe for achieving the inflation                                                       8  In some countries, improved transparency has accompanied greater central bank independence, on the argument that more independent central banks must also provide enhanced accountability. 
 4 BIS Review 15/2003 objective), and public release of the central bank's forecast or evaluation of the economy (as reported, for example, in the Inflation Reports issued by a number of inflation-targeting central banks).9  Why have inflation-targeting central banks emphasized communication, particularly the communication of policy objectives, policy framework, and economic forecasts? In the 1960s, many economists were greatly interested in adapting sophisticated mathematical techniques developed by engineers for controlling missiles and rockets to the problem of controlling the economy. At the time, this adaptation of so-called stochastic optimal control methods to economic policymaking seemed natural; for like a ballistic missile, an economy may be viewed as a complicated dynamic system that must be kept on course, despite continuous buffeting by unpredictable forces.  Unfortunately, macroeconomic policy turned out not to be rocket science! The problem lay in a crucial difference between a missile and an economy--which is that, unlike the people who make up an economy, the components of a missile do not try to understand and anticipate the forces being applied to them. Hence, although a given propulsive force always has the same, predictable effect on a ballistic missile, a given policy action--say, a 25-basis-point cut in the federal funds rate--can have very different effects on the economy, depending (for example) on what the private sector infers from that action about likely future policy actions, about the information that may have induced the policymaker to act, about the policymaker's objectives in taking the action, and so on. Thus, taking the "right" policy action--in this case, changing the federal funds rate by the right amount at the right time--is a necessary but not sufficient condition for getting the desired economic response. Most inflation-targeting central banks have found that effective communication policies are a useful way, in effect, to make the private sector a partner in the policymaking process. To the extent that it can explain its general approach, clarify its plans and objectives, and provide its assessment of the likely evolution of the economy, the central bank should be able to reduce uncertainty, focus and stabilize private-sector expectations, and--with intelligence, luck, and persistence--develop public support for its approach to policymaking.  Of course, as has often been pointed out, actions speak louder than words; and declarations by the central bank will have modest and diminishing value if they are not clear, coherent, and--most important--credible, in the sense of being consistently backed up by action. But agreeing that words must be consistently backed by actions is not the same as saying that words have no value. In the extreme, I suppose a central bank could run a "Marcel Marceau" monetary policy, allowing its actions to convey all its intended meaning. But common sense suggests that the best option is to combine actions with words--to take clear, purposeful, and appropriately timed policy actions that are supported by coherent explanation and helpful guidance about the future.  One objection that has been raised to the public announcement of policy objectives, economic forecasts, and (implicit or explicit) policy plans by central banks is that even relatively modest commitments along these lines may limit their flexibility to choose the best policies in the future. Isn't it always better to be more rather than less flexible? Shouldn't the considered judgment of experienced policymakers always trump rules, even relatively flexible ones, for setting policy?  I agree that human judgment should always be the ultimate source of policy decisions and that no central bank should--or is even able to--commit irrevocably in advance to actions that may turn out to be highly undesirable. However, the intuition that more flexibility is always better than less flexibility is quite fallacious, a point understood long ago by Homer, who told of how Ulysses had himself tied to the mast so as not to fall victim to the songs of the Sirens. More recently, the notion that more flexibility is always preferable has been pretty well gutted by modern game theory (not to mention modern monetary economics), which has shown in many contexts that the ability to commit in advance often yields better outcomes.  For illustration of the potential benefits to policymakers of even modest self-imposed restrictions on flexibility, consider fiscal policy, which shares with monetary policy some of the same issues that arise when a group of shifting membership makes a series of policy decisions that have both short-run and long-run implications. In the short run, fiscal policymakers may have important and legitimate reasons                                                       9 I refer to these features as communication rather than as rules because they simply make public the elements of the policy framework, that is, constrained discretion. Even when the inflation target itself is set outside the central bank or by an outside agency with the cooperation of the central bank, for the most part inflation-targeting central banks themselves rather than outsiders (such as the legislature) are the principal enforcers of their own targets and procedures. “Self-enforced” inflation targets are the only case I will consider here. 
 BIS Review 15/2003 5 to depart from budget balance, sometimes even substantially--for example, to appropriate funds to deal with a national emergency or to provide a stimulus package to assist economic recovery. In the long run, however, maintaining public confidence requires that fiscal policy be conducted in such a way that the ratio of national debt to GDP remains stable at a moderate level. Arguably, public confidence, and hence the ability of policymakers to use fiscal instruments aggressively to address short-term concerns, is enhanced by whatever legislative rules, guidelines, or procedures exist that--however gently or firmly--tend to compel the policymakers to bring the budget back toward balance, and the debt-GDP ratio back toward stability, after the crisis has passed. True, spending caps, comprehensive budget resolutions, mandatory long-term deficit projections, and similar provisions, to the extent that they are effective, may reduce at least a bit the flexibility of fiscal policymakers. But if intentionally yielding a bit of flexibility increases public confidence in the long-run sustainability of the government's spending and tax plans, fiscal policymakers may find that adopting these rules actually enhances their ability to act effectively in the short run.  As with fiscal policy, public beliefs about how monetary policy will perform in the long run affect the effectiveness of monetary policy in the short run. Suppose, for example, that the central bank wants to stimulate a weak economy by cutting its policy interest rate. The effect on real activity will be strongest if the public is confident in the central bank's unshakable commitment to price stability, as that confidence will moderate any tendency of wages, prices, or long-term interest rates to rise today in anticipation of possible future inflationary pressures generated by the current easing of policy. Now the central bank's reputation and credibility may be entirely sufficient that no additional framework or guidelines are needed. Certainly, in general, the greater the inherited credibility of the central bank, the less restrictive need be the guidelines, targets, or the like that form the central bank's communication strategy. But credibility is not a permanent characteristic of a central bank; it must be continuously earned. Moreover, an explicit policy framework has broader advantages, including among others increased buy-in by politicians and the public, increased accountability, reduced uncertainty, and greater intellectual clarity. Hence, though a central bank with strong credibility may wish to adopt a relatively loose and indicative set of guidelines for communication with the public, even such a bank may benefit from increasing its communication with the public and adding a bit of structure to its approach to making policy. From the public's perspective, the central bank's commitment to a policy framework, including a long-run inflation target, imposes the same kind of discipline and accountability on the central bank that a long-term commitment to fiscal stability places on the fiscal authorities.  Misconceptions about inflation targeting I would like to turn now, briefly, to comment on a few key misconceptions about inflation targeting that have gained some currency in the public debate.  Misconception #1: Inflation targeting involves mechanical, rule-like policymaking. As Rick Mishkin and I emphasized in our early expository article (Bernanke and Mishkin, 1997), inflation targeting is a policy framework, not a rule. If it is to be coherent and purposeful, all policy is made within some sort of conceptual framework; the question is the degree to which the framework is explicit. Inflation targeting provides one particular coherent framework for thinking about monetary policy choices which, importantly, lets the public in on the conversation. If this framework succeeds in its goals of anchoring inflation expectations, it may also make the policymaker's ultimate task easier. But making monetary policy under inflation targeting requires as much insight and judgment as under any policy framework; indeed, inflation targeting can be particularly demanding in that it requires policymakers to give careful, fact-based, and analytical explanations of their actions to the public.  Misconception #2: Inflation targeting focuses exclusively on control of inflation and ignores output and employment objectives. Several authors have made the distinction between so-called "strict" inflation targeting, in which the only objective of the central bank is price stability, and "flexible" inflation targeting, which allows attention to output and employment as well. In the early days of inflation targeting, this distinction may have been a useful one, as a number of inflation-targeting central banks talked the language of strict inflation targeting and one or two came close to actually practicing it. For quite a few years now, however, strict inflation targeting has been without significant practical relevance. In particular, I am not aware of any real-world central bank (the language of its mandate notwithstanding) that does not treat the stabilization of employment and output as an important policy 
 6 BIS Review 15/2003 objective. To use the wonderful phrase coined by Mervyn King, the Governor-designate of the inflation-targeting Bank of England, there are no "inflation nutters" heading major central banks.10 Moreover, virtually all (I am tempted to say "all") recent research on inflation targeting takes for granted that stabilization of output and employment is an important policy objective of the central bank. In short, in both theory and practice, today all inflation targeting is of the flexible variety.11  A second, more serious, issue is the relative weight, or ranking, of inflation and unemployment (or, more precisely, the output gap) among the central bank's objectives. Countries differ in this regard, both in formal mandate and in actual practice.12 As an extensive academic literature shows, however, the general approach of inflation targeting is fully consistent with any set of relative social weights on inflation and unemployment; the approach can be applied equally well by "inflation hawks," "growth hawks," and anyone in between. What I find particularly appealing about constrained discretion, which is the heart of the inflation-targeting approach, is the possibility of using it to get better results in terms of both inflation and employment. Personally, I subscribe unreservedly to the Humphrey-Hawkins dual mandate, and I would not be interested in the inflation-targeting approach if I didn't think it was the best available technology for achieving both sets of policy objectives.13  Misconception #3: Inflation targeting is inconsistent with the central bank's obligation to maintain financial stability. Let me address this point in the context of the United States. The most important single reason for the founding of the Federal Reserve was the desire of the Congress to increase the stability of American financial markets, and the Fed continues to regard ensuring financial stability as a critical responsibility. (By the way, this is a reason to be nervous about the recent trend of separating central banking and financial supervision; I hope we have the sense not to do that here.) I have always taken it to be a bedrock principle that when the stability or very functioning of financial markets is threatened, as during the October 1987 stock market crash or the September 11 terrorist attacks, that the Federal Reserve would take a leadership role in protecting the integrity of the system. I see no conflict between that role and inflation targeting (indeed, inflation targeting seems to require the preservation of financial stability as part of preserving macroeconomic stability), and I have never heard a proponent of inflation targeting argue otherwise.14 Inflation targeting and the Federal Reserve  As I noted earlier, the Federal Reserve, though rejecting any explicit affiliation with inflation targeting, has been influenced by many of the same ideas that have influenced self-described inflation targeters. Increasingly greater transparency and more forward-looking, proactive policy are two examples of convergence in practice between the Fed and inflation-targeting central banks, and I think most would agree that both of these developments have been positive and have led to better outcomes. Most important, however, as I discussed in the earlier speech, under Chairman Volcker and Chairman Greenspan, the Fed has moved gradually toward a policy framework of constrained discretion.15 In                                                       10 King (1997) appears to be the source of the phrase. 11  Svensson (1999), who I believe coined the phrase “strict inflation targeting”, calls this point “uncontroversial.” Svensson’s paper and his related work also show in detail the consistency of inflation targeting with a dual mandate. 12  A number of inflation-targeting central banks refer to inflation stabilization as the central bank’s “primary long-run objective.” At one level, this statement does not have much content because inflation is the only variable that central banks can control in the long run. Its real import is to say that the central bank is responsible for long-run price stability, a statement that should be unobjectionable in any framework. 13  Meyer (2001) draws a distinction between a hierarchical mandate, which subordinates other objectives to the price stability objective, and a dual mandate, which places price stability and employment objectives on equal footing. Like Meyer, I prefer the dual mandate formulation and find it to be fully consistent with inflation targeting. Formally, the dual mandate can be represented by a central bank loss function that includes both inflation and unemployment (or the output gap) symmetrically. 14 Here is part of a verbal reply that I made to a commenter on a paper about inflation targeting and asset prices that Mark Gertler and I presented at the Fed’s Jackson Hole conference in August 1999, as published in the conference volume: “I want to correct the impression . . . that Mark and I are somehow against lender-of-last-resort activities, which is absolutely wrong. I have studied the Depression quite a bit in my career, and I think there are two distinguishing mistakes that the Federal Reserve made. The first was to allow a serious deflation, which an inflation targeting regime would not have permitted. And the second was to allow the financial system to collapse, and I absolutely agree with, for example, what happened in October 1987 and other interventions . . . One advantage of the inflation targeting approach as opposed, for example, to a currency board, is [that] it gives you considerably more scope for lender-of-last-resort activities.” (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, 1999, p. 145) 15  Bernanke (2003). Gramlich (2000) made a similar observation and cited empirical evidence. 
 BIS Review 15/2003 7 particular, through two decades of effort the Fed has restored its credibility for maintaining low and stable inflation, which--as theory suggests--has had the important benefit of increasing the institution's ability to respond to shocks to the real economy. The acid test occurred in 2001, when the FOMC cut interest rates by nearly 500 basis points without any apparent adverse effect on inflation expectations.  Given the Fed's strong performance in recent years, would there be any gains in moving further down the road toward inflation targeting? The most heated debates are said to occur on questions that are inherently impossible to prove either way, and I am afraid that this question gives rise to one of those debates, involving as it does counterfactual futures. Personally, though, I believe that U.S. monetary policy would be better in the long run if the Fed chose to make its policy framework somewhat more explicit. First, the Fed is currently in a good and historically rare situation, having built a consensus both inside and outside the Fed for good policies. We would be smart to try to lock in this consensus a bit more by making our current procedures more explicit and less mysterious to the public. Second, making the Fed's inflation goals and its medium-term projections for the economy more explicit would reduce uncertainty and assist planning in financial markets and in the economy more generally. Finally, any additional anchoring of inflation expectations that we can achieve now will only be helpful in the future. To move substantially further in the direction of inflation targeting, should it choose to do so, the Fed would have to take two principal steps: first, to quantify (numerically, and in terms of a specific price index) what the Federal Open Market Committee means by "price stability", and second, to publish regular medium-term projections or forecasts of the economic outlook, analogous to the Inflation Reports published by both inflation-targeting central banks.  Particularly now that we are in the general range of price stability, I believe that quantifying what the FOMC means by price stability would provide useful information to the public and lend additional clarity to the policymaking process. Let me add a caveat however. Despite the potential long-run benefits of such a change, FOMC members may be concerned at this juncture that the Congress and the public would misperceive the quantification of price stability as an elevation of the Fed's price stability objective above its employment objective in violation of the dual mandate, even if that were in no way the intention. Although personally I have no doubt that quantification of the price stability objective is fully consistent with the current dual mandate, I also appreciate the delicate issues of communication raised by such a change. Realistically, this step is unlikely to occur without a good bit more public discussion. I hope that my talk today contributes to that discussion.16  The publication of medium-term forecasts does not raise nearly the same difficult political and communication issues that quantification of price stability may, in my view, and so I propose it here as a more feasible short-term step. The FOMC already releases (and has released since 1979) a range and a "central tendency" of its projections for nominal GDP growth, real GDP growth, PCE inflation, and the civilian unemployment rate twice each year, publishing them as part of the semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.17 These projections are actually quite interesting, as they represent the views of Fed policymakers of the future evolution of the economy, conditional on what each policymaker views as the best path for future policy. Two drawbacks of these projections as they now stand are that (1) they are sometimes not released for a number of weeks (the time between the FOMC meeting at which they are assembled and the Chairman's testimony to the Congress), and (2) the January projections cover only the remainder of the current year (the July projections cover the remainder of the current year and all of the subsequent year).  I think it would be very useful to detach these projections from the Monetary Policy Report and instead release them shortly after the meetings (in January and July) at which they are compiled. I would also suggest adding a second year of forecast to the January projection, to make it more parallel to the July projection as well as to the forecasts in the staff-prepared Greenbook. By releasing the projections in a more timely manner, and by adding a year to the January projection, the FOMC could provide quite                                                       16  In principle, the Federal Reserve could also publish its estimate of the long-run growth potential of the U.S. economy, for symmetry with its estimate of price stability. Unfortunately, potential output growth tends to be variable and difficult to measure with precision. A deeper asymmetry arises from the fact that, unlike the long-run rate of inflation, the Federal Reserve cannot control, and thus cannot be held responsible for, the long-run economic growth rate. 17 The Monetary Policy Report is required by the Congress under Section 2B of the Federal Reserve Act. The report is required to contain “a discussion of the conduct of monetary policy and economic developments and prospects for the future . . .” The projections may be interpreted as satisfying part of the requirement to provide the Federal Reserve’s view on prospects for the future. 
 8 BIS Review 15/2003 useful information to the public. In particular, the FOMC projections would convey the policymakers' sense of the medium-term evolution of the economy, providing insight into both the Fed's diagnosis of economic conditions and its policy objectives.18 Ideally, the release of these projections also would provide occasions for Governors and regional Bank Presidents, drawing on the expertise of their respective staffs, to convey their individual views on the prospects for the economy and the objectives of monetary policy.  Conclusion Inflation targeting, at least in its best-practice form, consists of two parts: a policy framework of constrained discretion and a communication strategy that attempts to focus expectations and explain the policy framework to the public. Together, these two elements promote both price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations; the latter in turn facilitates more effective stabilization of output and employment. Thus, a well-conceived and well-executed strategy of inflation targeting can deliver good results with respect to output and employment as well as inflation.  Although communication plays several important roles in inflation targeting, perhaps the most important is focusing and anchoring expectations. Clearly there are limits to what talk can achieve; ultimately, talk must be backed up by action, in the form of successful policies. Likewise, for a successful and credible central bank like the Federal Reserve, the immediate benefits of adopting a more explicit communication strategy may be modest. Nevertheless, making the investment now in greater transparency about the central bank's objectives, plans, and assessments of the economy could pay increasing dividends in the future.                                                       18  An alternative, suggested by Blinder et al. (2001), is to release a summary of the staff-prepared forecasts (the “Greenbook” forecasts). I think that option is worth considering but prefer focusing on the FOMC projections for now. The projections of the FOMC members draw heavily on the expertise of the Board staff, as well as the staff of the regional Banks, but they also reflect the policymakers’ personal views, which I think is important. Reporting policymakers’ projections rather than staff projections is in keeping with the practices of most other central banks. 
 BIS Review 15/2003 1 Lars Heikensten: Introduction on monetary policy  Speech by Mr Lars Heikensten, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to the Riksdag Committee on Finance, Stockholm, 18 March 2003. *      *      * Let me begin by thanking you for the opportunity to come here to the Committee on Finance and discuss monetary policy. This is the first time I have come here as Governor of the Riksbank. I have looked forward to today's meeting with you, our owners, and I shall do all I can to provide you with the information you need.  These open hearings began originally at the initiative of the Riksbank. They were an expression of our endeavour to bring about an open discussion on monetary policy in society, an endeavour that has since taken on many other aspects, lengthy Inflation Reports, a clear rule-of-thumb that can be evaluated, published minutes from monetary policy discussions, and so on. Now these meetings are a part of our legislation. The fact that the Committee closely follows our activities has become even more important since the Riksbank was given an independent status. These meetings illustrate the link between us and the democratically-elected body in Sweden. They make it clear that we are not working in some sort of democratic vacuum, which is sometimes claimed in the debate.  The situation in the global economy and the Swedish economy is currently marked by insecurity caused by the Iraq issue. What the central banks of the world can do in this situation is to continue to pursue their policy consistently to avoid contributing to greater uncertainty and increasing pessimism. If participants in the financial markets of a few years ago could be said to show a strong willingness to take risks and perhaps a sometimes exaggerated optimism, there are today tendencies in the opposite direction, particularly if one looks at the headlines in the media or listens to market participants. The central banks can balance this by maintaining credibility in price stability and by safeguarding the functioning of the payment system. The Riksbank strives to conduct a clear, credible monetary policy that is generally accepted by both the Swedish people and participants in the financial markets. We have therefore specified an explicit target for the annual inflation rate and explained that we normally try to keep to a simple rule-of-thumb; if the forecasts of inflation one to two years ahead exceed the inflation target we raise the interest rate and vice versa if the forecasts show inflation below target level. This clear intellectual framework makes it easier to influence expectations in society of monetary policy and to evaluate the policy afterwards. Both we ourselves and external analysts can take a stand on whether the policy appears sensible, whether the forecasts we make are reasonable, and whether we follow the principles we have declared that we follow.  Today I intend to begin by describing the current monetary policy situation and then looking back at developments in recent years. The latter discussion shows, not surprisingly, that it is not always so easy in practice to determine what is appropriate monetary policy, despite a clear target with apparently simple principles behind it. Current monetary policy Higher energy prices behind rising inflation Inflation is at present above the target level. Over the past twelve months UND1X inflation has risen by 3.3 per cent. Does this mean that monetary policy has been too expansionary, or that the interest rate should be raised now? No, it does not. At least we do not believe so. The fact that inflation has risen recently is due to large price rises on a few components of UND1X, primarily electricity and oil. Excluding energy prices, UND1X inflation has risen by 1.9 per cent over the past year, i.e. very close to the inflation target.  It is well known and accepted that monetary policy does not have any great immediate effect on inflation, which is one reason why the interest rate is set in relation to changes in the forecast inflation rate rather than the actual rate. Attempts to constantly keep inflation close to the target level could 
 2 BIS Review 15/2003 lead to large fluctuations in interest rates, with negative consequences for the economy as a whole. This applies in particular when the economy suffers supply shocks, which at the same time lead to higher prices and lower production. Increases in electricity and oil prices are examples of this type of supply shock. It is therefore important to separate the effects of the energy price rises from the effects of other driving forces behind inflation. This is also completely in line with the clarification of the inflation target published by the Riksbank in 1999. The Riksbank's assessment is that energy prices one to two years ahead will fall back to roughly the same levels as forecast before the increases. However, these forecasts include a slight trend increase in electricity prices. Uncertainty in connection with the Iraq conflict Assessing more exactly how much is a temporary rise in inflation and how much depends on more lasting tendencies is a delicate task. The assessment of economic activity, both here in Sweden and abroad, plays an important role here. The uncertainty currently prevailing in the global economy makes it more difficult than usual to interpret various economic indicators and to predict future developments. When weak figures are received from various sources, it is difficult to know whether they are the result of a slowdown in the economic recovery due to fundamental reasons, such as households wanting to increase their saving to compensate for the large stock market falls, or whether they are the result of an inability to act while waiting for the solution of the Iraq crisis.  The assessments of the economic situation and even more the oil prices are largely due to the assumptions made with regard to developments in the geopolitical situation. Let me emphasise, before I go into this, what is actually obvious; a war entails much more than just economic consequences of the type the Riksbank has reason to observe in its Inflation Report - first and foremost considerable human suffering. Let me also say that in this field - i.e. geopolitics - we are of course amateurs, although we have tried to use our international contacts when putting together our forecast. The Riksbank's main scenario assumes a solution will be reached in the Iraq conflict that does not give any reason to significantly reconsider the picture we have of a gradual recovery in economic activity. The surveys we have made indicate that the macroeconomic consequences of a brief war will not be so different from a less dramatic development. In this sense one can say that our main scenario is consistent with both a peaceful solution and a brief war. The Inflation Report describes in greater detail how we assess the effects of a worse development, which is, of course, a possibility. A weaker recovery An increasing number of indicators over the past few months have given the impression that the international economic recovery will be more protracted than anticipated. The main difference from the assessment we made in the December report, is the deterioration in prospects for the euro area. All in all, our assessment is that international growth will be slightly lower this year than we believed when making our forecasts in December. The fact that we have revised down the international growth forecast also means that we expect a slightly less strained resource utilisation in the global economy. The slightly slower recovery for the global economy will also have repercussions for developments in Sweden. Growth this year is now expected to be lower than last year and almost one half of a percentage point lower than we had reason to assume in December - 1.7 per cent instead of 2.1 per cent. Consequently, we are also anticipating there will be slightly more unutilised resources in the Swedish economy in the coming years than we had previously assumed. Our forecast of resource utilisation in Sweden has also been affected by the revisions Statistics Sweden recently made to the National Accounts. These indicate that productivity growth in the economy was higher than estimated during the greater part of the 1990s. This in turn indicates that the economy's long-term potential growth rate may be slightly higher. To summarise, I can conclude that the pictures of economic activity in Sweden and in the rest of the world are similar to the extent that there appear to be some unutilised resources and that growth will not exceed its long-term potential over the coming years. Developments are currently being restrained by the unease over Iraq. There is also still great uncertainty regarding the size of the adaptations that remain after the earlier rises in share prices and other asset prices. Some figures indicate that most of the adjustments have now been made, but the picture is not unambiguous. Nevertheless, a recovery is under way, after what must be regarded in many areas, and particularly in Sweden, as a fairly mild 
 BIS Review 15/2003 3 slowdown. Our forecasts indicate an average GDP growth over the coming years in line with the economy's long-term sustainable rate and resource utilisation is expected to remain largely unchanged over this period. This means that economic activity and the labour market are not expected to put any great pressure on prices and wages at present or in the coming years. There is, of course, a risk that developments will follow completely different paths than those we anticipate in our main scenario. This could in turn entail both upside and downside risks for inflation. The downside risk that concerns us most is connected to international developments. There are problems in the euro area in particular that could lead to a weaker development. The upside risks are mainly linked to domestic price-setting and wage formation. The rise in energy prices pushes up costs in other parts of the economy and can spread. It could also affect expectations and wage demands. We are facing collective wage bargaining rounds in the autumn, which will play a decisive role for the future of the economy. All in all, we have come to the assessment that the risk spectrum is neutral; we see equally large risks for a lower inflation path than in our main scenario as for a higher path. Repo rate lowered 0.25 percentage points The Riksbank's total assessment is that inflation measured at the rate that has guided policy in recent times, UND1X, will be slightly lower than the target level one to two years ahead. However, the picture is more complicated than this. Despite the fact that this indicates the repo rate should be lowered, the decision has not been a simple one. This is because one important reason for inflation being lower than the target level one to two years ahead is that electricity and oil prices are expected to fall back from their current high levels and it is not certain this fall in prices will affect policy. When adjusted for energy prices, inflation is expected to be in line with the target two years ahead.  The forecasts of inflation presented in the Inflation Report provide scope for lowering the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points. This was also the decision taken by the Executive Board of the Riksbank yesterday. An important circumstance that affected the decision is that the unease and uncertainty in the global economy risk leading in the short term to a much worse development in economic activity than described in the main scenario. It is difficult at present to determine the future direction for monetary policy, which will depend partly on the development of the Iraq crisis and the effects of its possible outcome on inflation prospects. Before I go on to discuss history, let me emphasise one more thing. The repo rate decision we consider most appropriate depends on the overall direction expected for economic policy. Recently, there have been claims that this is an appropriate time to counteract the weakening of the economy with a more expansionary fiscal policy. Some debaters even claim that it would be desirable in the present situation to give up the principles that have guided budgetary policy in recent years, with an expenditure ceiling and surplus target. I don't agree with that at all. If there is short-term room for manoeuvre and it is possible to obtain higher growth and employment without threatening the inflation target, this should be safeguarded by lowering the repo rate. To relinquish the fiscal policy regulations when they may be really put to the test would send a very negative signal to all those who analyse the Swedish economy. This could in turn risk having directly counter-productive effects on the interest rate and thereby on economic developments.  Monetary policy 2000-2002 Let me return to a retrospective look at the development of the inflation rate and the monetary policy conducted. The Riksbank has published an appendix in the Inflation Report that is intended to facilitate the evaluation of monetary policy during the period 2000-2002. The focus of my discussion will be on the latter part of this period. This is because developments in 2000-2001 were illustrated very clearly in last year's assessment. Price rise and monetary policy 2001 The fact that inflation was over the target level during the second half of 2001 and first half of 2002 was largely due to supply shocks similar to those we are experiencing now. Food prices rose considerably as a result of mad cow disease, foot-and-mouth disease and higher prices for fruit and vegetables resulting from poor harvests. There was also a rise in electricity prices. The Riksbank's 
 4 BIS Review 15/2003 assessment was then, as it is now, that these price rises were essentially temporary and inflation would soon fall again. This proved to be the case and in this sense the upturn in inflation 2001 did not comprise a serious monetary policy problem. However, the inflation rate rose even after adjustments were made for food and energy prices; there appears to have been a rising trend in various measures of underlying inflation from early 1999 to early 2002. It has since been shown that the Riksbank and other forecasters overestimated GDP growth and underestimated inflation when we made our forecasts for 2002 during 2000 and 2001. Perhaps we were a little too optimistic with regard to the economy's capacity to grow without inflation accelerating. However, this should be seen in the light of the earlier forecasts having been wrong in the other direction; when the Swedish and international economies grew at a very rapid rate, while inflation was low. The surprising upturn in prices during 2001 came to affect policy. Although the Riksbank made the assessment - as early as May 2001 - that the upturn was essentially temporary, there remained concern that it might to a greater degree than anticipated reflect a high level of resource utilisation. When there were signs that inflation expectations were about to rise during 2001, at the same time as the krona weakened, we made the assessment that it was necessary to intervene and raised the repo rate by a quarter of a percentage point. This took place in early July 2001. A couple of months later, after the terrorist attacks in the USA on 11 September, the Riksbank chose to lower its steering interest rate by 0.5 percentage points in the light of the poorer economic prospects. However, no further reductions were made. The reason was that a tentative upturn in economic activity was expected in the future and resource utilisation was assessed as relatively high, despite the slowdown. Compared with other countries, fiscal policy was tangibly expansionary, while a weak exchange rate gave impetus to the Swedish economy.  Developments in 2002 During spring 2002 the repo rate was raised by 0.25 percentage points on two occasions. The background was that resource utilisation was still assessed as relatively high and economic activity was expected to strengthen significantly in the light of the policy pursued, with ensuing higher inflation. In addition, inflation was still high and there was uncertainty over this, partly connected with resource utilisation. However, the recovery began to slow down, partly in the wake of continued stock market falls. At the same time, the earlier assessment that the upturn in inflation during 2001 had been temporary was confirmed, as inflation was now in line with the target again, which reduced uncertainty over possible contagion effects. Given this development, the repo rate was lowered twice during the autumn, by 0.25 percentage points. There are important similarities and important differences between the situation now and then. Inflation has risen sharply now, as it did then, as a result of some easily discernible supply shocks, with what are probably fairly transitory effects. The geopolitical unrest has had negative effects on the global economy, ever since 11 September 2001. However, there are also important differences. The krona weakened at the beginning of 2001, which together with a tendency towards higher inflation expectations brought about an interest rate hike. Over the past year the krona has remained relatively stable against the euro and strengthened against the dollar. Expectations of economic activity were also different in 2001. That year, up to the early autumn, they were aimed at relatively high growth and a rise in resource utilisation, although growth expectations were slightly lower than a year earlier. Today, expectations are of a largely unchanged level of resource utilisation. Thus, price pressure is not as high, either, as long as no secondary effects arise from the energy price rises. Forecasts guide policy Let me conclude by underlining two important aspects when assessing monetary policy. Firstly, the Riksbank, like many other countries with inflation targeting, has chosen to look ahead when making monetary policy decisions. This is clearly seen when the actual policy is compared in the evaluation appendix with simple, rule-based decisions on the basis of observed GDP growth or actual inflation. The import of this is, of course, that forecasts of inflation and GDP growth become more decisive for monetary policy than the actually observed growth rates in price levels and GDP. A disadvantage of this policy is that forecasting mistakes have effects on policy. But one advantage, which we consider 
 BIS Review 15/2003 5 to outweigh this, is that monetary policy becomes less disjointed, more predictable and on the whole more stabilising for economic developments. Of course, the Riksbank could have raised its rate more when inflation rose because of higher food and energy prices during 2001. But would this have rapidly subdued inflation and led to a more beneficial development in the economy? I don't think so. Secondly, it is difficult both to make and to assess forecasts, as our picture of history and the current situation constantly changes as a result of revisions to the statistics. The latest revisions have entailed an upward adjustment of GDP and productivity in Sweden during the years 1993-2002. In 2000 and 2001 the Riksbank made the assessment that there were unutilised resources in the economy and that inflationary pressure was thus modest. When the actual inflation rate rose, we felt obliged to review this picture, and some adjustment was probably justified. However, the most recent figures nevertheless indicate that the original assessment was largely correct. It is important not to get carried away by the most recent statistics and rapidly draw up new trends to follow. Future assessment of the Riksbank Let me finish by emphasising something I accentuated in the beginning. We aim to provide you on the Committee of Finance with the best possible information for your assessments and discussions. If you have any wishes or views with regard to how the material and the information you have received today could be further developed, we would of course be happy to hear them. We shall do all we can to satisfy your wishes.  Thank you. 
 BIS Review 14/2003 1 Andrew Large: Basel II and systemic stability Speech by Sir Andrew Large, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at the British Bankers' Association - Basel II/CAD 3 Conference, London, 13 March 2003. *      *      * Introduction Welcome to all present - particularly Bill Rutledge of the New York Fed, whose President, Bill McDonough, is rightly credited with the paternity of Basel II. Basel II is a significant step forward. It brings life to the concept of capital requirements as a function of the actual risks which banks undertake. And it extends many of the principles long developed in the area of market risk, into that of credit risk. The very essence of the banking business. This was a courageous move. And it has required Herculean labour, intellectual agility, and sheer hard work. It seeks to address the public policy objectives of regulation and supervision on the one hand, and the real-world best practice of how banks manage their businesses on the other. It has sought to provide incentives to private firms to encourage them to manage themselves in ways which reinforce their own strengths, and hence to contribute to financial stability as a whole. But equally it is designed to enable supervisors to develop resources to sharpen their own judgement, to encourage them to take account of individual circumstances, to avoid box ticking, and to add real value to the process. These are worthy ambitions. They rely on the interaction of the three pillars to achieve it. Having worked on both sides of this argument, I am more than aware of the anxieties - and indeed disagreements - which have arisen during the long debate that has got us to where we are. But the direction seems clear even though storm clouds may appear from time to time. But what I would like to do today is to look beyond today's situation a little, and to share with you a few reflections both on the Basel process itself, and, looking forward, on some related issues. Importance of all three pillars in the new Accord Firstly a couple of observations on the Accord itself. One is to remind ourselves that the Accord has three pillars - not just one. Pillar one has had most of the attention hitherto. The challenge of producing greater risk sensitivity has been considerable. Technical experts from all areas of the business, model builders, and others, have been involved. This has generated a tendency to seek greater and greater granularity and has resulted, perhaps inevitably, in considerable complexity. Striking a balance between risk sensitivity and detail has not been easy. But faced with the detail of pillar one, the challenge going forward is not to lose sight of the other two pillars, and the role they can play in mitigating complexity. Pillar two Pillar two, it should be remembered, was designed to alleviate the need for excessive detail. Supervisory oversight was felt to be a better way to address the many complexities than detailed rules. Some in the private sector complain that there might be a lack of regulatory level playing field. But my own experience leads me to believe that supervisors themselves are just as aware of this. So I would encourage those in the private sector to work with supervisors in different countries to ensure the delivery of fair supervision across frontiers. If we can achieve confidence in that, then the intention of pillar two acting as a mitigant against greater prescription will I believe be realised in practice. That said, I recognise that in some jurisdictions the thinking behind pillar two represents a new departure in the philosophy, and perhaps legal basis, behind banking supervision. And in that way it represents a considerable challenge. 
 2 BIS Review 14/2003 Maintaining the link with market practice Basel II has been a long process. But it is not an end in itself. Indeed if it were we would never achieve it. The markets, and the risks they give rise to, are not static. It is instructive, for instance, to reflect on just how much risk management theory and practice has advanced in the five years since negotiations on the Accord began.  I have long felt that you need some mechanism to ensure that prudential standards remain appropriate as the state of the art moves on. That does not mean that the standards should be in a state of continuous flux. There is a good case for stability in the initial period while the Accord is being adopted. And any review mechanism must take careful account of the implementation costs incurred by banks when the rules change. But it is costly, too, to persist with regulatory standards where they are clearly out of line with market practice.  Real effort has been made to tie the Accord to best market practice and thus to changes that banks will need to introduce anyway. Going forward, the guiding principle, difficult I know to achieve in practice, should be to keep to a minimum the difference between expenditure that banks would be incurring in any event and that required by regulators. Part of the trick is to ensure sufficient continuity of core aspects of the standards, so that changes to basic IT systems etc are minimised or at any rate can take place over time. Time is, after all, a major help in this respect. Implementing systems changed as part of the software obsolescence cycle may involve only modest marginal cost. More immediate and discrete changes are always going to be more costly.  These issues will clearly need further discussion. In the EU context, however, it is particularly important that the arrangements for revising any Directive reflect, if not the letter, at least the spirit of Lamfalussy. It would be wholly inappropriate to try to hard code all the detail of the pillar one rules in an EU Directive, as if these can necessarily stand for a long period of time. I should say that the costs of implementing Basel II will not fall on banks alone - nor will the challenges. In most jurisdictions, regulators too will both face challenges and need to incur costs in expanding staff numbers, in training and in implementing systems. This will be important for them to handle the new approach. After all, it calls for a significantly greater level of expertise on the part of line supervisors than has the existing Basel Accord. And whilst the UK, and a few other jurisdictions, do have that expertise, we need to remember that we are looking at a global market place. And at a global level I detect a deficit of expertise which will require to be remedied. Pillar three and disclosure I would also like to say a few words on pillar three. Pillar three can, it seems to me, play two roles. First, of course, it can play a role within the Basel II context itself, by mitigating the need for complexity in pillar one. Disclosure about the way organisations actually manage their risks can indeed help a better understanding of their risk profile, compared to a study of complex numbers on their own. For example, understanding how a firm conducts its stress testing, or how valuations might be sensitive to different assumptions, could be of real value. But, second, such disclosure could be of value in the general accounting context itself. This gets to the complexity versus disclosure debate in the search for a better way forward in that arena; and should improve the ability of accounts to reflect changes in the underlying business. All of this is really to say that pillar three needs to be seen in a broader context. In today's 'derivatised' world, the utilisation of derivatives and complex forms of contract, often with modelled valuation bases, is just about omnipresent. This is not a value judgment - it is a fact. I think we have to accept that any set of accounts, however drawn up, is likely to be considerably deficient, taken just as numbers, in terms of outlining the economic realities of risks within the balance sheet. And disclosure itself is arguably inadequate at present in relation to both off- as well as on-balance sheet activity. However much it may be a matter of regret, and despite best intentions, the transparency of today's accounts has become less and the opacity greater than was the case in former days, thereby giving a less than complete or reliable view of overall risks. This is not just a question of SPVs; what is and what is not on the balance sheet; nor even whether historic or fair value accounting techniques are used. The fact that accounting standards setters are only too well aware of this, and grappling with the considerable issues involved, is very much to be applauded. For this is a fundamentally difficult area. 
 BIS Review 14/2003 3 I particularly welcome the efforts of Sir David Tweedie and his colleagues at IASB in addressing so openly the hugely difficult task of getting the right balance and right principles into place. Many of us can see I think that the financial instruments standards IAS 32 and 39 have provoked significant and strong views. Wisdom, foresight and a certain forbearance will be needed if we are to achieve a good solution. So we should all welcome the present initiative of the IASB in holding a series of roundtables with respondents to their exposure drafts on revisions to IAS 32 and 39. Debate and efforts in relation to these particular standards seem to me to be vital. They get to the heart of the dilemmas and challenges presented by new financial techniques and often complex instruments. It has after all been shown, in the Enron case if no others, that detailed and prescriptive accounting standards, in the wrong hands, can engender a moral hazard in the search for ways round them which investment bankers and lawyers may well be expected to find. A similar logic applies in the prolonged debate between historic and mark-to-market accounting principles. Once again, whichever approach is used, neither of them will tell the whole story in terms of the underlying economic realities of a bank's risk and return, nor how the risks are managed. But forms of disclosure may help. Looking ahead: the longer term financial stability policy agenda Perhaps I can turn now to some observations for the longer term. These go beyond Basel II and what its architects had in mind for it. But they nonetheless require us to think in terms of the same combination of evolving best practice within the financial services industry on the one hand and public policy needs on the other. I The challenges of an increasingly integrated financial sector Firstly, the new Accord is mainly designed for credit risks and hence essentially for banks. Yet we are all becoming clearer that the process of intermediation of risks is itself changing mightily. The silos that were securities, lending, and insurance, are no longer silos. Instead we are seeing the increasing development of a single financial network embracing not only these areas, but also many organisations which fall outside today's definitions of what is a bank, what is a securities house, or what is an insurance company. This process has gathered pace in recent years, and has accelerated since the Basel II process itself began. A couple of examples can illustrate what I mean. First is the growth of the credit risk transfer market. Alan Greenspan has recently noted that this may have benign effects, recently arguing that: 'If risk is properly dispersed, shocks to the overall economic system will be better absorbed and less likely to create cascading failures that could threaten financial stability'. But new forms of contract tend to bring uncertainty. The recent litigation in New York involving claims under surety bonds is perhaps a much reported incident of this sort. And uncertainties in a world dependent on expeditious performance of contracts has to be a real issue in financial stability terms. Second, we have seen the emergence of large multifunctional financial groups. So my observation is that whatever thinking might have gone into the Basel II Accord for banks, we would be wise to focus further, on the way in which capital adequacy and other prudential supervisory techniques fit together, for different parts of the financial world, including insurance. The wisdom in earlier days was that systemic risk, in a financial stability sense, was largely confined to banks. Not any more. It has been recognised for some time that the securities arena and the process of securitisation has changed all that. And more recently, growing interlinkages with the insurance sector are giving rise to the need for a further rethink. II Looking beyond capital adequacy: the importance of liquidity Secondly a rather different angle. Viewed from the point of view of financial stability, capital adequacy is clearly a vital and valuable policy tool. That is why Basel II is so important. But systemic crises do not always emanate from capital inadequacy. The first indication of trouble ahead may well come from a completely different area. What I am talking about is the question of liquidity. And my observation here is that we would be advised to give more thought to the underlying issues, risks, and mitigants which could be ingredients in liquidity problems. What are the drivers? What may cause liquidity to be withdrawn? To what extent could uncertainties, referred to a few moments ago, impact liquidity in 
 4 BIS Review 14/2003 unpredictable ways? What machinery/measures can best be devised to ensure that liquidity will continue to be available in times of stress? And, in the face of attempts to improve the resilience and efficiency of market infrastructure (for example, clearing and settlement), how will changing practices and perceptions affect the drivers of liquidity? This is, I feel, an area where standards and principles could be further developed which engender both the best practice understandings of the private participants on the one hand, and the interface with public policy imperatives on the other. Conclusion Basel II has been steered to this point of take-off for the hugely critical area of capital adequacy. I would identify four challenges for the next stage. First, to achieve the successful implementation of Basel II by banks and regulators across the globe. Second, to ensure that mechanisms exist to update it in the light of evolving best practice. Third, to give thought to whether analogous agreements would be appropriate in securities and insurance. And, fourth, to ensure that the scale of work on capital adequacy issues does not cause us to overlook the importance, either of liquidity management, or the development of a more robust market infrastructure in the maintenance of financial stability. 
 BIS Review 14/2003 1 R Basant Roi: Indian Ocean International Bank Ltd - opening of the on-going training programme  Keynote address by Mr R Basant Roi, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, Port Louis, 8 March 2003. *      *      * Chairman of the Board of Directors of the IOIB Staff members of the IOIB Ladies and Gentlemen I am privileged to address you on the occasion of the opening of the first training programme for the staff of the Indian Ocean International Bank Ltd. Your training programme is starting at a time when animated talks regarding the latest bank fraud have wrought up to a high pitch of concern. Although I have been invited by your bank today to reflect on ethics in banking to mark the opening of your training programme, I shall attempt to highlight some cases of fraud from which we may all draw some lessons.  Philosophers in ancient as well as modern times have debated lengthily on ethics. Aristotle and J.S. Mill could not definitively sort out our ethical problems. It is unlikely that the business gurus of today can resolve the problems with a few well-constructed and captivating sentences. A commentator from the European media once stated that he found himself ill at ease to start a television programme ‘with a lecture by currency manipulator George Soros, of all people, on ethics’. The commentator was quick in qualifying his remark with a statement to the effect that George Soros had spent quite some millions of dollars made in speculating against the Pound sterling in 1992 on charities. Unethical ethics? Ethical dilemma or what? I do not intend to dwell lengthily on such an overarching concept as ethics. We all have our own definition of ethics. The Oxford English Dictionary defines ethics as a set of moral principles. Ethic is a singular word but is often used in plural. Perhaps that is why its definition tends to be so elastic. It is, as you all must be knowing, not a mathematical concept and I, for one, would not venture here to give you any precise definition of what ethics in banking is all about. Let me content myself with ethics in its simplest sense, that is, as one writer has put it, “choosing the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the fair over the unfair”. And what is good, Phaedrus, And what is not good - Need we ask anyone to tell us these things? Ethical behaviour stems from within us, not from without. “Nothing external, … no guideline, no regulation, no sophisticated system, no well-articulated ethics programme is going to make yourself any better. The self is an internal image, who you perceive yourself to be, a composite of your thoughts and beliefs. If that self does not change, then you will continue to act and feel as you did before.” This is one way of looking at the whole problem of ethics. Perhaps that is why universally economic agents went for some sort of a do-it-yourself philosophy in the past.   However, questions relating to ethics in the wake of several corporate scandals the world over are being increasingly asked since the 1980s. Over 500 business ethics courses are offered in the US and nearly all business schools teach ethics. As a reaction to cynicism schools of business and law are increasingly offering courses in ethics as if morality, like algebra, can be taught and applied. An article in the Journal of Economic Literature with the title ‘Economics and Contemporary Moral Philosophy’ highlighted four aspects of the relationship between Economics and Moral Philosophy. Interestingly, one of the four relationships emphasizes how the moral beliefs of an organisation, be it a financial or a non-financial institution, influence its behaviour in the marketplace. Evidently, by virtue of having fiduciary responsibilities bankers are naturally expected to readily understand what Amartya Kumar Sen calls ‘basic value judgement’, that is what society regards as being good, right, fair and acceptable. The Asian crisis amply demonstrated that banks and non-bank financial institutions cannot indefinitely overstep ethical values. As one central banker has put it the crisis ‘increases the need for organisations to adhere to a strong set of values to steer them through the minefield of ethical choices with which they are faced as they make business decisions. It is also necessary to ensure that the 
 2 BIS Review 14/2003 behaviour of the organisation is in practice aligned with these values and that employees buy into them, so that the organisation actually practises what it preaches.’       Bankers occupy a position of trust. Nearly two years ago, in one of my addresses I mentioned that good corporate citizenship and adherence to core ethical values form the basis of honest bankers. Is it good, right and fair for a bank officer to accept or extort gifts in any form whatsoever in return for loans extended to borrowers or to cheat customers of banks? I do not believe that anyone of us should undergo a rigorous training in business ethics at Harvard Business School to answer this simple question.  Historical record reveals that mania engenders systematic misfeasance, malfeasance or defalcations. Swindles are a response to the greedy appetite for wealth stimulated by not only economic booms but also by depressions. The 1920s recorded the highest number of swindles in the US. As bankers, and particularly as senior managers in our individual institutions, we have to be well aware that as firms and households see others getting rich through speculative purchases and sales, they generally tend to imitate. ‘Monkey see, monkey do.’ As the number of firms and households indulging in such practices grow large speculation for profits leads them away from rational behaviour to manias. And manias engender swindling.  Bankers are householders, too. In the world of finance, we, as bankers, should be familiar with swindles that have assumed the character of ‘Ponzi finance’ - a type of game in finance played by the archetypal swindler, Charles Ponzi. Economic theorists have elaborately analysed how a borrower, and possibly even a banker, who has control over the price in the market in which he issues his own personal debt may choose to play ‘Ponzi game of financing’: repay old debt with issuance of new debt to a point where either the borrower runs away with the money and disappears or, if the borrower is a banker, he dips in the bank’s till. Castanier in Honore de Balzac’s Melmoth Reconcilie is a cashier. Mme Aquilinia de la Garde, mistress of the cashier, has expensive tastes. The cashier issues promissory notes to meet expenses. At some stage the cashier adds up his debts. He could rescue himself by leaving his mistress but he could not give her up. Eventually his debts mounted. Interest due swelled. The cashier’s financial manipulations could not be continued and it became evident that he should fail. The cashier decided to defraud rather than to declare bankruptcy. The cashier plunged his hands into the bank’s till.   Financial felony has many forms and character. Outright stealing, paying dividends out of capital, dealing in stock exchange on inside knowledge, selling securities without full disclosure, altering banks’ books, diverting funds from pre-determined use to another, extending loans to controversial individuals and dubious persons deliberately ignoring established procedures are only some in a long list of financial felony.  The foregoing is intended to simply draw your attention to the ways and means employed by officers of financial institutions to defraud. ‘There is perhaps no record of a bank fraud extant of which the perpetrator was not honest yesterday.’ (Clapham, Bank of England, Vol. 2). Never allow a bank officer to stay in a key position for too long a time. Rotation of officers in fraud-prone areas of any bank’s operations is essential. Bank officers should compulsorily go on vacation leave once a year. This is an elementary principle in the management of any financial institutions. The Bank of Mauritius receives numerous complaints from bank customers. May I say that there is much scope for improving the quality of services offered by several banks. Unfair charges and fees on banking transactions, inadequate and often misleading information supplied to bank customers, rather than advising borrowers how to get out of a temporary setback in their businesses squeezing them to the point of bankruptcy are a few items in the long list of complaints that could bring the banks into bad disrepute. Is it ethical to impose inordinately high charges and fees? I am sure you know the right answer. Is it not ethical for banks to supply their customers with information about the charges and fees?   All in all, the culture of any bank does matter. How much the staffs of banks appreciate the value that senior managements themselves attaches to what is good, right and fair in the conduct of the business they are in is of critical importance. Good corporate governance is indeed the pacesetter for ethical behaviour in banks. As I said earlier the moral beliefs of an organisation shape the behaviour of its employees. Several months back I had a working session with the Board of Directors of your bank wherein I outlined the various parameters set in the Bank of Mauritius guideline on Corporate Governance. I am pleased to note that your Board of Directors has initiated corrective actions. I urge your Board of Directors to carry the implementation of all the guidelines issued by the 
 BIS Review 14/2003 3 Bank of Mauritius through to the finish. Your progress is being monitored. The Bank of Mauritius will carry out similar exercises with the Boards of Directors of other banks also in the near future.  The Bank of Mauritius has, in the past few years, issued several guidelines to banks and other deposit taking institutions. I do not wish to go into the details of those guidelines here with you. I do not wish to be l’évangile de l’intégrité, le Dalai Lama de la transparence et l’apôtre de la bonne governance. We have been urging all deposit taking institutions to enforce the guidelines. The guidelines are of international standards. Once enforced, management of banks should be less apprehensive of frauds and unethical behaviour in their respective organisations. In the new Banking Bill we are introducing a penalty system. Banks that fail to adhere to the rules of the game will be fined. I am delighted that new Board of Directors of your bank has decided to give training to the staff. I am given to understand that it is the first training programme organised for you all. Let me wish you the very best of success. 
 BIS Review 14/2003 1 Yves Mersch: Financial sector Luxembourg - recent developments and financial stability Introductory speech by Mr Yves Mersch, Governor of the Central Bank of Luxembourg, at the ALFI 2003 Spring Conference, Luxembourg, 11 March 2003.  *      *      * Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is an honor and a pleasure for me to be invited to join the 2003 Spring conference of the Luxembourg Investment Fund Association and to hold its introductory speech. My presentation comprises two main sections. The first section is devoted to recent developments in the financial sector, with a specific focus on Luxembourg. The second section relates to financial stability issues. 1. Recent developments in the financial sector  The year 2002 has been, as you all know, a difficult year for the financial industry as a whole. Weak economic and financial market conditions have translated into a deterioration in the profitability of the European banks. This deterioration appears to be the consequence of a combination of two major adverse developments in their operating environment. - First, the deterioration in the economic cycle and in the borrowers’ credit quality, resulting in increased loan loss provisions. - Second, the plunge in global and in particular in European stock markets, coupled with increased risk aversion and uncertainty in other financial markets, entailing reduced commissions and trading income from capital-market related businesses. The Luxembourg financial sector, characterized by its high degree of openness, has not escaped from the impact of the depressed general environment. In the year 2002, the Luxembourg banking sector has seen its net results deteriorating on an aggregated basis by 6%, although the evolution is unequally spread among the individual financial institutions. While interest margins and commissions, which are their key sources of profitability, have declined in total by 7% and 6% respectively, a compensation of this negative trend has partly been achieved at the level of certain individual institutions through an increase in their one-off exceptional revenues and/or a release of previously created general provisions. The one-off exceptional revenues increased in total by 525 million euros, or 132%, and are related for the major part to capital gains income through the sell-off of the stock-holdings by several banks in Cedel, this in the context of the total acquisition of the Luxembourg based embedded payment and securities settlement system by Deutsche Boerse AG. The level of provisions on a net aggregated basis has increased by 595 million euros, or 84% compared to 2001. A closer look at the figures highlights that within this general increase, which is related in particular to a new net creation of specific risk provisions, some individual banks have released previously created so called general provisions, thus allowing for an improvement in their end-of-year results. General provisions have here played the role of reserve buffer. Recent discussions on the implementation of new rules and regulations in the banking sector will certainly pose challenges and call for new risk mitigation techniques. I will only mention as examples the discussion in relation to the introduction of the IAS accounting standards for the banking sector, including full fair value accounting for the banking book , as well as the information disclosure of the quarterly results, which will most likely increase the short term volatility of the banking results; the future introduction of the new capital adequacy rules which risks having a negative pro-cyclical impact of the loan-loss provisions on the financial sector. The concept of dynamic provisioning could be a step in the right direction in this context. 
 2 BIS Review 14/2003 If we disregard in the banks’ accounts from the results the miscellaneous income, including capital gains, the picture of the banking sector appears even more alarming. Banks’ income before provisions and taxes would show a decrease of 7% in 2002 instead of an increase of 6%; their net results would be almost 30% lower than the year before, instead of a modest decline of 6%. Amid these adverse developments, banks have succeeded in containing their costs. Administrative costs have been reduced by 6% over the year under review, while staff costs have only slightly increased by 3%. Possible further cost reductions into the year 2003 are however not unlimited. The cost/income ratio of Luxembourg banks stands at 40% at the end of 2002, down from 41% in 2001, and is already more efficient than for most other European banks. It compares indeed to an average ratio of 66% EU-wide in 2001. An important part of potential further cost cuts on the European level is most probably already incorporated in the Luxembourg results. Other gauges of banking activity are not encouraging either. A look at the banks’ aggregated balance sheet shows a decrease of 58,4 billion euros, a decrease of 8% compared to 2001 and contrasting with a continuous growth over the past twenty years. Even employment, typically a lagged indicator, decreased by close to 600 units in 2002, or 2% in relative terms, and the total number of employees stands at 23 300 at the end of December 2002. This reduction is however attenuated by an increase of about 200 staff members within the ”Other professionals of the financial sector”, whose employment comes close to 20% of the employment of the banking sector. Staff redundancies via social plans have however so far been the exception. As concerns the number of banks, 178 at the end of January 2003, we have witnessed a reduction of nine units compared to the end of 2001 and a notable decrease compared to the peak of 223 banks in June 1996. This movement is mainly the result of mergers resulting from restructuring within the banking groups, cross-border as well as cross sectoral, at the international level. The tendency has abated for now, but is likely to revive once the economy recovers. This restructuring process can lead among others to the concentration of specific activities within banking groups into one single handling unit. IT-infrastructure, back-office, trading and accounting are some prime examples. While acknowledging the possible economic benefits of this concentration, care should be taken that outsourcing does not create gaps, neither in risk management nor in supervision. From a macro-prudential perspective, the banks have been able, partly due however to the aforementioned factors in their profit and loss accounts, to cope with the harsh external environment. On an aggregated basis, the global net constitution of value adjustments, related to their own funds, has increased from 1.9% in 2001 to 5.1% in 2002. Their return on assets, in terms of net results at 0.4% at the end of 2002, has fallen back to its level of 1999. Their global aggregated capital ratio has improved from its stance of 14% at the end of 2001, to 16% at the end of 2002, comfortably above the prudential 8% threshold. The investment fund business has equally not been spared by the unfavorable external environment. The UCIs, numbering 1 941 at the end of 2002, albeit showing a modest increase of 33 units over the past year, has seen its growing trend reversed from October 2002 to December 2002 by 19 units. The value of assets under management, at close to 845 billion euros at the end of 2002, has diminished by 9% as compared to 2001. This decline seems however to be mainly the result of the reduced market value of assets. Positively, a net accumulation of 57 billion euros in new capital invested in 2002 has taken place. Ladies and Gentlemen, although the current picture does not look favorable, the sector has remained resilient. Ultimately, the sector’s outlook hinges on developments in the economic and financial markets environment. We are facing a quite unusual synchronized slowdown in the world’s three major economies, Europe, the United States and Japan. Today, the words that can appropriately characterize the future outlook are uncertainty, fragility and volatility in relation to the timing and pace of economic recovery overshadowed by geopolitical tensions. We should remain vigilant. 2. Issues of financial stability The combination of the central banks’ role in issuing money and the participation of commercial banks in the money creation process results in the involvement of central banks in financial stability. Commercial banks’ money represents a large share of the total money stock, and its value is 
 BIS Review 14/2003 3 dependent on the creditworthiness of commercial banks. The concern of central banks for the orderly functioning and stability of the banking system arises hence from the need to maintain the public good of a stable means of payment. Banking is plagued by inherent instability. The banking sector functions as a closely inter-linked system, which is prone to contagion risks through the payment system and the interbank markets. Central banks, as issuer of money, need, like any other sound managed financial institution, to monitor the quality of their counterparts. This is an addition to their role as ultimate provider of a safe settlement medium and of liquidity to ensure the orderly functioning of the financial system. Price stability supports sound investment and sustainable growth, which in turn is conducive to financial stability. Since the fragility of banks and their counterparts tend to be more frequent when prices are unstable, the pursuit of price stability can be seen as a crucial contribution to financial stability. Day-to-day monetary policy tools are to a significant extend associated with financial stability considerations. Lending- and deposit facilities at the central bank and fine tuning money market operations are primarily aimed at providing sufficient liquidity to the money market and facilitating an orderly liquidity management by individual banks. A specific question relates to the relationship between asset prices, financial stability and monetary policy. How should a central bank position itself with regard to price changes in assets? Asset price targeting beyond the pursuit of price stability could set conflicting signals. One could certainly question central banks’ superior ability for asset price targeting; different asset classes could require conflicting action. Based on an indicator for maintaining price stability over the medium term, the present ECB strategy takes note of movements of exchange rates, stock prices and properties prices. The mission attributed to the ESCB in the field of financial stability is threefold: First, it has the task to contribute to the policies carried out by the competent authorities in the field of prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial sector; second, it is entrusted with an advisory role in the rule-making process; third, it has the obligation to promote the smooth operation of payment systems. The BCL has put in place a system of macro-prudential indicators, allowing for a regular monitoring of the Luxembourg financial sector. The International Monetary Fund has in the context of its recent article IV consultation and Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) welcomed the establishment by the BCL of the aforementioned indicators; those have served among others as a basis for the IMF assessment of the soundness of the financial sector, the systemic importance of which is highlighted in the respective reports. During six months, from June to December 1998, the BCL has been endowed with the mission of supervising financial institutions on a micro-prudential level. This mission has however subsequently been removed and delegated to the Commission de surveillance du secteur financier, created at the beginning of 1999. The legislator was most probably not aware of the fact that this decision would lead to an exceptional situation within the Monetary Union, as it entails a total absence of formal bilateral co-operation between the micro-prudential and macro-prudential supervision of the financial sector. Central banks of the Eurosystem assume today either direct responsibility for micro-prudential supervision, or are closely involved in this mission, or have formal co-operation arrangements in place. The role for central banks, to be embedded in an appropriate overall supervisory regime due to their involvement in financial stability, is based on their mission in payment systems; the obligation to communicate and comment in the field of financial stability and to maintain a communication network with other central banks; the need of disseminating information to markets; and the possible need for liquidity injection in emergency situations or for crises management. Therefore, the role for central banks to act as a global co-ordinator in crises situation directly derives from the fact the central banks have the special expertise, information and tools necessary to perform co-ordination and liquidity support functions. The smooth functioning of the payment systems is instrumental to the efficient allocation of financial resources in the economy. Through the payment systems, banks are interconnected and channel liquidity to the financial sector and to the rest of the economy, and thus contribute to the smooth economic development and to financial stability. The participants in those systems are linked in a network that provides a channel for contagion risk. The failure of a counterpart can trigger systemic problems. The same is true for securities settlement systems. 
 4 BIS Review 14/2003 With the transposition of the Settlement Finality Directive into Luxembourg law in January 2001, the legislator has endowed the banking supervisory authority with the surveillance of the systems, and on an exceptional basis the BCL, under the condition that the BCL is a participant in those systems. For the time being, BCL is in charge of the oversight of Lips-Gross, the Luxembourg component of Target, Lips-Net, the local retail payment system, including its technical agent Cetrel and the securities settlement system operated by Clearstream, including its technical agent Clearstream Services. The BCL has notified these systems to the European Commission. It monitors the observance by the systems of the requirements laid down in its oversight policies and procedures. Those are based on international standards and recommendations. They comprise among others, issues related to corporate governance and corporate structure, the latter aiming at avoiding the emergence of oversight gaps or loopholes at the level of the system operator. The BCL participates in the discussions at the ESCB on issues regarding oversight of the payment and securities settlement systems. At the ESCB level, a Memorandum of Understanding was concluded in 2001 between the overseers of payment systems and the supervisory authorities. This non-legally binding document relates to the co-operation and exchange of prudential information which may have an impact on financial stability and on aspects which call for a co-operation between the ESBC and banking supervisors on a cross-border level. Even though synergies between price stability and financial stability should prevail in the longer run, successful monetary policy will not always be sufficient by itself to prevent financial instability. In rare circumstances, the need to provide liquidity to individual illiquid institutions cannot be excluded. A form of involvement of central banks which carries fewer moral hazard implications than the provision of liquidity consists of the central banks acting as a co-ordinator to facilitate private sector solutions. In this case, the central banks can act as “honest broker”. Due to their unique position in the financial system, their independence from political considerations, their possession of special expertise, information and tools, they appear best placed to assume the role of overall co-ordinator. 3. Conclusions Potential future risks and vulnerabilities in the financial sector continue to have their source in the European and global macro-economic environment. Further needs for additional risk provisioning and continued lower income from trading activities and retail banking in general could further impair banks’ profits. The financial results of the first quarter of 2003 will give us a first indication in this respect. The banking sector has been resilient so far and I believe, without being complacent, that this sector has the potential to withstand possible further shocks. Enhanced risk management, increased reserve buffers and continued strategies aiming at increasing profitability are certainly steps in the right direction. Ladies and Gentlemen, since the creation of an euro area financial system, financial stability concerns have developed into a euro area wide issue. The unique challenge the eurosystem is facing lies in the threefold separation between the regulatory body, which is the European union, the single currency area and country specific supervisory jurisdictions. This separation requires special forms of co-operation between public bodies. As liquidity and contagion risk is increasing in importance, one should expect the role of central banks in financial stability to increase. Care should be taken in relation to risks arising from the non-banking financial sector activities and from financial market price developments. Despite improvements in risk management techniques and procedures, in prudential supervision and in the oversight of payment and securities settlement systems, the occurrence of a future financial crises is not excluded. Central banks’ role as global co-ordinator in those situations is of crucial importance. To repeat and summarize: Central banks are involved in financial stability: being banks themselves with business operations, it is necessary for central banks to control the soundness of their counterparts; in addition central banks are entrusted with the exclusive task of providing ultimate liquidity. They play an important role in crises management and in maintaining financial stability, regardless of the institutional structure for supervision which is adopted in the respective jurisdiction. However, close formal co-operation and information sharing arrangements, between central banks and supervisory authorities, which should work not only in theory but also in practice, is a pre-condition to address issues of financial stability in an adequate way. 
 BIS Review 14/2003 5 Thank for your kind attention. 
 BIS Review 14/2003 1 David Dodge: Central Bank Website of the Year Remarks by David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the Website Awards Event, Central Banking Publications and Lombard Street Research, London, England, 12 March 2003. *      *      * It is very gratifying to be here tonight to accept, on behalf of the Bank of Canada, this award for "Central Bank Website of the Year."  It has become almost a cliché to point out that "Internet time moves faster than normal time." But I'm reminded of that observation as I accept this award - an award for achievement in a medium that barely existed ten years ago. For that matter, it was only eight years ago - in 1995 - that the Banco de México, the Bank of Canada, and a few other central banks launched their first Web sites. Back then, it would have been hard to imagine just how quickly the Web would evolve into the hugely influential medium it is today.  It would also have been hard to imagine back then just how far central banks would move towards greater openness and transparency in their day-to-day operations.  So it seems significant that these two trends - the push towards more open, transparent communications, and the unexpectedly rapid ascendance of the Web - should have coincided.  At the Bank of Canada, our Web site has been an integral part of our communications strategy over the past eight years. The Web offers us a cost-effective global distribution channel for vast amounts of data, analysis, and commentary pertaining to our main functions - that is, the conduct of monetary policy, the promotion of financial stability, the supply of bank notes, and the provision of central banking services to the federal government.  Our site also offers a growing amount of purely instructive material. Through the use of glossaries, "backgrounders", and other information, we have made a concerted effort to ensure that every document we publish provides enough context to help non-specialists read and understand it. This is no small challenge, given the admittedly dry and complex nature of much of the material a central bank deals with.  We have also developed "inflation and investment calculators" so that our message about the benefits of low inflation is clear to the public. And we use a graphic presentation to explain the transmission of monetary policy. As well, we are currently developing a Web-based simulation game, designed to explain the intricacies of monetary policy to high school and undergraduate students.  Based on our efforts to date, our hosts here this evening have decided that the Bank of Canada's Web site is the best among the two dozen central bank sites that they short-listed for this award. So the question you may be asking is, "How exactly did you do it? And what sets the Bank of Canada's Web site apart from those of other banks?"  First, we did it ourselves. We didn't throw a lot of money at outside consultants. From the earliest days, we have been fortunate enough to have a small group of key people - editors, writers, programmers - who were excited by this new technology, and who were willing to dedicate their time to building and improving the site.  I'd like to take a moment to mention a couple of those key people by name - although, as always, there are many others whose efforts have contributed importantly to the success of the site. Some of you may already know our senior Web consultant, Brent Eades, through his Web-related articles in central banking publications, and his presentations at various central bank Web conferences. Since 1998, Brent has had the principal responsibility for developing and expanding our site, and we are obviously very pleased that his efforts are receiving such a strong endorsement here tonight.  I would also like to note the considerable contribution of Ken Kingsbury, a senior programmer on our staff, who has been responsible for perfecting many of the sophisticated data search tools on the site.  Second, from the beginning, our attitude has been one of encouragement, rather than direction. We have been content to trust the planning and management of the site to staff who have the expertise to do the job right. Indeed, I think the fact that we have trusted the specialists in our various departments to decide how best to present their particular information has a lot to do with the success of our Web site.  
 2 BIS Review 14/2003 As we look to the future of our site, our plan is to continue to trust those with the necessary talent. Staff are already planning a variety of improvements to the site over the next year - a graphic redesign is in the works, as well as the simulation game I mentioned a moment ago. We also plan to fine-tune and reorganize the site's content to make it even more accessible than it is now. So this is a heads-up to our fellow central bankers that we don't intend to relinquish this award readily!  *********************** Once again, I want to express my sincere thanks to Central Banking Publications and Lombard Street Research for the honour of this most prestigious award. This is a proud moment for the members of our staff who have put in endless hours developing a prize-winning site. 
 BIS Review 13/2003 1 TT Mboweni: Inflation, growth and employment opportunities  Lecture by Mr TT Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the Department of Economics, University of Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, 6 March 2003. *      *      * 1. Introduction Members of the Portfolio and Select Committees on Finance, Deputy vice-chancellor,  Professors,  Staff,  Students,  Ladies and gentlemen It is very pleasant to be on this side of the beautiful Hex River Mountains and to speak to you on a number of issues right at the core of central banking. The accusation is often heard that central bankers have narrowed the world down to inflation, and do not have an open mind on any other matters. Not true! The way in which these matters come together - the principles behind their interaction - will be central to my talk to you today.  2. The magnitude of the challenges facing our economy Starting with a longer-term picture of inflation, it is a well-known fact that the double-digit inflation which reigned from 1974 to 1992 left considerable scars on our economy. Its redistributive impact was nasty, with the buying power of the most vulnerable groups in society, the poor and the elderly, in particular being undermined. The plight of a pensioner who retired twenty years ago using interest on a fixed deposit to provide for himself or herself is illustrated by the cost of a basket of consumer items which cost R100 in early 1983. The cost of that basket shot up to R380 in early 1993, and currently amounts to R815. Although inflation has receded to single-digit levels and has averaged around 7,8 per cent per annum over the last ten years, this is still enough to very significantly erode the living standard of the most vulnerable groups in our society over time. Some distortions therefore remain, leading to frictions and misallocation of resources. High unemployment continues to characterise the South African labour market. Based on the responses of a representative sample of 30 000 households sampled in the February 2002 Labour Force Survey, Statistics South Africa puts the official unemployment rate at 29,4 per cent. The absolute number of the unemployed amounts to 4,7 million people. And these are people who are looking for jobs - it does not cover those who have given up. The opportunity cost to our economy is huge: even if each of them would only produce goods and services to the amount of R650 per month (the equivalent of the minimum wage in the lowest-paying areas), their combined output would amount to almost R40 billion per annum - almost as much as the value actually added in our entire agriculture, forestry and fishing sector. Disillusionment and desperation often accompany unemployment. Unemployment insurance - soon to be expanded to more sectors - can help to relieve some of the symptoms, but what is of course needed is the creation of a sufficient number of sustainable job opportunities to absorb the unemployed. To this end, most economists agree that sustained real GDP growth of around 5 to 6 per cent per annum is needed. Whereas South Africa barely managed to record an average growth rate of 1,5 per cent per annum during the 1980s, this has indeed accelerated to around 3 per cent per annum since 1994. Nevertheless, a significant and sustained further improvement is needed. The question is how? And in what way could monetary policy contribute towards such stronger growth?  3. Inflation and growth: is there a trade-off? Can more growth (and the other side of the coin, less unemployment) be bought by allowing more inflation? This question has interested economists a lot since 1958 when A W Phillips and R G Lipsey published their analysis of the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wages in the United Kingdom from 1861 to 1957. Empirical evidence indicated the existence of an 
 2 BIS Review 13/2003 inverse relationship between wage inflation and unemployment. This implied that an inflation-accommodating monetary and fiscal policy stance - an easy-money policy - could be used to reduce unemployment. However, this relationship turned out to be fragile at least and quite false at worst. Firstly, empirical evidence which accumulated in numerous countries increasingly undermined the Phillips curve theory as inflation accelerated but the hoped-for reduction in unemployment either failed to materialise or did not last for long. Secondly, economic theories were developed which explicitly incorporated learning behaviour. Assuming adaptive expectations it could be shown that "the" Phillips curve (with the unemployment rate on the horizontal axis and inflation on the vertical) would shift upward over time. The true picture would then consist of a short-term Phillips curve where the trade-off holds for a while, but a long-term Phillips curve which is vertical.  Some rational expectations models went further, and implied that stimulatory monetary and fiscal policies would be fully expected and reflected in prices without having quantity effects. This would mean that there would be no short-term Phillips curves, just a long-term vertical relationship. Looking at South African empirical information in this regard, there are unfortunately severe data problems. The data on registered unemployment (people registering as unemployed in order to receive unemployment insurance payouts) is patchy and where available, not consistent over time. As far as the Labour Force Surveys are concerned, they only started in 2000 and have a six-monthly frequency. But assuming growth in real GDP is the mirror image of unemployment, adequate data of high quality is available to investigate the proxy relationship - that between inflation and real GDP growth. This relationship turns out to be very loose. On a few occasions there are signs of the expected short-term relationship, with higher growth accompanying higher inflation, but most of the time it doesn't seem to persist. Over the long term, no trade-off seems to hold. In fact, it is noteworthy that from 1982 to 1992 average inflation amounted to 14,6 per cent against average real GDP growth of 0,7 per cent, while from 1992 to 2002 inflation averaged 7,6 per cent per annum and real growth 2,7 per cent. The lower inflation, the better economic growth. This runs against the logic of the Phillips curve, but makes perfect sense for central bankers who tend to stress the deadweight losses flowing from high inflation. An uncertain environment with high inflation is certainly not conducive to a true reading of price signals and relative scarcities, brisk fixed capital formation and sound resource allocation in general. (Some observers would of course argue that both the low growth and the high inflation of the 1970s and 1980s were caused by outside factors such as various supply side shocks. Correlation doesn't prove causality. And so the debate will continue…) Pursuing this line of reasoning further, a number of studies covering a large number of countries have been done, inter alia by IMF officials, to estimate the rate of inflation above which the distortions introduced by inflation really start to drag the real growth rate of the economy down. Not surprisingly, these studies come up with different answers. Growth-destroying inflation starts at low single digits, high single digits or (at most) slightly above the ten per cent mark, depending on the methodology used. A little inflation may be good, for example making it easier to lower real prices and wages in industries experiencing more competition without having to lower nominal prices and wages. However, it must be pointed out that low inflation should not solely be pursued because it is conducive to sustainable economic growth. It should also be pursued because equity, fairness and development in the broadest sense would be sacrificed if inflation were left to spiral upward. 4. What is currently happening to inflation, growth and employment? It is by now well-known that the South African government has set a target of 3 to 6 per cent for CPIX inflation. In 2002, the actual outcome was 10 per cent. While disappointing, this outcome was not unexpected in the light of the 34 per cent depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand during 2001. It fed higher rand prices for imported products into the inflation spiral. In order to brake these inflationary forces, the Reserve Bank therefore raised its repurchase rate on 4 occasions from January to September 2002, on each occasion by 100 basis points. The 2001 depreciation of the rand was fairly soon reflected in production prices. Twelve-month production price inflation accelerated from a low point of 7,8 per cent in September 2001 to a double-digit rate of 11,5 per cent in January 2002 and eventually reached a maximum of 15,4 per cent in both August and September 2002. Consumer prices tend to lag a bit behind production prices, and this is 
 BIS Review 13/2003 3 indeed what happened again: Twelve-month CPIX inflation accelerated from a low point of 5,8 per cent in September 2001 to double-digit rates from August 2002 and recorded a recent highest level of 12,7 per cent in November 2002. Food prices played an important role in this process. At the production price level twelve-month food price inflation peaked at around 30 per cent, while at the consumer level it peaked at around 20 per cent. For key food items like maize, Southern African production fell below demand, driving prices towards import parity - which meant very high levels in rand terms during most of the past 18 months, given what had happened to the exchange rate. But year-on-year inflation rates can be deceptive, making it worthwhile to also analyse shorter-term price movements. One way of doing so is to calculate the percentage change from quarter to quarter in the relevant price index, and then to annualise it. Calculated in this way, production price inflation shot up to 25,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2002, but receded during the course of the year to only 5,0 per cent in the fourth quarter. Consumer prices were much more sticky; annualised CPIX inflation on balance accelerated from 11,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2002 to 14,5 per cent in the final quarter. By January 2003, however, the month-to-month rate of CPIX inflation reflected some moderation flowing through from some of the slowdown in production prices; it receded to an annualised rate of 6,0 per cent. At that time the recent appreciation of the rand had swung the month-to-month rate of production price inflation around to an annualised rate of decline of 6,4 per cent. It is not only in Japan where prices can decline! But I should hasten to add that there is no comparison between Japan's long-term price deflation and South Africa's short-term decline in production prices which is so closely related to exchange rate movements.  How do inflation prospects look going forward? To some extent this has already been dealt with in the Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy Review of October 2002. It projected that CPIX inflation would peak towards the end of 2002 (which it did), and then would decline fairly dramatically during the course of 2003 (which also seems to be in progress). The disciplined monetary policy stance and continued sound control over the government finances were already set to reign in the inflation spiral, and are now receiving some additional help from the relatively strong exchange rate - stronger than had been incorporated in the central scenario of the October 2002 projections. New projections will of course be tabled at the forthcoming Monetary Policy Committee meeting, to be held on 19 and 20 March. Some downward rigidity in inflation should always be expected with various ratchet effects, sticky nontradeables' prices and the like, but the resolve of the MPC to steer inflation through difficult terrain to within the 6 to 3 per cent target range should not be underestimated.  Doing all the right things and the things right as far as macroeconomic policy is concerned, with enhanced stability, clear medium-term policy frameworks, and adequate transparency and accountability, confidence is growing and fixed investment expenditure is rising. Furthermore, the rising investment expenditure is spread over many industries. This bodes well for future growth. The transition from volatile real GDP growth that did not quite match population growth in the 1980s to more consistent growth of around 3 per cent per annum in recent years is very significant. As the consistent track record grows, the athlete is likely to graduate to the stage where 3 per cent is much too pedestrian. Declining employment numbers have since 1989 been recorded in the core formal sectors of the South African economy. These numbers are not comprehensive; while it inter alia includes government, manufacturing and mining, it for instance doesn't include industries such as computer programming. But it is broad enough to make it worthwhile to note that core formal sector employment turned around in the second quarter of last year, growing at an annualised rate of 1,8 per cent, followed by 2,4 per cent in the third quarter. While two swallows do not make a summer, it nevertheless represents good news.  5. A note on lags in monetary policy In monetary policy formulation we are acutely aware of the long and variable lags inherent in monetary policy. We have to assess the current economic situation and economic problems at hand as comprehensively and quickly as possible. And we cannot simply look out of the window like a rain forecaster to get an initial feel for the situation. A huge amount of statistical work, including large-scale surveys of economic agents in various sectors, has to be done to get the facts on the table. Then we have to decide which policy instruments to use and to what extent. Utilising inputs from economic researchers, the Monetary Policy Committee deliberates on issues and after thorough debate takes a decision. Next we have to implement those instrument changes. With operational 
 4 BIS Review 13/2003 departments that are well-geared, this element of monetary policy is usually quick and clean. But then, of course, the economy has to respond to the new instrument settings. Many things can only be speeded up to a certain point. Even with the utmost dedication and effort, a comprehensive picture of the economic situation can only be tabled about two months after the end of the quarter concerned, although many individual bits of information are available and are analysed earlier on. The MPC process itself is fairly quick, taking two days. Monetary policy changes can generally be implemented almost immediately. The really frustrating part is the "outside lag". This is generally held to be about 18 to 24 months. When the MPC senses an imminent acceleration in inflation and raises interest rates to counter it, private sector banks usually raise their own interest rates within days. However, with so many transactions already irrevocably in the pipeline and with many economic agents not very sensitive to interest rates, credit extension and expenditure are slow to react. Eventually they do, of course. It is usually only at that time, when expenditure slows down significantly, that price and wage setters start to discover real resistance to further increases. It could easily be 18 months or longer from when policy interest rates are raised to when it fully works through and moderates the inflation rate.  In this world of long lags, credible inflation targeting seems a useful mechanism to shorten the outside lag and perhaps moderate the magnitude of the interest rate changes required to achieve a particular outcome. If there is no doubt that the authorities are committed to the inflation target and will in the end prevail, economic agents are likely to set their prices and wages at levels readily reconcilable with the inflation target, and are likely to view deviations from the target as temporary. Less interest rate medicine is likely to be required with such a forward-looking expectations formation process. Less sacrifice would therefore be required to get to the inflation target range and to remain there. But this could only work if the central bank is fully committed to the inflation target, is independent and willing to use its policy instruments to the full extent needed, and if all economic agents know this. In cricket, one-day games have risen in popularity as the tempo of life has accelerated. Most people simply do not have five days to watch the traditional kind of match. So things have been speeded up; without it, the Cricket World Cup tournament would have taken ages to complete. It seems preferable to also speed up the tempo at which inflation unwinds and returns to our 6 to 3 per cent target range, working along the lines of the forward-looking expectations process described previously. While I have no doubt at all regarding the Reserve Bank's independence and commitment to achieving the inflation target, the lag structure in economic agents' response will be most interesting. May we have a one-day match rather than a marathon! 6. Conclusion Low inflation and financial stability support sustainable economic growth, development, equity and employment creation. They are not in opposition to it. While some short-term trade-offs cannot be denied, allowing inflation to take root has dire long-term consequences. CPIX inflation is already in deceleration mode, and the Reserve Bank will vigorously ensure that it ends up in the 6 to 3 per cent target range. Thank you. 
 BIS Review 13/2003 1 David Dodge: Meeting global challenges - the importance of sound economic policies Remarks by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Canada-UK Chamber of Commerce, London, UK, 12 March 2003.  *      *      * I am delighted to be in London to speak with you today.  We are facing a time of great economic and political uncertainty. While economic activity is close to potential in Canada, most other countries are facing very weak demand and lacklustre economic prospects. And, of course, there is the overriding prospect of a war in Iraq.  Voltaire said that "doubt is not a pleasant condition, but certainty is an absurd one." We policy-makers are rarely burdened with certainty at the best of times, and definitely not these days! In an environment as unsettled as this one, it is easy to become preoccupied with the here and now. But, during such times, it is even more important that we remain focused on the medium-term goals of macroeconomic policy. And that's what we're trying to do in Canada.  Many of my colleagues at international meetings this year have commented on Canada's economic strength. It is true that we've had some good luck. But Canada's strong performance during the past two or three difficult years for the world economy primarily reflects extraordinary efforts made during the 1990s to get our macroeconomic framework - that is, our monetary and fiscal policies - right.  Canada, of course, was not alone in making these efforts. During the 1980s, a consensus developed among OECD nations on the combination of policies most likely to deliver sound economic performance. The consensus grew out of the unhappy experiences of earlier policy experiments. And it was built around four key principles: trade liberalization, structural reform, fiscal prudence, and low and stable inflation.  These four principles work like the four legs of a chair. The chair is steadier when all four legs are equally sturdy. Similarly, an economy is more stable when progress is made on all four policy fronts. And when one of the legs starts to weaken, the best way to restore stability is to build that leg back up, not to cut down the other three.  Canadians spent a great deal of effort over the past decade or so putting the four elements of this policy framework into place. It involved considerable short-term economic pain. But the phrase "short-term pain for long-term gain" is more than just a cliché. Canada is now receiving the economic payoff from this effort. Since 1997, our economy has consistently exceeded the average growth rates of the world's most industrialized countries. And it is expected to do so again this year.  The first principle: trade liberalization  Let me briefly review those four principles and the progress that Canada has made on each. I'll start with the principle of trade liberalization. We all know that freer international trade helps countries to more fully exploit the gains that come from increased specialization and greater productivity and competitiveness. Canada's economy made some difficult adjustments to freer trade during the late 1980s and early 1990s. First, we signed the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement, which came into effect in 1989. Then, in 1994, Mexico joined the group through the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Both of these agreements sparked a great deal of political controversy. And many Canadian companies were understandably anxious to avoid increased competition. As well, the Free Trade Agreement came into effect at a time when monetary policy was tight, to fight the high inflation rates of the day.  Despite initial misgivings, Canadian companies rose to the challenge of increased competition. Some of the sectors that we used to protect the most - such as furniture, clothing, and wine - have since established a strong presence in international markets. Overall, Canadian exports have flourished under these agreements.  
 2 BIS Review 13/2003 And that strengthens our resolve to see freer trade extended beyond regional trading blocs. Canada is hoping to see meaningful progress at the World Trade Organization's Doha round of multilateral talks. Clearly, agriculture is going to be a major hurdle. The developed countries, including all of us in the G-7, have a considerable way to go in terms of liberalizing agricultural trade. And there are other sectors where major effort is required. This effort must be made so that the global economy can benefit. It won't be easy but, in the long run, it will be worth it.  The second principle: structural reform  Complementing trade liberalization is the second principle, which focuses on the need to improve the structure of national economies. The goal here is twofold: first, to increase the flexibility of our economies to adjust to changing world economic conditions; and second, to ensure the longer-run viability of our social - and income - security arrangements.  Structural adjustments are always difficult because reforms will affect various groups in differing and often painful ways. Further, the economic benefits of increased flexibility may take a fairly long time to emerge. But these difficulties should not sway us from the task of reducing rigidities and increasing efficiency.  Canada has made some progress on a number of fronts. For example, governments have taken steps to reduce distortions in the personal income tax system, and have implemented a goods and services tax to replace the outdated tax on manufacturers. Unemployment insurance benefits were also reduced and restructured to strengthen the incentive to work.  Another important structural reform was to our public pension system. In 1996, Canadian federal and provincial governments agreed to changes that would put the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans on a sustainable footing. This meant some restructuring of benefits and a sharp increase in contributions - moves that were as unpopular as they were necessary.  The surpluses in the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans now represent almost 1 per cent of GDP. Furthermore, these surpluses are set aside in special funds that cannot be touched by governments for general use. The assets of the public plan are now managed by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, a body that is entirely independent of government. Its sole mandate is to invest the contributions in markets, in order to generate the best possible returns, consistent with prudence, over the long term.  The third principle: fiscal prudence  This leads me to the next principle, which relates to fiscal policy and the need for a more disciplined approach to managing the public purse. Fiscal policy must be guided by the principle of putting the ratio of public debt to GDP on a sustainable, downward track.  In Canada's experience, this was a difficult hurdle to overcome. To be sure, the fiscal consolidation of the 1990s was painful. I was federal Deputy Minister of Finance at that time, and I can tell you that many difficult and unpopular decisions had to be taken. Equally important, the provinces had to make tough choices as they reduced their public spending and restored their fiscal health. But as difficult as those years were, waiting would only have made matters worse.  Well, here's the good news: the vicious circle of rising deficits and debt has become a virtuous circle of balanced budgets and falling debt. Reducing the deficit in the 1990s helped Canada's international credibility. This led to a reduction in the risk premium demanded by international investors. The fiscal improvement meant that the Bank of Canada was able to lower interest rates more easily when economic circumstances warranted. Not only did lower interest rates reduce debt-servicing costs, they also stimulated economic growth, which brought in more revenues to the government. The extra revenues and lower debt-servicing costs, in turn, led to an even better fiscal position. At the end of 2002, Canada's total government surplus represented just over 1 per cent of GDP - not including the surplus in the pension plans.  Last month, Finance Minister John Manley announced a fifth consecutive surplus in the federal budget and projected that the budget will continue to be in a balanced position or better for the next three years. The budget maintained the fiscal planning framework of previous years. That framework includes a $3 billion contingency reserve, which is used to reduce debt if it is not needed. It also 
 BIS Review 13/2003 3 includes $1 billion in the upcoming budget year for additional economic prudence, and $2 billion in the following year, as further assurance that Canada won't fall back into deficit.  Canada is expected to have one of the lowest debt burdens in the G-7 this year. Not only have we reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio, but we have paid down almost $50 billion of federal debt. This has led to the restoration of Canada's Triple-A credit rating and has freed up about $3 billion of resources every year for the federal government. The main point is that while the initial work of fiscal consolidation is certainly difficult, it is necessary in order to enjoy the dividends later on.  The fourth principle: low and stable inflation  The fourth principle relates to monetary policy - the responsibility of the Bank of Canada. This principle recognizes that, over the medium term, monetary policy should work to keep inflation low, stable, and predictable.  Let me explain how we do this. Since 1991, following a joint agreement with the federal government, the Bank of Canada has operated with a system of inflation-control targets. I don't plan to spend a lot of time explaining our system to this audience, because the United Kingdom adopted a system very similar to ours a couple of years after we did.  We aim to keep consumer price inflation at the 2 per cent midpoint of a 1 to 3 per cent range. If the trend of inflation moves away from the target in either direction, the Bank will take action so that inflation returns to the target within 18 to 24 months.  Canada's inflation-targeting framework works in a symmetrical way, minimizing the chances of both a sustained upward drift in inflation and the threat of deflation. Indeed, through most of the past decade, we have managed to keep inflation around the 2 per cent target midpoint. And so, Canadians' expectations for inflation have become firmly anchored around 2 per cent. This climate of low, stable, and predictable inflation has helped to smooth out the ups and downs in the economy and to create the best possible environment for longer-term economic growth in Canada.  Inflation and the economic outlook  Let me now give you the Bank of Canada's views on the state of the Canadian economy and the outlook. First, a bit of history. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, the Bank of Canada, like other major central banks, moved quickly and aggressively to cut its policy interest rate to shore up confidence. That dramatic monetary policy action helped a great deal. By the spring of 2002, it became evident that our economy hadn't been knocked off track by the events of 11 September. Indeed, evidence was starting to build that the economy was growing faster than its production potential, taking up the remaining small amount of economic slack. So, we raised our key policy rate three times between April and July, by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point.  But by late last summer, we were seeing the effects of financial headwinds, geopolitical uncertainties, and continued weakness in the global economy. These factors remained in play through the autumn. As a result, we refrained from raising interest rates, even though inflation was accelerating.  Our initial analysis was that this increase in inflation would be temporary. However, both core and total CPI inflation remain well above target. This reflects the impact of higher-than-expected prices for crude oil and natural gas, continuing increases in auto insurance premiums, and price pressures in certain sectors, such as housing, food, and some services. The higher inflation also suggests an underlying firmness in the price-setting environment. In other words, relative price increases wouldn't be pushing up trend inflation if there was not sufficient demand.  Indeed, final domestic demand - especially household spending - has remained robust. However, economic growth in Canada moderated in the final three months of 2002, largely because of weaker exports - most notably, a decline in automotive shipments to the United States.  Even with this slowing growth in the fourth quarter, upward revisions for previous quarters leave the level of economic activity slightly higher than we had been monitoring. In fact, Canada's economy remains near full capacity.  Let me list some of the indicators that support this view: high industrial capacity utilization; near record-high labour force participation rates; a record-high employment-to-population ratio; corporate 
 4 BIS Review 13/2003 profits at their highest level since early 2001; and, as I said a few moments ago, above-target trend inflation.  While we continue to foresee growth somewhat below potential in the first half of this year, we expect increased demand in the second half of 2003 and into 2004, as global uncertainties diminish. But with an appropriate reduction in the amount of monetary stimulus, we see the level of output remaining close to capacity during this year and into 2004.  So, in making our interest rate decision on 4 March, we weighed the following considerations: domestic inflation pressures, the expectation that Canadian economic activity will remain near potential in 2003 despite geopolitical uncertainties, the stimulative stance of monetary policy, and improved conditions in capital markets. Taking all of these factors into account, the Bank raised its key policy rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 3 per cent.  Even with this increase, the stance of monetary policy remains stimulative. Thus, over time, further reductions in monetary stimulus will be required to return inflation to the target over the medium term. But, as we have said, the timing and pace of increases in policy interest rates will continue to depend on a number of considerations. These include the strength of demand pressures; the evolution of inflation expectations; the impact on confidence of geopolitical and global economic uncertainties; and the way in which developments in the Middle East affect demand and inflation, both globally and in Canada. The Bank will continue to closely monitor all of these factors.  *********************** Let me conclude. At the beginning of my talk today, I noted that, for over a decade now, Canada has followed a policy based on the four key principles: trade liberalization, structural reform, fiscal prudence, and inflation control. It's never easy to follow those principles, but, over the medium term, they do lead to better economic performance.  Canada's recent economic record is evidence of that. We have maintained an enviable growth performance through what has been a very difficult period for the world economy. We remain optimistic - and so do others - that we will continue to do so. Both the OECD and the IMF predict that Canada's economy will outperform those of other G-7 countries this year.  But these are difficult times. Significant geopolitical and global economic uncertainties continue to overhang the economic outlook for all countries. It is during times like these that policy-makers may be tempted to put the four principles aside and focus instead on short-term economic problems.  In Canada, we have learned that it is by sticking to these principles that we create economic structures that can withstand turmoil. The four policy principles have proven to be the most effective tools for meeting the challenges of a very uncertain world.  
 BIS Review 12/2003 1 Bank of Japan’s March report of recent economic and financial developments1 Bank of Japan, 6 March 2003. *      *      * The Bank’s View2 Economic activity remains flat amid substantial uncertainty about the outlook for the economy. With regard to final demand, while business fixed investment has been virtually level, private consumption continues to be weak. Moreover, housing investment remains sluggish and public investment is declining. While domestic demand has yet to show signs of recovery, both exports and imports are increasing at a very modest pace with net exports remaining virtually level.  Industrial production continues to be basically level in response to these developments in final demand. As for the employment situation, new job offers are on a gradual rising trend. In addition, the number of employees, which covers various types of employees including non-regular employees such as temporary workers, appears to be declining at a slower pace. However, firms are still maintaining their stance on reducing personnel expenses, and household income continues to decrease significantly due mainly to an ongoing decline in wages. Thus, the employment and income situation of households overall remains severe. Turning to the economic outlook, a widely shared view of the prospect for overseas economies in 2003 is that, partly due to the continued firmness in Asian economies, they will follow a gradual recovery path. However, their recovery is likely to be anemic, at least for the time being, given the sluggish improvement in the U.S. economy and further weakness in European economies. In this situation, the increase in exports is expected to remain very modest, and industrial production is likely to be more or less unchanged for the immediate future.  With respect to domestic demand, public investment is projected to follow a declining trend, and private consumption is likely to remain weak for some time due to the severe employment and income situation. Business fixed investment is expected to be supported by the improvement in corporate profits to date, but is unlikely to recover clearly for the time being due mainly to substantial uncertainty regarding overseas economies.  Overall, assuming that overseas economies will recover in 2003, albeit only at a moderate pace, the increase in exports will accelerate and the uptrend in production will resume sooner or later, which in turn will initiate the momentum for a recovery. However, the economy is unlikely to show clear signs of recovery for some time, since production is expected to be virtually unchanged for the time being while downward pressures such as excessive labor input and debt persist. Furthermore, the downside risk to the economic outlook for overseas economies continues to require attention, given that there are some uncertain factors including geopolitical developments and their economic implications. On the domestic side, stock prices are weak. Hence, careful monitoring is required of progress in the resolution of the nonperforming-loan problem and its effects on stock prices, corporate finance, and the economy.  On the price front, import prices are on a rising trend with some fluctuations, reflecting developments in prices of overseas commodities such as crude oil. Domestic corporate goods prices have been declining gradually on the whole with the continued fall in machinery prices, despite the rise in import prices and the improved supply-demand balance in materials industries. Consumer prices and corporate services prices have also been declining gradually.  Looking at the conditions influencing price developments, import prices are projected to be firm for the time being due mainly to developments in crude oil prices. On the other hand, factors such as the ongoing technological innovations in machinery and the streamlining of distribution channels will continue to push prices downward. Meanwhile, the overall state of supply and demand is expected to                                                       1  This report is based on data and information available at the time of the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting held on March 4 and 5, 2003. 2  The Bank’s view of recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on March 4 and 5, 2003 as the basis for monetary policy decisions. 
  continue exerting downward pressure on prices, with domestic demand continuing to be weak for a while. However, the low levels of inventories and the improvement in the supply-demand balance in materials industries will support prices in corporate transactions. Against this background, the decline in domestic corporate goods prices is likely to be mitigated in the near term. The pace of year-on-year decline in consumer prices is expected to become somewhat slower, as medical costs are projected to rise from April due to public insurance reforms.  As for the financial environment, the outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank of Japan is recently moving at around 20 trillion yen, as the Bank provides ample liquidity. Under these circumstances, in the money markets the overnight call rate continues to hover at very close to zero percent. Moreover, longer-term interest rates continue to be at low levels on the whole, and the markets remain steady to date as the fiscal year-end approaches. Yields on long-term government bonds declined again to the range of 0.7-0.8 percent after moving in the range of 0.8-0.9 percent until mid-February. Yield spreads between private bonds (bank bonds and corporate bonds) and government bonds are contracting slightly. Stock prices are weakening slightly reflecting the heightened uncertainty about geopolitical developments and uncertainty regarding the domestic economic outlook. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average is recently moving at the 8,000-8,500 yen level. In the foreign exchange market, the yen is currently traded in the range of 117-119 yen to the U.S. dollar, as the dollar continues to be weak due mainly to greater tension in the Middle East.  With regard to corporate finance, private banks remain cautious in extending loans to firms with high credit risks while they continue to be more active in extending loans to blue-chip companies. The lending attitudes of financial institutions as perceived by firms, particularly small ones, are severe. In the corporate bond and CP markets, the issuing environment for firms with high credit ratings is accommodative, but the environment for firms with low credit ratings is severe. Credit demand in the private sector continues to follow a downtrend mainly because business fixed investment remains sluggish and firms are continuously reducing their debts. Amid these developments, private banks’ lending continues to decline by about 2-3 percent on a year-on-year basis. The amount outstanding of corporate bonds and CP issued is moving at around the previous year’s level.  Meanwhile, according to business surveys, financial positions of firms, particularly those of small firms, remain severe. The year-on-year growth rate of the monetary base is around 10-15 percent. The year-on-year growth rate of the money stock is around 2.0 percent.  Funding costs for firms continue to be at extremely low levels on the whole. Against the above background, the financial developments are summarized as follows. Money market conditions continue to be extremely easy. Long-term interest rates are declining slightly. The money stock and the monetary base maintain high growth rates relative to that of economic activity as a whole. However, stock prices remain weak. In corporate finance, the fund-raising environment of firms with low credit risks is accommodative on the whole, but with regard to firms with high credit risks, the stance of investors is severe and the lending attitudes of private banks continue to be cautious. Developments in the financial and capital markets, the behavior of financial institutions, and the situation of corporate finance continue to require close monitoring. 
 BIS Review 12/2003 1 Ishrat Husain: Strategy for development of Microfinance in Pakistan Remarks delivered by Dr Ishrat Husain, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, as Chief Guest at the launching ceremony of the Financial Sector strengthening program of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, Islamabad, 26 February 2003.  *      *      * I would like to commend the Swiss Government and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) for launching the Financial Sector Strengthening Program (FSSP). I believe that the lack of adequate human and institutional capacity, shortage of local expertise and weak coordination among the various stakeholders are indeed the factors inhibiting the growth of microfinance sector in Pakistan. The initiative taken by SDC to overcome these constraints is therefore both timely and appropriate. But I do expect that once the FSSP has successfully demonstrated the business model for capacity building it will be adapted and internalized by our own network without any further recourse to external donors. The transfer of technology and its adaptation to our own circumstances is the most effective way to utilize external resources. At the outset let me place microfinance in the overall context of the efforts the State Bank is making to expand the outreach of financial services and help the goal of poverty alleviation in the country. The SBP is, in addition to microfinance, encouraging the provision of credit to small and medium entrepreneurs through a newly set up SME Bank, to small farmers through a newly restructured Zarai Taraqqati Bank Ltd and Cooperative Banks, to women entrepreneurs, individuals and small firms through the First Women’s Bank. These institutions will work as the protype in developing the methodology and expertise in these areas and then this protype will be replicated through the mainstream financial institutions in the country. This is the only durable basis through which the poor can benefit from financial sector of the country. Pakistan has adopted a sectoral approach to microfinance in Pakistan and assimilated learnings from the experience of other developing countries which have been active in this area for decades. Microfinance is still in its infancy and has a long way to go. Some momentum has been built up during the last three years as bulk of the disbursements has taken place since June, 1999. Although there has been a big spurt in these three years the numbers of the beneficiaries and the volume of credit disbursed is still quite low in relation to the needs and demand of the intended target group. We have therefore decided to adopt a holistic, “let thousand flowers bloom”, and inclusive strategy for promotion and spread of microfinance in Pakistan. This strategy consists of the following six elements. First, there is a strong political commitment towards supporting microfinance as an integral tool of poverty alleviation program. President of Pakistan has taken keen personal interest in the nurturing and growth of this sector and has directed the Ministry of Finance to monitor and track the microfinance sector on a regular basis. The Government has invited the World Bank, ADB and other bilateral donors to actively assist us in this sector. Consequently the enabling environment for development and growth of MF is highly conducive. The constraints, snags and problems faced during the implementation of the program are removed in consultation and full involvement of the stakeholders. Second, the program involves multiple actors and institutions - community organizations, NGOs, public sector, private sector, Rural Support programs - in the delivery of microfinance. The extent of poverty prevailing in Pakistan requires ‘all hands - on the deck’ approach rather than and exclusive monopoly of the Government or the public sector as has been the case in the past. Khushali Bank is owned by several leading financial institutions - private, public and foreign - rather than by the Government of Pakistan. This has allowed it to function in a professional manner. Third, the complementarities between microfinance and other elements of poverty alleviation such as Investment, Infrastructure, Social services and Capacity building are clearly recognized and built in the program. Income generation by the poor cannot take place only through availability of credit if there is no infrastructure, or markets for selling their produce. Similarly without building the knowledge base and enlarging capacity of the poor there won’t be any scope for sustainable microfinance. Fourth, the government is experimenting with a variety of institutional models for delivery mechanisms and outreach to the poor. For example, we have a wholesale organization such as PPAF which is successfully disbursing a $ 100 million line of credit provided by the World Bank. We have Khushali 
  Bank which is a retail bank and has already reached out to 100,000 customers and is targeted at 700,000 by 2007. Then there is First Mcirofinance Bank established in the private sector which is expanding its branch network throughout the country. We have integrated program vehicles such as the NRSP, PRSP etc. which combine Microcredit with other services. There are several single product Microfinance NGOs such as Kashif Foundation in Lahore. Two commercial banks are also providing lines of credit for microfinance. Leasing companies have also begun to take some interest and two of them are already engaged in the sector. In addition there are several self standing donor supported projects delivering microfinance. We don’t know as to which particular delivery mechanism will be effective and that is why there is a need to experiment with plurality and diversity. Fifth, an innovative feature of the Microfinance Sector Development is that as the poor segments of the population are much more prone and vulnerable to shocks they need to be protected. Thus a bad harvest or drought or strikes in the cities or violence completely wipe out the earning capacity of the poor and disable them from repaying their credit obligations on time. As labor is their only asset and the returns on labor are disrupted for no fault of theirs a risk mitigation mechanism had to be created to insulate the poor borrowers from these unforeseen hazards. A Risk Mitigation and Deposit Protection Fund has been created to provide protection to the MFIs borrowers and depositors. They can seek recourse to this fund under adverse circumstances beyond their control. Sixth, the regulatory regime adopted by the SBP for Microfinance sector is that of a facilitator, guide and problem solver. We do not prescribe for MFIs the same onerous regulations which prevail for other financial institutions. We have a light regulatory oversight and are learning together with the practitioners and adopting ourselves to the changing circumstances. We have a Consultative Group drawn from the representatives of stakeholders who guide us in the development of our regulations and prudential norms. To conclude, the strategy for microfinance development will undergo continuous review and modification to make it responsive to the needs of the poor. The government, State Bank, NGOs and all other MF practitioners have to work together to make this strategy work and accelerate the speed with which we can reach out to the potential beneficiaries. On the part of the SBP I can assure you our full commitment and support to this strategy. We look forward to working together with you in these endeavors. 
 BIS Review 12/2003 1 Ingimundur Friðriksson: Monetary policy and the current monetary situation Address by Mr Ingimundur Friðriksson, Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland, to a civic club meeting in Reykjavík, 26 February 2003. *      *      * The framework for monetary policy in Iceland was altered decisively in March 2001. The government and the Central Bank issued a joint declaration adopting inflation targeting as the mainstay of monetary policy and abandoning the fixed exchange rate policy which had been followed for just over a decade. To begin with, a relatively narrow target band was set in the previous regime for the reference exchange rate of 2¼% in either direction around the central value for the króna. This was widened in two stages, to end up as a 9% deviation in either direction early in 2000. During this period, price stability was the principal objective of monetary policy and a stable exchange rate was an intermediate target. Since the adoption of inflation targeting, the Central Bank’s inflation forecast could be said to have actually served as an intermediate target of monetary policy, with the ultimate objective price stability. Inflation targeting has established itself in many countries in recent years and has formed the backbone of monetary policy, for instance, in the UK, Sweden, Norway and New Zealand, with good results in each case. In May of 2001 the Icelandic parliament Althingi unanimously adopted a new Central Bank Act, which entailed extensive changes from the previous legislation. Taking into consideration innovations in central bank legislation in other countries, this Act consolidated the new inflation targeting policy. The most significant change from the earlier legislation was to set a single, principal objective for the Central Bank, i.e. to promote price stability. The Bank was also granted the independence to apply its instruments in order to achieve this objective. Furthermore, it was assigned the task of maintaining Iceland’s foreign exchange reserve and fostering an efficient and reliable financial system, i.e. financial stability. The Act also stipulated that the treasury may not borrow from the Central Bank. Specific requirements were set out concerning transparency and accountability towards both the government and the public. For example, the Bank is now obliged to publicly account for its monetary policy and for monetary and exchange rate developments and its actions in these areas at least quarterly.  The principal objective of current Central Bank monetary policy, as stated in the joint declaration issued by the Bank and the government in March 2001, is to keep inflation as close as possible to 2½%. Should inflation deviate from this target by more than 1½ percentage points in either direction, the Bank is to provide the government with a written public account explaining what has caused this deviation, how the Bank intends to respond and how long it expects that it will take for inflation to once again return to within the targeted inflation limits.  The Central Bank has only one instrument at its disposal to achieve this objective: interest rates. The significant interest rate here is that used in the Bank’s repurchase transactions with credit institutions, sometimes referred to as the Central Bank’s policy interest rate. Such transactions in fact represent the Bank’s liquidity facility for these institutions. The commercial and savings banks subsequently set their own rates of interest, having regard to the Central Bank’s policy rate, and short-term market interest rates generally change in phase with the Central Bank rate. If other factors remain constant, changes in the Central Bank interest rate also affect long-term interest rates, but here other aspects also enter the picture. The response of these rates to changes in the Central Bank rate is therefore not always predictable and tends to occur with a certain time lag.  Inflation forecasting plays a crucial role in Central Bank policy. It produces four forecasts annually, which are published in its quarterly Monetary Bulletin. The inflation forecast extends just over two years into the future, on a quarter-by-quarter basis. As in other countries, interest rate changes by the Central Bank take quite some time to have an impact throughout the economy. This makes it necessary to have a forward-looking policy, with the inflation forecast based on state-of-the-art methodologies. In addition to its inflation forecast, the Central Bank publishes a quarterly assessment of the economic and monetary situation and prospects, including a national economic forecast, and their probable impact on price level developments. If inflation looks likely to exceed the Bank’s target limits in a long-term perspective, the Bank will raise its policy interest rate, or cut this rate if inflation is heading below the target limit.  In preparing its inflation forecasts and regular assessment of the economic situation and outlook, the Central Bank examines a wide variety of indicators. These include both statistical data and information 
  obtained from interviews with representatives of industry, special interest groups, credit institutions and others. Much of this statistical data is available on the Bank’s website.  Decisions by the Central Bank’s Board of Governors are made following in-depth examination of these indicators, based on the Bank’s evaluation of the situation and prospects, the premises behind the inflation forecast and the inflation forecast itself. In accordance with the provisions of the Act which entered into force in the spring of 2001, the Board adopted internal rules on the preparation of, arguments for and presentation of its monetary policy decisions. The rules were formally approved at the beginning of 2002 and published in the quarterly Monetary Bulletin. The inflation target adopted in March 2001 removed the earlier fluctuation bands set for the ISK exchange rate and the exchange rate was floated. The new monetary policy framework was introduced under rather difficult conditions, with a sliding exchange rate and mounting inflation. It is fair to say that the tight monetary stance is the main reason that inflation receded as sharply as it did in 2002. Experience has shown that the monetary policy passed this demanding trial with flying colours and no one should any longer doubt its value for the Icelandic economy. It works in Iceland just as it does everywhere else. The Central Bank responded to imminent inflationary pressure by raising its interest rates in 1998 and still further in 1999 and 2000. The interest rate increase served to reduce excess demand in the economy and the ISK exchange rate rose, thus slowing increases to the consumer price index (CPI) in an overheated economy. Early in 2000 the fluctuation bands for the króna were widened, in part because the previous limits were then felt to be restraining the rising exchange rate, which was regarded as necessary to counter inflationary pressure. The exchange rate peaked in the spring of 2000, when it was just over 12% higher than at present.  Market expectations changed in the spring of 2000, and the exchange rate began a downward trend. There are no doubt various explanations as to why this occurred but probably the major factors were concern at a sizeable current account deficit and the resulting enormous need for foreign financing, together with Icelandic investments in foreign securities during that same year, not least by pension funds. The downward exchange rate slide lasted until late November 2001. Several times during the period from mid-2000 until well into 2001, the Central Bank intervened in the currency market in an attempt to prevent a further decrease in the exchange rate. The Bank intervened in particular when a downward spiral seemed to be forming, or when the Bank felt that its intervention could have a positive effect in changing market expectations. This was based in part on the Bank’s conclusion that the exchange rate had already dropped more than was reconcilable with long-term equilibrium in the economy. The Central Bank expended substantial sums in intervening on the foreign exchange market, over ISK 40 billion in total, without this sufficing to halt the slide of the króna. At best, it may have slowed the depreciation until the economy had cooled somewhat, and it also contributed to making the inflationary impact of the exchange rate drop less than it would otherwise have been. An article by Gerður Ísberg and Þórarinn G. Pétursson in this February’s issue of the Central Bank’s Monetary Bulletin describes the Bank’s actions on the foreign exchange market during 2000 and 2001 and assesses their impact. The article concludes definitively that at best the intervention had only short-term effect in each case and the market soon returned to its previous situation. In other words, their conclusion is that intervention on the foreign exchange market against strong prevailing currents has precious little effect unless accompanied by corresponding changes in the domestic interest rates. This is in full accord with the experience in other countries. In recent public discussion the claim has often been made that the exchange rate of the króna is far too high and that the Central Bank needs to take steps to bring it down again. The fact of the matter is that the Bank’s means of controlling the exchange rate are overestimated and the power of the market underestimated when the claim is made that the Central Bank can, through its actions, direct the króna to a specific level. The proposal has been made, for instance, that the Central Bank cut its interest rates substantially with the aim of lowering the exchange rate. In this context it should be pointed out that the Bank has cut its policy rate substantially, from 10.4% only a year ago (11.4% two years ago) to 5.3% at present. The Bank’s nominal policy rate has not been lower since 1994 and the real policy rate is at its lowest since 1996. The domestic and foreign interest rate differential has narrowed significantly. In addition, the Central Bank’s interest rate is now below the estimated equilibrium interest rate and thus has a stimulating effect on the economy. The impact of interest rate changes generally is only visible after a certain time lag, prompting one to conclude that the effect of the major decrease in interest rates during the past year has yet to be fully felt.  
  As is well known, the exchange rate for the króna plummeted in 2000 and 2001, and for quite some time was substantially below a level reconcilable with long-term equilibrium. This occurred at a time when the price of key exports was very high, making the years 2000 and 2001 especially favourable for the export sector and in fact also for import competing sectors. Enterprises in these sectors now understandably feel the effects of the rise in the exchange rate. It is not to be expected, however, that the same conditions will again arise in these sectors as prevailed, for example, during 2001 and in the early part of 2002. In this connection it could be mentioned that, based on the predictions on performance made by financial enterprises, the contribution margin in fisheries companies will be fairly good this year, although not as good as in 2001 and 2002, which were quite exceptional. In the February issue of its Monetary Bulletin, the Central Bank published an analysis of the proposed major construction projects in East Iceland1 and possible responses for economic management. The article concludes that unless economic counter-measures are taken, the projects will create overheating in the economy, inflation and instability. Although their scope will be considerable, the projects are not so large that economic stability cannot be preserved and inflation contained by means of appropriate responses in economic management. Mitigating measures would be most effective if they involved both monetary and fiscal restraint, as well as internal adjustment of the national economy, including a rise in the exchange rate. The more restraint shown on the fiscal side, the less need there will be to raise interest rates. A higher króna exchange rate also means less cause to raise interest rates. The exchange rate was fairly stable from the spring of 2002 until early this winter. It then began to rise and continued to do so steadily until early February of this year. The Central Bank has stated its view that the exchange rate rise in recent months has been primarily due to the effect of the proposed major construction projects in East Iceland. The operations of the aluminium smelter will likely cause the equilibrium exchange rate for the króna to be higher than otherwise. Furthermore, it appears evident that the influx of foreign currency in connection with these projects will be considerable, with higher domestic interest rates than otherwise. All of this affects market expectations and makes the króna exchange rate higher than it would be in the absence of plans for major development in East Iceland. The economy could thus be said to have already begun adaptation to the coming projects, i.e. the exchange rate adjustment has begun and is even well on its way.  In view of what has already been said, it is clear that industry and business in Iceland has to prepare itself for a higher exchange rate than would have been the case without this major development. It naturally demands careful management and cost-cutting in operations where required. As mentioned previously, the Central Bank of Iceland now practices inflation targeting intended to keep inflation as close as possible to 2½% per year. The Bank’s latest forecast predicts that inflation will be slightly below this mark during the next two years, or just over 2%. Following this forecast, the Bank cut its policy rate by 0.5 percentage points.. All other things being equal, this will mean that inflation will be slightly higher than that assumed in the forecast. Were interest rates to be lowered significantly from the current level, it would very likely set off a new wave of inflation and instability, which would be to the advantage of neither wage earners nor industry. As mentioned, there seems to be some overestimation of the possibility of the Central Bank to control the market rate of exchange. But, as was also pointed out, the Bank’s intervention on the foreign exchange market, expending large sums in 2000 and 2001, had only a short-lived effect. In this connection, it should also be noted that since last autumn the Central Bank has regularly purchased foreign currency in the domestic interbank market. When this decision was announced, it was stated that the Bank intended to purchase the equivalent of ISK 20 billion of currency by the end of 2003. To start with the Bank purchased USD 1.5 million on Mondays and Wednesdays each week. This January the Bank also began to purchase this same amount on Fridays as well, and in February purchases were added on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Currently the Bank thus purchases USD 7.5 million each week, or the equivalent of USD 390 million on a yearly basis. Even though the impact of these purchases on the exchange rate will likely be slight in the long term, as is generally the case with such intervention on the foreign exchange market, the króna rate will be somewhat lower for a while than would have otherwise been the case.                                                        1  Aluminium smelter and related power plants. 
  As was previously pointed out, the Central Bank spent the equivalent of ISK 40 billion to try and shore up the falling króna in the years 2000 and 2001. As a result, the Bank’s net external position worsened significantly and since that time its currency reserves have to a considerable extent been maintained with foreign short-term loans. The Bank’s plans to purchase the equivalent of ISK 20 billion in foreign currency, announced last autumn, involved paying off at least a major portion of short-term debt. This was also the primary purpose of the purchases. The decision on foreign currency purchasing was taken under completely different conditions than existed later in the winter when the major development projects in East Iceland changed from plans to reality. The Central Bank’s foreign currency reserves are currently ISK 36 billion (USD 460 million) and it could be argued that they need to be considerably greater. Considering the new circumstances and the altered outlook due to the expected major development and resulting influx of foreign currency, barring unexpected changes the Central Bank will very likely continue its regular purchases of foreign currency on the domestic interbank market even after reaching the ISK 20 billion point. By so doing the Bank would avail itself of the opportunity to boost its foreign currency reserves beyond that which would otherwise be practical.  Public discussion in recent weeks has been characterised by considerable criticism of the Central Bank and its monetary policy. From the Bank’s point of view, the debate seems a bit peculiar in some respects, not least because views have typically been attributed to it which have no basis in the writings, speeches or other statements issued by the Bank or its executives. As has been pointed out, people also seem to overrate the ability of the Central Bank to direct market developments, as well as to expect it to strive to achieve all sorts of objectives which it has practically no possibility of accomplishing, and which are in fact not part of its role, such as ensuring a certain exchange rate, full employment, etc. After the introduction of inflation targeting in 2001, the Central Bank has no specific objective as far as the exchange rate is concerned. This is in accordance with its policy of targeting inflation and a floating exchange rate. This has been interpreted to mean that the Bank is completely disinterested in developments in the exchange rate. This is not true. The exchange rate for the króna is very important, the events of the past year or two are more than sufficient indication of that. As the Bank has previously pointed out, the real exchange rate at present is not far from average over the past 20 years, nor much above the average of the past 10 years. The nominal exchange rate since the beginning of this year is in fact slightly lower than it was during the same months two years ago. The exchange rate for the króna is determined by the situation and strength of the national economy, external equilibrium and market expectations. The present exchange rate thus reflects to a considerable extent factors which the Central Bank can do little to influence. The large exchange rate fluctuation from 2000 to 2002 can be attributed to specific circumstances, and the exchange rate is unlikely to fluctuate as substantially in the immediate future as it did during this period. It should be borne in mind, however, that the nature of the Icelandic economy and its small size does mean that currency fluctuations as a rule will be greater than between the currencies of larger economies. In this connection, however, it can also be pointed out that the Euro lost more than one-quarter of its value against the US dollar from the beginning of 1999 until it bottomed out, and since that time has risen once more by just over one-fifth. The Central Bank is not unconcerned about the exchange rate, but has limited means of influencing its development, as has been explained. There is only so much the Bank can do to restrain currency fluctuations. A substantial lowering of interest rates could possibly force the exchange rate down somewhat, but this would mean sacrificing other and more important objectives for precious little gain. The joint declaration issued by the government and the Central Bank in March of 2001 states that the Bank will intervene in developments on the foreign exchange market through buying and selling foreign currency if it deems this to be necessary in order to achieve its inflation target, or if it is concerned that exchange rate fluctuations could threaten financial stability. There is no cause for so doing at present. As I mentioned, the primary objective of the Central Bank’s monetary policy is to foster price stability. Price stability is recognised to be a prerequisite for long-term economic growth and thus improved welfare. The Central Bank has lightened its monetary restraint substantially in recent months. In the course of ten months, the policy rate has been cut very significantly, resulting in a real policy rate which is lower now than it has been since 1996, as I mentioned. At the same time, the Bank has also given notice that further relaxation is envisaged in the form of lower required reserves by the Central Bank. The impact of the recent interest rate cuts has yet to be fully reflected in the economy. Although claims are frequently advanced that the real exchange rate for the króna is currently too high, the Central Bank cannot influence the real exchange rate except for a limited time. Too much relaxation of 
  monetary policy at present would only prepare the ground for the next period of over-expansion and inflation, with accordant instability.  As mentioned, the Central Bank announced an interest rate cut of 0.5 percentage points earlier this month and plans to relax reserve requirements. The announcement of the Bank’s decision also pointed out that there were opposing arguments as to whether and to what extent further relaxation of monetary restraint would be implemented. Following the announcement of the interest rate cut, the government announced its plans to allocate funding to various construction projects to support employment, with several local authorities following suit. Furthermore, it now appears likely that work will get underway this year on an enlargement to the Norðurál aluminium smelter and power developments linked to it. These factors will naturally be taken into consideration in decisions on monetary policy in the weeks and months to come. As I mentioned at the beginning, the framework of monetary policy was changed in 2001 with the introduction of inflation targeting. This is in line with international developments in recent years, resulting in Central Banks being entrusted with a single main objective, i.e. to promote price stability. Price stability was set as the primary objective of monetary policy because inflation is above all a monetary phenomenon. There is little point in setting objectives for monetary policy which it cannot achieve. Applying monetary policy to achieve price stability also contributes to economic stability. This, in turn, is a prerequisite for future growth in the economy and making the most efficient use of its scarce resources. Other public authorities, industry and interest groups also need to adapt their decisions to accord with this inflation targeting. 
 BIS Review 12/2003 1 Alan Greenspan: Global finance - is it slowing?  Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Bank of France International Symposium on Monetary Policy, Economic Cycle, and Financial Dynamics, Paris, France, (via satellite), 7 March 2003.  *      *      * For at least the past twenty years, the process of financial globalization has been rapidly advancing. The development of new financial products, notably a wide variety of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and the removal of many barriers to international capital mobility have tightened linkages among global financial markets. As a result, capital has flowed more freely across national borders in search of the highest risk-adjusted rates of return. At some point, globalization undoubtedly will reach maturity. Financial innovation will slow as we approach a world in which financial markets are complete in the sense that all financial risks can be efficiently transferred to those most willing to bear them. Equivalently, as institutional and legal impediments to cross-border flows are eliminated, the bias in the allocation of savings toward local investments will be reduced to its minimum, and the opportunity for arbitrage across national markets will disappear. In my lecture today, I will consider whether there are signs that globalization is nearing maturity. In particular, has the pace of financial innovation begun to slow? Do the patterns of capital flows suggest that global financial markets are approaching full integration? And, most important, what do the answers to these questions imply regarding the potential for future contributions of globalization to economic growth and financial stability? Has the Pace of Financial Innovation Begun to Slow? Although the pace of innovation cannot be measured with precision, important new instruments continue to emerge. Credit derivatives arose only in the early to mid-1990s. Still more recent has been the marriage of derivatives and securitization techniques in the form of synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments have broadened the range of investors willing to provide credit protection by pooling and unbundling credit risk through the creation of securities that best fit their preferences for risk and return. The combination of derivatives and securitization techniques is being applied to a growing range of underlying assets. Additionally, the way that OTC derivatives are traded and settled clearly could be significantly improved. Despite, or perhaps because of, the rapid pace of product development, the derivatives industry still executes trades predominantly by telephone and confirms them by fax. Systems for the electronic execution and confirmation of trades require a degree of standardization and a large measure of cooperation that are not required for developing new instruments. Still, the derivatives industry has a long history of cooperating to standardize documentation, and it is disappointing that so little progress has been made in adopting efficient and reliable means of executing and confirming trades. We must also consider how broadly the recent innovations have been adopted. Of course, the growth of OTC derivatives over the past twenty years has been spectacular and shows no obvious signs of abating. The latest estimate by the Bank for International Settlements of the worldwide notional amount of OTC derivatives outstanding reached $128 trillion in June 2002, a figure more than 25 percent larger than that recorded a year earlier. Such derivatives have become indispensable risk-management tools for many of the largest corporations. Yet a recent study drawing on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings indicated that, as of year-end 1997, only a little more than half of the 1,000 largest U.S. non-financial corporations used OTC or exchange-traded derivatives.1 More detailed, comprehensive and timely data are available for American banking organizations. Those data show that although the fifty largest U.S. banking organizations all used derivatives as of September                                                       1 See W. Guay and S.P. Kothari, “How Much Do Firms Hedge with Derivatives?” Journal of Financial Economics, forthcoming. 
  2002, only 5 percent of all U.S. banking firms used any type of derivative. In the case of OTC credit derivatives, which have proved to be particularly effective in risk management, a mere 0.2 percent of U.S. banking organizations have begun to use such tools. Even among the fifty largest, less than half use these instruments. Thus, judging from the data on the use of derivatives, the potential for financial innovation to have a broader impact and thereby to continue contributing to globalization appears considerable. Evidence of Financial Globalization in Capital Flows Implicit in the criterion for complete globalization that opportunities for cross-border arbitrage disappear is that global savings should flow irrespective of location to investment in projects with the highest risk-adjusted rate of return.2  A half-century ago, Harry Markowitz showed mathematically that an investor can reduce the variance, and hence the riskiness, of his portfolio for a given expected return by diversifying into assets with imperfectly correlated returns.3 Subsequent research showed that foreign assets are excellent candidates for diversification.4  Direct barriers to capital flows, such as restrictions on foreign purchases of domestic assets and limitations on the ability of domestic residents to invest abroad, have promoted home bias, although, as I will discuss shortly, many such direct obstacles in recent decades have been mitigated. Indirect barriers, such as high costs of foreign transactions, inadequate information on foreign investments and cultural and linguistic differences between foreign and domestic investors, are also seen as sustaining home bias. And finally, there are exchange rate and country risks. Wild swings in exchange rates can entirely erase earnings on foreign assets, even as those same assets yield a healthy return in local currencies. Concern over who will bear the exchange-rate risk or, alternatively, who will bear the costs of hedging that risk are an additional factor retarding international investment. Along with foreign exchange risk, political risk helps to drive a wedge between foreign and domestic perceptions of the expected risk-adjusted return to an asset. The consequence of such dual expectations is a lower market clearing price for those assets and a lower level of foreign investment than would exist in the absence of such distortions. Aside from any direct or indirect barriers, people seem to prefer to invest in familiar local businesses even though currency and country risks do not exist. The United States has no barriers to interstate investment, and the states share a common currency, culture, language, and legal system, yet studies have shown that individual investors and even professional money managers have a slight preference for investments in their own communities and states. Trust, so crucial an aspect of investing, is most likely to be fostered by the familiarity of local communities. Researchers have consistently found that, in general, investors direct too much of their savings domestically. Owing to risk aversion, they tend, to their own detriment, to over-discount foreign returns. Such suboptimal allocation of capital lowers living standards everywhere. In their seminal paper twenty years ago, Feldstein and Horioka pointed out that, on net, nations’ savings are generally invested domestically.5 Their research implies that global savings are inefficiently distributed to investment, meaning that savers are bearing too much risk for the returns they achieve and that countries with high-potential investment projects are getting less financing than                                                       2 Risk-neutral investors, if they exist, will price an asset solely on the basis of its expected return. But at best, very few humans are risk neutral. In general, investors require an asset’s price to be discounted below the risk-neutral price as compensation for bearing risk. The amount of compensation required will vary both with the actual riskiness, or variance, of the asset’s returns and with the investor’s degree of risk aversion. If familiarity reduces an investor’s uncertainty over expected returns to an asset, one would expect that that investor would discount unfamiliar assets more heavily than familiar assets. In such a case, differences between foreign and domestic investors’ familiarity with an investment would lead to under-investment by foreigners relative to domestic investors, leaving an irreducible minimum bias toward investing locally. It is thus total risk, not neutral risk, that is arbitraged. 3  H. Markowitz,”Portfolio Selection,” Journal of Finance, vol. 7, no. 1 (1952), pp. 77-91. 4  See H.G. Grubel, “Internationally Diversified Portfolios,” American Economic Review, vol. 58 (1968), pp. 1299-314; or B.H.

  they could productively employ. A clear benefit of financial globalization is that, to the extent that it reduces home bias, savings will be better directed to the most promising investments in the world, increasing global economic growth and prosperity. However, so long as risk aversion exists and trust is enhanced by local familiarity, we cannot expect that home bias will fully dissipate. Nevertheless, is globalization at least reducing home bias toward its minimum level? Survey data collected in the United States suggest a large swing toward foreign investment. U.S. residents began to increase the share of foreign assets in their portfolios from less than 9 percent in the late 1970s to about 15 percent by the mid-1990s. Since then, the trend has leveled off. The increased allocation to foreign assets was broad based, encompassing portfolio flows into debt and equity securities as well as foreign direct investment. A substantial part of the swing to holdings of foreign assets by U.S. residents coincided with a significant liberalization of capital accounts in both developed and emerging-market economies. In Western Europe, as goods markets became increasingly integrated, capital accounts followed suit. Starting in the 1980s, controls on foreign exchange and on inbound and outbound capital flows were relaxed. In Japan, the most-restrictive capital controls were relaxed in the early 1980s, but major liberalization came in the mid-1990s with the “Big Bang” financial reform measures. Similarly, many emerging-market economies removed or weakened currency and capital account controls in the 1990s. One cross-country study finds that, from 1983 to 1998, capital account openness improved markedly.6 With increased experience, U.S. investors doubtless improved their familiarity with foreign investment opportunities, and home bias, accordingly, declined. Data on financial flows into the United States indicate that foreign purchases of U.S. securities and foreign direct investment in the United States began to pick up in the early 1990s, and it has surged in the past four years. A similar pattern is apparent in the accumulated foreign holdings of securities issued by U.S. residents. As late as 1998, foreign residents owned just 6 percent of U.S. equities, but by 2001 that figure had risen to almost 15 percent. Reliable data on capital flows and securities holdings outside the United States are scarce, but what data we can muster tell a similar story. Although international diversification appears to have increased over the past two decades, it remains puzzling that, as I mentioned previously, shares of foreign assets in U.S. residents’ portfolios began to plateau in the mid-1990s at levels still well below full diversification. This outcome might indicate either that substantial indirect barriers to capital flows still exist or that an irreducible home bias among U.S. investors is inhibiting geographic diversification. Formidable indirect institutional barriers to lowering home bias beyond those to which I alluded earlier obviously do remain. Legal restrictions on foreign ownership of domestic assets or limits on the flow of domestic funds abroad can be significant. Informal disclosure practices that favor local investors may lead to information asymmetries - that is, an advantage to domestic residents in acquiring information about prospective investments - that discourage foreign investment in a country. These asymmetries may be exacerbated by differences in corporate governance and local norms of fairness that diverge from foreign standards, undercutting trust. This unfamiliarity fosters risk aversion and elevates home bias. Recent studies suggest that differing disclosure and corporate governance standards preserve home bias. Researchers have shown that, in most countries, holding a controlling interest in a firm yields significant benefits that do not accrue to minority shareholders, and that a substantial portion of home bias in those countries can be attributed to local holdings of closely held firms.7 Additionally, staff at the Federal Reserve Board and International Monetary Fund have shown that, for firms from emerging-market economies that meet U.S. standards for disclosure and protection of minority shareholder rights, U.S. residents hold the theoretically predicted proportion of company shares in their portfolios.8 Thus, it appears that an improvement in global reporting and corporate governance standards could significantly reduce global home bias.                                                       6  J.

  So do derivatives markets that help to narrow the wedge between the perceived risk-adjusted returns of foreign and domestic residents on any particular investment. Foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps have helped reduce the overall risk of securities denominated in foreign currencies or to transfer the risks to agents with either a greater appetite for risk or a longer investment horizon over which to smooth losses. Even the imposition of capital controls, foreign exchange restrictions, or devaluations of fixed currencies can now be at least partially hedged through nondeliverable forward contracts that settle in dollars for the change in value of an underlying currency over some pre-determined period. Credit default swaps now allow agents to hedge or exchange even sovereign risk. Argentina’s recent default provided a powerful test of these new derivatives and proved their worth, perhaps even helping to limit contagion. The further development of derivatives markets, particularly in smaller economies where idiosyncratic risk may be more difficult to hedge, will likely facilitate greater cross-border flows and a more productive distribution of global savings. The coincident development of local derivatives markets may facilitate the development of local currency bond markets in small or emerging-market economies by giving foreign and domestic investors more tools with which to hedge their exposure to the country risk. What Are the Real Economic Implications of Financial Globalization? It should be apparent that the process of financial globalization has come a long way but is as yet incomplete. Further development should lead to the enrichment and growth of developing economies as global savings are efficiently directed to capital accumulation in those countries where the marginal product of capital is highest. Another possible result of the process of financial globalization is increasingly large international payment imbalances as countries exporting capital run current account surpluses and those receiving capital run current account deficits. However, such developments should not necessarily be taken as a sign of a systemic problem. They can, in fact, be a sign that the global economy is becoming more efficient at directing capital to assets with the highest risk-adjusted rate of return. Along the way, the economies that liberalize first and to the greatest extent, and credibly commit to respect the property rights of foreigners, may receive the greater portion of free-flowing capital and thus potentially both greater net inflows and larger current account deficits. This process may have contributed to the recent expansion of the U.S. current account deficit. That expansion coincided with a steady appreciation of the U.S. dollar in the late 1990s, suggesting that net demand for U.S. assets was an important factor driving the significant widening of the U.S. current account deficit. As noted earlier, U.S. savers’ appetite for increasing the share of their portfolio devoted to foreign assets began to wane, and at roughly the same time capital account liberalization in other countries freed a large pool of savings to be invested internationally. These newly freed savings flowed disproportionately to the United States, where as a consequence one must assume risk-adjusted returns were perceived to be highest. Apparently, rapid U.S. productivity gains not seen elsewhere raised expectations for the return to capital on U.S. assets. Moreover, the Asian crisis in 1997 combined with the Russian default a year later to reverse global investors’ enthusiasm for investments in developing economies. The crises reminded foreign investors of the indirect barriers that continue to exist, especially in the developing world: a lack of adequate corporate disclosure and governance; underdeveloped, and often capricious, legal structures for contract dissolution and bankruptcy; and ex post government intervention in favor of domestic residents over foreign investors. Capital flows to the emerging-market economies, which had been at record levels throughout the early 1990s, dried up as a result. In contrast, the deep and broad financial markets of the United States and a well-developed legal system with a long history of respect for private property drew record financial flows into the United States. The lesson we should draw, however, is not that continued financial globalization will draw ever greater amounts of capital to the United States or even to the industrial world more generally. There are limits to the accumulation of net claims against an economy that persistent current account deficits imply. The cost of servicing such claims adds to the current account deficit and, under certain circumstances, can be destabilizing. The gross size of global quarterly or annual surpluses and matching deficits should rise as indirect barriers to cross-border investment are eliminated and home bias is reduced. However, portfolio adjustments will presumably continuously ameliorate such imbalances. As international accounting 
  and reporting standards become better, information asymmetries that currently exist between foreign and domestic investors will diminish. Adequate disclosure will, one hopes, accompany the development of institutions that will reduce corruption, and improve corporate governance, respect for private property and the rights of minority shareholders. Together with the growth of deeper and broader markets for derivatives, these developments should lower the risk of cross-border investment, making a wider array of the world’s assets more attractive to international investors.  Despite much progress, the process of global financial integration is far from complete. Though most direct barriers to international capital flows have been eliminated, numerous indirect barriers remain in place. While a dazzling array of financial innovations has sprouted in recent decades, the inability of market participants to hedge, trade, or share certain risks, especially those related to cross-border investment, implies that financial markets still need further innovation and deepening. Such barriers to capital flows preserve home bias and impede the efficient distribution of global savings to the most productive investments. We must remember that as financial globalization matures it will have consequences to economies that we cannot ignore. Global capital flows will increase in size and will switch directions more easily. As a result, temporary imbalances will naturally occur from time to time. To counter these, we need to consider various multilateral policy initiatives, from international accounting standards to international capital requirements for banks, from a “New Financial Architecture” to crisis prevention and resolution mechanisms. Also, market participants will need to enhance their ability to manage vast quantities of collateral that are integral to globalized modern finance. Our goals should include not only global financial stability, but also the promotion of free flowing capital directed to its most productive uses throughout the world. That goal will bring about greater financial stability and a more prosperous future for all who choose to participate in the global economy. 
 BIS Review 11/2003 1 Donald L Kohn: The strength in consumer durables and housing: policy stabilization or problem in the making? Speech by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Conference on Finance and Macroeconomics sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, San Francisco, 28 February 2003.  *      *      * We have spent the day examining the intersection of finance and macroeconomics from a theoretical and longer-run empirical perspective. I thought it might be interesting as after-dinner entertainment to bring the topic to the here and now - to the current economic and monetary policy situation. In particular, a number of commentators have raised the specter that imbalances are being created in the markets for consumer durable goods and houses - unsustainably high prices or activity - that will produce macroeconomic strains when, inevitably, they correct. These concerns obviously echo those expressed by some observers that monetary policy allowed run-ups in equity prices and capital spending in the 1990s that ultimately proved to be destabilizing. In that context, I thought it might be useful to consider the choices and information available to the central bank on this related question now - in real time - without the aid of 20-20 hindsight. I want to emphasize that what follows is focused on the question of imbalances in houses and durables and is not intended to be a comprehensive discussion of the outlook for the U.S. economy, which will depend on a wide array of influences I am not addressing. I should note the views on this question are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.1  Monetary Policy Backdrop The basic story is straightforward: In response to a series of developments that curtailed aggregate demand in the United States, the Federal Reserve has eased policy aggressively, cutting the federal funds rate 5-1/4 percentage points in two years, bringing the real federal funds rate to below zero. The most important contributors to economic weakness have been sharp contractions in investment spending and equity prices as businesses and investors re-evaluated the profitability of capital spending and the productive capacity built up in the late 1990s. The lower interest rates boosted investment in housing and consumer durables, helping to offset the drag of the decline in business investment and the damping effects of the drop in household wealth on consumer spending. These policy actions have kept the economy from softening even further and inflation from dropping by more from already low levels.  To a considerable extent, monetary policy easing is working no differently today than in the past: It stimulates interest-sensitive spending. But there are many forces at work in this cycle that have required interest rates working through their effects on household spending to shoulder an unusually heavy burden to support growth. Unlike most other cycles in recent U.S. economic experience, the weakness was initiated by a cutback in investment spending. This contrast is illustrated in chart1 which shows spending relative to GDP for a number of components of investment. While business fixed investment, shown in the upper panel, typically drops more than GDP when the economy weakens, the recent episode is remarkable in a couple of ways. First, the drop in the high-tech share, the red line, is unprecedented. Second, the drop in the share for non-high-tech equipment, the black line, has been unusually steep, exceeded only in the 1979-82 episode, when the contraction in output was far deeper.  Another unusual aspect of the current cycle is that equity prices and wealth continued to move lower long after interest rates started falling and kept declining well after the economy seemed to have bottomed out. This pattern appears to have occurred because the re-evaluation of corporate profitability has persisted for some time; because of last summer's revelations of corporate misdeeds; and because the recent increase in perceptions of geopolitical risk. These same concerns have continued to raise risk spreads in credit markets, damping the passthrough of lower policy interest                                                       1 John Roberts of the Board's staff contributed to the preparation of these remarks. 
 2 BIS Review 11/2003 rates to the cost of business credit. With uncertainty high and financial markets skittish, firms have remained hesitant to commit their cash and investment has been very slow to turn around.  In addition, economic weakness and sharp declines in equity prices have been widespread globally, and, until recently, these developments have helped keep the dollar strong despite the reduction in interest rates. Sluggish growth in the economies of our trading partners and the relatively high dollar have held down net exports, blunting another potential channel for monetary policy easing to bolster spending. In the late 1990s, the rise in the dollar reflected global perceptions of expanding investment opportunities in the United States and the resulting current account deficit provided a safety valve through which strong domestic demand was met in part by higher foreign production. But even though we do not need that safety valve anymore, the current account deficit has continued to increase of late, requiring easier monetary policy to keep domestic demand elevated relative to domestic income.  In the lower panel, chart 1 also gives some sense of the extent to which household investment has been carrying the economy. Economic contractions have frequently been led by weakness in the household sector, which often has responded to higher interest rates as the Federal Reserve acts to reverse inflation pressures. This pattern can be seen in the chart, where the spending shares of housing and consumer durables typically drop sharply before and during recessions. In this episode, however, these shares have continued to move slightly higher, despite a pronounced drop in wealth and a weak economy. Thus, household investment has stayed unusually strong throughout the recession and early in the recovery, buoyed, no doubt, by low interest rates.  Going Forward: The Benign Scenario As a consequence, it is to be expected that stocks of interest-sensitive investment goods - in the present circumstances, especially cars and houses - are greater than they would otherwise be. And with demand for housing strong, it is perhaps not surprising that house prices are probably higher than they otherwise would be.  But judging from the steep upward slope of the yield curve, few see interest rates as holding at current levels indefinitely. When, at some point, interest rates rise to more typical levels, desired stocks of these goods likely would fall, holding other factors equal, restraining this interest-sensitive spending. But it is important to remember that such an increase in interest rates would not occur in a vacuum; it would occur because the economy looked to be growing more vigorously. Most economists expect that a more pronounced step-up in the pace of activity will be brought about by a recovery in business investment from its current subdued levels. In that case, the need for high levels of spending on housing will be reduced. And higher interest rates will be instrumental in bringing about the adjustment in housing expenditures required to keep economic activity from overshooting its potential. In principle, a housing or durables boom induced by monetary policy need not entail a bust that would be painful to the economy.  Of course, it is not likely to occur as smoothly as that. Among other things, markets could get it wrong - for example, they could anticipate greater strength in underlying demand than is actually occurring. Then, higher interest rates would tend to damp spending unduly. But there is an “automatic stabilizer” aspect to the interaction of financial markets and the economy. As investors realized their error, rates would fall back. And markets would likely get a nudge from the Federal Reserve: We would set rates lower than the markets have built in, and in our various statements we would attempt to make clear our assessment of economic prospects. Interest rates could then stay low for an extended period, the desired stock of housing would remain elevated, and housing investment would remain high as well. But that would be just what is required. Alternatively, business investment could snap back faster than expected. In that case, interest rates would rise more rapidly as the extent of the strength of demand became clear - with, undoubtedly, some help from the Federal Reserve - weakening household investment more sharply as would be required. With production currently well below potential and inflation and inflation expectations low, it is doubtful that the temporary misalignment of rates would result in the development of any perceptible inflation pressures before the Federal Reserve would have time to take countervailing steps.  Costs and Risks to the Benign Scenario So far I have painted a rather sanguine picture of the longer-term consequences of a monetary-policy-induced boom in household investment. While this story has the virtues of plausibility 
 BIS Review 11/2003 3 and internal consistency, it does involve some features that bear further thought. First, the benign scenario relies on the transfer of productive resources across sectors - in particular, it involves primarily the inflow of resources into the residential construction sector. Presumably, the transfer of these resources entails some costs - retraining and perhaps relocation of workers, a different mix of capital, and so forth. If residential construction were eventually to shrink as interest rates rose, further costs would be incurred as those resources shifted yet again to different uses.  Another possibility is that the reality of the housing and consumer durables booms may not work out as neatly as the benign scenario would suggest. Indeed, some have drawn the comparison with the high-tech investment boom that peaked in 2000. As events have unfolded, it appears that firms concluded that the investment they undertook in those years was not justified; the subsequent drop in investment suggests that, in hindsight, firms concluded that they had “overinvested” in high-tech equipment; and that sharp cutback in investment created a recession. Is it possible, these commentators have asked, that the current boom in housing and durables will leave us with similar regrets in a few years?  Furthermore, prices of houses have been rising faster than inflation in recent years, reminiscent of the surge in equity prices through 2000. Some analysts argue that loose monetary policy is feeding a bubble in housing prices that will eventually burst.2  In short, the question is whether the stimulus to household investment, while cushioning the economic cycle in the near-term, is setting the stage for greater instability in the longer run.  Taking these concerns in turn:  Reallocation costs. There is little doubt that it is costly to build up a commercial enterprise. Workers must be hired, office space rented, equipment purchased, management expertise redirected. All of these actions entail costs. At the same time, as I already noted, if the yield curve is any indication, interest rates will one day go back up, giving rise to the possibility that some of the current expansion of construction firms will eventually need to be unwound.  So relying on the housing sector to offset weakness elsewhere in the economy clearly entails costs. But these costs need to be put against the costs of underutilized resources. Facilitating an increase in residential construction puts resources to use that would otherwise lie idle. Implicit in the conventional story is the assumption that the costs of unemployment are significantly greater than the costs of shifting resources across sectors; if so, the presence of adjustment costs should not seriously impede the desire to offset weakness in spending elsewhere with greater spending on household investment. Alternatively, a judgment that the adjustment costs were large, or the shock to demand temporary, might argue in the direction of a more measured policy response.  While it is hard to know for sure how important these adjustment costs may be, it is worth noting that, historically, there has been considerable variation in employment and production in the residential construction sector. Seasonal fluctuations in residential construction are quite large, and in business cycles from the early 1970s to the early 1990s, it was not uncommon for housing starts to drop by more than half. So it appears that this sector of the economy has evolved in such a way that it can expand and contract rapidly. Moreover, in the current episode, the falloff in commercial construction has freed many resources that can readily be put to work building houses for now, then shifted back when business spending picks up.  Similarly, even with the strong sales of light motor vehicles and other consumer durables last year, capacity utilization in these industries for the most part has remained at moderate levels, which suggests that the additional production induced by the monetary stimulus has occurred without important and costly new investment in production capacity.3                                                        2  Another possibility is that the buildup of debt associated with the strength in household investment will feedback adversely on financial conditions, especially as the boom unwinds. Such consequences could occur even in the absence of a “bubble” in housing prices if households were overextended and lenders had not taken adequate precautions against even a measured drop in collateral values. However, the link between debt burdens and consumer spending are tenuous at best, and when measured on a consistent basis, burdens do not look especially large. Moreover, loan-to-value ratios on mortgages have been about flat, leaving ample cushion for moderate housing price declines, should they occur. These observations suggest that widespread credit difficulties with important macroeconomic effects are unlikely when interest rates rise. For this reason, and to keep the subject manageable, I will not deal with the debt associated with acquiring the houses and durables. 3  The exception was for light trucks, when capacity utilization reached 97 percent in the third quarter of 2002. 
 4 BIS Review 11/2003 In sum, it does not seem that the costs of shifting resources across sectors should be a concern now. This is especially true when you consider that these resources would quite possibly otherwise be idle. That is not to say that such costs might not loom larger in other circumstances - say when resources are being temporarily shifted between the tradeable goods and nontradeable service sectors - though policymakers and their critics would still also need to be mindful of the costs of keeping more people unemployed.  Excesses. Perhaps the more challenging question is whether excesses and imbalances have built up that could create economic instability in the future when they are unwound. It is not hard to see why the issue arises. Chart 2 shows that real house prices have risen rapidly in the last few years. On a constant quality basis, new house prices still have not breached the peak of the late 1970s, but the prices of existing homes have sky-rocketed. Moreover, as can be seen in chart 3, the stock of consumer durables has risen at an elevated rate in the last few years; while the stock of houses has been growing more moderately, that pace has been maintained for some years.  The difficulties of real-time identification of imbalances are hard to overstate. One can never be sure until well after the event whether prices or quantities have indeed deviated from sustainable levels, because the sustainable level is never observable but must be estimated, and those estimates are quite sensitive to the assumptions being made. This point is especially true of asset prices: For example, the literature on both equity prices and exchange rates indicates that it is hard to beat a random walk. A similar point can be made about investment and the capital stock - including the stock of houses and durables. As the recent experience with business capital so graphically illustrates, excesses are only clearly evident after the fact - and the size of the over-investment may be disputable even then.  All that said, we can identify a number of factors that should affect what I will call the “sustainable” stock of housing and consumer durable goods - the level that would be desired over time at particular levels of interest rates and other key determinants of demand. Among these determinants are wealth, permanent income, and the user cost of owning the good - in effect its “price.” That price, in turn, depends importantly on the rate of interest. The demand for housing as an asset may also reflect some specific institutional changes. In particular, in recent decades, the rise of home equity lines of credit and the lower costs of mortgage refinancing has meant that housing wealth has become increasingly “liquid,” and as a consequence, may have become more attractive.  Chart 4 compares the actual levels of the stocks of housing and consumer durables with their desired levels derived from the Board staff's “FRB/US” model of the U.S. economy, using both current interest rates and their historical averages. Somewhat surprisingly, estimates from this conventional approach suggest that, at current interest rates, the existing stocks of houses and consumer durables are appreciably below the sustainable levels. In this model, low interest rates have a powerful effect on the desired stocks of housing and durables. Even when we estimate sustainable levels based on historical average interest rates, we conclude by this method that current housing and durables stocks are about in line with long-run demand.4 We need to keep in mind that these are only very rough estimates of unobservable variables. But such as they are, they do not suggest that as interest rates rise we will find that we are left with a vast oversupply of houses and durables.  What about house prices? Unfortunately, as I already noted, asset prices are even harder to model than investment. Just as equity prices can be thought of as being the present discounted value of future benefits of equity ownership - in principle, dividends and share repurchases - so house prices can be thought of as being the present discounted value of the future benefits of home-ownership, which, in theory, should be the potential market value of the rent from the house. And, just as the rate of return on equity should fall along with interest rates, so should the rental rate of return on houses. With rents changing very slowly over time, we ought to expect that, other things being equal, lower interest rates would raise house prices. In addition, households may be weighing houses against alternative investments other than bonds. In that regard, the collapse of expectations for gains from holding equity have undoubtedly made real estate relatively more attractive, contributing to price increases and higher activity.  On the supply side of the market, the scarcity of desirable land relative to population growth naturally puts upward pressures on prices. In addition, productivity in construction has lagged gains in the                                                       4  This conclusion proved relative robust to alternative models using varying definitions of permanent income and wealth. In all models, the elasticity of the demand for housing relative to user cost was 0.5 and that of consumer durables was 0.9.

The combination of demand and supply factors has caused house price gains to outstrip per capita income gains in recent years. The top of chart 5 shows that the ratio of house prices to per capita disposable income has increased substantially since 1998. But owing to the decline in mortgage rates, this has not made housing less affordable. The bottom of chart 5 shows an index of housing “affordability,” which compares the mortgage payment on a typical home to median household income; high levels of the index mean greater affordability. Although house prices outpaced income through much of the late 1990s, housing remained quite affordable by historical standards. It does not appear that the rise in prices has meant that the market is being supported on an increasingly narrow base, given increases in incomes and declines in interest rates. If interest rates were to rise so that real mortgage rates were equal to their long-term average, the affordability index would drop back, but only to a level that would still leave houses more affordable than they were in the second half of the 1980s.  Conclusion: Implications and Policy Choices In sum, the rise in housing prices and the increase in household investment in houses and consumer durables do not appear out of line with what might be expected in the current environment of low interest rates and continuing growth in real disposable incomes. Judging from this analysis, and bearing in mind its inherently tentative - if not speculative - character, it seems likely that as the economy strengthens and interest rates rise in response, household investment and prices are likely to soften some relative to recent trends, but not to break precipitously. Houses and cars would not be providing the impetus to economic activity they often have in past recoveries, but they do not appear set to replicate the experience of fiber-optic cable.  We are making inferences from very inexact proxies for desired stocks and sustainable prices. No one could definitively rule out the possibility that home construction and prices could drop sharply. Undoubtedly this will occur in some local markets, and it could become widespread. But the odds would seem to favor a more measured response to the inevitable tightening of policy as the recovery in business investment picks up steam, consistent with keeping the economy on a sustainable growth track rather than becoming another source of macroeconomic instability.  And weighing those odds is what policy is all about: Making choices in real time, using incomplete knowledge of future asset market behavior, and weighing potential costs and benefits for economic performance over time from alternative policy strategies.  By lowering interest rates aggressively, the Federal Reserve undoubtedly has shifted some forms of economic activity from the future to the present. In effect, we are trying to cushion the effects of decisions by the private sector to postpone business capital spending for now. Adjustment costs aside, and these appear to be minor, it is not clear why we would not want to bring construction spending in from the future, when it is likely that other parts of the economy would not be so weak. It makes sense to build the houses and cars now, when the cost of doing so is relatively low, rather than waiting. And building them now has kept more people employed and reduced the risk of deflation. All in all, from my perspective, with the knowledge and analysis available to me, the policy choices we have made seem consistent with fostering our legislated goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-run interest rates, not only in the near term, but most likely over the longer run as well.

 BIS Review 11/2003 1 Alan Greenspan: Home mortgage market Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the annual convention of the Independent Community Bankers of America, Orlando, Florida, (via satellite), 4 March 2003.  *      *      * Last year was surely one of the most memorable years ever experienced by the home mortgage market. Owing largely to the lowest mortgage interest rates in more than three decades and rising home prices, close to 10 million of regular home mortgages were refinanced. I use the term regular mortgage to exclude both home equity and construction loans. The outsized dollar volume of these refinancings - by our estimates, $1-3/4 trillion net of cash-outs - was an all-time record and represented almost one-third of the value of all regular home mortgages outstanding at the beginning of last year. Total regular mortgage originations, at $2-1/2 trillion, also proceeded at a record pace.  As part of 2002's process of refinancing, households “cashed out” almost $200 billion of accumulated home equity, net of fees, taxes, points, and commissions. That represented almost 3 percent of estimated total home equity at the beginning of the year, up slightly from the 2001 share. In no year prior to 2001, as best we can judge, did cash-outs exceed 1-3/4 percent of total home equity. Of last year's cash-outs, approximately $70 billion was apparently applied to repayment of home-equity loans, and a significant part was employed to reduce higher-cost credit card debt, judging from the slowed pace of growth in installment debt outstanding.  Previous Federal Reserve surveys of the disposition of cash-outs indicate that a substantial amount - perhaps half - was used to finance home modernization and personal consumption expenditures, outlays that directly affect GDP and jobs, and that likely was the case again last year. Low mortgage rates doubtless motivated much of this spending, but the ready availability of home equity for extraction appears to have also played a substantial and independent role in prompting additional household expenditures. Even as recently as the late 1980s, a family that wanted to use housing wealth to finance consumption would have faced an expensive and time-consuming process. Although substantial home equity wealth has existed for many years, only in the last decade or so has secured borrowing against home equity become a cost-effective source of credit in a wide variety of circumstances.  An even greater support to the economy than cash-outs last year was the extraction of home equity associated with a record 6.4 million existing home sales, including condos, at record prices. This pace of ownership turnover of the existing housing stock also reflected the near-record-low mortgage rates.  We estimate that mortgage originations for existing home purchase last year topped $600 billion. Subtracting the home sellers' repayments of the remaining debt of their outstanding mortgages, we infer a net increase of approximately $350 billion in debt on the homes that turned over last year. That debt increase exactly matches the extraction of previously built-up equity on those homes plus fees and taxes folded into the loans. Not surprisingly, the change in mortgage debt is highly correlated with the realized capital gains on the turnover of those homes.  We do not have a direct measure of how the equity extracted from last year's home turnover was expended. It is likely, however, that home sellers, after setting aside a down payment for the family's next home, expended a considerable part of their home equity extraction on goods and services.  In addition to the extraction of equity financed by regular mortgages last year, approximately $130 billion was drawn through a net increase of home equity loans, also a record, and also presumed to be the consequence of low mortgage rates as well as accelerated appreciation of homes. Federal Reserve studies of the disposition of home equity loans suggest a slightly higher rate of repayment of credit card and other consumer nonmortgage debt than our cash-out disposition surveys concluded.  All in all, the amount of previously built-up equity extracted from owner-occupied homes last year, net of fees and taxes, totaled $700 billion by our calculations, or more than 10 percent of estimated equity at the beginning of the year. Home equity extraction for the economy as a whole is, of necessity, financed by debt. In fact, the $700 billion of equity extraction is similar to the increase in mortgage debt last year.  
 2 BIS Review 11/2003 Despite the exceptionally large extraction of equity, the total remaining equity at the end of 2002 was higher in dollar terms than at the beginning of the year, owing to a 7 percent increase in existing home prices over the four quarters of last year and $300 billion in new home construction, net of mortgage extensions on those homes. Mortgage debt as a percent of the market value of homes accordingly rose somewhat more than 1 percentage point during the year.  Mortgage debt service costs as a percent of the disposable income of homeowners last year were little changed from 2001. The estimated 10 percent of homeowners' disposable income allocated to mortgage debt service in the third quarter of last year was well below the highs in 1991, though the ratio of homeowners' mortgage debt to their disposable income rose to a record high.  Refinance and home purchase originations, seasonally adjusted, peaked in the fourth quarter of last year. It is difficult to imagine that pace being maintained in the current quarter. Seasonally adjusted applications for refinancings, as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association, are off their peaks but still impressively high. So are home purchase mortgage applications. This suggests a somewhat less robust market for mortgage originations this quarter.  With home price increases now subsiding, and mortgage interest rates no longer declining at last year's impressive pace, some slowdown in the rate of mortgage debt expansion is to be expected. That is likely to be the case for equity extraction from home turnover as well. As I noted earlier, that extraction appears to parallel the realized capital gains on home sales, which mainly reflect the number of existing home sales. Home price change, of course, is also a factor, but it is the average change over the length of occupancy - nearly ten years for the typical homeowner - that matters, not recent price trends.  Similarly, refinancing and the cash-outs associated with them accelerated last year as the decline in mortgage interest rates on new loans far exceeded the modest decline in the average rate on all outstanding regular home mortgages. This wider spread between the current mortgage rate and the rate on outstanding loans, as you all know, markedly increased the incentive to refinance. So any stabilizing of rates on new mortgages would narrow the spread as portfolio rates continue to decline as a consequence of continued refinancing at interest rates still below the portfolio average. A narrowed spread would likely reduce cash-outs, lessening the level of equity extractions from this source. We do not have estimates of total home equity loans beyond the end of last year, but lines of credit at commercial banks - approximately a fourth of total home equity loans - rose during the first 7 weeks of 2003, considerably more than the typical seasonal change.  In summary, the frenetic pace of home equity extraction last year is likely to appreciably simmer down in 2003, possibly notably lessening support to household purchases of goods and services.  * * * The very large flows of mortgage funds over the past two years have been described by some analysts as possibly symptomatic of an emerging housing bubble, not unlike the stock market bubble whose bursting wreaked considerable distress in recent years. Existing home prices (as measured by the repeat-sales index) rose by 7 percent during 2002, and by a third during the past four years. Such a pace cannot reasonably be expected to be maintained. And recently, price increases have clearly slowed.  It is, of course, possible for home prices to fall as they did in a couple of quarters in 1990. But any analogy to stock market pricing behavior and bubbles is a rather large stretch. First, to sell a home, one almost invariably must move out and in the process confront substantial transaction costs in the form of brokerage fees and taxes. These transaction costs greatly discourage the type of buying and selling frenzy that often characterizes bubbles in financial markets. Second, there is no national housing market in the United States. Local conditions dominate, even though mortgage interest rates are similar throughout the country. Home prices in Portland, Maine, do not arbitrage those in Portland, Oregon. Thus, any bubbles that might emerge would tend to be local, not national, in scope.  Third, there is little indication of a supply overhang in newly constructed homes. The level of overall new home construction, including manufactured homes, appears to be well supported by steady household formation and not dependent on high and variable replacement needs or second-home demand. Census Bureau data suggest that one-third to one-half of new household formations in recent years result directly from immigration.  In evaluating the possible prevalence of housing price bubbles, it is important to keep in mind that home prices tend to consistently rise relative to the general price level in this country. In fact, over the 
 BIS Review 11/2003 3 past half century, the annual pace of home price increases has been approximately 1 percentage point faster on average than the rise in the GDP deflator. This higher home-price inflation rate results from persistently slower productivity growth in new home construction than in the economy overall. This lag in productivity growth drives up new home prices relative to the general price level and, by arbitrage, it drives up the prices of existing homes as well. In addition, local building and land use restrictions continue to constrain the supply of buildable land in many areas, whose price increases also tend to outstrip the rate of inflation.  Clearly, after their very substantial run-up in recent years, home prices could recede. A sharp decline, the consequences of a bursting bubble, however, seems most unlikely. Nonetheless, even modestly declining home prices would reduce the level of unrealized capital gains and presumably dampen the pace of home equity extraction. Home mortgage cash-outs and home equity loan expansion would likely decline in the face of declining home prices. However, the five-year old home building and mortgage finance boom is less likely to be defused by declining home prices than by rising mortgage interest rates.  Should rates rise, it is entirely possible that new and existing home sales would decline, leading to a lower level of realized capital gains on homes, a further narrowed refinance spread and, as a consequence, less overall home equity extraction. It is worth bearing in mind, however, that any sustained increase in rates presumably would occur only in the context of a more vigorous upturn in the pace of business activity, suggesting that the net effect on housing activity might be relatively limited.  * * * Most of the aforementioned data are new and derive from a much broader home mortgage data system in the early stages of development by the Federal Reserve Board. As a consequence, all specific numbers I have cited this morning are preliminary and subject to revision.  The evident increasing importance of tracking these very large flows of housing-related credits that have become so prominent in the past decade or two has led the Federal Reserve Board into a major statistical program to fill a notable gap in currently available data.  The Board has for years estimated outstanding home mortgage debt and published these estimates in our Flow of Funds accounts. We publish quarterly estimates of the stock of one- to four-family home mortgage debt as compiled from the vast majority of institutions that originate or hold home mortgage loans. These quarterly estimates of the levels of mortgage debt, however, do not allow us to monitor important flows such as refinancings, cash outs, and repayments. That shortfall needed to be remedied.  The availability of considerable detail on the vast majority of originations required by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) was a catalyst of this new project. Our latest tabulation of HMDA data, for the year 2001, provided detailed characteristics on almost 13 million mortgages with dates of application and origination. This unique body of data enables us to create weekly, monthly, and quarterly data on applications and originations of regular mortgages. These data are available for home purchase and refinance mortgages as well as for originators' purchase and sale of regular mortgages. Incidentally, the proportion of refinance to home purchase mortgages appears consistently higher in the data reported to us than in the data published elsewhere.  Independently, we have constructed a set of quarterly gross mortgage flows consistent with our series on mortgage debt outstanding. These calculations suggest significantly higher estimates of mortgage originations, but otherwise closely parallel the HMDA published originations. We are working on a system to adjust the HMDA internal detail to the wider coverage of originations consistent with our published outstanding mortgage debt on one- to four-family homes.1  * * * Home equity extraction directly finances household purchases of goods and services by liquefying previously illiquid assets. It also indirectly finances such purchases by facilitating outlays financed by                                                       1 Estimates of construction loans are excluded. 
 4 BIS Review 11/2003 credit card and other nonmortgage consumer debt. Equity extraction has been a major source of repayment of such debt.  Borrowing against home equity has been a staple of household finance for decades, but as I noted earlier, it has been only in the past decade or so that such practices have been encouraged by lenders. We need to far better understand the economics of this major addition to household finance and its impact on the economy. One hopes, new data will form the basis of better insights.  There can be little doubt that the availability of a ready source of home equity has reduced the costs and uncertainties associated with income volatility, retirement, unexpected medical bills and a host of other life events that can unexpectedly draw down savings. Home equity extraction may be the household sector's realization of the benefit of a rapidly evolving financial intermediation system.  
 BIS Review 10/2003 1 Susan S Bies: Retirement savings, equity ownership, and challenges to investors  Speech by Ms Susan S Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at a joint presentation to the National Economics Club and the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession of the American Economic Association, Washington, D.C., 27 February 2003.  *      *      * Good afternoon. I am delighted to be here to speak about some of the new challenges and opportunities that American families face from changes in retirement savings and equity ownership in the United States. I know that many of your members are economists who work in policy advisory roles in government. As an economist who enjoys getting back to her Ph.D. roots, I want to also address how traditional economic theory about consumer behavior and corporate governance are, at times, in apparent conflict with the practices that we observe. This in turn raises issues about the appropriate economic and policy frameworks for decisionmaking.  There has been a dramatic shift in employer-sponsored retirement plans over the past two decades - a shift from plans in which pension managers controlled most investments and retirees received preset benefits to plans in which workers directly control their investment portfolios and keep their investment returns. Many American families have responded by purchasing corporate equity - frequently through investments in mutual funds or other institutional accounts. With increasing control over their pensions, and broader participation in equity markets, Americans have far more options for financial planning than they did twenty years ago.  But with the new opportunities come risks and responsibilities. Households with more control of their resources for retirement have a greater need to employ sound financial planning. Moreover, though many might be unaware of it, stock-owning households share responsibility for oversight and governance of the corporations they own.  The headlines of the past couple of years have highlighted the importance of these risks and responsibilities. We have all witnessed a precipitous fall in stock prices and some spectacular corporate failures and have read accounts of retirement savings accrued over long careers only to be lost in a matter of weeks. Some of those corporate meltdowns were accompanied by the revelation of shoddy auditing practices and stock analyses tainted by conflicts of interest. And those who should have been ensuring sound corporate governance were often unwilling or unable to protect the interests of shareholders.  Recent developments suggest that households may, in coming years, take on even more responsibility for their retirement saving and assume additional responsibilities for corporate governance. The President's recently released budget for 2004 would considerably expand tax-preferred savings accounts for American families. And newly adopted Securities and Exchange Commission rules that give investors unprecedented access to proxy-voting records of mutual funds will enable and encourage investors to take more active roles in corporate governance.  With this backdrop, I would like to start by discussing some of the challenges confronting families, employers, and policymakers as workers assume greater control of their retirement planning. Later, I will turn to some issues related to individual investors' roles in corporate governance.  Retirement savings The American pension landscape has changed dramatically in the past twenty years. Mostly gone are the days when companies addressed their workers' retirement needs solely by paying fixed pensions from retirement until death. Today's workers are much more likely to manage their own retirement resources by participating in employee-directed savings accounts. This trend has greatly expanded workers' responsibilities for their retirement planning. But it has also raised significant new questions about how effectively employees are handling their new freedoms and responsibilities, and what the appropriate role for employers should be in helping their workers plan for retirement.  What lies behind the two-decade trend toward worker-directed savings accounts? Companies like them because they relieve the firm of the burden of managing a pension fund to finance promised 
  benefits. One need only scan a few recent headlines to be reminded of the difficulties that underfunded pension plans can impose on corporate balance sheets. With a savings-account plan, in contrast, companies need only set up the accounts and let their employees manage the investments. And workers also like savings account plans, because they provide more choices and because they are portable - that is, they can travel with the employee from job to job. A particularly popular type of savings plan is the 401(k), which lets workers make pre-tax contributions to retirement accounts through payroll deduction. Twenty-five years ago 401(k) plans did not exist. Today they cover more than 40 million workers, take in $150 billion in annual contributions, and hold assets worth more than $2 trillion.  This is a significant development, because along with the greater flexibility of a 401(k) plan comes greater responsibility on the part of individuals to direct their own retirement saving. Workers must decide whether to participate in the plan, how much to contribute every pay period, where to invest contributions, when to rebalance their asset mix, and what to do with balances when changing jobs.  Economic theory provides the basis for making these types of choices, but the problems are complex and the average employee may not have developed the skills to formally evaluate the alternatives. And, in fact, recent research has found some troubling patterns: Many workers do not participate in their employers' retirement plans, contribute a small proportion of their wages, and make questionable investment and distribution choices.  Let me just take a minute to cite some telling facts about 401(k) plans. Despite the tax advantages of 401(k) contributions, one-quarter of workers eligible for 401(k) plans do not participate at all, even when their employers would match a portion of their contributions.1 These workers are effectively turning down a pay raise by leaving compensation on the table. And many who do participate save just a little. In a survey last year, one-quarter of firms reported that their rank-and-file 401(k) participants saved an average of less than 4 percent of pay.2  How will these plans affect retirement security in the long run? Several studies suggest that many workers are not saving adequately for retirement.3 In 2001, among households with retirement accounts who were approaching retirement age, one-half had balances of less than $55,000, and one-quarter had balances of less than $13,000.4 Clearly balances of this size will not be adequate to finance many economic emergencies and will barely supplement social security over the two or three decades that often follows retirement.  There are other concerns about the way in which employees manage their 401(k) plans. Some seem to give little attention to the way their contributions are invested. For example, some participants divide assets equally across all available investment options, or simply invest contributions according to plan defaults.5 And, as was made painfully clear last year, many 401(k) participants seem to invest heavily in employer stock.6 Overall, about one-quarter of aggregate 401(k) balances are in company stock, but for many employees the share is far higher.  Why do workers invest so much in company stock? The question is particularly pressing because workers' financial outcomes are already heavily dependent on the fortunes of their employer. Moreover, employers often require that the matching contributions they make on behalf of their employees be invested in company stock. Thus, when employees invest their own contributions in the company stock, they are ratcheting up an already-risky position. Elementary finance theory suggests they shouldn't do it.                                                        1  Deloitte and Touche, 2002 401(k) Annual Benchmarking Survey. 2  Deloitte and Touche, 2002 401(k) Annual Benchmarking Survey. 3  For a review, see Olivia Mitchell, Brett Hammond, and Anna Rappaport, Forecasting Retirement Needs and Retirement Wealth, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000. 4  Based on the Federal Reserve Board's 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances. 5  Nellie Liang and Scott Weisbenner, "Investor Behavior and Purchase of Company Stock in 401(k) Plans - The Importance of Plan Design," FEDS Working Paper 2002-36 and NBER Working Paper W9131, 2002.

  Yet many workers believe that their employer's stock is less risky than broad market averages.7 What explains this apparent disconnect? As someone who held a large fraction of my own 401(k) plan in my company's stock for many years, perhaps I can help answer this question. There is a difference between risk and uncertainty. Employees may feel less uncertain about the prospects of the company for which they work relative to other companies about which they know little. This may make them more comfortable about holding their company's stock - even at the cost of a poorly diversified and highly volatile portfolio.  To summarize, experience has shown that while 401(k) plans offer workers unprecedented flexibility in managing their pensions, some workers do not seem to be using them effectively - they contribute too little, make questionable investment choices, or fail to participate at all. In response, some employers have expressed increased interest in employer-provided financial education.  But employers' attention to plan design turns out to be just as important. Contrary to predictions of traditional finance theory, the way retirement-plan options are framed to workers affects the choices they make. This is where the new discipline of behavioral finance has begun to offer significant contributions. Some of the most innovative and apparently effective ideas about retirement-plan design owe to the insights of behavioral finance.  As compelling evidence that framing matters, researchers have found that so-called "opt-out" plans, or plans that automatically enroll workers, have significantly higher participation rates than plans that require workers to sign up.8 Not surprisingly, employers have responded by making automatic enrollment more prevalent: A recent survey found that nearly a quarter of large plans either have adopted automatic enrollment or are considering adopting it.9  But automatic enrollment may not be enough, since automatically enrolled employees often give little attention to the default options of the plan. One study found that half of automatic enrollees had not moved from the defaults even three years after enrollment.10 This could be a problem because default contribution rates, which are typically 3 percent of pay, are often too low to allow workers to take full advantage of employer matches, let alone to build sufficient assets for retirement. In fact, there is some evidence that the low default rates reduce contributions among workers who would likely have saved more in the absence of the default. Finally, the default investment choice in automatic enrollment plans is typically the least risky, such as a money market or stable value fund. While these investments are especially safe, their expected returns may be too low to achieve long-term retirement security.  Subsequent research has highlighted how employers might improve their automatic enrollment plans. For example, they might set higher default contribution rates and greater default exposure to a diversified set of higher-yielding assets. Another possibility is to bring new employees on board with low contribution rates - just as is often done currently - but then to nudge contribution rates up as the workers receive pay raises. Some studies have shown that workers are willing to pre-commit to such a plan, which eventually results in significantly higher rates of savings.11  But along with these new opportunities for employers come difficult new questions. How high should their employees' savings rates go? In an ideal world, all employees would be making well-informed savings decisions and wouldn't need any encouragement from their employers. But, in reality, a plan's design affects the financial well-being of its participants. And though a default savings rate of 3 percent of pay might seem too low, an employer is not necessarily in a good position to know what the appropriate saving rate should be. A high default rate may be inappropriate, particularly if employees respond by dissaving outside their retirement plan.                                                        7 Vanguard Center for Retirement Research.

  Many employers will recoil from making these choices, because they do not want to become too paternalistic. But a significant and inescapable implication of this line of recent research is that employers cannot avoid responsibility in this area, because there is no "neutral" plan design - whatever design they choose will affect the retirement security of their employees.  To summarize, the past two decades have brought remarkable expansion of the financial options available to ordinary workers, including significant new tools for retirement planning. But this experience has also revealed some important lessons for workers, companies, and policymakers. While many - perhaps most - workers effectively use the new tools to prepare for retirement, some do not. Moreover, participants' choices are often affected by the presentation of the options. Thus, companies offering retirement savings accounts such as 401(k) plans face a delicate balancing act. While they desire to shift the maximum degree of decisionmaking to workers, they must acknowledge that basic plan-design choices will affect the long-term retirement security of their employees. Companies that find the right combination of financial education and plan design will be in the best position to help their employees prepare adequately for retirement.  Equity ownership As Americans have stepped up their use of employee-directed savings accounts in the past couple of decades, many have also purchased their first shares of corporate equity - often within their 401(k) plans. More than half of U.S. households now own either stock or stock mutual funds.12 Moreover, equity ownership reaches further into younger generations and the middle class now than it did in the 1980s. From 1989 to 2001, the fraction of Americans younger than 35 who owned stock more than doubled, as did stock ownership among families with below-median income.13  This striking increase in equity ownership is, in part, an outgrowth of the move toward worker-directed savings plans, as I've already discussed. More than two-thirds of U.S. stockholders now hold some stock in an employer-sponsored retirement plan.14 In addition, the heightened popularity of owning stocks probably reflects a broadened understanding of the potential benefits of equity investments and perhaps an increased tolerance for financial risk. Also important, especially for investors of relatively modest means, is that mutual funds in particular have substantially reduced the cost of purchasing a diversified portfolio. Despite the ease with which corporate equities can be traded directly nowadays - through on-line brokerage accounts, for example - a recent survey found that two-thirds of stockholders first bought their equity shares through mutual funds.15  Besides its financial risks and potential rewards, stock ownership imparts important corporate governance responsibilities. In fact, economic theories of firm behavior often stress the competing interests of management and ownership. With an ownership share in a business, every stock investor has a role in providing oversight on how that company is run. The egregious corporate scandals in the headlines last year have highlighted the need for responsible oversight by corporate boards and shareholders alike to check the behavior of management. So, as we look for solutions to corporate governance problems, we should not forget that every individual who owns stock has a role - perhaps a small one, but an important one.  Yet the growth in households' equity ownership has come with an ironic twist: While more households own shares of corporations, many of the new stockholders are unable to play a role in corporate governance. Why? Because Americans have largely purchased their shares through pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. These financial intermediaries, which act as the agents for household investors, have generally not made much, if any, effort to make their governance policies transparent and responsive to the preferences of their investors.                                                        12  Aizcorbe, Ana, Arthur Kennickell, and Kevin Moore, "Recent Changes in U.S. Family Finances: Evidence from the 1998 and 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances," Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 89 (January 2003), pp. 1-32, and Federal Reserve Board staff calculations from the Survey of Consumer Finances.

  So, as Americans have been purchasing most of their stock indirectly through institutional investors, the responsibilities for active monitoring of corporate management and governance mechanisms have been shifting to institutions. There's good news, bad news, and some promising news to report about this trend.  The good news is that we may have reason to expect that institutional shareholders would be especially active in working for good corporate governance. An institutional investor holding a large block of stock naturally reaps more of the rewards of good corporate governance than an individual holding a small number of shares, and the big institutional investor undoubtedly has more leverage with management. In addition, as individuals buy their stock through institutions, the task of forming shareholder coalitions to effect good governance ought to become that much easier.  The bad news is that, with some notable exceptions, institutional investors historically appear to have been fairly passive shareholders and have tended to shy away from challenging management directly and from initiating reform-oriented proxy proposals. Also some institutional investors may face conflicts of interest in providing active governance if they also compete to sell financial services - like pension-plan administration - to the firms whose shares they hold.  To be sure, the evidence on institutional shareholder activism and conflicts of interest is limited, because few institutional investors provide any information about how they vote the shares in their portfolios. So, individual investors interested in corporate governance are unlikely to be able to ascertain anything about how an institutional investor has voted shares on their behalf. Although some institutional investors may have been active in behind-the-scenes attempts to promote good management decisions, few details about these efforts are made available to the public, which ultimately bears the risk of stock ownership.  And the promising news? Just last month, the SEC approved new rules that will require investment advisers and mutual funds to disclose their proxy voting policies and specific proxy votes. For most investors in mutual funds, the new rule will provide unprecedented information about how votes are being cast on their behalf.  In fact, some have criticized the new disclosure rules for imposing too great a burden on mutual funds and for providing too much information to be useful to most investors. But that criticism misses the point. Disclosure of proxy voting records will likely initiate new efforts to educate individual investors on corporate governance issues.  Disclosures about proxy voting are especially important for index funds. Actively managed funds can signal dissatisfaction with corporate officers by selling shares, but index funds, which passively hold a basket of representative companies, cannot. Soon, by monitoring the proxy-votes of index-fund managers, investors will be able to gauge their fund managers' satisfaction with corporate officers.  By the time the first proxy-voting reports are required to become public in 2004, I expect that the initial steps toward corporate governance education will already have been taken. Individual investors looking for guidance on the way mutual funds vote their proxies will be able to turn to a slate of organizations that monitor and analyze mutual funds' voting records. I look forward to learning how my mutual funds have voted their proxies and to comparing their voting records with those of other funds. As other investors do the same, the new disclosures will likely have the additional side benefit of directing new attention to corporate governance.  Conclusion Some of last year's most striking developments - tumbling stock prices, evaporating retirement accounts, and improper corporate oversight - highlighted the importance of longer-term trends in pension plans and equity ownership. As more workers have managed their own retirement accounts and more become stockholders through pension plans and mutual funds, more have learned about both the rewards and the risks of investing in capital markets. With individuals' increasing exposure to market fluctuations and greater participation in equity markets come both new opportunities and new responsibilities, for both workers and employers. Today I've discussed some of the issues that have come to light as a result of long-term trends in pension plans and equity ownership. And I'd like to leave you on an optimistic note with this observation: The issues I discussed today are only possible because of the remarkable breadth and depth of capital markets in the United States. I am confident that over the long haul, the concerns I noted will simply represent the ordinary climb along the 
  investment-learning curve as a broader segment of American households work to achieve their financial goals.  
 BIS Review 10/2003 1 Alan Greenspan: Aging global population Testimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C., 27 February 2003.  *      *      * Mr. Chairman and other members of the committee, I am pleased to be here today to discuss the economic effects of the aging of the global population. In so doing, I would like to emphasize that the views I will express are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board.  The world's population is growing older as a result of both declining fertility and increasing life expectancy. These trends manifest themselves in at least two important dimensions: a more slowly growing population and labor force, and an increase in the ratio of the elderly to the working-age population.  The so-called elderly dependency ratio has been rising in the industrialized world for at least 150 years. The pace of increase slowed greatly with the birth of the baby-boom generation after World War II. But elderly dependency will almost certainly rise more rapidly as that generation reaches retirement age. The acceleration will be particularly dramatic in Japan and Europe. For example, in Japan the population share of the elderly, defined here as those at least 65 years of age, climbed from 12 percent to 17 percent in the past decade, and demographers expect it to reach 30 percent by 2030. The absolute size of Japan's working-age population is already declining and is projected to fall 20 percent over the next three decades. Europe's working-age population is also anticipated to recede, and the share of the elderly in its overall population is expected to rise markedly, though less so than in Japan.  The changes projected for the United States are not so severe as those projected for Europe and Japan, but nonetheless present daunting challenges. Over the next thirty years, the growth rate of the working-age population in the United States is anticipated to slow, from about 1 percent per year today to about 1/2 percent per year by 2030. At the same time, the percentage of the population that is over 65 will rise markedly - from less than 13 percent today to perhaps 20 percent by 2030.  Though the overall population is expected to continue to age, much of the aging of the labor force has already occurred with the aging of the baby-boom generation. Once the baby boomers begin to retire, the mean age of the U.S. labor force is expected to stabilize.  These anticipated changes in the age structure of our population and work force result largely from the decline in fertility that occurred following the birth of the baby-boom generation. After peaking in 1957 at about 3-1/2 births over a woman's lifetime, the fertility rate in the United States fell to less than 2 by the early 1970s, and then rose to about 2.1 by 1990.1 Since then, the fertility rate has remained close to 2.1, the so-called replacement rate, or the level required to hold the population constant in the absence of immigration or changes in longevity. The decrease in the number of children per family since the baby boom has inevitably led, with a lag, to a projected increase in the ratio of elderly to working-age population.  Increases in life expectancy, too, have been substantial. In 1950, a man 65 years of age could expect, on average, to live until age 78, whereas now he can expect to live until over 81. And if current trends continue, by 2025 he can expect to live to 83 and, by 2060, to 85. Women's life expectancy is projected to increase about the same amount, from 81 in 1950 to roughly 85 today, 86 in 2025 and 88 in 2060.  Of course, it is difficult to predict the age structure of the population in the more distant future. Although we have a good idea of the size of the working-age population over the next twenty years or so - its members are largely already born - forecasting the number of children and future immigration and population growth is much more conjectural. Just recently, for example, the United Nations revised its forecast of world fertility rates downward from its projection only three years earlier;                                                       1  The fertility rate used here is the total fertility rate. It is measured as the average number of children who would be born to a woman in her lifetime if she were to experience the birth rates by age observed in any given year. 
  according to the new forecast, world population is expected to begin actually declining in the latter part of this century, whereas under the previous forecast, it was expected to continue growing.  Even with the substantial uncertainty that surrounds these forecasts, population aging in the developed world is not likely to be a temporary phenomenon, associated solely with the retirement of the baby-boom generation. Rather, under current projections, the retirement of that generation should be viewed as hastening the transition between the current distribution of age and one in which the population is notably older.  The populations in most developing countries likewise are expected to have a rising median age, but they will remain significantly younger and grow faster than our population over the foreseeable future. Eventually, declines in fertility rates and increases in longevity may lead to similar issues with aging populations in the developing world but likely only well after the demographic transition in the United States.  As you know, the aging of the population in the United States will have significant effects on our fiscal situation. In particular, it makes our social security and Medicare programs unsustainable in the long run, short of a major increase in immigration rates, a dramatic acceleration in productivity growth well beyond historical experience, a significant increase in the age of eligibility for benefits, or the use of general revenues to fund benefits.2  Indeed, according to the intermediate projection of the social security trustees, the level of social security contributions under current law begins falling short of legislated benefits by approximately 2017. While the prospect of a shortfall in social security is reasonably certain given the changing composition of the population, the range of possible outcomes in Medicare is far wider. Rapidly advancing medical technologies, essentially inelastic demand for medical services for the elderly, and a subsidized third-party payment system have created virtually unconstrained demand.3  How the financing pressures that accompany increasing retirement are resolved will have profound, but uncertain, effects on the structure of both private and public pension plans. Private pension assets already account for about 12 percent of household financial assets in the United States, a level that will almost certainly increase over the next decade. The total investment income of these funds, in conjunction with retirees' other forms of income, must be sufficient to finance a satisfactory standard of living.  The real resources available to fund pension benefits depend on the economy's long-term growth rate, which in its simplest terms is determined by the growth rate of labor employed plus the growth rate of the productivity of that labor. As already noted, by 2030 the growth rate of our working-age population is expected to decline by half.  The fraction of the working-age population actually employed will doubtless be affected by improvements in health or changes in the economic returns to working. Labor productivity has historically been affected by changes in the amount of capital available to each worker, the pace of technical progress and, perhaps more subtly, changes in the experience of our workforce. These elements are key to assessing the economic effects of aging.  One natural response to population aging will almost surely be for a more fit elderly population to increase their participation in the labor force. Americans not only are living longer, but they are generally living healthier. Rates of disability for the elderly have been declining, reflecting both improvements in health and changes in technology that accommodate the physical impairments that are associated with aging. In addition, work is becoming less physically strenuous but more demanding intellectually, continuing a century-long trend toward a more conceptual and a less physical economic output. For example, in 1900, only one out of every ten workers was in a professional, technical, or managerial occupation. By 1970, that proportion had doubled, and today those types of jobs account for about one-third of our workforce.  Despite the improving feasibility of work at older ages, Americans have been retiring at younger and younger ages. Some analysts believe this trend has slowed, although few anticipate a rapid                                                       2  Because social security benefits are tied to productivity growth with a lag, only a rate of productivity growth well above historical experience could completely resolve social security’s long-term financing problem. 3  Constraining these outlays by any mechanism other than prices will involve some form of rationing - an approach that in the past has not been popular in the United States. 
  turnaround. But rising pressures on retirement incomes and a growing scarcity of experienced labor could induce greater labor-force participation.  Immigration, if we choose to expand it, could prove an even more potent antidote for slowing growth in the working-age population. As the influx of foreign workers in response to the tight labor markets of the 1990s showed, immigration does respond to labor shortages.  An expansion of labor-force participation by immigrants and the healthy elderly offers some offset to an aging population. However, it is heightened growth of output per worker that presents the greatest potential to boost the growth of gross domestic product. A significant rise in the growth of labor productivity will be necessary if the standard of living of retirees is to be maintained and that of workers is to continue advancing.  One of the more direct ways to raise growth in output per hour is to increase saving and investment, which augment the capital stock available to workers. Another is to increase the incentives for innovation; efficiency gains, broadly defined, currently account for roughly half the growth in labor productivity.  Though augmenting saving and investment should raise future labor productivity and thereby help provide for an aging population, the incremental benefit of additional investment may itself be affected by aging. Without a growing labor force, the amount of new equipment that can be used productively will be more limited, and the return to capital investment could decline as a consequence.  What actually happens to the saving rate in the next three decades will depend importantly on the behavior of the baby-boom cohort during their retirement years. Over the post-World War II period, the elderly in the United States, contrary to conventional wisdom, seem to have drawn down their savings only modestly. The reasons are not entirely clear. Often people bequeath a significant proportion of their savings to their children or others rather than spending it during retirement. If the baby-boom generation continues this pattern, then the U.S. household saving rate may not decline significantly, if at all.  The faster rates of aging in Europe and Japan may also directly affect investment and, hence, the growth of labor productivity here in the United States. If saving rates in these countries decline, global capital flows to the United States that have contributed significantly in recent years to financing domestic investment are likely to decline. As in the United States, much will depend on the extent to which retirees in these countries draw down their savings. For example, the saving rate in Japan, even with the rapidly aging population, has not declined to the extent that some had predicted. However, if households in Japan were to start consuming more and saving less, Japan's trade surplus would likely shrink as consumption of imported goods rose. Some of the elevated level of their imports would be exports from the United States, and our trade balance would improve, all else being equal.  Jobs requiring unskilled labor are likely to continue moving to developing countries, and this transfer may increase foreign direct investment by U.S. firms. Most other developed countries are unlikely to be able to offer higher rates of return because they are already aging faster than the United States.  Many developing countries have the potential to offer higher rates of return because of their younger and more rapidly growing populations and currently low stocks of capital, but the realization of this potential is far from guaranteed. Historically, returns to investment in many developing countries have been held down by several inhibiting factors: low levels of education, poor infrastructure, and, perhaps most important of all, capricious legal protections.  Clearly, if net capital inflows into the United States decline, so must our current account and trade deficits. Any such declines must be offset by higher domestic saving - including government saving - if domestic investment in plant and equipment and in housing are to be maintained.  Future labor productivity, however, is determined by more than just saving, investment, and capital intensity. One of the remarkable features of the economy over the past seven years or so has been the acceleration in the pace of innovative use of capital by workers, rather than increases in the amount of capital per worker. Indeed, as I pointed out earlier, such innovation accounted for about one-half of the rapid increase in labor productivity that we observed in the late 1990s. Therefore, it is important to address the possibility that aging will affect the rate of innovation, either through a rearrangement of existing capital resources or through technological advance.  Economists understand very little about how technological progress occurs, and research about the effects of aging populations on technological innovation has been sparse. On the one hand, some commentators have worried that an aging population will lead to a less dynamic economy and a lower 
  rate of technological progress; they cite, for example, the fact that the majority of Nobel prizes in the "hard" sciences were awarded for discoveries made by the winners early in their careers. Such issues may have less import going forward, however, as most of the aging of the workforce has already occurred. On the other hand, a slowed rate of growth or a decline in the working-age population may raise technological growth. Although discovery of new technologies is to some degree a matter of luck, we know that human activities do respond to economic incentives. A relative shortage of workers should increase the incentives for developing labor-saving technologies and may actually spur technological development. Economic historians have argued that one reason that the United States surpassed Great Britain in the early nineteenth century as the leader in technological innovation was the relative scarcity of labor in the United States. Patent records of this period show that innovation did respond to economic incentives and that the scarcity of labor clearly provided incentives to develop new methods of production.  *      *      * The aging of the population means that the government will inevitably need to make a number of changes to its retirement programs. These changes in themselves can have profound economic effects. For example, aside from suppressing economic growth, large increases in payroll taxes can exacerbate the problem of reductions in labor supply, whereas policies to promote longer working life can ameliorate it. Reductions in benefits - through changes to the age for receiving full retirement benefits or through reforms to slow the growth of Medicare spending or through other means - can affect retirement, the labor force, and saving behavior. In addition, policies that link increases in longevity over time to the eligibility age for social security, and perhaps Medicare, may need to be considered. Such linkages would help protect the financial and, hence, the economic viability of these programs.  The aging of the population is bound to bring with it many changes to our economy - some foreseeable, many probably not. Though the challenges here seem great, the necessary adjustments will likely be smaller than those required in most other developed countries. But how we adjust will also matter. Early initiatives to address the economic effects of baby-boom retirements could smooth the transition to a new balance between workers and retirees. If we delay, the adjustments could be abrupt and painful.  Fortunately, the U.S. economy is uniquely well suited to make those adjustments. Our open labor markets can adapt to the differing needs and abilities of our older population. Our capital markets can allow for the creation and rapid adoption of new labor-saving technologies, and our open society has been receptive to immigrants. All these factors put us in a good position to adjust to the inexorabilities of an aging population.  
 BIS Review 16/2003 1 Ian Plenderleith: The aim and operation of monetary policy Speech by Mr Ian Plenderleith, Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the Merrill Lynch Macro Day, Johannesburg, 25 March 2003.  *      *      * I was honoured and delighted to have the opportunity to join the South African Reserve Bank as a Deputy Governor at the start of this year. As still very much a newcomer to the South African scene, I thought I might take this opportunity to share of few of my early impressions of the South African economy - and specifically of the operation of monetary policy, which is the particular responsibility of the Reserve Bank I should say at the outset that these impressions are very positive. There is, in my view, a great deal to be admired in the performance of the economy, and in the contribution monetary policy is making to promoting that performance; and in parallel, a great deal of progress is being made in pressing ahead with structural reform, across a wide front, in order to ensure that the economy can fulfill its potential in the future. Perhaps the most remarkable achievement that strikes me in the economic sphere is that the South African economy has continued to achieve steady and sustained growth over the past few years despite the global economic slowdown in the surrounding world economy. As the world economy has moved into slowdown over the past two years or so, the South African economy has continued to grow at around 3% - not, to be sure, as fast as one would hope to achieve in a more favourable world environment, but nonetheless a great deal better than many other economies have experienced. The current cyclical upswing in the South African economy, which began in September 1999, has now been in progress for 3½ years; and, looking ahead, the prospects are encouraging for the economy to continue to grow.  How has this been achieved? There are no doubt many contributory factors, but I think an important one is the coherent and responsible macroeconomic policy framework which the authorities have steadily and consistently pursued over recent years, covering both fiscal and monetary policy. The fiscal side is not for me, as a central banker, to dwell on. But there is no doubt that the steady commitment the government has shown to keeping the budget deficit to low and manageable levels and to containing the burden of public sector debt has delivered real benefits in terms of a strong and sustainable structure in the public finances. The result, as evident in the Budget last month, is that, as the economy has grown and as revenue collection has strengthened, there has been enhanced scope both to reduce taxes and to continue building up essential spending programmes on a sustainable basis. In the monetary field, on which I want to say a little more, there has similarly been a commitment to a coherent and responsible framework steadily and consistently pursued. This is the inflation-targeting framework, which mandates the Reserve Bank to keep inflation low in order to deliver broad price stability across the economy as a whole. South Africa is, of course, not alone in setting price stability as the priority for monetary policy. Maintenance of low inflation is the universal aim that central banks around the world are set to pursue. But in pursuing this aim within the framework of an explicit low inflation target, South Africa is very much in the forefront of international best practice. Why this emphasis on low inflation and the commitment to price stability? At one level, the socio-economic damage that flows from a failure to control inflation is all too evident. High and volatile rates of inflation disadvantage the poor, who are least able to protect themselves from the ravages of inflation, to the benefit of those more able to preserve their standards of living. Inflation disadvantages in particular those living on fixed incomes, often the elderly reliant on pensions or savings. Across the board, inflation will tend to discourage savings and undermine the ability of people to plan their future personal finances on a prudent, long-term basis. By eroding values in a corrosive and insidious fashion, inflation can undermine sociably responsible behaviour and threaten the stability of society as a whole. Not for nothing has inflation been called a silent and invisible thief.  In more specifically economic terms, too, inflation is the enemy of long-term sustainable economic growth, weakening the capacity of the economy to achieve the rate of growth of which it is capable. 
 2 BIS Review 16/2003 Past history, in South Africa and in many other countries, illustrates this all too vividly. If demand in the economy is allowed to grow faster than the output supply capacity of the economy, the result is inevitably rising inflation. This is because excess demand cannot induce the economy to deliver more output than it is capable of producing: it simply bids up the price of the output the economy can produce, generating inflation. If inflation is allowed to gather pace, the process of reining back excess demand, through higher interest rates, is inevitably more wasteful, in terms of an extended period of growth below capacity, than if timely action is taken by the monetary authorities to keep the pace of demand in line with the supply capacity of the economy. To try to maintain that balance, between demand and supply in the economy, is essentially the task of monetary policy and the aim the central bank is pursuing when it sets interest rates. If it succeeds, inflation will be kept low and the economy can continue to grow at a steady and sustainable rate on a continuing and lasting basis. There is an important corollary of this process. This is that there is not, in any meaningful sense, a trade-off between growth and low inflation. It is not in practice feasible to contemplate living with a somewhat higher rate of inflation, even for a period, in the hope that this would bring higher growth. The reason is that low inflation is not an alternative to growth, but a necessary and essential pre-condition. Without a commitment - made and delivered - to keeping inflation low, we will not achieve on a sustainable basis the growth of which the economy is capable. With low inflation, demand, and hence output, in the economy can continue to grow on a steady and sustainable basis. In pursuing low inflation, therefore, the central bank is aiming for exactly the same goals that we all desire - continuing sustainable growth in output and employment and living standards across the economy as a whole.  The inflation-targeting framework in South Africa has a critical role to play in maintaining low inflation. Its strength lies in the fact that its structure contains what I believe to be the four key elements for an effective monetary framework. Let me say a word briefly about each. First, the framework provides for an explicit target to be set for inflation. This is currently that inflation, as measured by the CPIX, should be brought back down to, and held within, a range of 3-6%. The value of setting an explicit target in this form is that it helps to anchor inflation expectations to a low level. Business and industry, and individuals, in making their own financial plans, will hopefully do so on the basis that inflation will be kept in that range over time; and on the basis that, if, as at present, inflation moves outside that range, the policy stance will be adjusted promptly to bring it back within range - as indeed was done last year. Anchoring expectations in this way helps in turn to build low inflation into the fabric of the economy as a whole. The target also, importantly, provides a means, quite properly, of holding the central bank to account for its performance. I shall touch on this last aspect again in a moment. Secondly, the inflation-targeting framework gives the responsibility for achieving the target to the central bank, and specifically to the Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, acting independently and under a clear mandate to deliver the target. It also gives the MPC the means to achieve the target, through its decision on setting the Reserve Bank's repo rate at each of its meetings. The framework thus ensures that there is a clear allocation of responsibility; and it ensures that interest rate decisions are taken by a competent authority dedicated to the task and acting independently. Thirdly and fourthly, the inflation-targeting framework is one that delivers a high degree of transparency and accountability. Transparency and accountability is achieved through the full statement the MPC issues immediately after each meeting, through the range of publications the Reserve Bank issues setting out its view of developments, and through the public appearances the Governor and his colleagues make in explaining the Reserve Bank's policy activities. I think this is a very important and beneficial part of the process for several reasons - partly because it is right that in a democratic system public agencies should be required to be open and accountable in explaining their activities; partly because that process hopefully helps to maintain public confidence in the performance of the agency and public support for the objective of low inflation; partly because that in turn should encourage business and individuals to conduct their affairs on the basis that low inflation will be maintained; and partly because openness and accountability helps promote a better public debate on the issues. These are all elements that I believe help to strengthen the effectiveness of the inflation-targeting process. This framework has, of course, been tested in the past 18 months by the inflationary shocks the economy has faced from the fall in the value of the rand in the latter half of 2001 and the accompanying upwards pressure on food prices and fuel costs. The steps taken last year to raise interest rates were necessary to prevent these shocks generating a self-reinforcing process of rising 
 BIS Review 16/2003 3 inflation. As indicated in the statement issued after last week's meeting of the MPC, there are now signs that the inflationary pressures are beginning to abate and that the outlook for inflation is improving, though there is little room for complacency given the considerable risks we still face. But to return to my initial impressions, what is particularly encouraging, I believe, is that the coherent and responsible policy framework provided by inflation-targeting has demonstrated its ability to address the shocks in a steady and considered manner and, in doing so, has helped considerably to maintain confidence in the economy. This is particularly evident in the international markets, where confidence in the fundamentals of the South African economy has undoubtedly been a factor in the recovery of the rand; and it is evident, too, in the positive attitude to South Africa encountered more generally abroad - notably, for example, in the upgrades that have already been put in place by the rating agencies, with further upgrades in prospect. This, more than anything, - a well-structured policy framework, steadily and consistently pursued - is what has helped the South African economy to continue to grow through the current world slowdown. This is strong evidence that a commitment to low inflation works, in helping to maintain sustainable growth, and that it will help us to achieve the future growth that is essential to enable all of us to develop the huge potential of this fine country.  
 BIS Review 16/2003 1 Lars Heikensten: Monetary policy and potential growth Speech by Mr Lars Heikensten, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to the Swedish Economics Association, Stockholm, 28 March 2003. *      *      * Let me begin by thanking you for the invitation to come here to the economic association. As a former secretary of this association it is a particular pleasure to be invited here. My intention today is to discuss a broader question than I normally have reason to take up, namely the Swedish economy's capacity for long-term growth. The greater the economy's capacity for long-term growth, the better the development in welfare. And here I am not thinking merely of material aspects, but also of the possibilities of providing young people with a good education, elderly people with good quality care and the environment with a long-term sustainable development. The long-term potential growth rate is also important for monetary policy. A high potential growth rate allows the economy to grow rapidly without inflation accelerating. I shall begin with a brief description of the intellectual framework the Riksbank uses with regard to potential growth and how this affects the shaping of monetary policy. After that, I shall discuss two factors determining potential growth, namely productivity and labour supply. Finally, I shall round off with some conclusions. My hope is to be able to contribute to initiating continued discussions and in-depth analyses in this field, both among researchers and more policy-oriented economists. The Riksbank’s intellectual framework According to the textbook model of macro economics, there is a level of production (GDP) that keeps the economy in balance, i.e. actual and expected inflation are in line with the target level, profit shares and wages are stable, etc. This level of production is often called the potential or long-term sustainable level of production. Despite the fact that the economy is balanced, the potential production level does not remain constant; it normally grows over time. The reason is, quite simply, that technical developments enable a higher production level to be achieved with the same amount of production factors, and that the production factors themselves often show an increase trend. The actual inflation rate can deviate from the target rate (and the expected rate) if the production level of the economy, for some reason, deviates from the potential level. It is often said that there is a positive or a negative production gap. A positive production gap means that the actual production is higher than the potential level. In this case, of course, the resource situation is strained; bottlenecks begin to arise in the economy. The reverse applies with a negative production gap. As the production gap is usually seen as a measure of the demand pressure in the economy and the demand pressure in turn affects inflation, monetary policy is in many respects a case of choosing a steering interest rate that will lead to the smallest possible production gap. If the production gap is completely closed and equal to zero - i.e. actual and potential production coincide - the inflation rate should be 2 per cent as long as a credible policy is pursued and no other shocks occur. Figure 1 illustrates in principle possible future developments. An important insight in this context is that changes in the steering interest rate are significant for production and employment in the short term, but not in the long term. If prices and wages do not adapt immediately - i.e. there are nominal lags - changes in nominal quantities, including the Riksbank's repo rate, will entail changes in relative prices and real wages. These real price changes affect the economy's real aggregated demand and thereby both production and employment. If, for instance, wage agreements are signed for longer periods of time, while companies' pricing is more flexible, lowering the steering interest rate can have real economy effects in the short term, because companies' price increases will lead to lower real wages and higher profits and thereby increased production and employment. In the longer term, when new wage agreements are signed wage formation will take into account the higher price increases and be adapted to avoid changes in real wages. By changing the steering interest rate, the Riksbank can affect the actual, short-term production level but not the potential, long-term level. The latter is determined, as I said earlier, by factors such as 
 2 BIS Review 16/2003 technological developments, labour supply, etc. On the other hand, it is probable that monetary policy can indirectly, by contributing to a more stable economic development, create better conditions for good growth in the long term. Reliable assessments of the potential growth capacity of the Swedish economy are very important for successful conducting monetary policy. Given this, it is perhaps not so surprising that we have spent a significant amount of our time in recent years making analyses of issues related to economic growth. This is demonstrated in our working report series, which contains a relatively large number of studies on this subject. A complicating factor with regard to studies of potential growth is that they entail a quantity that cannot be directly observed and measured, but has to be estimated indirectly with the aid of another method. There are a number of statistical methods for this, each of which has both advantages and disadvantages. The estimated results have proved to be relatively sensitive to the method applied. This in turn means that there is good reason not to fasten on one individual method, but to use several methods and thereby increase the reliability of the estimates. At the Riksbank we apply three different methods for calculating the production gap and we regularly show and discuss the results of these in our Inflation Reports (Figure 2). Before we make our final assessment, on which we base our monetary policy, we also weigh in other information on resource utilisation, for instance from the National Institute of Economic Research's business tendency surveys or from publications of shortages in the labour market. This can also be a good idea as the macro data that forms a basis for the method-based estimates, such as GDP growth, is often changed afterwards as a result of revisions to statistics. The most recent revisions have led, for instance, to an upward adjustment in both GDP and productivity for the greater part of the 1990s. The development of productivity and the labour supply I implied in my introductory discussion that the potential growth capacity of the economy is determined by the constant developments in technology that occur in a market economy and by the trend increase in production factors. A central element in this context is the labour productivity trend measured as GDP per hour worked. This increases through technological progress (e.g. as machines become more modern) or through the addition of real capital (a long-term extension of the production apparatus). If the labour supply itself also shows a change trend over time, this must be taken into account. The potential growth rate of the economy can therefore be calculated as the total historical growth in labour productivity and labour supply. As I will soon show, however, it is often difficult even afterwards to distinguish lasting trends from those of a more temporary nature, e.g. those caused by fluctuations in economic activity. This applies both to the development of productivity and the labour supply. At the same time, distinguishing between processes that are lasting and those of a temporary nature is one of the most important aspects with regard to the discussion of a country's capacity for long-term growth. Let us then study the determining factors one by one. Signs of a better growth in productivity My third slide shows the development of labour productivity, measured as GDP per hour worked, together with an estimated trend (Figure 3). We see that productivity growth varies strongly, but also that it shows a tendency to increase over time, particularly during the 1990s. This is a marked difference compared with developments in the 1970s, when the trend was instead a downward one. During the 1980s the actual productivity growth levelled out at a low level and was often around 1 per cent or below - with the exception of a few individual years. During the 1990s, on the other hand, there was a rapid increase and productivity growth stabilised at a level above 2 per cent.  We don't know exactly what was the driving force behind this development. But allow me nevertheless to indicate some factors that may have played an important role. The economic crisis at the beginning of the 1990s probably played a not so insignificant role in raising productivity growth during the first half of the 1990s. During the crisis years production with a low level of productivity was put out of business and unemployment increased which led to an increase in the labour productivity measured. This one-off effect raised the level of productivity growth but at the same time meant that a large percentage of society's available resources was not utilised. 
 BIS Review 16/2003 3 In connection with and directly after the crisis there were also a number of changes in the Swedish economy that have affected developments since then. New regulations were established for fiscal policy, with an expenditure ceiling and surplus target. At the same time, monetary policy was successfully aimed at safeguarding low inflation. Also during the 1990s a number of markets were deregulated and opened to domestic and international competition. In addition, Sweden joined the EU. This development entails an increased international integration of product and labour markets, which should have had a favourable effect on productivity growth. A further explanation is the shifting between sectors in the Swedish economy. During the 1960s and 1970s there was a rapid growth in employment in the public sector, while the private sector declined. Following the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s the situation was reversed (Figure 4). As productivity growth in the public sector is probably lower than productivity growth in the private sector, this development results in a rise in productivity for the economy as a whole. These effects are reinforced by the fact that the National Accounts are based on the calculation assumption that there is no productivity increase in the public sector at all. During the second half of the 1990s in particular, there was a rapid development in information technology, which entailed greater efficiency in knowledge transfer between individuals and companies and between companies. The expansion of the IT sector was one of the corner-stones of this "new economy". The effect this actually had on productivity has been much discussed. It is clear that the IT sector itself, and in particular the telecom industry, was responsible for a significant part of productivity growth at the end of the 1990s. Developments were very uneven among the different industries, with the increase in productivity in "IT user" industries being much less impressive, despite large investments in IT products, than that in the "IT producer" sector. The latter is also clearly illustrated when the productivity increase in trade and industry is adjusted for the increase that took place in the telecom industry (Figure 5). When this sector is excluded, productivity during the second half of the 1990s increased by only 1.9 per cent a year, compared with 2.8 per cent if the sector is included. The telecom sector has now greatly declined in importance and there is apparent confusion over its future development. The important question for the Riksbank is what all of this entails for the development of long-term productivity growth in future. The figure shows that the trend increase has not been as large at the end of the 1990s as during the period up to 1995. It should also be remembered that the method used to calculate the trend has the characteristic that it reflects changes in the actual underlying trend at a slower rate. In addition, the very high rates of increase for productivity during the latter part of the 1990s reflected both a relatively rapid growth in the private sector relative to the public sector and a strong growth in the IT-producing sectors, particularly the telecom industry. It is not likely that future developments will follow the same paths. Nevertheless, there are many indications that the long-term increase in productivity now is higher than it was during the 1970s and 1980s. Factors in favour of this are the fairly comprehensive changes that took place during the 1990s, particularly the introduction of the new stabilisation policy regime and a greater degree of openness in the Swedish economy. Labour supply a major cause for concern Let us now move on to study how the labour supply has developed during the same period of time. My next slide shows the actual growth and trend for the number of hours worked (Figure 6). To begin with, one can conclude that developments have been relatively adverse during the greater part of the 1980s and 1990s. According to the trend, we can actually only detect an increase during the second half of the 1990s, which was broken recently both due to economic activity and to more structural causes. Several factors lie behind this development.  Once again it is natural to go back to the crisis years in the early 1990s. At that point the number of hours worked declined significantly as a result of the large fall in demand that took place. Parallel with this, structural changes were implemented. Young people on the verge of working life chose to continue studying, partly because of the lack of jobs, partly because developments on the labour market meant that higher educational demands were made. Another explanation could be that the number of older persons in the labour force also declined considerably during the same period. The labour supply in the age group 60-64 years fell by approximately 40,000 persons during the 1990s, despite the fact that this group's percentage of the population did not change significantly. In addition, the number of people taking early retirement increased at an alarming rate. Recently, as we are all aware, the amount of sick leave has increased. 
 4 BIS Review 16/2003 Another factor that appears to have had some significance is that the Swedish labour market has not been able to make adequate use of the labour reserve comprised of inhabitants who were born abroad. The employment frequency among these people has been much lower than the employment frequency among people born in Sweden. This applies in particular to those who have arrived here quite recently. The efficiency in matching on the labour market also appears to be lower for these people. One indication of this is that many with a university education are either unemployed or have jobs below their competence levels. Contrary to what many people believe, however, demographic developments have been relatively favourable during the 1990s, from a labour force perspective. The population growth in the age group 20-64 years developed weakly during the entire 1970s and most of the years up to the 1980s (Figure 7). However, towards the end of the 1980s the rate of increase began to accelerate. Since then it has been relatively high, with the exception of a few individual years in the mid-1990s. The fact that growth in the number of hours worked at the end of the 1990s began to take off was mainly due to the rapid expansion in the private, and to some extent also the public, services sector. I mentioned earlier the discussions of the significance of the "new economy" for productivity increases during the 1990s and as I said productivity growth fell heavily at the beginning of the new millennium. The same applies to the number of hours worked. This raises the question, similar to the case of productivity development, of whether the calculated trend growth in the diagram overestimates the real long-term trend increase. To shed further light upon this we need to go through the causes for the development in the number of hours worked in recent years. The number of hours worked in the economy is determined partly by the number of persons working and partly by average working hours, i.e. how many hours each person works. One factor that has clearly pulled down the average working hours in recent years is the rise in sick leave. It is uncertain to what extent this is an effect of a transitory nature. Various studies have shown that the amount of short-term sick leave taken tends to increase when the situation on the labour market improves and unemployment declines. If sick leave is divided up according to length, it can be seen that the long-term sick leave has increased most over the past years. To the extent that this development is the result of incentive effects, the increase may be of a more structural nature, which means sick leave will not automatically decline when the economic situation deteriorates. In the general debate it has been implied that changes in various institutional factors accounted for this interpretation, e.g. that the rules for qualification for early retirement pension had become tighter and the remuneration level in sickness benefit had been raised. Another important factor here could be that the percentage of older people on the labour market has increased somewhat recently. Is an increase in sick leave the only explanation for the decline in average working hours? No, it is not. And we can see this clearly when we study developments adjusted for absence due to sickness (Figure 8). Here we can see that the average working hours have shown a declining tendency even when adjusted for people who have not worked due to illness. Compared with the period 1994-1995, average working hours have declined by around 3 percentage points and the negative tendency is particularly strong after 1999. Moreover, the other curve in my diagram - for the number of employed - shows that the growth in working hours last year was curbed by a lower increase in employment. This was in turn a result of the economic slowdown no longer affecting just manufacturing, but also the services sector. The decline in working hours appears to depend on three main factors, apart from increased absence due to illness. The first factor is an increase in other types of absence than illness, e.g. holidays or looking after sick children. The second is a decline in the amount of overtime worked and a reduction in the working hours agreed between employers and employees. The third factor is a shift where more people choose to move over from full-time to part-time work. The relative significance of structural and economic factors in this context is again difficult to assess. There are many indications that variations in overtime are particularly affected by economic activity. Although it is more difficult to determine how this relates to the other factors. The assessment made by the Riksbank so far is that average working hours will show a tentative rise when economic activity improves. To summarise, there is reason for considerable concern regarding the future labour supply. If there is reason to be slightly more optimistic over productivity growth, the opposite applies to the labour supply. A number of factors, such as demographic developments, absence due to illness and the proposal for shorter working hours all indicate a decline in the labour supply over the coming decade, unless there is a change in policy. 
 BIS Review 16/2003 5 Future potential growth What does all this mean for the assessment of the economy's potential growth capacity right now and in the coming years? If we uncritically assume the simple model I outlined earlier, we could calculate an estimate of potential growth by simply adding together the trend values I showed in the diagram on productivity growth and the number of hours worked. I have done this in my next diagram (Figure 9). Measured in this way, potential growth was just over 1.5 per cent up to around 1992. Since then it has risen gradually to approximately 3 per cent in 2001. However, my discussion of the causes of the decline in actual growth in recent years showed that there are good reasons to believe that 3 per cent is an overestimate of the growth potential in the Swedish economy today. One way of subduing the effect on the trend of variations in individual years is to estimate the trend as a mean value of the period's actual growth. This procedure gives a trend growth of 2 per cent, which I have also indicated in the diagram. If one believes that the truth lies somewhere midway between the growth rates we had before and after the changeover in our economic policy, one can instead calculate the mean value of the mean values during the periods 1980-1992 and 1993 onwards. The result is then 2.2 per cent. No procedure is perfect, of course. As I mentioned initially, the estimate results vary significantly depending on which method is applied and this is one of the reasons why the Riksbank has chosen not to specify an exact figure for potential growth. We have instead chosen to work with an interval of 2 to 2.5 per cent, which has emerged gradually as we have endeavoured to refine our analyses and improve our knowledge. The interval indicates that we have been influenced by the strong growth figures during the latter part of the 1990s, but that we have been cautious in stipulating to any great degree our assessments of some form of "new economy". A further reason for not specifying potential growth in more detail than this is that new information is received continuously and this affects our assessment. As I mentioned earlier, the National Accounts have recently been revised and the new results indicate a strong growth in both GDP and productivity in Sweden during the period 1993-2002. Such revisions show that there is considerable uncertainty in the statistics and that it is important not to overreact to the most recent figures. When we make assessments of inflation in connection with monetary policy decisions we normally look two years ahead. In this context we also calculate potential growth with the aid of more detailed data. This includes labour market data, for instance, to assess labour force developments with reference to developments in the working population, people in regular education and labour market policy training and the number of people on sick leave or early retirement pensions. A digression on demography Allow me, before I finish, to comment further on demographic developments. One factor that we, like many other countries, will need to grapple is the adverse demographic development that will take place in few years' time. This will entail the percentage of elderly people in the population increasing significantly and resulting in a considerable reduction in labour force participation. Large demands will be made on public finances and the labour supply and growth trends will be subdued. My last slide shows the growth in actual hours worked during the period 1981-2001, together with a calculation for growth during the period 2002-2050 (Figure 10). The calculated growth in working hours is based on Statistics Sweden's forecast of the Swedish population up to 2050 and fixes other determining parameters at the 2002 level. The average increase in working hours amounted to approximately 0.4 per cent during the period 1981-2001. The calculated series' average increase 2002-2050 stops at a modest 0.01 per cent; in practice almost no increase at all.  Conclusion I shall conclude with a summary. A high long-term growth rate is one of the most important objectives of economic policy. It becomes easier to achieve almost all other political objectives if economic growth is good. There is greater scope for private consumption and wage formation is made easier. It becomes easier to finance public sector services such as health and welfare. Higher growth also gives greater scope in other political areas, such as environmental policy.  In addition, the potential, long-term growth rate is a variable of essential significance for monetary policy. The Riksbank cannot itself influence the development of the economy's long-term growth rate; 
 6 BIS Review 16/2003 this is governed by other factors, primarily by how much we work and how efficient the economy is. But the potential growth rate to a great degree sets the framework for monetary policy. Simplified, one can say that our task is to keep actual production as close to potential production as possible. Then inflation will also come close to the target level. Following on from this, the higher the potential growth rate, the faster the Swedish GDP can grow without putting the inflation target at risk. A natural starting point for calculating potential growth in the economy is the growth trend for productivity and the labour supply. Productivity growth has shown tendencies towards improvement during the 1990s. It is probable that factors such as the new low-inflation rate regime and greater openness with stiffer competition have played an important role in this development. However, it is far from certain that the high rates of increase at the end of the 1990s will continue. They mirrored both a rapid growth in the private sector relative to the public sector and a strong growth in the IT/telecom sector. Nevertheless, it is probable that the long-term increase in productivity is higher now than it was during the 1970s and 1980s.  The number of hours worked has also developed relatively favourably since the mid-1990s. However, this development has largely depended on demand, influenced by the fact that there were considerable unutilised resources in the economy after the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. With regard to the labour supply, there is less reason for optimism, partly because the demographic situation will be adverse in a few years' time, with more departures from the labour force relative to entries. Nor are there clear signs that economic policy has been organised to contributed to an increase in the labour supply in future. The incentives to work have rather been reduced in the social insurance system in recent years. There are also discussions now of reducing working hours. The Riksbank has earlier spoken of a potential growth rate in the economy in the interval of 2-2.5 per cent. We have not considered it possible to be more precise than this. Of course, we are constantly examining our view in the light of new data and analyses. When we look ahead two years, there is no reason to change this view now; it is important that no one misunderstands me here. But if the current trends for the labour supply persist, it is likely that we will have to assume in the longer term a potential growth rate closer to 2 per cent than 2.5 per cent.   Thank you!

 BIS Review 16/2003 1 John Hurley: A central banker’s perspective of the Irish and international economic situation Speech by Mr John Hurley, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, at the Finance Dublin Conference, Dublin, 25 March 2003. *      *      * The international and euro area economy This is a time of exceptional uncertainty in the world economy. This uncertainty has been driven by a number of factors, notably the deterioration of equity and financial markets during 2002 and more recently, rising geopolitical tensions and the ensuing war in Iraq. As a result, the outlook for global economic growth has weakened compared with earlier expectations.  The impact of the war in Iraq on the global economy will depend on the extent and duration of the conflict. The range of scenarios is wide but one can characterise two contrasting situations. In one case, a prolonged conflict could trigger a marked increase in oil prices and undermine consumer and business confidence, slowing consumption and investment spending and leading economic growth to weaken. Alternatively, a short and decisive conflict would eliminate the uncertainty that now exists. It is not possible at this point to assess conclusively the implications for the euro area. But the Governing Council has made it clear that developments will be monitored closely, that it stands ready to act if necessary and will provide liquidity should that be required.  The geopolitical situation masks the fact that, by historical standards, this has been an unusual economic recovery. Evidence from the past half-century suggests that typically a recovery in economic growth is driven by rising equity prices and falling savings rates, in addition to low interest rates. Over the past year, however, equity markets have weakened further, while savings rates have risen. These developments reflect to a large degree an attempt to correct the problems of the past, in particular the significant economic and financial imbalances generated during the preceding boom in the US. The current account deficit has, moreover, continued to grow and is now being driven by the emergence of a sizeable fiscal deficit. Ultimately, this situation has to be corrected, and this will undoubtedly have implications for the rest of the world.  With the external impetus to growth likely to be modest, euro area growth will have to be driven largely by domestic demand. However, the recent track record of larger euro area economies is not encouraging. Their underperformance has acted as a headwind to sustainable economic recovery and this situation may change only gradually. In summary, I would remain concerned that, even in the event of an unwinding of geopolitical tensions, euro area growth is set to remain modest for some time yet.  The Irish economy Turning now to the Irish economy, I should say that the Central Bank’s Spring Bulletin is due to be published to-morrow. It will be giving a fairly detailed analysis of how we see the outlook for the economy. I will confine my remarks today, therefore, to a few general observations.  Over the past year or so, the pace of economic growth has slowed greatly in the wake of a much more subdued international performance. With such a high dependence on international trade and a disproportionately large ICT sector, it was inevitable that Ireland would feel the draughts from the developments in the international economy. It was also clear that the high growth rates experienced since 1994 would decline as the economy increasingly encountered infrastructural pressures and labour market tightness, and this inevitably happened. However, the speed of the deceleration in GNP growth was much faster and its extent was significantly greater than expected. Such a sharp deceleration was clearly going to be felt in people’s pockets and on the jobs front.  Given the deterioration in the general international economy, the immediate cause of the slowdown here is the weakness of demand. Export growth here last year is now estimated to have been only about 4 ¼ per cent, compared with average annual increases of 19 per cent, for example, in the three years to 2000. With such a large traded sector, this slowdown was bound to be felt right through the 
 2 BIS Review 16/2003 economy. This has spilled over into domestic demand with both consumption and investment demand showing only modest growth last year.  With business and consumer confidence indicators quite weak, it is unlikely that there will be much of a recovery in domestic spending in the short-term. On top of this, we have the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq and the major uncertainties that this adds to the equation. At present, we are factoring in only modest growth this year in domestic spending. With only a small pick-up in export growth, GNP growth is likely to be a little less than 2 per cent. There is also some downside risk to this forecast.  In this more difficult environment, the pursuit of prudent policies will leave us well-placed to participate in the upturn in the world economy when it comes. An important element in this is that, the rate of increase in public expenditure needs to continue its downward path to a more sustainable level; it should be contained to the 7% planned for this year. This will help to limit domestic inflationary pressures. It would also limit the damage to our competitiveness in the event of a sharp appreciation of the euro.  As our Spring Bulletin points out tomorrow, we still have an inflation problem. The excess inflation over that of our euro area partners is largely a services sector phenomenon. Nominal pay increases in recent years have been much higher than the euro area. While higher productivity increases here have partly offset these differences, these have been confined to a relatively small number of industrial sectors. The strengthening of the euro since the middle of last year has exacerbated the effect of these unfavourable trends on competitiveness. It behoves us, therefore, to focus on all policy areas in order to quickly reduce our inflation rate to that of the average of our euro area partners. In this regard, I am happy to see, as part of the anti-inflation initiative in the proposed national partnership agreement, that representatives of employer and union organisations will work with the Government in an effort to target domestic sources of inflation.  The financial sector I would now like to make a few comments on the financial sector. As a major player in the economy, the broad financial sector benefited from the strong economic performance before the recent slowdown. This was reflected in strong growth in balance sheet sizes and in employment. The IFSC continues to be a success story. The main area of growth in the IFSC has been in the funds sector; these now account for about half of total employment of about 11,000 with aggregate authorised funds amounting to over euro 300 billion.  Irish banks have faced a marked deterioration in their business environment in the past year or so. In response to this, they have become more conscious of managing both their primary and secondary exposures to particular industries and sectors. In terms of performance, it is too early to make an assessment of the overall profitability of the banking sector in 2002. However, some key results published to date, suggest that Irish credit institutions continue to increase profits, but at a slower rate than in previous years. Irish banks remain well capitalised with strong solvency ratios and, to date, there has been only a marginal increase in impaired loans. Provisioning levels have also been maintained suggesting that the banking system is well covered against loan losses. Notwithstanding the currently stable picture, it is important to bear in mind that bad debts lag the economic cycle. Therefore, loan quality will be a topical issue for some time.  Regarding the broad property sector, the weaker state of the economy, together with a continuous expansion of housing output, would seem to point to more subdued prices ahead. In the commercial property sector, prices have ceased rising. The growth in residential mortgage and commercial property lending, nevertheless, remains strong despite the underlying weakness in the economy and the uncertain outlook. Our continuing concerns in this area will be dealt with in our Bulletin tomorrow.  The new Regulatory Authority Before concluding, may I refer briefly to the establishment of the new Regulatory Authority. As you know, the Interim Board of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority has been in place since last April. I have been working very closely with Brian Patterson to ensure a smooth transition to the new structures. We are very confident that we will be ready for the implementation date, expected to be in early May.  
 BIS Review 16/2003 3 As provided for in the draft legislation the Financial Services Regulator will be a new authority with its own independent responsibilities for prudential supervision and consumer protection across the full spectrum of the financial services industry.  In his address this morning, Liam O’Reilly described how the Authority will discharge its functions. Liam and his staff have made excellent progress over the past several months in mapping out the way forward for supervision. I wish him every success in the important work ahead.  Conclusion In summary, the world economy is currently labouring in the aftermath of past excesses, particularly in regard to asset markets, as well as present geopolitical uncertainties. These have seriously affected consumer and business confidence resulting in weak demand across the world economy. The international climate is evidently an important determinant of our economic performance, and there remain significant doubts over how and when the world economy will emerge from its current subdued state. Our own policies should be directed to limiting domestic inflationary pressures and protecting competitiveness. While, our inflation looks set to moderate somewhat, as the year progresses, it will require a concerted effort to narrow the inflation differential against the average for the euro area.  
 BIS Review 15/2003 1 Eva Srejber: Future scenarios for housing finance  Speech by Ms Eva Srejber, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the Institute for Housing and Urban Research, Gävle, 19 March 2003. *      *      * Introduction Housing finance in Sweden constitutes a significant part of the Swedish financial system. At the beginning of this year, total lending from banks and mortgage institutions amounted to approximately SEK 2200 billion, which was fractionally higher than Sweden's GDP. Mortgage institutions account for just over 50 per cent of this lending, which is why it is vital that financial market players understand the housing finance market, its participants and how it affects and is affected by the Swedish economy. For this reason the seminar today can play an important role in advancing knowledge within the field.  There are several factors that affect housing finance. These include demand factors, supply factors and structural factors. I will not be mentioning all of these but will instead be focusing on three important factors, namely internationalisation, changed regulations and adjustments of household and corporate balance sheets. I will also be attempting to make a connection to how changes in these three broad areas influence the financing of housing. Allow me to begin by outlining the developments of recent years as a point of departure for future prospects. A process of internationalisation has been ongoing for many years now and is driven by several factors. The process is particularly evident in the capital and financial markets. It is usually said that when global production increases by 1 unit, international trade increases by two units and capital movements by four. The increased commercial possibilities that arise as countries become more economically integrated are perhaps the greatest driving force. Another force that is driving the internationalisation process is IT. In spite of the IT crash, there is still considerable potential afforded by information technology. While IT companies have suffered badly on the stock market, the use of the technology itself does not represent a "bubble". IT has resulted in better accessibility to both customers and markets as well as to information. For example, it enables mortgage institutions to find buyers of their services in several locations without having a physical presence there. Moreover, it reduces costs for administration, given the initial costs, and this ought to lead to better conditions for consumers. Yet another driving force is the growth of international organisations such as the EU. With 13 accession countries, the EU could soon be enlarged to include 10 new members, and this is leading toward the creation of a very large and important common capital market. Contacts with our neighbours in the Baltic States and Poland will be stimulated even further through co-operation in the EU. The euro area, which is now four years old, is developing and could include a greater number of countries in the future.  Another important development that has affected the financial markets is the introduction of minimum standards in a number of different areas, e.g. for the supervision of banks, insurance companies, securities trading, payment systems, accounting and auditing, corporate governance and money laundering. These standards were established to create a joint foundation in all countries that will form a basis for safe and efficient financial systems. The IMF and the World Bank have assumed the task of evaluating the extent to which the countries fulfil the requirements according to these standards and also to assist them in addressing the shortcomings that are found. So far over 60 countries, or one-third of the members of the IMF and World Bank, have been assessed. In addition, many countries have performed "self-assessments" voluntarily. The increased implementation of international standards is a very positive development as it demonstrates that the countries are genuinely striving to improve their regulations and supervision and thereby also the financial systems. It is not only beneficial for the countries themselves but also for the international community, as it makes it possible to avoid the weaknesses that can otherwise spread in the international network The development of regulations through, for instance, the EU as well as other initiatives including a new, major currency in Europe will help enhance the efficiency of the financial and capital markets. It will affect mortgage institutions primarily in terms of their borrowing costs.  As a third point, I would like to mention the balance sheet adjustments that have followed the share price bubble and which have been having an impact in the financial markets. In the light of high 
 2 BIS Review 15/2003 expectations of future growth, households financed their consumption, and companies their investment, by increasing their indebtedness in the belief that these debts would be easy to repay due to high future earnings and income. Moreover, a large proportion of the companies' financing was obtained via the stock market. Balance sheets became inflated, as did the actual growth in the economy. When earnings prospects later proved to be lower than expected, there was a fall in both share prices and the value of assets. Debt levels appeared high, particularly in the corporate sector. In order to lower their debts, companies had to increase their income and reduce their costs, which resulted in weaker demand in the economy. Furthermore, the declining share prices prompted households and the financial institutions that invest households' money to seek out investment alternatives that appeared safer. The downward adjustment of the future outlook itself also resulted in uncertainty. This in turn was compounded by the uncertainty caused by international terrorism and the attempts to deal with this by putting pressure on Iraq. This contributed to an increase in the spreads between corporate and treasury bonds as well as to greater volatility in the markets. To counteract the effects of balance sheet and income statement adjustments on the real economy, monetary policy was eased in several countries around the world. At the same time, fiscal policy became more expansionary. The short-term interest rate fell while more subdued inflation prospects and a flight to "safe" investments caused a drop in long-term rates as well. The low interest rates together with the search for safe investments spread to other asset markets. The price of gold increased, and there was a rise in housing prices in several countries as households took advantage of the low level of interest rates to boost their housing consumption. The rising property prices counteracted the fall in the value of households' financial assets. This in turn has led to households in several countries continuing to increase their indebtedness, particularly to finance housing.  However, these historically large changes in the asset and debt markets have thus far proceeded smoothly. In spite of the fact that we have seen the biggest decline in share prices since the 1930s, the largest suspension of national debt payments in history (Argentina), the biggest corporate bankruptcies (Enron, WorldCom), one major terrorist attack and a wave of small ones, the financial markets have been strong enough to handle this. Risk diversification and the emergence of new financial derivatives are two explanations for the preserved stability in the financial system. While developments in the real economy have been affected by the balance sheet and income statement adjustments, the business cycle bottomed out at a higher level of growth than was feared, given the considerable imbalances that existed at the height of the bubble in 2000. The economy is now undergoing a slow recovery, driven by the normal cyclical course of events but subdued by balance sheet adjustments and geopolitical uncertainty. Balance sheet adjustments will continue, however, as there are still substantial savings imbalances between different regions of the world. At the same time, the risk of war has caused flight to safer assets and thereby resulted in low interest rates. Recently, there has been an improvement in earnings and a slight fall in credit spreads. Nevertheless, the effects of asset price adjustments on pension funds, life insurance companies and non-financial enterprises are still been felt through various parts of the economy. Should the economy follow a debt cycle in the future, there is also a risk that the currently low interest rates will lead to the implementation of projects that would be unprofitable at normal rate levels. How has housing finance in Sweden been affected in recent years by internationalisation, regulatory changes and balance sheet adjustments? Developments in the Swedish asset and debt markets have largely been the same as those abroad. Shares and commercial property have declined in value since 2000. Investment in residential property and prices of permanent single-family dwellings have risen by 8 and 15 per cent respectively for the past two years. Prices of tenant-owner apartments have also increased. The rise in prices of owner-occupied housing, and to a certain extent the increase in the rate of construction of tenant-owner apartments, has caused mortgage institutions to continue to increase their lending over the past three years by an average of 8 per cent per year. The annual rate of increase surpassed 10 per cent toward the end of 2002. Over the past 20 years, lending by banks and mortgage institutions has grown by approximately 8 per cent per year, while lending by mortgage institutions alone has grown around 10 per cent per year. This implies that mortgage institutions' share of lending has risen over the years. If one studies the borrowing of non-financial enterprises, the picture becomes somewhat different. Here mortgage institutions have become less important. During the middle of the 1990s they accounted for just over 40 per cent of corporate borrowing, but now their share has fallen back to just below 25 per cent. This is mainly an effect of increased international competition and increased bond financing.  
 BIS Review 15/2003 3 The structure of the housing market and housing finance. Has internationalisation resulted in increased competition? At the same time as we have seen large adjustments in the balance sheets of households and companies, other longer-term trends have continued to have an effect on the structure and competition in the housing finance market. The market for mortgage institutions in Sweden is characterised by a small number of participants that dominate the entire market. There are presently a total of 10 mortgage institutions in the Swedish market, which is slightly fewer than 15 years ago. The five largest have approximately 95 per cent of the market, which is an increase of just under 10 percentage points compared with 15 years ago. Mortgage institutions operate in two different markets. The first is a national and regional market for lending to consumers, while the second is a national and international borrowing market. Mortgage institutions' borrowing in foreign currency amounted last year to around 20 per cent but lending in foreign currency was negligible. If mortgage institutions on account of their size can obtain better terms in the borrowing market it should, given the competition in the mortgage market, be passed on to consumers. Although mortgages are a relatively simple, standardised financial product that should be well suited for selling over national boundaries, such cross-border activities have so far been limited. The relatively small number of participants in the mortgage market both in Sweden and other countries can be explained by the fact that these markets are most often highly national in nature with distinctive national characteristics. The sluggishness is due in part to the difficulty in comparing the value of collateral under different national legal systems. This has implied that it is often domestic participants that are in competition in mortgage markets. In Europe, national mortgage markets are rather different. This is mainly because factors such as regulations, tax legislation, market structure, bureaucracy and corporate cultures are different in different countries. Moreover, it means that the costs of entry are high for new participants, particularly for foreign competitors, not least because of marketing. The effect of distinctive national features on the market has also been apparent to Swedish participants that have set up businesses abroad and then operated under other regulatory frameworks and according to other practices. Another limiting factor is the fact that as long as Sweden remains outside the euro area, foreign companies that wish to enter the Swedish mortgage market will have to provide loans in Swedish kronor, as Swedish borrowers do not generally want to expose themselves to exchange rate risk. However, should Sweden join the euro, the interest rates offered by lenders in the different countries of the euro area will become directly comparable. With a single currency, it would be easier for borrowers to judge which institution in the euro area offers the best terms. Swedish borrowers would be able to take loans in euro without exposing themselves to currency risk, and the availability of potential lenders would increase. Differences in regulations and taxation systems, however, would continue to constitute a limitation on increased competition. Challenges for Swedish housing finance ahead of the future Looking toward the years ahead, developments in the housing finance market will be driven by a number of powerful forces: continued balance sheet adjustments, the effects of the continued internationalisation process in Europe and new rules for financial institutions. I shall concentrate on these three challenges. Challenge 1 - Continued internationalisation Allow me to deal with the different challenges in turn and therefore begin with the challenge posed by internationalisation and, in particular, European integration. One of the driving forces behind the trends in the capital and credit markets is increased international competition and increased awareness of international opportunities. The diversification of both financing and investment is increasing, and risk management instruments are being improved. Europe affects the financial markets through the euro. In addition to the 12 euro countries in the EU, there are a large number of countries in which the euro plays a pivotal role either as a means of payment or through some form of link to the euro. In coming years, when the current accession countries gradually introduce the euro, the euro markets will become larger. At the same time, the harmonisation of rules will continue and the markets will become more integrated. Meanwhile the euro has been accepted by the rest of the market; both the United States and the United Kingdom keep just over half of their official foreign exchange reserves in euro. Canada and Australia keep around 40 per cent in euro. There has therefore been a rise in demand for euro bonds and an increase in liquidity in the market. At the same time, the supply of bonds has risen as an increasing number of agents, both companies and states, are choosing to finance their activities 
 4 BIS Review 15/2003 through the bond market. According to the ECB, just under 30 per cent of all bond holdings in euro have been issued by foreign residents. The total stock of euro bonds issued by euro institutions is now EURO 7 400 billion. This market has grown substantially since 1999. The introduction of the euro has consequently affected the interest rate markets. We can see that there has been a dramatic reduction in the yield differentials for 5-year treasury bonds between the countries that have introduced the euro from about 5 to 7 percentage points during the years 1994-1996 to approximately 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points in recent years. In January and February this year, the yield on Swedish 5-year treasury bonds was around 80 points higher than the euro area average. Of course, part of this reduction in the euro area has to do with the consolidation of government finances in the EU countries to meet the convergence criteria, but the risk premium for exchange rate risk between the currencies that has now disappeared has definitely contributed to the reduction. The remaining yield differential can largely be explained by the different credit ratings of countries in the euro area as well as differences in liquidity between various bond issues. The introduction of the euro has also helped increase the width and depth of European capital markets and has at any rate led to almost complete integration of the part of the money market trading that is closely connected to the Eurosystem's monetary policy transactions. The growing capital market in euro is becoming increasingly important as a source of financing for Swedish companies, so far primarily for major enterprises and institutions that can manage currency risk. This would provide a larger financing base without currency risk for Swedish companies if we were to introduce the euro in Sweden. It is not just the interest rate markets that have been affected by European integration and the general trend toward internationalisation. The changed market conditions have also affected competition and thereby the structure among market players. Financial activities tend to benefit considerably from large-scale operation. High, fixed costs in the form of training, highly skilled staff, large and resource-intensive computer and analysis systems, and information retrieval mean that unit costs fall as turnover volume increases. One way to attain a sufficiently high turnover volume for fixed costs or to limit the disadvantages involved in large-scale operation could be a strong specialisation of activities. The trend we can see today in individual countries, of banks merging to create larger entities, is a result of an attempt to reduce unit costs and thereby increase profit margins through economies of scale. However, very few banks have so far established operations on a large scale in other countries. Most institutions have the majority of their activities and earnings in their home country. The consolidation that has occurred through cross-border mergers and acquisitions has generally not yet led to a radically different market in the EU for the services traditionally provided by banks to households and small companies. In this part of the banking sector, there remains substantial overcapacity in the EU which has proved time-consuming to eradicate. Presently, we are seeing problems in the German banking system caused in part by overcapacity, major costs and different terms of competition for different institutions as a result of a slow restructuring of the banking system. On the other hand, a number of banks in Western Europe have expanded into Central and Eastern Europe and given rise to development and modernisation of the banking systems of the former planned economies. The reasons for this are that Central and Eastern Europe constitute a developable market that could soon be a part of an enlarged EU. At the same time, this has contributed to improved profitability in the parent banks as many countries in Central and Eastern Europe continue to show favourable growth compared with the present EU countries. The banks being acquired are mostly full-service banks, which means that the parent bank gets a larger customer base for its financial services, one of which is mortgages.   Another structural trend is a greater concentration of financial activities to certain centres in order to profit from cluster benefits. Companies that produce the same products and services discern benefits from being located close to each other for several reasons. These might, for example, be a skilled labour force, accessibility to the market, suppliers and customers, specialised service companies, market information, market knowledge or infrastructure. They are reinforced by economies of scale that benefit large financial companies gathered together in a few locations. One such example of a financial centre is London. Mortgage institutions with standardised products independent of distance to customers and borrowing in an international capital market ought to be activities that can profit from these cluster benefits. The concentration trend that we have been able to perceive over the past 15 years among Swedish mortgage institutions demonstrates that these are also following this structural trend. 
 BIS Review 15/2003 5 Challenge 2 - International regulations One of the intentions behind the EU's internal market and the introduction of the euro is to create a more efficient market for products and services in which competition increases and customers obtain better products at lower prices. One aspect of this is the EU's Financial Services Action Plan that is to be realised by 2005. The Plan contains 42 measures that aim to remove remaining obstacles to cross-border trade in financial services and to promote financial integration in the EU. At the same time, measures are been taken to support the supply of risk capital in the EU. These action plans will help realise the vision of making the EU the most competitive, knowledge-based economic area in the world by 2010. Three-quarters of the measures in the Financial Services Action Plan have already been decided. This will also affect mortgage institutions, as they are major participants in the markets for both lending and borrowing.  Another factor of importance is the new capital adequacy rules that are planned for introduction in 2006. Put simply, capital adequacy rules are rules governing how much capital a bank is required to hold for various borrower groups for each krona lent. In the new rules, it is intended that the risk weighting will better reflect the actual credit risk. This means that the banks will be more careful in assessing the relationship between the risk of a loan and its return. It will therefore be possible to observe increased risk in the banks' interest rates. The new capital adequacy rules have both advantages and disadvantages. The proposed rules require the banks to hold more capital if the risks in their loans increases. If they do not have more capital than that prescribed by the rules, they must either acquire more capital or reduce the risk in their lending. In such a situation, a bank can decide against renewing loans, which of course would entail severe consequences for its borrowers. There is therefore a risk that the new rules will reinforce cyclical developments. Nevertheless, the new rules entail several advantages: a more all-round, individual risk assessment that better protects savers' funds and reduces the risk of tax payers via the Government having to step in, opportunities for cheaper loans to low-risk borrowers as well as increased interest expenditure for high-risk companies. Consequently, the pricing of loans will be fairer. But how will the new capital adequacy rules affect loans and lending to housing companies that thereby affect the financing of housing? An initial reflection is that the banks will perform a more individual assessment of the object of the loan and the associated company than before. A second reflection is that the banks when pricing their loans will also focus on the cash flow of the loan, which in this case is the same as the company's cash flow. In most cases, housing companies have a large amount of the value of their properties as collateral and this will continue to be positive in the future, but the banks currently focus on the customer's ability to repay after which they look at collateral. The proposed changes to the capital adequacy rules will apply from 2006, but developments in the capital market will probably entail the banks adapting their lending gradually in advance to the new rules. It is therefore important that capital-intensive businesses start preparing their activities for a more individualised credit assessment in the future. Opportunities for finding competitive financing in the lending market at a low rate of interest will be available for those that can convince lenders that their operations will generate a stable flow of future earnings. Higher risks in the form of varying earnings flows, for instance, will cost more. Challenge 3 - The effect of balance sheet adjustments In the wake of the fall in share prices, we have thus far seen the effects on housing finance in the form of low interest rates, which have enabled households to increase their indebtedness at a slowly rising interest ratio. As the interest ratio has risen marginally, this in turn has led to a continued increase in residential property prices in several countries, including Sweden. The lower expectations of future earnings that have resulted from the stock market decline has so far not markedly reduced housing finance demand in Sweden. Thus far, the effect of the low interest rates appears to be the dominant factor. As the balance sheet adjustments come to an end, the geopolitical uncertainty abates and the economy continues to recover, risk aversion will decrease, which in turn will lead to a normalisation of market rates. Consequently, this will dampen household demand for housing finance. On the other hand, expected earnings flows will rise in tandem with the rise in economic activity. The ability of mortgage institutions to find "cheap" financing will also be affected by the normalisation of interest rates. Investors will return to riskier investments as risk aversion declines. Furthermore, rises in long-term interest rates will reduce the value of the bond holdings that were acquired by investors during the current risk aversion period. Consequently, mortgage institutions will face challenges in the time to come on both the demand and supply sides. 
 6 BIS Review 15/2003 Conclusion All in all, most factors indicate that competition in the mortgage market for borrowing and financing will increase. A potential Swedish adoption of the euro, larger markets that generate a bigger financing base, the EU's Financial Services Action Plan, Basel II and the efficiency improvements in the infrastructure for conducting cross-border trade in financial services are all important factors in a future perspective of the capital market. As mortgages are standardised products, lenders will mostly compete through prices, i.e. interest rates on mortgages. Competition will ensure small variation in prices, which is why the question of financing will be of primary importance for mortgage lenders. As competition in the mortgage market increases, the borrowing costs of mortgage institutions will become the decisive factor in their ability to conduct profitable, competitive operations. 
 BIS Review 15/2003 1 Klaus Liebscher: A stable euro for a strong Europe Panel statement by Dr Klaus Liebscher, Governor of the Austrian National Bank, at the European Banking & Financial Forum, Prague, 25 March 2003. *      *      * It is a great pleasure for me to participate once again in the European Banking & Financial Forum here in Prague and I congratulate the organizers for the interesting topics they have chosen this year. I would like to focus my deliberations on the state of the economy, on the stability-oriented framework of EMU, including the need for further reforms required to enhance the euro area's noninflationary growth potential, and - last but not least - on the EU enlargement process. The Governing Council of the ECB decided on March 6 to reduce the key interest rate by 25 basis points to 2½%. This decision was taken in the light of an improved outlook for price stability, owing in part to the appreciation of the euro and the subdued pace of economic growth in the euro area. The latter must be seen in the context of increased geopolitical risks over a protracted period of time, which once again led to higher oil prices. Additionally, a fundamental downward correction of companies' profit expectations as well as increasing pessimism on the part of consumers and investors have substantially dampened demand and depressed stock prices in the industrial world. However, apart from these unfavourable shocks, some structural inefficiencies have also been holding back the euro area economy. Forecasting the future is notoriously difficult - even more so under the current geopolitical conditions. Heightened volatility in oil markets, for instance, makes it more problematic than usual to assess short-term inflation developments. However, on the assumption that geopolitical tensions will decrease over time, more fundamental factors should dominate price developments in the euro area. The significant appreciation of the euro over the past year, which will feed through to the economy via lower import and producer prices, subdued economic activity and somewhat more modest wage settlements should dampen inflation in the medium term. If oil prices moderate, as indicated by futures, inflation rates in the euro area will most likely fall below 2% in the course of 2003 and should remain at levels in line with price stability thereafter. Against this background, interest rates in the euro area have fallen to very low levels, both in nominal and real terms. On the basis of currently available information, this policy stance, while contributing to the preservation of price stability over the medium term, somewhat counterbalances the multiple factors which currently have an adverse effect on economic activity. In the current environment of heightened uncertainty, stability has become an even more precious asset. As is well known, the Eurosystem's primary objective is to maintain price stability over the medium term, since price stability unambiguously represents a precondition for sustainable economic growth and rising employment in the long run. Moreover, in times of severe tension, it is of the utmost importance that policymakers do not lose sight of their primary responsibility, so as to reduce uncertainty and strengthen confidence. Consequently, the Governing Council of the ECB stands ready to act if necessary. And financial markets can rely on the provision of sufficient liquidity even under exceptional circumstances, as was demonstrated in the past. As to military action in Iraq, the impact of this confrontation on the global economy can vary significantly in scope and size, depending on the extent and duration of the conflict. It is therefore not possible at this juncture to conclusively assess the short and medium-term implications for the euro area.  The euro area has established itself as a stable monetary anchor in the global economy. That notwithstanding, one has to acknowledge that much remains to be done. The Stability and Growth Pact obliges euro area member states to achieve budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus in a sustainable manner, in order to minimize the risk of breaching the budget deficit criterion of 3% of GDP in the course of a business cycle. Sound budgetary positions not only create enough leeway for automatic stabilizers to take full effect over the cycle, they contribute to reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio and consequently the interest burden for governments, increase investors' confidence in the euro area and therefore keep interest rates lower than they would otherwise be. Moreover, demographic developments make it imperative to bring public finances into 
 2 BIS Review 15/2003 structural balance or surplus. Even though in most countries the current fiscal policy stance, as envisaged in the updated stability programs, strikes a reasonable balance between letting automatic stabilizers operate and seeking further consolidation where needed, some countries' current consolidation plans lack ambition, particularly over the medium run, once the current slump has in all likelihood been overcome. It is necessary that all euro area countries live up to their obligations in full. Fiscal policy must be part of a comprehensive and growth-oriented strategy, focusing - as a rule - on restraining the volume and on improving the structure of public expenditures. The euro area economy is held back not only by current geopolitical tensions, but also by frictions in labor and product markets. Structural reforms in these areas are of utmost importance to increase the flexibility of the economy, thereby improving its resilience against detrimental shocks and raising the euro area's noninflationary growth potential. Policymakers are well aware of this assessment.  However, the lack of clear and decisive progress in implementing structural reforms weighs on confidence. It is high time to reassure business, investors and consumers by delivering overdue structural reforms. Such measures must be geared towards more flexible labor markets and higher labor participation rates, the full implementation of the EU single market, free and sound competition along with further cutbacks in state aid, and consumer-friendly retail market regulations. This would enhance productivity, thereby making the euro area more attractive for domestic and international investment, it would promote economic activity and raise the noninflationary growth potential of the euro area, and it would enhance employment, thus boosting consumer confidence and private consumption. Indeed, it is up to us to set in motion such a virtuous circle! The policy program of the newly elected Austrian government includes several important measures to foster Austria´s attractiveness for business and investors. Starting out from a small budget deficit of 0.6% in 2002, the government´s fiscal policy stance foresees some cyclically motivated widening of the deficit to 1.3% this year. Looking ahead, the government intends to make significant tax cuts. The cutback of the share of government in the Austrian economy is appropriate and in line with international endeavors to improve the quality of public finances. The tax cuts should be accompanied one for one by expenditure cuts so as to ensure that a balanced budget is achieved over the cycle. Where do Central and Eastern European countries enter this picture? It is my conviction that this historic reunification of Europe will mutually strengthen today's accession countries and the EU. Having said this, challenging tasks lie ahead. First and foremost, we will have to provide stability in a broad sense: political stability, macroeconomic stability, financial market stability and price stability. The framework which is in place provides for such broadly based stability. Thus, enlargement will encourage growth and employment in a wider Europe. Economic and monetary integration of the accession countries will proceed in three stages: first, the acceding countries will join the EU in May 2004, second, the new Member States will participate in ERM II, the exchange rate mechanism of the EU, for at least two years, and third, after the sustainable fulfilment of all the convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty, the new Member States will adopt the euro. Throughout the process leading to the introduction of the euro, the new Member States' economic situations and their policy strategies will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The role of ERM II in this process, first, is to help participating Member States orient their policies to stability and to foster economic convergence. Second, participation in ERM II without severe tensions for at least two years is one of the convergence criteria. Finally, entry into the euro area will be based on the sustainable fulfilment of the Maastricht convergence criteria. These criteria will be applied to future euro area entrants in the same way they applied to euro area countries. It may take quite a while before new Member States will be in a position to fully participate in EMU. A fair share of realism is called for to avoid disappointment. In the long run, such an equitable and strict procedure will be to the advantage of all Member States of the European Union. In concluding, I would like to reiterate that in many respects, the euro has proved to be a driving force for Europe's continued political integration and economic reforms. The euro is regarded as an important token of identity for a modern, dynamic and open Europe. The euro provides a stable anchor in unfortunately not so stable times. But the euro can only shield us from external shocks within limits. Even though the euro has already triggered considerable fiscal and structural reforms, we must not relinquish our endeavors to make the euro area economy more efficient and productive. 
 BIS Review 15/2003 1 David Dodge: The benefits of sound economic policies Speech by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Italian Bankers Association, Rome, Italy, 18 March 2003.  *      *      * It is truly a pleasure for me to visit this magnificent and historic city. I certainly appreciate the opportunity to speak to your association today.  Canada and Italy share many similar characteristics. We both belong to the G-7, and we are among the smaller members of that group. Our two economies vary greatly from region to region, both in terms of structure and strength. Overcoming these regional disparities is one of the great challenges we both face. After the serious inflation problems of the 1970s and early 1980s, Canada and Italy are now enjoying the benefits of a low-inflation environment. And we both trade a great deal with a large partner - in our case, with the United States, in your case, with the rest of the euro zone. We in Canada and you in Italy have recently taken steps to overhaul our tax systems, and we both face the challenges of an aging population.  Given our similarities, there is clearly much we can take from each other. What I would like to do today is talk about some of the lessons that we in Canada have learned about economic policy in recent years.  The "four legs" of economic policy  During the 1980s, a consensus began to take shape among OECD countries on a set of economic policies that would provide the strongest base for sustained economic growth. There are four principles involved in this consensus. I like to think of them as the four legs of a chair. Just as a chair is steadiest when all of its legs are the same length, policy-makers can get the best results by paying equal attention to all four principles. And when one of the legs starts to weaken, the best way to restore stability is to build that leg back up, not to cut down the other three.  Over the past decade or so, Canadians spent a great deal of effort putting the four elements of this framework into place. It certainly was not easy. It involved a fair bit of short-term economic pain. But the phrase "short-term pain for long-term gain" is more than just a cliché. Canada is now reaping the economic benefits of this effort.  Of course, part of the reason for our recent good performance is the basic structure of our economy. For example, the current global economic uncertainties are having their greatest effect on large, multinational firms. But Canada's economy consists more of small and medium-sized enterprises. As well, while the hard-hit technology sector has become an increasingly important part of the Canadian economy in recent years, it still represents a smaller share of our economy, compared with, for example, the United States.  But good fortune is only part of the story. Without Canada's commitment to the OECD's "four legs" of sound economic policy, our recent performance would no doubt have been poorer.  So, what are the "four legs" of the OECD consensus? The principles that I am referring to deal with monetary policy, fiscal policy, trade liberalization, and structural reform. I will spend a few minutes on each of these, drawing on Canada's experience in recent years.  Let me start with the one that relates most directly to the Bank of Canada's primary responsibility - monetary policy. The OECD consensus holds that price stability is the appropriate goal for monetary policy over the medium term. In Canada, we try to achieve this goal through an inflation-targeting framework. The Bank of Canada reached an agreement with the federal government and introduced this policy in 1991. Under that agreement, we aim to keep inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), at the 2 per cent midpoint of a 1 to 3 per cent target range over the medium term.  We have found that this inflation-targeting system has been very effective in promoting low, stable, and predictable inflation in Canada. Following a period of higher and more variable inflation in the 1970s and 1980s, the inflation-control targets have helped to anchor monetary policy. After the agreement came into effect, inflation quickly fell into the target range. Subsequently, inflation expectations have become focused on the target, helping to promote sustained economic growth.  
 2 BIS Review 15/2003 Here in Italy, the inflation-targeting monetary authority is the European Central Bank (ECB). Italy's recent inflation record is certainly favourable. But there is a slight difference in the approaches of the ECB and the Bank of Canada that I will mention. At the Bank of Canada, we explicitly run monetary policy in a symmetric way around our 2 per cent target. The ECB's only explicit commitment is to keep inflation below 2 per cent.  There are always challenges to operating a single monetary policy in a country with diverse regions. As I said earlier, Canada, like Italy, has several regions with different economic structures. The ECB faces the even more daunting challenge of conducting monetary policy for an entire continent! But the important point I want to make here is that both the ECB and the Bank of Canada are determined to keep price stability as the medium-term policy goal. That is the first of the four legs.  The second leg of the consensus has to do with fiscal policy. In the years leading up to the mid-1990s, provincial and federal governments in Canada were in the habit of running budget deficits. These deficits built up as governments continued to borrow, primarily to finance current consumption. It was an unsustainable situation, made more serious by our aging population. Clearly, social spending had to be put on a viable long-term course. And so fiscal policy needed to be based on a plan for putting the ratio of public debt to GDP on a steady downward track.  In Canada's experience, this was a difficult hurdle to overcome. The fiscal consolidation of the 1990s was painful. I was the federal Deputy Minister of Finance at the time, and I can tell you that many difficult and unpopular decisions had to be taken. Equally important, the provinces had to make hard choices as they reduced their public spending and restored their fiscal health. But as difficult as those years were, waiting would only have made matters worse.  Now, here's the good news: the vicious circle of rising deficits and debt has become a virtuous circle of balanced budgets and falling debt. Reducing the deficit in the 1990s helped Canada's international credibility. And this led to a reduction in the risk premium demanded by international investors. The fiscal improvement meant that the Bank of Canada was able to lower interest rates more easily when economic circumstances warranted. Not only did the lower interest rates reduce debt-servicing costs, they also stimulated economic growth, which brought in more revenues for the government. The extra revenue and lower debt-servicing costs, in turn, led to an even better fiscal position. Canada's total government surplus at the end of 2002 represented just over 1 per cent of GDP, which does not include the surpluses in public pension plans.  Last month, Finance Minister John Manley announced a fifth consecutive surplus in the federal budget and projected that the budget will continue to be in a balanced position or better for the next three years. The budget maintained the fiscal planning framework of previous years. That framework includes a $3 billion contingency reserve, which is used to reduce debt if it is not needed for other purposes. It also includes $1 billion in the 2003–04 budget year for additional economic prudence, and $2 billion in the following year, as further assurance that Canada won't fall back into a deficit position. Not only have we reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio, but the federal government has paid down almost $50 billion of debt. This has led to the restoration of Canada's Triple-A credit rating and has freed up about $3 billion of resources every year for the federal government. The main point is that while the initial work of fiscal consolidation is certainly difficult, it is necessary in order to enjoy the fiscal dividends later on.  The third leg of the consensus deals with trade liberalization. Countries need freer international trade to exploit the gains that come from increased specialization, enhanced productivity, and greater competitiveness.  Canada's recent experience in this area first involved signing the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, which came into effect in 1989. In 1994, Mexico joined the group through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Both of these agreements sparked a great deal of domestic political controversy. But they also opened markets and created tremendous opportunities. Canada's exports have flourished as a result.  But freeing up trade means more than setting up regional free-trade blocs, such as NAFTA and the European Union. Canada is hoping to see meaningful progress at the World Trade Organization's Doha round of multilateral talks. Clearly, agriculture is going to be a major hurdle. The developed countries, including all of us in the G-7, have a considerable way to go in terms of liberalizing agricultural trade. And a number of other sectors will also require a major effort. This effort must be made so that the global economy can benefit. It won't be easy, but in the long run, it will be worth it.  
 BIS Review 15/2003 3 The fourth policy leg has to do with structural reform. These adjustments are always difficult because reforms will affect various groups in differing and often painful ways. Further, the economic benefits of the increased flexibility may take a fairly long time to emerge. But these difficulties should not sway us from the task of reducing rigidities and increasing efficiency so that our economies can better adjust to a rapidly changing world.  Canada has made some progress in a number of areas. The federal government has made changes to its system of unemployment insurance, trying to base the program more on insurance principles and to improve the employability of labour. Canada has also taken steps to reduce distortions in the personal income tax system and has implemented a goods and services tax to replace the outdated tax on manufacturers.  More recently, we made some major changes to our public pension system. The Canada and Quebec Pension Plans were established in 1966 using a "pay-as-you-go" system. But changing demographics put pressure on the plans, as they are doing in Europe. By 1996, the federal and provincial governments agreed to changes that would put the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans on a firmer footing. This meant some restructuring of benefits and a sharp increase in contributions - moves that were not popular, but they were certainly necessary.  The Canada and Quebec Pension Plans now generate surpluses that represent almost 1 per cent of GDP. These are set aside in special funds that cannot be touched by governments for general use. Indeed, the federal and provincial governments agreed to set up the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, an entirely independent body. Its sole mandate is to invest the contributions in markets, in order to generate the best possible returns, with due consideration for prudence, over the long term. I should also point out, because the Canadian and Italian systems are different, that all public sector employees in Canada belong to pension plans that are fully funded.  I know that you in Italy are struggling with pension reform, and I know how difficult the issue is. But such reforms are important, and I wish you well in your efforts. The challenges you are facing serve to highlight the fact that implementing the fourth leg of the OECD policy consensus is not easy. But we must all continue to make progress and not lose sight of the four principles.  The payoff that Canada is now seeing gives me confidence in the value of the OECD consensus. Despite the global economic slowdown, despite the collapse of the share prices of many technology firms, despite the effects of the September 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States, and despite the corporate governance and accounting concerns, Canada's economy has remained strong. And most forecasters expect us to lead the G-7 in economic growth again this year.  Given all the uncertainty in the global economy, it is more important than ever that national authorities around the world stick to this policy framework. It is only by staying the course that we can establish a steady base for sustained growth over the long term.  Canada's economic prospects  Let me now give you the Bank of Canada's views on the state of the Canadian economy and the outlook. First, a bit of history. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, the Bank of Canada, like other major central banks, moved quickly and aggressively to cut its policy interest rate to shore up confidence. That dramatic monetary policy action helped a great deal. By the spring of 2002, it became evident that our economy hadn't been knocked off track by the events of 11 September. Indeed, evidence was starting to build that the economy was growing faster than its production potential, taking up the remaining small amount of economic slack. So, we raised our key policy rate three times between April and July, by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point.  But by late last summer, we were seeing the effects of financial headwinds, geopolitical uncertainties, and continued weakness in the global economy. These factors remained in play through the autumn. As a result, we refrained from raising interest rates, even though inflation was accelerating.  Our initial analysis was that this increase in inflation would be temporary. However, both core and total CPI inflation remain well above target. This reflects the impact of higher-than-expected prices for crude oil and natural gas, continuing increases in auto insurance premiums, and price pressures in certain sectors, such as housing, food, and some services. The higher inflation also suggests an underlying firmness in the price-setting environment. In other words, relative price increases wouldn't be pushing up trend inflation if there was not sufficient demand.  
 4 BIS Review 15/2003 Indeed, final domestic demand - especially household spending - has remained robust. However, economic growth in Canada moderated in the final three months of 2002, largely because of weaker exports - most notably, a decline in automotive shipments to the United States.  Even with this slowing growth in the fourth quarter, upward revisions for previous quarters leave the level of economic activity slightly higher than we had been monitoring. In fact, Canada's economy remains near full capacity.  Let me list some of the indicators that support this view: high industrial capacity utilization; near record-high labour force participation rates; a record-high employment-to-population ratio; corporate profits at their highest level since early 2001; and, as I said a few moments ago, above-target trend inflation.  While we continue to foresee growth somewhat below potential in the first half of this year, we expect increased demand in the second half of 2003 and into 2004, as global uncertainties diminish. But with an appropriate reduction in the amount of monetary stimulus, we see the level of output remaining close to capacity during this year and into 2004.  So, in making our interest rate decision on 4 March, we weighed the following considerations: domestic inflation pressures; the expectation that Canadian economic activity will remain near potential in 2003 despite geopolitical uncertainties; the stimulative stance of monetary policy; and improved conditions in capital markets. Taking all of these factors into account, the Bank raised its key policy rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 3 per cent.  Even with this increase, the stance of monetary policy remains stimulative. Thus, over time, further reductions in monetary stimulus will be required to return inflation to the target over the medium term. But, as we have said, the timing and pace of increases in policy interest rates will continue to depend on a number of considerations. These include the strength of demand pressures; the evolution of inflation expectations; the impact on confidence of geopolitical and global economic uncertainties; and the way in which developments in the Middle East affect demand and inflation, both globally and in Canada. The Bank will continue to closely monitor all of these factors.  *      *      * So, to conclude, these are certainly challenging economic times. But we in Canada remain convinced of the merits of the economic policy consensus reached at the OECD. To reiterate, these policies are: a monetary policy aimed at medium-term price stability; a fiscal policy aimed at reducing public debt-to-GDP ratios; trade liberalization; and meaningful structural reform. Canada's positive economic experience over the past couple of years, in the face of stressful times for the global economy, is strong evidence that this framework is the right one. In Canada, there is a determination to stick with these policies which, especially during these uncertain times, are demonstrating their value.  
 BIS Review 14/2003 1 L Wilson Kamit, CBE: An overview of financial and economic developments in Papua New Guinea Speech by Mr L Wilson Kamit, CBE, Governor of the Bank of Papua New Guinea, at the 38th SEACEN Governor’s Conference, Manila, 13-14 February 2003. *      *      * Introduction Thank you for inviting me to this year’s SEACEN Central Bank Governors Conference, and I am happy to present a brief update on the economic development in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Please allow me firstly to summarise the structural developments that have taken place over the last 2-3 years during my absence from this conference. 1. Legislative and policy changes In 1999, the Government embarked on a comprehensive structural reform program, which was endorsed and partly financed by the international multilateral financial institutions (IMF, ADB, World Bank), and the bilateral friends of PNG, including Australia and Japan. One important objective of the reform program was to rebuild the state owned institutions through legislative changes so as to avoid political influences, and to privatise the public enterprises that continue to operate inefficiently. Substantial progress has been made under the reform program to strengthen transparency, accountability and independence in these institutions. The reforms included the financial sector, whereby structural reforms at the Bank of Papua New Guinea were considered necessary to achieve macroeconomic stability over the medium term. A new Central Banking Act (CBA 2000), which became effective on 16 June 2000, enhanced the independence of the Central Bank in the formulation and conduct of Monetary Policy. A revised Banks and Financial Institutions Act (BFIA 2000) and the new Life Insurance and Superannuation Acts were also passed by Parliament in 2000, which enables the Central Bank to regulate and supervise these industries. The BFIA 2000 aims to broaden the scope and improve the effectiveness of financial sector regulation, drawing on international best practices. The supervision of Life Insurance and Superannuation industries was previously under the responsibility of the Finance and Treasury Department, and will be initially taken over by the Central Bank with a view to separate it out in the future. To strengthen its capacity, the Central Bank is receiving technical assistance (TA) from the Australian Government, IMF and World Bank to have in place a supervisory framework to assimilate the Life Insurance and Superannuation participants under its supervision.   2. Developments in the financial system As at December 2002, the financial system in PNG consisted of four commercial banks, six finance companies, 17 savings & loans societies, ten major superannuation funds and six life insurance companies. Over the last two years, two commercial banks were sold and amalgamated into the operations of the other two existing banks. In line with its new powers under the BFIA 2000, the Central Bank initiated enforcement actions against a number of institutions, including the former Government owned commercial bank and finance companies, in an attempt to rectify problems that threatened depositors’ funds or the overall stability of the financial system. The Central Bank also instituted care-taker management for a few large savings and loan societies under the Savings and Loan Societies Act, and liquidated 76 dormant societies as part of its revitalisation programme. Legal action was also taken against several fast-money schemes that continue to solicit deposits from the public. 
 2 BIS Review 14/2003 New initiatives The Bank issued new standards on foreign currency exposures on 28 September 2001, setting a limit of 10 percent of bank capital for any single foreign currency exposure, and 15 percent of capital for total foreign currency exposures. The new standard also requires banks to report their exposures each day to the Central Bank in electronic format.   The Bank is reviewing the existing prudential standards (i.e. regulations) covering capital adequacy, large exposures, and asset quality and provisioning that applies to banks and finance companies, with the TA from the IMF. These prudential standards have been reviewed and implementation will take commence in 2003. New polices are now being drafted to place limits on shareholdings and market share of the banks. 3. Latest economic and outlook for 2003 Economic growth Preliminary estimates of economic activity indicate that real GDP declined by 0.5 percent in 2002, following a revised decline of 3.4 percent in 2001. The decline was due to the continued depressed levels of activity in the mineral, building and construction, retail and wholesale, and electricity, gas and water sectors. For 2003, real GDP is projected to increase by 1.8 percent with growth in both the mineral and non-mineral sectors. The agriculture/forestry/fisheries sector is forecasted to grow by 2.9 percent in 2003, reflecting increased production of all agricultural export commodities.  Balance of payments Preliminary balance of payments data for 2002 showed an overall deficit mainly reflecting a widening current account deficit, due to lower merchandise exports of most agricultural commodities, gold, copper, crude oil, forestry and marine exports, combined with higher imports and net service payments. The level of gross official reserves at the end of December 2002 was US$ 340.0 million, sufficient for around 4.6 months of total and 6.6 months of non-mineral import cover. The balance of payments for 2003 is projected to show a further deterioration in the overall balance reflecting a deficit in the capital account and narrow surplus in the current account. The projected surplus in the current account is attributed to increases in production and prices for the major agricultural and mineral exports. The declining trend in the current account surplus, which commenced in 2000, is a worry and reflects the decline in non-mineral sector exports and higher imports.  Fiscal operations of the government The 2002 Supplementary Budget introduced in August 2002 aimed to achieve a deficit of 3.4 percent of nominal GDP, but is now estimated to be higher due to payment of unbudgeted expenditures relating to the National Elections and general goods and services. With no draw down in exceptional or program financing during 2002, the Government relied on new issues of domestic debt to finance the budget deficit and net external loan repayments.  The 2003 National Budget, aims to consolidate the fiscal adjustments introduced in the 2002 Supplementary Budget and restore it to a sustainable fiscal position. The adjustments would assist in achieving macroeconomic stability and provide the conditions necessary for sustainable economic growth. The budget deficit is projected at 2.0 percent of GDP with reductions to 1.0 percent of GDP in the medium term. To achieve a sustainable budget deficit, a financing gap is required to be filled from external sources. Exchange rate During 2002, the depreciation of the exchange rate was influenced by the following factors: high Government expenditure; persistent current account deficit in the non-mineral balance of payments, due to sustained import demand mainly fuelled by fiscal expansion, low export receipts from the agriculture sector and high net overseas remittances by individuals and companies; increased forward transactions by importers; uncertainties created by the delay in the announcement of Government macroeconomic policies, and disruption to the mineral projects; increase in reserve money as a result 
 BIS Review 14/2003 3 of net maturity of Treasury bills by the non-bank public; downgrading of PNG’s credit rating by an international ratings firm; and negative real interest rates, which contributed to the high net remittances overseas. Since December 2002, the exchange rate has generally stabilized and is steadily appreciating due to inflows of export receipts and supported by low import demand. Inflation The upward trend in the rate of inflation that began in 2001 continued into the June and September quarters of 2002. Significant downward pressure on the kina contributed towards the upward movements in consumer prices. Towards the end of the year, seasonal demand for foreign currency contributed to import price pressure, as retail and wholesale companies accumulated inventories in anticipation of increased domestic demand during the festive season. The 2002 December quarter inflation outcome is expected to be high because of the negative developments of the kina and the increases in the price controlled items. As a result, the annual headline inflation outcome for 2002 is expected to be around 15 percent, significantly higher than the 10 percent outcomes of 2000 and 2001. The annual headline inflation rate for 2003 is expected to be an improvement on 2002, due to positive influences from reduced uncertainties and the tight monetary policy stance taken by the Central Bank, which is expected to stabilize the financial market.  Monetary and financial market development Because of renewed fears for high inflation, the Central Bank tightened monetary policy during the second half of 2002. Accordingly, the Bank increased the Kina Facility Rate (KFR) by 2.0 percentage points in aggregate, from 12.0 percent in July to 12.5 percent in August and to 14.0 percent in November 2002. Consistent with the increase in the KFR, market interest rates increased. The level of broad money supply (M3*) increased by 4.2 percent in 2002, influenced mainly by the growth in net credit to the Government. Reserve money increased significantly in the last two months of the year, due to maturities of Treasury bills by the non-bank private sector. The tight monetary policy stance is expected to be maintained in the first half of 2003, due largely to the following factors: the high underlying inflation rate expected for the December quarter of 2002, and the first half of 2003; the prudent implementation of the 2003 Budget and uncertainties relating to its external financing; and the continued recovery of the world economy and its effect on the international prices and demand for Papua New Guinea’s exports.  Consistent with these assumptions, the Central Bank will maintain a cautious approach in allowing growth in reserve money. This is due to the underlying high level of liquidity and excess capacity that the commercial banks currently have to increase lending and demand for foreign exchange, which may exert further pressure on the exchange rate. Accordingly, the annual percentage change in underlying trimmed mean and headline inflation rates are expected to be 10.6 and 9.0 percent in 2003, respectively. Thank you for your attention. 
 BIS Review 14/2003 1 Yves Mersch: The interplay between monetary policy and fiscal policy in EMU Speech by Mr Yves Mersch, Governor of the Central Bank of Luxembourg, at the ALGAFI General Assembly, Luxembourg, 12 March 2003.  *      *      * Introduction It is a pleasure for me to take part in this ALGAFI General Assembly in Luxembourg. I am all the more satisfied because ALGAFI gave me the opportunity to discuss an extremely interesting issue, namely the interplay between monetary and fiscal policy in EMU. For obvious reasons, I will not refer to the specific case of Luxembourg but will instead primarily talk about the European Monetary Union (EMU) as a whole. However, I will privilege the Luxembourg dimension when the need emerges to illustrate some of my contentions. The advent of EMU has prompted a renewal of the debate on the interplay between fiscal and monetary policy. Although this debate is multifaceted, I will narrow it down to three basic questions. In my opinion, these questions address the most relevant issues at stake. The first question is whether the co-ordination of fiscal and monetary policy should be enhanced in the euro area, in order to secure a more efficient policy mix. There would exist strong arguments for an enhanced coordination at first sight, because of the existence of many interaction channels between monetary policy and fiscal policy. On the one hand, monetary policy affects the interest rate conditions, which have a significant impact on interest rate expenditure. Let me remember you that interest charges represent 4% of GDP in the euro area considered as a whole, and close to 6,5% in Belgium, Italy and Greece. On the other hand, fiscal policy has an influence on aggregate demand and long-term interest rates, which are of course taken on board in the elaboration of monetary policy. Furthermore, aggregate demand and interest rates have a direct impact on the balance sheet of financial intermediaries and, hence, on the transmission channels of monetary policy. The second question is conceptually linked to the first one, as will become clear in my answer. This question is whether fiscal policy should play a more prominent role in EMU, in order to palliate the so-called asymmetric shocks in a context where monetary policy is no longer defined at the national level. By definition, these shocks affect a subset of countries and do not embrace the euro area as a whole. For this reason, they do not play a central role in the conduct of the area-wide monetary policy. On the other hand, however, asymmetric shocks could inflict macroeconomic instability on the Member States concerned. On a priori grounds, this would justify an enhanced role for an active fiscal policy at the national level.  The third and last question is related to whether the fiscal policy rules encapsulated in the European Union Treaty and in the Stability and Growth Pact have a constraining or a favorable impact on the way monetary policy is conducted and implemented, and whether they do not unduly restrict the room for maneuver of national government in a context where monetary policy is no longer designed at the national level.  My conclusion is centered on the mutual reinforcement between stability-oriented monetary and fiscal policies. First question Let me now provide my answers to these three questions. As regards the first one, I would simply say that an enhanced coordination of fiscal and monetary policy is in no way a necessary condition for a smooth functioning of monetary policy in the euro area. From a purely theoretical viewpoint, an improved coordination could help achieve a more appropriate combination between monetary policy and fiscal policy. The resulting policy mix would be more efficient, in the sense that the authorities would be able to fine tune their policy action in response to the type of economic shock they face. However, the conceptual validity of this contention is not so guaranteed as widely held, because several necessary conditions for the design of an adequate policy mix are not fulfilled.  
 2 BIS Review 14/2003 First, it is usually extremely difficult to differentiate the type of economic shock involved - whether the shock is permanent or transitory, or whether it is a demand or a supply shock - except maybe several years after the occurrence of the problem. A fortiori, it is therefore impossible to pick up the policy mix that is best suited to the economic circumstances. This undoubtedly casts a shadow on the feasibility of an active and explicit coordination of monetary and fiscal policy.  The second “practical” argument is in my opinion even more powerful. The cornerstone of the “coordination paradigm” is the contention that fiscal policy is able to impact on aggregate demand in a timely and significant way. For this reason, it can be combined with monetary policy in an effective way, depending on the state of the economy and the nature of the underlying shocks. However, the “ideal policy mix” would turn into a lame duck in circumstances where fiscal policy cannot be activated in a timely fashion and with the expected impact on the macroeconomic situation. In other words, the co-ordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy can be compared to a walking man, who has to stand firm on both legs. Should one of the legs fail to respond in a timely and coordinated way for whatever reason, many adverse consequences would inevitably follow. Although fiscal policy is of course extremely useful in many respects, I am quite skeptical as regards this specific feature that is so important for the elaboration of an appropriate policy mix, namely the stabilisation properties of an active fiscal policy geared towards macroeconomic fine-tuning. This “leg” seems quite unreliable to me, for several reasons. First of all, experience shows that fiscal impulses are frequently implemented too late, after the occurrence of the shock. These delays simply reflect a time-consuming decision-making process. Let me draw your attention on the various steps involved: the identification of the problem, the elaboration of the required measures, the discussion of these measures and their political adoption, their implementation and the time it takes before they exert an impact on aggregate demand. There are many examples of allegedly contra-cyclical policies that turn out to exert a procyclical impact on the economy because of the time lags involved. In these circumstances, fiscal impulses could contribute to magnify economic cycles. In addition, long and variable delays increase the uncertainty about the impact of discretionary measures on the economy. This “impact uncertainty” will increase the uncertainty for economic agents and monetary policy-makers. Furthermore, any stabilisation policy has to be conducted in a symmetrical way in order to avoid a systematic drift in the level of public expenditure. This condition is unfortunately difficult to fulfill, because many expenditure items are not flexible downwards. They could be increased in an easy way when the policy mix requires an expansionary fiscal policy, but a decline of the same magnitude will in all probability not be implemented when a restrictive stance becomes more appropriate. Let me give the example of Luxembourg to illustrate the validity of this point. The compensation of employees and social transfers - two expenditure categories characterised by a weak downward flexibility for evident reasons - jointly account for about 70% of total general government expenditure. On a priori grounds, only the intermediate consumption of general government could be used in a symmetric way and in a timely manner, but this expenditure item does not account for more than 3% of GDP. In addition, it is split between the central government and local governments, which would also require a close co-ordination between these two entities. The weak magnitude of fiscal multipliers in Europe cast some additional doubts on the validity of the fine-tuning approach. All the available empirical evidence indeed shows that the so-called leakage effects are very significant in the euro area countries, due to the high import content of expenditure and, as far as revenue are concerned, a high propensity to save. Multipliers are of course also very small in Luxembourg, especially on the government revenue side, because Luxembourg is really the epitome of a small, open economy.  A final reason to be skeptical about the ability of fiscal policy to fine-tune the economy at discretion is the existence of the so-called “non-Keynesian” effects. Although the concept may seem complicated at first sight, it merely refers to the impact of expected budgetary developments on private consumption. These non-Keynesian effects could further dampen the impact of an active budget policy. For instance, private consumers might be inclined to save more when government expenditure tend to increase, because they expect that more taxes will be levied in the future in order to finance the budgetary imbalance associated with the fiscal impulse.  According to the specialised economic literature, these effects would be higher the higher the level of public debt and the tax burden. Given the very low public debt in Luxembourg, this factor does not play a prominent role in this country at first sight. However, I am convinced that non-Keynesian effects could emerge also in the Luxembourg context, in case the long-term sustainability of public finances is 
 BIS Review 14/2003 3 no longer guaranteed. Thus the need to monitor for instance the budgetary consequences of population ageing and the inflow of cross-border and foreign workers. These various practical problems make it extremely difficult to design an appropriate combination between monetary policy and fiscal policy, and this is further complicated by the fact that monetary policy has to be conducted in a proactive way, on the basis of some projections about future inflationary developments. My answer to the question “is the co-ordination of fiscal and monetary policy a necessary condition for a smooth monetary policy” is therefore clearly negative. In many circumstances, such coordination could even turn out to be counterproductive. It would blur the clear delineation of responsibilities between policy makers and would undermine the commitment of national governments to fiscal discipline.  Second question My answer to the second question - whether fiscal policy should play a more prominent role due to the fact that monetary policy is no longer conducted at the national level - is also extremely clear. At first sight, fiscal policy could be used in a more active way in the Member States in order to palliate the disappearance of a specifically national monetary policy. This more active use of fiscal policy would dampen asymmetric shocks, which would contribute to reinforce the homogeneity of the euro area economy.  This argument is conceptually appealing, but in practice its foundations are rather shaky, to say the least. More specifically, I think that it would be extremely difficult to iron out the impact of asymmetric shocks via an active fiscal policy. This is simply a particular case of my general contention that a fine-tuning, demand management strategy would be extremely difficult to carry out at the national level. This contention has just been made in relation with the first question on co-ordination. My answer to the second question is therefore that an increased role of fiscal policy is not justified on practical grounds, at least as far as an active fiscal policy is concerned. However, the absence of a national monetary policy conducted at the national level also magnifies the importance of what I would call a “passive” form of fiscal policy, based on the free play of automatic fiscal stabilisers. The reliance on automatic stabilisers - basically unemployment expenditure and taxes - would in general be preferable to a more active fiscal policy, because they have a more immediate impact on aggregate demand. In addition, unlike most discretionary policies, they do not have a persistent effect on fiscal variables, since they are reversed as soon as economic conditions change. In Luxembourg, automatic stabilisers tend to exert a more stabilising impact than public investments, because investment programmes typically have to go through heavy legal procedures, which results in long and variable implementation lags. Of course, the free play of automatic stabilisers presupposes the attainment of a sound budgetary position, as will be demonstrated in my answer to the third question. Third question But before I address the third question, let me briefly recall the salient point of the fiscal rules encapsulated in the Treaty establishing the European Community and in the Stability and Growth Pact. The Treaty (and some protocols annexed to it) contains three crucial rules related to fiscal discipline. Since they are widely known, I will describe them in a concise way. A first rule basically states that the general government deficit should not exceed a reference value of 3% of GDP. A second, stock-oriented rule requires that general government debt should not be higher than 60% of GDP, unless the ratio “is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace”. A third rule prohibits the monetary financing of the different subcomponents of the public sector and of Community institutions or bodies. The Treaty is supplemented by the Stability and Growth Pact. The cornerstones of the Pact are two council regulations adopted in 1997. Under the Pact, Member States are expected to adhere to the medium-term objective of general government balances close to balance or in surplus. In order to establish this adherence, Member States are required to present stability and convergence programmes each year. These programmes present inter alia the medium-term objectives for the budgetary balance and the adjustment path towards the “close to surplus or in balance” position. The ECOFIN Council is required to deliver an opinion on each national programme, which gives way to “peer pressure”. In case of a failure to adhere to the Treaty reference values, an “Excessive deficit 
 4 BIS Review 14/2003 procedure” is in principle implemented. Sanctions could be applied in case an excessive deficit is established. In my opinion, this framework is in no way an impediment to the smooth conduct and implementation of the single monetary policy. I would indeed argue that the aforementioned fiscal rules are clearly supportive of a stable monetary policy, for at least three reasons. - First, the prohibition of any monetary financing coupled with the high degree of independence of the ECB and the National Central Banks ensures that a potentially destabilising link between fiscal and monetary policy will no longer exists. A regime in which monetary financing is allowed is indeed characterised by a “soft” intertemporal budget constraint. In such a situation, the government may be tempted to resort to the inflation tax in order to finance budgetary deficits. The resulting situation could be “mutually destructive” for monetary and fiscal policy. In such a context, fiscal discipline could indeed degenerate into a loose fiscal policy, and the latter would in turn contaminate monetary policy. Monetary policy would therefore become unpredictable and would increase the volatility of the monetary base and of the inflation rate. In the extreme case, this situation could lead to hyperinflation, as illustrated for instance by the situation of Germany under the Weimar Republic. EMU is congenitally immune from such episodes, owing to the prohibition of monetary financing and the independence of central banks in the euro area.  - Second, I am convinced that the fiscal rules embedded in the Treaty and in the Stability and Growth Pact are not incompatible with the free play of automatic stabilisers. As I told you earlier, automatic stabilisers are especially important, because they help counteract asymmetric shocks at the national level in a situation where monetary policy is conducted at the euro area level. Provided that Member States are able to reach a close to balance or in surplus position, they could indeed let automatic stabilisers operate in full, without incurring the risk of breaching the 3% reference value. A close to balance or in surplus position indeed means that the cyclically adjusted fiscal balance should be in equilibrium. In such a situation, it would require a very negative output gap, equal to about 6% of GDP, to reach a nominal deficit in excess of 3% because of the free play of automatic stabilisers. This underlines the overriding importance of the attainment of a close to balance or in surplus position. Let me also highlight that such a position would requires a nominal surplus under favorable economic circumstances. In other words, it is essential to apply a strict fiscal discipline also during economic upturns.  - Third, the attainment of a sound fiscal position compatible with the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact would facilitate to a considerable extent the conduct of monetary policy. The absence of clear and binding fiscal rules could have resulted in a non-cooperative equilibrium, characterised by higher long-term interest rates. This can be illustrated by the example of an individual Member State willing to tolerate higher deficits and to issue more debt securities in order to finance the resulting gap. This additional debt issuance would in all likelihood give way to a crowding out effect - namely to an upward pressure on interest rates due to the drain on private savings. The key point is that in EMU - where there exists a single currency and a high degree of integration between national financial markets - this additional burden would be borne by the euro area as a whole, and not just by the individual Member State responsible for the additional debt issuance. This kind of spillover effects could encourage each Member State to issue excessive amounts of debts. As a result, the euro area-wide interest rates would tend to be higher than required by economic fundamentals. Such a situation could complicate to a considerable extent the conduct of monetary policy, which underlines the need to resort to commonly shared rules of fiscal restraints. Conclusion Let me conclude with the statement that the relationship between monetary and fiscal policy runs both ways. First, I would like to point out that the more predictable fiscal policy fostered by the aforementioned fiscal rules would produce a more stable environment as regards, for instance, the inflation rate, aggregate demand or the tax burden. Such an environment would be conducive to economic and financial stability, which would enhance the efficiency of monetary policy. 
 BIS Review 14/2003 5 It also goes without saying that a more predictable monetary policy is supportive of fiscal discipline. More predictable short-term interest changes are indeed liable to impact on the budgetary equilibrium in several Member States. In addition, a stable monetary policy able to anchor the inflation expectations of economic agents will generate lower and less volatile long-term interest rates, which will further dampen the risk of budgetary slippages induces by unforeseen interest rate developments. More predictable interest rates are also extremely important for the Luxembourg general government, in spite of the extremely low public debt level observed in Luxembourg. First, the assets of the Luxembourg general government - including the accumulated reserves of the investments and special fund and the assets held by the general pension regime - are quite substantial, and the associated income is primarily dependent on short and long-term interest rate developments. Second, the soundness and profitability of the financial sector, which accounts for more than one third of all taxes collected by the Luxembourg central government, is very sensitive to the level of short-term interest rates, to the slope of the yield curve and also to stock exchange prices, namely three variables that are either directly fixed or strongly influenced by monetary policy. The importance of a predictable monetary policy for the Luxembourg government is particularly apparent in such a context. 
BIS Review 14/2003 1 Svein Gjedrem: Monetary policy and the economic situation Speech by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of the Central Bank of Norway, at a meeting of the Troms Fish Farming Association, Harstad, 13 March 2003.  The address is based on the assessments presented at Norges Bank’s press conference following the Executive Board’s monetary policy meeting on 5 March and on previous speeches. Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. The Charts in pdf can be found on the Norges Bank’s website. *      *      * The operational target of monetary policy as defined by the Government is inflation of close to 2½ per cent over time. Norges Bank sets the interest rate so that future inflation will be equal to the inflation target of 2½ per cent. Interest rates were reduced this winter in response to the change in the inflation outlook. The inflation projections were revised downwards as a result of weaker cyclical developments in the world economy, a sharp drop in interest rates internationally and a strong krone. In addition, the Norwegian business sector is feeling the effects of the high Norwegian cost level. Moreover, growth in domestic demand has slowed. Household purchasing power has been reduced as a result of higher electricity prices. The weak prospects at home and abroad are in turn having an impact on the Norwegian labour market and the outlook for wage growth and inflation in the years ahead.  The inflation target provides economic agents with an anchor for their decisions concerning saving, investment, budgets and wages. Households, businesses, public entities, employees and employers can base decisions on the assumption that inflation in Norway will be 2½ per cent over time. High demand for goods and services and labour shortages normally point to higher inflation in the future. When interest rates are increased, demand falls and inflation is kept at bay. When demand is low and unemployment rises, inflation will tend to slow. Interest rates will then be reduced. The inflation target is a vehicle for, not an obstacle to, monetary policy’s contribution to stabilising output and employment. This intention is also expressed in the Regulation on Monetary Policy. The inflation target of 2½ per cent is broadly in line with the inflation targets of our trading partners. It is also an anchor for developments in the krone exchange rate. The krone fluctuates. We have open trade with other countries and free capital movements. We do not have the instruments to fine-tune the krone exchange rate. The krone has been strong. As a result, prices for imported goods have fallen. This has led to low and stable inflation in spite of sharp wage growth.  The krone exchange rate fluctuates. This is not surprising because other countries’ currencies also fluctuate. The Swedish krona, sterling and the New Zealand dollar have fluctuated considerably in periods.  The krone exchange rate is the price of our currency measured in terms of a foreign currency. Developments in other countries are just as important for the krone as developments in the Norwegian economy. Capital flows freely and flows can change rapidly. This can spill over to exchange rates and interest rates as well as output and employment.  Currency swings are driven by cross-border capital movements. Capital flows were heavily influenced by investor focus on stock market returns until the downturn began. In the US, equity prices almost trebled between 1995 and 2000. Stock markets in other countries followed suit. The decline was amplified after the downturn in the global economy deepened as a result of terror and fears of war. Investors sought to avert the risk in the stock market. Capital inflows into the stock market resulted in a strong dollar. However, expectations concerning corporate earnings were higher than later proved to be warranted. When expectations were lowered, equity prices fell. Demand for bonds increased, resulting in low long-term interest rates. 
2 BIS Review 14/2003 In response to heightened uncertainty and fears of war, traditional safe havens for capital, such as the Swiss franc and gold, have become increasingly attractive. The Swiss franc appreciated after the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 and towards the end of last year. Gold prices moved up sharply after UN Security Council Resolution 1441 was adopted in November last year. Oil prices fell markedly after 11 September 2001, but have since risen. Fears of war in Iraq have increased the uncertainty surrounding global oil supplies. Strategic oil reserves have risen, while private reserves are low. This has exerted upward pressure on oil prices. The strike in Venezuela has also had an impact. The oil market is unstable. The extraordinary conditions in the oil market will not prevail indefinitely. Major economies such as the US, Germany and France are struggling with stagnation and fears of recession. Substantial tax relief and low interest rates are holding up activity in the US. The Japanese economy has been in a deflationary recession for a long period. In recent years, the krone exchange rate has shadowed the difference between Norwegian and foreign short-term rates. This is why the krone has been strong. In addition, high oil prices have had an influence. The effect of the interest rate differential on the krone has been intensified by conditions in capital markets. Investors have been favouring carry trades. Risk premiums in major currency markets have been low, which seems to indicate that investors have until recently been less prone to speculate in exchange rate fluctuations. As equity prices fell, investors started seeking alternative vehicles. This made the krone market more attractive. The krone appreciated at the same time as foreign stock markets and domestic equity prices fell. Bonds and other interest-bearing securities have been of particular interest.  The interest rate differential between Norway and trading partners has contributed to a strengthening of the krone. Norges Bank has reduced the sight deposit rate from 7 to 5.5 per cent since 11 December. Since mid- January the krone has depreciated, partly reflecting expectations of lower interest rates. Monetary policy has been relaxed.  In January 2003, competitiveness in business and industry was close to 15 per cent below the average for the last 30 years. Following such substantial deviations, competitiveness has historically always returned to the average fairly rapidly. Market participants weigh the interest rate differential between Norway and other countries against the likelihood of a depreciation of the krone in the future. Cyclical divergence may cause the krone to overshoot its future level in the short term.  With the krone exchange rate prevailing at end-January, competitiveness had weakened by a little less than 25 per cent since 1996. The krone was about 10 per cent stronger. On 10 March, the krone was about 3 per cent stronger than in 1996. The rest of the deterioration in competitiveness is primarily due to the high level of wage growth. Wages in Norwegian manufacturing grew by close to 15 per cent more than wages among trading partners between January 1996 and end- January 2003. In the years around the millennium, the depreciation of the krone veiled the underlying deterioration in competitiveness. In May 2000, the krone exchange rate reached its lowest level in six years. The krone has since appreciated, and the effect of high wage growth has gradually come into evidence in company accounts.  In the ten years following the banking and currency crisis in 1992, the economy featured a long period of balanced growth. However, towards the end of the upturn the economy was facing labour shortages, higher wage growth and a sharp increase in household consumption and debt. Interest rates had to be kept at a high level in Norway. The turnaround abroad took place two years ago, but the Norwegian economy continued to show a high level of activity. This led to a widening of the interest rate differential against other countries. The main explanation for the wide interest rate differential is not that interest rates are high in Norway, but that interest rates are at a historic low abroad. Interest rates in the US have not been at such a low level since the 1960s. A further jump in wages in 2002 amplified the imbalances in the economy and fuelled the rise in prices for goods and services produced in Norway. This is why monetary policy has been tight.  The real interest rate, i.e. the interest rate adjusted for inflation, rose in 2000 and was thereafter somewhat higher than the average for the past 30 years. With the reductions in the key rate this winter, the real interest rate is no longer particularly high. The tight monetary stance is reflected in the strong krone. 
BIS Review 14/2003 3 Over the autumn and winter, it has become clear that global growth is weaker than we and other observers had expected. Several central banks have responded by reducing interest rates further. Interest rates in the US and Europe are unusually low.  Global growth is still expected to pick up gradually towards a more normal level, but the upturn may come at a later stage than previously assumed. However, we cannot rule out that the world economy is headed for a fairly long period of stagnation. Low interest rates in the US and Europe are a reflection of this risk. Weak external developments have had negative spillover effects on the Norwegian economy through the appreciation of the krone, the fall in equity prices and lower demand for Norwegian exports. Unemployment has increased, primarily in service industries. The prospects for manufacturing industry are deteriorating. High wage growth is forcing many businesses and municipalities to cut costs and reduce their workforces. In 2002, inflation was close to target at 2.3 per cent, but has been somewhat lower in recent months. The strong krone is the primary factor behind low price inflation. The rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services is marked by the considerably higher wage growth in Norway relative to trading partners. Wage growth moved up further last year, even in industries where profitability had been sharply eroded. A situation where wage growth does not react to the labour market outlook, can give rise to substantial real economic costs. Developments over the past year show that monetary policy is effective and that inflation can be kept at a low and stable level also in periods with high domestic cost inflation. However, if developments in the real economy are to be satisfactory over time, real wage growth must be adapted to underlying productivity growth. A precondition for countering a possible downturn by means of monetary policy easing is slower growth in labour costs. Monetary policy cannot prevent an increase in unemployment that is caused by a significantly higher rate of growth in labour costs in Norway compared with other countries. Nor can an expansionary fiscal policy counter a cost-driven rise in unemployment.  Growth in real wages is far higher than the underlying growth in productivity. If higher costs cannot be passed on to customers, earnings decline and the wage share increases1. Many businesses will have to adjust their workforces to maintain profitability. This leads to a fall in employment and increased productivity. For some companies, this may be a prerequisite for maintaining operations in Norway. The alternative is to close down or relocate production to another country. While the wage share has risen sharply in manufacturing, it has remained fairly stable in other industries. Import firms have wider margins, suggesting that the appreciation of the krone has not fully benefited customers. We also know that employment in some service industries has fallen. Many companies in the service sector have adjusted their workforces to maintain profitability. To some extent, higher costs can also be passed on to customers through higher prices in this sector.  Manufacturing employment is declining. In the public sector, where employment growth has been strong the last few years, budgets will only allow a moderate increase in employment in 2003. Overall, employment is projected to fall by ½ per cent in 2003 and remain unchanged in 2004. Employment followed a similar course in the early 1980s. At that time, employment rose markedly as a result of continued strong growth in the labour force. Labour force participation in Norway is currently at a record-high level, and the demographically determined supply of labour is low. At the same time, labour force growth may be lower than implied by demographic trends for various reasons. More people may choose to study until the situation in the labour market improves. Some of the unemployed may exit the labour market on retirement schemes. Outflows from the labour market and low labour force growth as a result of demographic trends may limit the increase in unemployment. Nevertheless, unemployment is projected to rise, especially in manufacturing. The increase through 2002 primarily reflects a rise in unemployment in the service sector. Manufacturing unemployment remained stable until end-2002, but has increased substantially in the last few months. More lay-offs and lower expectations regarding manufacturing employment point to increased unemployment in the manufacturing sector ahead. In addition, statistics show a 40 per cent reduction in the number of                                                       1  Labour costs’ share of value added after direct and indirect taxes (factor income). 
4 BIS Review 14/2003 vacancies in manufacturing advertised in the last year. Demand for labour, measured in terms of advertised vacancies, is also low in other industries, indicating that unemployment may also increase further in the sheltered sector in the period ahead.  Registered unemployment is projected to increase from 3¼ per cent in 2002 to 4 per cent in 2003 and up to 4¼ per cent in 2004. Unemployment is projected to stabilise at this level in 2005. There are wide regional variations in unemployment. At the end of February, the number of registered unemployed in Troms County came to 3.6 per cent of the labour force, which is lower than the national average of 3.9 per cent.  Agriculture and fisheries combined account for a larger share of employment in Troms County than in other counties. The internationally exposed sector is relatively small in the county. The food industry accounts for about half of manufacturing employment.  As in the rest of the country, the public sector and some private service segments are important for employment in Troms. Business and financial services account for a smaller share than the national average. The work on the Inflation Report drew on information from the regional network that was established last year. We will have six rounds of talks each year with business and community representatives concerning financial developments in their enterprises and industries. There will be a total of about 200 visits in each round. We have divided the country into 7 regions and established links with regional research institutions in six of them. These institutions will hold meetings with the representatives on behalf of Norges Bank. Region North is covered by Kunnskapsparken in Bodø. Companies in the north are reporting lower demand and deteriorating profitability. The same tendency can be observed in most industries with the exception of retail trade and construction. The krone exchange rate, combined with a costly wage settlement, has contributed to weakening competitiveness in internationally exposed industries. As a result, demand and turnover in sectors that supply goods and services to this industry have fallen markedly.  Retail companies have recorded growth in turnover and solid profits in recent months, and our contacts expect this situation to continue over the next months.  Some activity growth is being reported for the construction industry. The increase in activity primarily reflects higher public sector demand.  Workforce reductions in both the public sector and manufacturing industry have been reported. More workforce reductions and lay-offs are planned for the period ahead.  Developments in the Norwegian economy may prove to be weaker than projected in the October Inflation Report. In spite of the interest rate cuts and a stimulatory central government budget, overall economic policy has been tight because the krone has been strong. The weakening of the krone since January has, however, led to an easing of monetary policy. Several years of deteriorating competitiveness will, nevertheless, have a dampening impact on growth in the period ahead.  The business confidence survey for manufacturing industry shows that manufacturing leaders’ sentiments about future developments are negative. Companies report a decline in production, employment and orders for both the export and domestic market. Many companies have moved abroad or are planning to move all or parts of their production out of Norway.  In recent years, the shipbuilding and engineering industries have sustained the activity level in Norwegian manufacturing. Shipyards experienced a sharp increase in new orders before end-2000 prior to the elimination of support to the shipbuilding industry in Norway and many European countries. The level of new orders has since then been very low, and the order backlog is nearly exhausted. A sharp increase in petroleum investment could provide positive growth impulses to the offshore-related industry. The demand impulses from petroleum investment to the mainland economy may, however, be weaker than has been the case earlier. Construction and installations with a high import content will account for a large share of the increase in investment from 2002 to 2003. Due to the high cost level in Norway, a growing number of contracts are also being awarded to foreign companies. At the same time, Norwegian shipyards are increasingly using foreign subcontractors in low-cost countries. This is having an impact on the Norwegian engineering industry.  Many service industries have had to adjust capacity in pace with changes in operating parameters. Investment in service sectors has fallen sharply, and is expected to continue to fall. There is considerable excess capacity in the commercial building market. Over the past year, there has been 
BIS Review 14/2003 5 extensive restructuring and downscaling, especially in the ICT sector and the airline industry. With the prospect of continued weak developments in the global economy and an uncertain stock market, reductions in capacity may still be necessary.  The fall in share prices reflects weaker expectations concerning future earnings. This may prompt enterprises to postpone or cancel investment plans. When share prices are low, companies may also find that raising capital by means of new issues is not an attractive alternative.  Strong growth in private consumption has contributed to sustaining activity in the Norwegian economy. Sharp wage growth, combined with reductions in direct and indirect taxes, resulted in close to 5% growth in household real disposable income last year. Real income growth will be considerably lower in 2003 and probably lower than projected earlier. Imbalances in the Norwegian electricity market have resulted in a sharp increase in electricity prices. This implies a considerable reduction in household real income growth. The interest rate reductions this winter will have the opposite effect. In addition, developments in employment are expected to be weaker and wage growth somewhat lower this year than previously projected.  During the last six months, households have become less optimistic about the economic outlook. Increased uncertainty in the labour market and lower confidence point to heightened caution and increased saving in the household sector. Lower interest rates have the opposite effect. Household saving behaviour may also be affected by high electricity prices. On the whole, a moderate, temporary decline in household saving is expected in 2003. Next year, a normalisation of electricity prices will contribute to increasing real income growth compared with 2003. At the same time, we have assumed that a share of the increased use of petroleum revenues over the central government budget will entail increased transfers or tax cuts for households. These factors, combined with lower interest rates, may fuel relatively brisk growth in private consumption in the next few years.  In the last few months, house prices have risen at a slower pace than in previous years. Activity in the housing market has declined and it takes longer to sell a dwelling. Growth in household borrowing remains high, but has eased somewhat recently. Weaker developments in house prices and reduced household optimism may further restrain credit growth in the future. Growth in mainland GDP is projected to be lower than trend growth, at 1¼% in 2003 and 2% in 2004. In 2005, growth is projected at 2¼%.  The underlying rise in prices in the coming year will be marked by the appreciation of the krone over the last two years. Despite high wage growth, the year-on-year rise in consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) will most likely range between 1½ and 2% until the summer. Subsequent developments will partly depend on externally generated inflationary impulses, changes in the exchange rate and how these changes feed through to consumer prices in Norway. The sharp rise in electricity prices may also affect other consumer prices. Wage developments this year and next will play an important role over the next one to two years. The inflation projections depend on the assumptions concerning the interest rate and the exchange rate. In the Inflation Report, we presented two alternative paths for the Norwegian economy. We judged that a gradual easing of monetary policy seemed appropriate. In one scenario, the tight monetary policy stance was held unchanged. Inflation then fell below target over the next few years. In another scenario, monetary policy was relaxed in line with market expectations. Inflation then moved up and was higher than the inflation target.  Actual developments may, however, deviate from both paths. Norges Bank will continuously assess developments in the global economy, the Norwegian economy and the krone exchange rate, and set the interest rate with a view to achieving the inflation target. 
 BIS Review 13/2003 1 Jarle Bergo: Oil - economic policy challenges Address by Mr Jarle Bergo, Deputy Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the 2003 Southern Norway Conference, Kristiansand, 11 March 2003.  The address is based on the assessments presented at Norges Bank's press conference following the Executive Board's monetary policy meeting on 5 March and on previous speeches. Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation.  *      *      * Oil is a major component of the Norwegian economy - with all the advantages and disadvantages this entails. Oil gives us an economic base that is not available to many other countries. But it also presents us with considerable challenges. How should we use our petroleum wealth wisely? This question poses a number of economic policy challenges. In my discussion today, I will focus on three points:  First, we must manage our petroleum resources recognising that they are part of our national wealth. When oil is extracted and sold, natural assets are transformed into financial wealth. This is not income in the ordinary sense. Norway’s national wealth belongs not only to our generation, but also to future generations. This means that our petroleum wealth must be equitably distributed between generations. The authorities must therefore be disciplined and apply long-term considerations in their spending.  Moreover, the size of the cash flow from petroleum activities varies considerably. If it were to be used as it accrues, this would have an enormous impact on demand impulses in the Norwegian economy, and dramatically amplify cyclical fluctuations.  Third, the use of petroleum revenues will have an impact on competitiveness in Norwegian business and industry. A high level of earnings and substantial fluctuations in the use of petroleum revenues may have a considerable impact on the operating parameters for internationally exposed industries. It is therefore important that we succeed in maintaining an industry structure that promotes learning, innovation and development.  We are now in a phase where petroleum wealth is being converted from natural resources under the seabed to financial assets abroad.  Both types of wealth involve large amounts of capital and are part of our national wealth, which provides the basis for Norway’s potential consumption over the long term. Consequently, it is crucial that our national wealth is managed in a sound and prudent manner, so that the return will be high and the risks acceptable.  Petroleum production generates a profit in excess of a normal return, i.e. economic rent. As economic rent accrues to the state, this gives the central government a cash flow from petroleum activities. Thus, the central government is now accumulating substantial capital.  Management of the Petroleum Fund poses challenges. At the same time, there is a demographic challenge to be faced: the working population will decline sharply, and the proportion receiving income from the public sector will rise.  The chart illustrates developments in the labour force and the number of pensioners in the period up to 2050. The blue line shows that the labour force is projected to increase by about 150 000 from 2000 to 2030. Old-age and disability pensioners will increase by some 500 000, shown by the grey line. This means that the number of persons in the labour force relative to the number of pensioners will fall from 2.6 to 1.8. These rough estimates are among other things based on the assumption that labour immigration remains at the present level.  The increase in the number of pensioners will result in a sharp increase in the obligations of old-age and disability pension funds. Expenditure on old-age and disability pensions is expected to more than double as a share of total GDP in the course of the next 30 years. The increase in the number of elderly, especially those over the age of 80, will in time require an increase in resources for nursing and care services. Welfare reforms that have been adopted will also contribute to increasing the need for resources in the public service sector in the years ahead.  
 2 BIS Review 13/2003 With an ageing population and strong growth in expenditure on pensions and nursing and care services, our petroleum wealth will be a welcome source of revenues. This is why it is particularly important that it is managed in a sound manner.  Petroleum activities are a substantial component of the Norwegian economy. In the chart, petroleum investment is shown by the blue line, while the red line shows the central government’s net cash flow from petroleum activities. Petroleum investment rose sharply in the 1970s and has subsequently varied between 4 and 8 per cent of GDP. Petroleum investment fluctuates considerably and has a substantial impact on cyclical developments in the Norwegian economy. The authorities can only regulate petroleum investment to a limited extent. It is therefore difficult to prevent the impulses to the Norwegian economy that are generated by these fluctuations. Consequently, it is all the more important to prevent fluctuations in the cash flow to the central government from these activities from having a direct impact on the economy.  Allow me to illustrate the consequences this might have: Let us suppose that the oil price temporarily increased by NOK 20 per barrel, or a little less than USD 3 per barrel. This is a small change, well within normal variations from one year to the next. The central government’s net cash flow from petroleum activities would then increase by around NOK 16 billion the first year and NOK 20-22 billion the next. This corresponds to almost 2 per cent of Norway's annual GDP.  If the increase in the cash flow is taken into the economy through higher expenditure or reduced taxes in the central government budget, aggregate domestic demand will be affected. Higher expenditure requires an increase in the public sector's use of real resources, primarily labour. Two per cent of GDP is then a substantial figure. If the increase in petroleum revenues is used domestically, this would correspond to almost all the annual growth in the mainland economy in a normal year. If the private sector of the economy is also expanding, and the economy is already close to its capacity limit, this policy would swiftly lead to strong pressures on economic resources. This would result in a rise in wages and prices. This policy would also lead to unstable conditions in the foreign exchange market. When oil prices then fell again and central government expenditure dropped, the economy would experience a very strong contraction.  The Government Petroleum Fund was established in 1990 with a view to safeguarding long-term considerations in the use of petroleum revenues. The idea behind the Petroleum Fund is that the cash flow from an increase in the oil price should accrue to the Fund and be invested abroad and that the increase in the oil price should not affect the wider budget. Thus, rather than affecting the domestic economy, the increase in the cash flow would be invested abroad through the Petroleum Fund. Similarly, a fall in the oil price would not affect the domestic economy, but would result in lower accumulation of foreign assets. By building up the Fund, the aim of ensuring that several generations will enjoy the benefits of our petroleum wealth is also taken into account.  In March 2001, the fiscal guideline and new guidelines for monetary policy were introduced. The guideline for fiscal policy implies that the central government budget deficit shall be equivalent over time to the expected real return on the Government Petroleum Fund. The new guidelines for economic policy received broad support in the Storting.  The guideline specifying that only the real return on the Petroleum Fund is to be used means that the capital in the Fund is not depleted. The capital in the Petroleum Fund will increase as long as there is a positive cash flow (to the central government) from petroleum activities. When the conversion from petroleum assets to financial wealth has been completed, the objective will still be to restrict withdrawals so that the real value of the Fund’s capital is maintained - in principle, indefinitely.  The guideline thereby provides a long-term anchor for fiscal policy. The guideline provides a stable framework that contributes to curbing fluctuations in the Norwegian economy that are caused by converting petroleum assets into investment at home and abroad. The guideline has been adhered to in the past two years.  As mentioned, the largest conversion of our national wealth in the next thirty years will be from oil as recoverable reserves to oil as financial wealth. The question might, of course, be raised as to whether an alternative option would be to keep our wealth in the form of oil and extract what we needed. Whether this would be profitable or not depends on oil price developments compared with the return on financial assets.  
 BIS Review 13/2003 3 If we look at the period from 1986 and compare developments in nominal oil prices with the return on a fund managed according to the Petroleum Fund's investment strategy - a global portfolio containing bonds and equities in a 60-40 distribution - we see that the fund would have yielded a far higher annual return.  What about the risk? How is it affected by a conversion from oil to financial wealth? History provides us with a clear, if somewhat surprising answer. A conversion from oil to financial wealth increases the return and at the same time reduces the risk. This is because wealth under the seabed (somewhat simplified) only consists of one asset, petroleum, while broadly invested financial wealth is highly diversified in many instruments whose return fluctuates at different rates.  Today the distribution between financial wealth (the Petroleum Fund) and petroleum is about 20-80. If we venture to base our assessment on historical relationships, it is fairly clear that we have, relatively speaking, too much oil in our portfolio and that the current conversion to financial wealth is to our advantage. We have no guarantee, of course, that history will repeat itself, but relying on the opposite requires considerable courage.  The Petroleum Fund can be invested in two main types of instruments; bonds and equities. The international bond market is about the same size as the equity market. Government bonds are a relatively safe investment, but the return is low. Long-term rates in the US and Europe currently stand at around 4 per cent. New investments will thus achieve an annual real rate of return of 1½-2 per cent. By way of comparison, the authorities have based their use of petroleum revenues over the central government budget on the assumption that the Petroleum Fund can generate a long-term real return of 4 per cent. It is unlikely that this rate of return will be achieved if we only invest in bonds.  Buying a bond means lending money to others. Buying equities is the same as investing in real assets. Buying equities gives us direct ownership of the means of production in global business and industry. On the one hand, these ownership rights provide high returns when companies are flourishing. On the other, shareholders are the first to sustain losses when companies fail. Consequently, the return on shares fluctuates far more than the return on bonds, reflecting the higher level of risk. Over the past 75 years, equity returns in the US market have been negative almost every third year.  An investor will only invest in high-risk vehicles if it is reasonable to expect compensation for the risk. The compensation for high risk in the stock market is a far higher average return for equities compared with bonds. Since 1926, the annual return on US equities has on average been 4.8 percentage points higher than the return on bonds. Also in most ten-year periods, investing in US equities has been profitable, with the exception of the depression in the 1930s and the last half of the 1970s. Equity returns have been negative after ten years only in the years between 1928 and 1938, in other words on equity investments made the year before the 1929 stock market crash.  It may also be worth noting that equities purchased during recessions - such as in the mid-1930s and mid-1970s - brought solid returns ten years later. The picture is the same for most other countries.  Since short-term fluctuations in equity prices are difficult to predict, it may be a sound strategy to keep the share of equities constant over time. This means buying a relatively large volume of equities when prices are low, and buying a smaller volume - or selling - when prices are high. This is the strategy applied by the Petroleum Fund.  Let us now revert to the Norwegian economy and Norwegian economic policy. The revision of economic policy in March 2001 can to some extent be said to be a consequence of our oil economy. The new guidelines have also changed the interaction between the different components of economic policy. Fiscal policy will now have an expansionary effect. In order to prevent pressure from becoming too strong, monetary policy has to be tighter than would otherwise have been the case. Monetary policy has therefore been given a clearer role in stabilising economic developments.  A clear monetary policy target is a necessary complement to the fiscal guideline with a view to ensuring reasonable macroeconomic stability. The operational target of monetary policy as defined by the Government is inflation of close to 2.5 per cent over time. The inflation target provides economic agents with an anchor for their decisions concerning saving, investment, budgets and wages. Households, businesses, public entities, employees and employers can base decisions on the assumption that inflation in Norway will be 2½ per cent over time.  The rise in labour costs is an important factor underlying Norges Bank’s assessment of the inflation outlook and interest rate decisions. If wage growth is too high - both in manufacturing industry and other industries - the internationally exposed sector will be affected in two ways. First, high wage 
 4 BIS Review 13/2003 growth will itself reduce earnings and employment. Second, the interest rate will be raised. Normally, this will lead to an appreciation of the krone, with a further reduction in earnings and employment. This will amplify the impact of high wage growth on manufacturing industry. Since the new guidelines on the use of petroleum revenues were introduced in a period when the labour market was tight, the krone was expected to be strong in periods.  The interest rate differential between Norway and trading partners has resulted in a strong krone. The wide interest rate differential is due to the historically low level of interest rates abroad. The slowdown in global growth has been more pronounced and spanned a longer period than we had expected. The Norwegian economy has also felt the effects of this. Norges Bank has therefore lowered the sight deposit rate from 7 to 5.5 per cent since 11 December, most recently on 5 March. The interest rate differential has narrowed. Since mid-January, the krone has depreciated, partly reflecting expectations of lower interest rates. Monetary policy has been relaxed.  There is uncertainty associated with developments in many of the factors that will influence inflation ahead, among others the exchange rate. This implies a gradual approach to the conduct of monetary policy.  Increased spending of petroleum revenues will have implications for Norway’s industry structure. High demand for goods and services that require domestic resources, necessitates higher employment in the sheltered sector. This labour has to be recruited from the exposed sector, or through the natural increase in the labour force finding its way to the sheltered sector.  Even if employment and output in Norwegian manufacturing industry fall, developments for Norwegian enterprises may not necessarily be only negative. Some enterprises may be at the cutting edge of technology, and increase their efficiency in pace with the rise in costs in Norway.  Others may relocate labour-intensive activities abroad. The scaling back of manufacturing still involves a risk. It makes the economy more vulnerable; the foundation for learning, innovation and development may be undermined when a smaller share of the business sector is exposed to intense international competition.  Even with a sustained extra currency income in the form of the return on the Petroleum Fund, the main share of Norwegian imports must be financed using revenues deriving from exports of goods and services from mainland Norway. This places demands on profitability in exposed industries. In the long run, cost competitiveness must be adapted to the need for financing imports and securing balance in the external economy.  Imports currently account for more than 30 per cent of GDP in Norway. The return on the Petroleum Fund will range between 4-5 per cent of GDP when the bulk of our oil resources have been extracted and converted into financial wealth. This means that no more than close to 1/5 of imports can be financed on the basis of oil in the long run. In other words, if the share of imports is to remain at the current level, a sizeable internationally exposed sector will be needed to finance imports.  Both our petroleum wealth and financial wealth are sizeable. However, it is the discounted value of our own labour that is our predominant asset. Our livelihood essentially depends, and will continue to depend in the future, on our ability to produce goods and services efficiently through our labour, and to use our creativity and innovation to become ever more efficient.  This can be illustrated by the following example: If a perception that oil has made us so wealthy that we can to some extent relax leads to a reduction in annual productivity growth of a quarter percentage point, i.e. a reduction in trend GDP growth from the current level of about 2 per cent to 1¾ per cent, the income base would be reduced by more than the entire return on petroleum wealth.  Societies that suddenly gain access to wealth deriving from natural resources have a tendency to spend the money and then fall into decline. A very clear example of this can be found in Spain already in the 1660s. The colonisation of South and Central America gave this country access to a wealth of natural resources, and to gold. Spain chose to spend a large portion of the windfalls on luxury and war. The attitude to working that this led to did not make it easy for these countries to get back on their feet again when the gold came to an end.  Many countries have had similar experiences in more recent times. The expression “Dutch disease” comes from the turn of events in the Dutch economy in the 1970s and 1980s after the revenues from the large gas finds in the Groningen field were used to finance strong growth in public spending. When the gas revenues declined, economic growth came to a halt and economy policy had to be tightened.  
 BIS Review 13/2003 5 Several studies of the relationship between long-term economic growth and natural resources show that countries with an abundant suppy of natural resources have tendency to experience lower economic growth. Why? In principle, an abundance of natural resources is an advantage for a country's economy.  One of the main findings of the studies on the relationship between long-term economic growth and the supply of natural resources is illustrated in the chart. The chart was made by Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Warner, two of the most prominent researchers who have studied the phenomenon that has come to be known as the “resource curse”. They use the size of a country’s exports of natural resources in relation to GDP in 1970 to measure how rich the various countries are in terms of natural resources. There is a negative correlation between the supply of natural resources and economic growth in the period 1970-1989. The group of countries with the highest growth rates includes the Asian tigers, which have had a very limited supply of natural resources. Several of the oil-rich countries around the Persian Gulf fall into the group of countries with the lowest growth. This could suggest that it is not necessarily an advantage to have an abundance of natural resources. There are many factors that influence economic growth. Sachs and Warner only look at one of these factors in their chart. The relationship has proved to be relatively robust, however. It is true that some economists have argued that the negative relationship does not apply when institutional factors in the countries included in the study are taken into account.  Venezuela is one of the poorest performing countries in the Sachs and Warner study. The country has the largest known oil reserves in the world, and also has an abundance of other natural resources. Venezuela has been among the largest oil producers since the 1920s. But as a result of an unsound economic policy, the country has not been able to achieve solid and stable economic growth. After the rise in oil prices in the 1970s, government spending increased sharply. In the 1980s, fiscal policy was also highly expansionary. The result was high inflation and rising unemployment. Close to 85 per cent of the country’s population is living in poverty. Economic growth has been weak. Between 1970 and 2002, GDP per capita has fallen by about 20 per cent.  Why have many countries failed to make good use of windfalls? There may be a number of reasons. In terms of economic policy, an explanation is that the wealth deriving from the resources leads to an extreme focus on acquiring as much of this extra wealth by various groups. The contest for this profit is often referred to as “rent-seeking behaviour”. Countries with an abundance of natural resources may be more vulnerable to extreme “rent-seeking behaviour” than economies with a limited supply of natural resources. The competition between the various factions can lead to an inefficient tapping of natural resources and an unsound use of revenues. The spirit of enterprise, talent and energy in both business and political life are used to acquire a share of this income rather than to foster productive activity in both the public and private sector. For an individual company or a group, this activity may seem rational - a 10 per cent chance to win the jackpot could be better than investing in a business that yields an ordinary return. This may have damaging consequences for a country.  A sociological explanation is that easily acquired wealth weakens the incentive for innovation and work. We feel that we have become rich and want to live the good life. A possible economic explanation is that a large and broad sector that is exposed to international competition fosters learning and development. Without such a sector, the competitive intensity in the economy may decline and the ability and willingness to be innovative may be impaired.  We must be cautious about drawing final conclusions based on historical comparisons. We would prefer to assume that we are managing our wealth better. However, it may be of particular relevance to highlight three critical pre-conditions for succeeding in this. First: Decision-making forms and processes in the political and economic arena must provide effective protection against the acquisition by interest groups of the right to use large shares of the petroleum wealth. Second: It is important for the growth potential in the economy that we maintain a broad sector in the mainland economy that works under intense competition so that we maintain and strengthen the incentive to acquire knowledge and to be innovative. Third: It is important that we bear in mind the issue of distribution across generations and that we manage the wealth as an asset.

 BIS Review 13/2003 1 European Central Bank: Press conference - introductory statement Introductory statement by Mr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank and Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the press conference held in Frankfurt, 6 March 2003. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. We have comprehensively reviewed monetary, financial and economic developments today. We concluded that the outlook for price stability over the medium term has improved in recent months, owing in particular to the subdued pace of economic growth and the appreciation of the exchange rate of the euro. As a result, the Governing Council has decided to lower the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Let me explain our assessment of recent economic developments in more detail. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 7.1% in the period from November 2002 to January 2003, compared with 6.9% in the period from October to December 2002. The continued strong monetary growth reflects an ongoing pronounced preference for liquidity in an environment of high financial, economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Although liquidity remains ample, it is not expected at this stage to give rise to inflationary pressures, given the current economic context and the expectation that some of the portfolio shifts will be reversed once the financial market uncertainty diminishes. Recent data on loans to the private sector, notably the weak growth in loans to non-financial corporations in late 2002, confirm this assessment. Turning to the analysis under the second pillar, available data and surveys indicate that economic activity in the euro area remained sluggish in late 2002 and in the first months of 2003. In light of recent developments, the outlook for economic growth in the euro area in 2003 has weakened compared with previous expectations, owing especially to the geopolitical tensions and the associated rise in oil prices. Accordingly, only a very modest rate of economic growth should now be expected this year. Considering price developments, according to Eurostat, annual HICP inflation is estimated to have been 2.3% in February 2003, slightly up from 2.2% in January. The main factor behind this change seems to be the rise in oil prices. In addition, some base effects related to food prices may have contributed to the renewed increase in annual inflation in February.  The ongoing volatility in oil markets makes it difficult to forecast short-term inflation developments. However, once some normalisation in these markets has occurred, more fundamental factors should dominate price developments. First, the significant appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro over the past year is expected to continue to feed through the economy into consumer prices, via import and producer prices. Second, the moderate pace of economic growth should also reduce inflationary pressures, influencing price and cost-setting behaviours. If oil prices moderate in the future, as currently expected by markets, the most likely outcome will be that inflation rates will fall below 2% in the course of 2003 and remain clearly at levels in line with price stability thereafter.  This baseline scenario relies on the assumption that, especially in an environment of subdued economic growth, wage moderation will prevail. In fact, some recent indications suggest more modest wage developments towards the end of last year, but this picture would need to be confirmed in the future. Overall, ECB key interest rates have reached levels which are very low. On the basis of the currently available information, this policy stance, while contributing to the preservation of price stability over the medium term, provides some counterbalance to the various factors which are currently having an adverse effect on economic activity.  Looking ahead, the most likely scenario is that economic growth will gradually recover once the factors contributing to the high economic uncertainty have diminished. While the expected weak economic activity at the beginning of this year will imply low average economic growth in 2003, a rise in quarterly growth rates should materialise in the course of the year. Over time, the euro area economy should 
 2 BIS Review 13/2003 benefit from a global economic recovery and the prevailing low levels of interest rates, as well as from falling inflation supporting real disposable income and underpinning private consumption growth.  However, any judgement on future developments is overshadowed at present by the geopolitical tensions and their potential resolution. Monetary policy cannot address this kind of uncertainty. Depending on further developments, the Governing Council stands ready to act decisively and in a timely manner.  The prospects for the euro area economy will depend very much on measures taken in other policy areas. As for fiscal policy, adherence of all countries to the framework laid down in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact will support stable and sustainable public finances, and will thereby contribute significantly both to confidence and to favourable financing conditions for the private sector. In most cases, the fiscal policy stance implicit in the updated stability programmes strikes a reasonable balance between letting automatic stabilisers operate and seeking further consolidation where needed. In some cases, current consolidation ambitions are weak. In order to further boost confidence in the fiscal framework and the economic environment, it is essential that appropriate consolidation plans are implemented in all countries with remaining imbalances. Hence, the commitments made in the stability programmes and the requests to further improve fiscal positions, as subsequently agreed in the ECOFIN Council, must be implemented in full. In this respect, the measures should be part of a comprehensive and growth-oriented strategy, which for most countries means putting the focus on both restraining the volume, and reforming the structure, of public expenditure. Finally, the outlook for the euro area economy could be significantly improved if governments strengthen their efforts to implement structural reforms in labour and product markets. Such reforms are important to ultimately raise the euro area's production potential, improve the flexibility of the economy, and make the euro area more resilient to external shocks. In particular at the current juncture, when economic activity is subdued, taking measures to make the euro area a more attractive place to invest in can contribute substantially to fostering confidence. We are now at your disposal for questions. 
 BIS Review 13/2003 1 Antonio Fazio: Two great economists and the challenges we face today Address by Mr Antonio Fazio, Governor of the Bank of Italy, on the occasion of the granting of the Keynes Sraffa Award, at The Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for the UK, London, 25 February 2003. *      *      * John Maynard Keynes was the most influential economist of the twentieth century, a century in which the world economy made greater advances than in any other historical period. The world’s population grew much faster than in the preceding centuries; per capita output also rose at an unprecedented pace. The growth in population and per capita income accelerated in the second half of the century, not least owing to the absence of wars comparable to those fought in the first half. The overall improvement in living conditions was accompanied by a widening of the gaps between the economic welfare of countries and geographical areas, and above all by an increase in the perception of the disparities. I shall return to this point later. As a subject in its own right, political economy acquired form and substance between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In this respect it is worth recalling: the fundamental contributions of Cantillon and Hume; the Physiocrats and Quesnay with his Tableau économique, the precursor of Leontief’s input-output analysis; Antonio Genovesi, who held the first chair of political economy in Europe at the University of Naples, with his Lezioni di economia civile, and Ferdinando Galiani, whose treatise Della moneta remains exemplary for its profundity and enduring relevance. Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations marked a decisive turning point. But economic analysis had already been developed, as a part of philosophy, by the Schoolmen. In the late Middle Ages, from the thirteenth century onwards, the great Italian, Spanish, French and Flemish moralists, in addressing the emergence of the urban economy and the growth in commerce and fairs after the manorial economy of the great Benedictine monasteries and the feudal estates, discussed the new developments with regard to trade, currencies, prices and the interest rate. Not far from here, in Oxford, the light of the Franciscan order, John Duns Scotus, developed a theory of prices that is based strictly on the cost and hence on the quantities of labour employed in producing goods. The underlying idea was constantly to search for and define the just price, in order to pursue commutative justice in exchanges, a concept that, together with distributive justice, was forcefully stressed by Thomas Aquinas as the basis of orderly life in the community. Later, the doctors of the Sorbonne and the great Italian universities also addressed the question of insurance. Taking a premium to insure goods against the risks of shipwreck and piracy was acceptable, but the insurers had to possess adequate capital, what we would call actuarial reserves today, with which to indemnify the insured in the event of claims. Fresh impetus was given to the study of economic phenomena by the monetary upheavals that followed the discovery of America. In the 1500s and the early 1600s, Molina, Lessius and Lugo put forward elegant analyses of the distinction between interest, considered a merely monetary phenomenon in line with Thomas Aquinas, and profits. In general it was censurable, usury, to charge interest on sums that were lent, because money was deemed unproductive; however, it was morally acceptable to receive compensation, a return or a share of the profits where the money lent gave rise, through commerce, to the creation of new wealth. The distinction between monetary interest and profits, the fruit of the use of money in commercial and productive enterprises, was lost for several centuries. After Wicksell it was rediscovered by Keynes, who made it a cornerstone of his General Theory. 
 2 BIS Review 13/2003 In the nineteenth century Ricardo and Malthus in England observed and theorized the expansion of industry and international trade, the growth of the population and its relationship with resources. Malthus also perceived the problem of effective demand. Marx, reinterpreting Hegel and Ricardo, drew on the development of mass production and capitalism and the tensions between workers and capitalists to form his palingenetic vision of the end of private property, the triumph of the proletariat, and communism. In continental Europe and Italy, Christian sociologists and economists - Ozanam, von Ketteler and Toniolo - analyzed the social and political consequences of the industrial revolution and the spread of mass production. They prepared the way for the social doctrine of the Catholic Church and Pope Leo XIII’s encyclical Rerum Novarum. In Germany the principles of the welfare state were outlined. In every epoch, the great economists understand the economic and social changes and upheavals of their times. They put forward new views of the forces that dominate the evolution of the economy. They study stylized facts, theorize them and reduce them to logical relationships and to models of how economic systems work, from which they draw indications for the conduct of business and for the action of the public authorities. Towards the end of the nineteenth century the role of credit and banking and, more generally, of finance emerged in all its importance. The separation, the real and logical distinction, between economic agents who save and those who use savings or make investments by borrowing capital has enormous implications not only for the expansion of economic activity but also for the stability of the growth process, both within individual economies and across economic systems. Keynes fully understood these changes and derived revolutionary economic theories from them, as well as setting out their far-reaching implications for policy. His genius is to be seen in the Economic Consequences of the Peace, which, it gives me pleasure to recall, was immediately translated into Italian by the Milanese publisher Treves. Keynes foresaw the devastating effects of the Treaty of Versailles on the European economy. He envisaged the losses suffered by Germany and Russia being a source of major political instability in Europe. He made a fierce attack on the work of President Wilson, the French president and the British prime minister. He examined the advisability of partially or completely cancelling war debts that had become unbearable for the smaller countries, and analyzed the dire consequences that application of the peace treaty would have for international trade and the prosperity of some regions. In the background, there seems to emerge a positive vision of economic relations among European countries along the general lines of what would take shape in the design of the European Community. In A Tract on Monetary Reform, which was also promptly translated into Italian by Piero Sraffa, Keynes delineated a new and different role for monetary policy. The objective of the banks of issue, which had developed predominantly in the nineteenth century and the early decades of the twentieth, was basically reduced to maintaining the gold parity. Stressing the powerful repercussions of inflation and deflation on the orderly working of the economy, prosperity, growth and employment, Keynes indicated the stabilization of the price level in terms of fiduciary money as the objective of monetary policy. He advocated the abandonment of the gold standard, which he called a “barbarous relic”. Several years later, in his criticism of Britain’s return to the gold standard, he reiterated his objections to restoring the pre-war parity, or at any rate to setting an exchange rate well above the one then obtaining. In The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill, a pamphlet he wrote in 1925, Keynes argued that restoring the pre-war parity would generate deflation, with adverse effects on income, a contraction in 
 BIS Review 13/2003 3 the volume of business and economic crisis. The only way to avoid these effects was to reduce wages and prices. His warning went unheeded. In the opinion of many scholars, the return of all the major countries to the gold standard with a marked revaluation of their currencies was the underlying cause of the Great Depression of the 1930s. In Italy, Mussolini’s “quota 90” policy for the lira, implemented in an authoritarian fashion in 1926 by the Finance Minister, Giuseppe Volpi, despite the misgivings of the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Bonaldo Stringher, appears to have been influenced by Keynes’s suggestions. In order to mitigate the deflationary effects, the revaluation of the lira to 90 against sterling, from a market rate that had reached nearly 150, was accompanied by an overall reduction in wages of 20 per cent. In the 1930s the Fascist regime also began a large programme of major public works that supported domestic demand. The Great Depression and the economic crisis that gripped Germany were the main cause, together with the country’s severe institutional difficulties, of the advent of Nazism. The hyperinflation of the early 1920s had been the consequence of the impossibility for the German economy to expand again under the heavy burden imposed by the peace treaty. The Second World War was not unrelated to the First, partly owing to the serious errors committed in the 1920s in international relations and monetary policies. The problem of unemployment emerged in all its drama. In the United States economic policy reacted with the New Deal and with a monetary policy appropriate to the new conditions. Economists laboriously rediscovered the problem of effective demand. The Polish economist Michael Kalecki is among those to be recalled in this regard. But it was Keynes who fully developed a new paradigm with which to grasp reality and make economic policy prescriptions. In his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, the classical vision in which supply generates demand in accordance with Say’s Law is criticized and the causal relationship is reversed: the level of economic activity depends on the demand for consumption and investment. The separation between the units where savings are formed and those where investment is decided, through banking and financial intermediation, renders investment independent of the availability of savings. In the absence of full employment, the expansion of public and private investment generates an increase in employment, consumption, production and, ultimately, savings that is sufficient to cover the new investment. The rediscovery of the distinction between the interest rate and the marginal rate of return on investment gave Keynes the theoretical model for determining the demand for capital goods on the part of firms. The equilibrium between saving and investment is re-established through changes in income, while the interest rate is determined in the money market. The model’s originality, the theoretical revolution, was grasped by economists. John Hicks offered an elegant interpretation of it in Mr. Keynes and the Classics. In 1944 Franco Modigliani extended the analysis of Keynesian theory and formalized it in Liquidity Preference and the Theory of Interest and Money. In the United States the new theory’s implications for the public finances were worked out by Alvin Hansen. The great effort to rebuild an international monetary order towards the end of the Second World War, culminating in the Bretton Woods agreements of 1944, again saw Keynes among its protagonists. Instead of his proposal based on the creation of an international currency, the bancor, the agreements mainly adopted the plan formulated by Harry Dexter White of the United States, based on the dollar, which was in turn linked to gold. America and the Federal Reserve came to play a role akin to that of a world central bank. The ascendancy of the dollar as the most important currency in international trade had major consequences for the US economy. 
 4 BIS Review 13/2003 Like all great thinkers, Keynes interpreted his times. His theories have had an immense influence on the economic policies of all the major countries up to today; they have also been subjected to stretched interpretations and used for shortsighted policies in the field of public finances. That public works could be used to alleviate unemployment was something rulers had always known. It will suffice to recall the examples of public spending in the Papal States and the Kingdom of Naples in Italy before national unification.  One example of a programme designed to increase the level of effective demand was Roosevelt’s New Deal in the United States. In England, the Beveridge plan was influenced by the same philosophy. Post-war Italy’s on-the-job public works training scheme, the Vanoni plan and the programme of special measures for Southern Italy are other examples.  Keynes’s original idea was to concentrate on public works and infrastructure, on expenditure intended to orient production and not on unproductive expenditure, although he later used the paradox of digging holes in the ground and then filling them in to explain the principle of effective demand. On the theoretical level, the Keynesian model is definitively established as an explanation of how an economy works. I was brought up on Keynesian theory by Modigliani and Samuelson at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1960s. Solow’s classes introduced me to the theory of growth. Those were the years of Kennedy’s New Frontier and the new economic policy. Keynesian theory was taught and applied, but Modigliani also encouraged me to look into the work of Friedman, who was refocusing attention on classical monetary theory. Friedman had restated the quantity theory of money in 1956. In his Presidential address to the American Economic Association in December 1967 he prefigured the explanation of the stagflation of the 1970s. He reasserted the need to control the quantity of money and not only interest rates. His ideas formed the basis for the monetary policies of the leading industrial countries in the 1980s and 1990s after the period of inflation that followed the cutting of the link with gold and the oil crises. An elegant and insightful synthesis of these two theories, the classical and the Keynesian, was developed by Patinkin in Money, Interest and Prices. In the Bank of Italy’s econometric model, which we began to build in 1963 and which is continuously updated and used to analyze the evolution of the Italian economy, the starting point is a Keynesian approach to the operation of the real sector of the economy; this is then integrated with an analysis of financial flows, à la Tobin. The stabilization of Italy’s economy in 1974 after the first oil shock, which involved limiting the volume of bank lending in order to control domestic demand, capital outflows and the exchange rate, was planned and estimated using the model. The outcome was more than satisfactory. The same model was the basis for deciding the massive fiscal adjustment undertaken in 1977 to improve the balance of payments and curb inflation. In both cases the measures were set out in agreements with the International Monetary Fund. For the stabilization programme of 1994-96 we relied on a stringent monetary policy. The objective was to subdue inflation, and the rate was rapidly reduced from almost double digits to around 2 per cent. Following the drastic monetary restriction, in roughly two years the lira appreciated by more than 25 per cent against the German mark. The growth in the money supply was virtually nil in the two years 1995-96. Initially, short-term interest rates had to be raised to an exceptionally high level by rationing central bank credit to banks. Inflationary expectations were stamped out; the lira appreciated and long-term interest rates fell from almost 14 per cent in early 1995 to 6 per cent within the space of two years. Although a Keynesian model was employed in order to analyze demand, output and employment, the monetary tightening proved effective in disinflating the economy. In some respects even the supply-side economics of the Reagan Administration in the 1980s, which was also a major factor in the strong performance of the US economy in the 1990s, can be interpreted as a stimulus to domestic demand based on a reduction of taxation and an increase in the budget deficit. 
 BIS Review 13/2003 5 The economic policy pursued by the United States in 2001 and 2002, consisting in large interest-rate reductions, tax cuts and increased public spending, also displays pronounced Keynesian traits. It was made possible by the existence of a budget surplus, the relatively low level of public debt, the strength of the dollar and the growth in productivity, itself ascribable to the flexibility of the labour market, which prevented inflationary repercussions. In several cyclical phases in recent decades, and to some extent at present as well, the interpretation of international economic developments has indicated an insufficient level of effective demand, especially of investment expenditure in the leading economies. Piero Sraffa developed his ideas largely in the intellectual milieu of Cambridge, to which Keynes brought him in 1927. The year before, the Economic Journal had published an essay of Sraffa’s that shook the foundations of Marshall’s model of perfect competition. Sraffa was a student of Einaudi’s. For many years he kept up an intellectual correspondence with such philosophers and political thinkers as Wittgenstein and Gramsci. But he was a scholar open to practical problems. We see this in his writings on money and banks in Italy in the stormy aftermath of the First World War, from which he drew some principles concerning the advisability of public involvement in banking supervision in periods of instability, in economies where finance was still developing. Until 1950 he worked on the critical edition of the works of Ricardo. Exhuming an approach that had been “submerged and forgotten since the advent of the ‘marginal’ theory”, Sraffa formulated a theory of prices and distribution on rigorous analytical foundations. The result was a critique of the neoclassical theory of value, which was the consensus doctrine of the day. His analysis contradicts the Marxian labour theory of value. Like Keynes, Sraffa distinguishes the share of output that remunerates capital from the interest rate. He mentions the possible influence of the rate set by the central bank on the rate of profit. Sraffa’s Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities was not published until 1960, after more than three decades of intense work to make sure of the logical and mathematical consistency of his theory. It was published in English and an Italian version was brought out almost simultaneously. The new theory triggered lively debate. One of Sraffa’s students, Luigi Pasinetti, crossed swords, successfully, with two eminent representatives of neoclassical economics, Solow and Samuelson, my own professors. Another of his students, Pierangelo Garegnani, continued to elaborate Sraffian capital theory. He is now working on the complete edition of Sraffa’s papers, still largely unpublished, with support from the Bank of Italy. In 1965-66, in his course on “Advanced Economic Theory”, Samuelson described Sraffa’s work with the greatest respect and linked it to the great school of thought beginning with Quesnay’s Tableau économique and continuing, three centuries later, with Leontief’s input-output tables and linear programming. Professor Samuelson reaffirmed this judgment in an article in the Corriere della Sera of 6 September 1983 on the occasion of Sraffa’s death, with the statement that if his work had been published a decade or two earlier it would have exerted a powerful influence on the subsequent development of economic theory by Leontief, von Neumann, Knight and Koopmans. Professor Pasinetti has extended Sraffa’s theoretical vision to the analysis of economic development. So far, to my knowledge, this has had limited application to current economic events. I should like, instead, to put forward the hypothesis that it can be of considerable help in understanding several important phenomena of our age. Sraffa’s model is an analytical interpretation of subsistence, of the conditions for the existence and survival of an economic system. The relationships between the quantities of commodities produced and used for production and prices must correspond to certain conditions connected with technical relationships. The model offers a new view, which also differs from classical economics, of the relative importance of different goods in the functioning of the economy. Some goods are essential for the production of the others; their disappearance would derail the economy. On the contrary, luxury goods only satisfy the needs of certain groups of consumers; their disappearance would have no significant repercussions on the economy, nor would it affect the distribution of income between wages and profits. 
 6 BIS Review 13/2003 The model shows very clearly that the value of non-reproducible goods of which a given amount is found in nature, such as land, depends on all the other relationships existing between the goods that are produced, which in turn are means of production. In the same way as for luxury goods, taxes on rents have no effect on prices or the distribution of income. The meaning of Sraffa’s laconic remark on the possible dependence of the rate of profit on the rate of interest may be less elusive today. With the globalization of financial markets, the rate of profit must be correlated with and is certainly powerfully influenced by the level of interest rates established in the international money market. Classical models can be extended along the lines developed by von Neumann to the link between the interest rate and the rate of growth. In a global economy with unrestricted international financial transactions, this has implications for the sustainability of growth in economies with a large foreign debt, the interest rate on which is determined exogenously by the level prevailing in international markets. It also has implications for the distribution of income between wages and profits within such economies. Finally, I would like to read Sraffa’s work in the light of an ideal connection with the profound thought of the medieval Schoolmen in their search for the just price. Given the rate of profit, commutative justice is established in the exchange of goods within the economy, based on the quantity of labour directly or indirectly embodied in them. Every worker’s purchasing power is determined exactly as a function of the structure of production, as defined by technical ratios. In other words, every worker’s purchasing power reflects the values of the goods that remunerate the effort required to produce them. In addition to commutative justice this also results in a sort of distributive justice as the foundation of society. Considerable progress has been made over the past two decades in the economic and institutional situation of the advanced and the developing countries, in global economic interdependence and in international economic cooperation.  Observers and politicians are fully aware of the need to take up the challenge of a globalization process that, while greatly improving living conditions throughout the world, has also aggravated and above all highlighted the disparities between the supply of essential goods and the level of economic development in different countries and geographical areas.  Financial globalization has progressed at a very fast pace in the past twenty years, thanks in part to the use of information technology. Today it can be said there is a single, worldwide money and financial market.  The growth in world trade has mainly concerned industrial products.  These developments in the exchange of goods, services and capital are a source of wealth for all who take part in them. Yet the liberalization and globalization of financial flows can be accompanied by outbreaks of instability that harm the weakest economies.  In a system that rests basically on fiduciary money, the principles of free trade and comparative advantage typical of trade in manufactures have sometimes been extended unquestioningly to movements of financial capital. Past errors in fixing exchange rates and instituting specific monetary regimes have been repeated in new ways. Reflection on the mistakes made and the need to limit and rectify the adverse effects on the stability of intermediaries, to protect savings and to restore conditions for a recovery in output have prompted the monetary authorities of the industrial countries to establish more extensive and closer cooperation among themselves and with the developing countries.  The Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Edward George, plays a leading role in this new phase of international monetary cooperation that we could say began with the meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in Toronto in February 1995, shortly after the Mexican crisis erupted.  The international financial system’s ability to cope with the repercussions of the uncertainty that followed 11 September 2001, the difficulties created by the cyclical slowdown in the leading economies and the consequences of the discovery of serious irregularities in the management of 
 BIS Review 13/2003 7 major international economic and financial groups, without suffering serious damage, testifies to the positive results.  To date, agricultural commodities and textiles have been excluded from the liberalization of trade.  The leading industrial countries must make an effort to reduce the enormous subsidies to their agricultural sectors and remove the regulatory and tariff barriers to imports of agricultural products and textiles from the developing countries.  By concentrating on the production of high-quality goods and opening up to imports of widely-consumed goods from the developing countries, the wealthiest economies can make an important contribution to increasing world output and, above all, to ensuring it is more equitably distributed.  The great economists are men of their times, but they also have the ability to shed light on the future.  The twentieth century gave us examples of instability and of economic and political upheaval of extraordinary magnitude.  At some crucial moments people feared for the very survival of our civilization, owing to the wide-scale use of weapons of mass destruction.  The experience of the two world wars, with their legacy of death and destruction, must impel us to relegate war to the past as a means of solving international disputes. Great philosophers have taught us that peace lies at the core of the future of humanity. Closer cooperation between the advanced countries and the emerging economies can contribute to the progress of the world economy.  It is necessary to rely on the decision-making power of the United Nations. It is necessary to oppose all the forms of violence that offend the dignity of the person, such as terrorism. It is necessary to strengthen, also in the light of ethical principles, the foundations of international law and institutions. For its part economic theory has made major advances. There is room to refine the analytical instruments that the great thinkers of the distant and recent past have handed down to us and adapt them to today’s situations. This is a task for universities, but also for the institutions that are continuously faced with new phenomena and problems. Further intellectual revolutions may not be indispensable; if they are, enlightened minds will put them forward. Fruitful results can still come from the analogical application of existing theories, formulated for essentially closed economies, to increasingly open and integrated economies. The institutional orders and policies adopted for national financial systems can provide guidance, taking account of the differences, for world finance. Theoretical models developed in the age of free banking can be applied to the analysis of international finance, in which the national monetary systems of individual countries play a role similar to that played by banks in national economies in the early decades of the 1900s. There exists a problem of controlling global liquidity, in addition to the stability of intermediaries. As rightly pointed out by Fausto Vicarelli, an economist who died prematurely some ten years ago, the basic characteristic of capitalism in the age of finance is instability. He considered the analysis of this phenomenon, and the consequent proposals for economic policy, to be one of Keynes’s most important contributions. Sraffa’s theory and the exhumation of classical doctrine, from Smith to Ricardo, not to mention the neoclassical models of growth, provide us with interpretations of the underlying relationships that link the variables of the economy. We know the mechanisms, but our grasp of what sets them in motion is often tenuous. Investment remains a fundamental variable for comprehending the evolution of an economy. Our knowledge remains incomplete, however, our forecasting power fragile. The current difficulties of the European economy and the uncertain outlook in Japan suffice to demonstrate this. The links between economics and the other social sciences must be rediscovered, beginning with the adjacent and most closely interrelated disciplines, such as demography. There remains the wider realm of the moral sciences. Economics is part of philosophy and politics. 
 8 BIS Review 13/2003 In his writings Professor Dahrendorf compels us to re-examine critically the relationship that has developed between freedom and society, between the market and regulation, between democracy and self-determination. Raising the issue of a new international order, he has affirmed that “democratizing international decision-making is the greatest challenge posed to our political imagination”.  There is a need for a “strong philosophy” of which economic theory must be an organic part. Adam Smith was a professor of moral philosophy; The Wealth of Nations springs from a social and political vision. The development of marginal analysis and the theory of markets and the study of general equilibrium have made fundamental contributions to our understanding of the economic behaviour and facts that surround us and in which we are immersed. They are not sufficient. We must investigate the underlying determinants of economic phenomena. The advances by Keynes and Sraffa beyond microeconomic analysis, with one considering aggregate quantities and the other the value relationships between wages and goods, directly seek to understand the variables of greatest importance for the welfare of society. The ancient themes of commutative justice and distributive justice maintain all their relevance. Economic analysis must go back to investigating first principles, rediscovering the links with the other dimensions of society of which the economy is part. This can come about in empirical fashion, as often happens. But that is not sufficient. It is up to social scientists, to philosophers, to return to a more systematic study that will set our understanding and action in the field of economics on a firmer foundation. The century that has just begun, with society marked by uncertainty and based on knowledge, demands an even greater capacity for government and participation, nurtured by a higher cultural level. It is the way to invest in the future, preparing a better tomorrow for the younger generations. 
 BIS Review 12/2003 1 Irma Rosenberg: Monetary policy and the Swedish economy Speech by Ms Irma Rosenberg, Deputy Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, to the Swedish Society of Financial Analysts, Stockholm, 5 March 2003. *      *      * Thank you for the invitation to come here and speak at the Swedish Society of Financial Analysts. This is my first public appearance in my new role as Deputy Governor of the Riksbank. It is stimulating to meet people and discuss economic issues. At the same time, I feel a little nervous, as I know I am facing an audience who are used to examining and interpreting statements by the Riksbank. One difference between this post and my previous work is that a member of the Executive Board must to some extent exercise caution when speaking publicly. This is to avoid creating any misunderstandings among participants in the financial market, who try to translate statements by representatives of the central bank into future interest rate policy. This means that some of you may not be acquainted with me, but my aim is to be as honest and clear as I possibly can. What I intend to start talking about today is the development of the economy in recent years and to follow this with a look ahead at the challenges facing both the Swedish and international economic climates, and finally say something about monetary policy.  Those of you who are familiar with the economic assessments I have made know that I sometimes have not shared the Riksbank’s conclusions. But please remember that this should not be interpreted to mean that I have a different opinion of the Riksbank’s objectives. I consider it a good thing to conduct an open discussion on the policy pursued. And I hope that you intend to take part in this discussion, as the whole point of an open central bank is to facilitate such discussion and allow it to improve monetary policy. Riksbank focuses on total inflation picture I shall begin by describing the way the Riksbank works. The Riksdag has assigned two main objectives to the Riksbank: to maintain price stability and to promote a safe and efficient payment system. Today I shall concentrate on the first of these two objectives. The Riksbank has defined the target for monetary policy as to limit inflation to 2 per cent, with a tolerated deviation interval of plus/minus one percentage point. This tolerated interval indicates that deviations are likely, but that they will be limited. The objective is worded in terms of the consumer price index (CPI), which is a broad index consisting of the prices in a basket of goods and services consumed by an average Swedish household. As interest costs and indirect taxes included in CPI inflation are not assessed to have a long-term effect on inflation, the Riksbank has chosen to normally focus on UND1X, which is an index that excludes these factors. From time to time there may also be reason to disregard other price changes that are assessed as temporary. Our ambition will then be to make it clear that we have done so. By raising and lowering the steering interest rate - the repo rate - the Riksbank attempts to influence inflation. As it is so difficult to steer inflation in the short term, the Riksbank makes an assessment of developments for the coming 1-2 years. This is the period of time usually assumed necessary for an interest rate adjustment to work its way through the economy and have a full impact on the rate of price increase, i.e. inflation. The Riksbank uses a simple rule-of-thumb when shaping its monetary policy. If the total picture of inflation shows that it is expected to be above or below the target level, the steering interest rate is adjusted accordingly.  There are four main factors in the analysis of future inflation that stand out as central to the shaping of monetary policy: the development of total resource utilisation, international price trends, the exchange rate and the general public’s inflation expectations. Inflationary pressure varies according to the demand situation and to changes in resource utilisation. The stronger the upturn in demand in relation to potential production, the greater the risk that prices and wages will rise rapidly and vice versa. This is why we who work in central banks around the world 
  must analyse the picture of economic activity as a whole, despite the fact that inflation is our target variable.  International price trends, where, for instance, oil prices are an important factor, affect domestic inflation by way of imports. An assessment of international resource utilisation can provide an indication, for instance, of how international prices may develop.  The development in the value of the krona is important in the assessment of inflation. A change in the exchange rate has a direct effect on inflation in that the price of imported goods and services is affected, and also an indirect effect via aggregate demand. If the value of the krona changes in relation to other important trading currencies, this affects the competitiveness of Swedish goods and services and thereby demand and resource utilisation. Inflation expectations among households and companies can also affect the price-setting and wage formation processes and thereby inflation. One purpose of a clear inflation target and a monetary policy governed by such a target is to firmly establish the inflation target with the general public.  At the same time, one should remember that the Riksbank is forced to take into account many other factors that influence price trends. These are often non-recurring factors, such as supply shocks in various forms, which are often difficult to predict. But above all it can be difficult to use monetary policy to prevent them having an impact on inflation. Monetary policy has an impact with a time lag, and it does not always reach the source of such a price rise. For instance, a central bank cannot prevent oil prices rising in the wake of the concern over a possible war in the Middle East. On the other hand, a central bank could of course try to quickly tighten demand in the country to push down prices in other areas and thus ensure the average rate of price increase remains in line with the target level.  The focus on inflation 1-2 years ahead, entails monetary policy being conducted gradually, little by little, rather than a constant acceleration and braking, which would risk creating unnecessary variations in demand and which could in turn have a negative effect on production and employment. The focus on the coming 1-2 year period thus means that temporary rises or falls in the inflation rate can be tolerated. However, it is important that the Riksbank is clear in its communication of whether it considers the rise to be temporary and when it expects it to subside. One-off shifts in price levels can have a more lasting effect on future inflation if, for instance, those involved do not believe that the rise is temporary, assessing that it will be lasting and thus wishing to compensate for the upturn. If this occurs, monetary policy must be used to intervene, even if the economic situation in itself does not provide cause for concern with regard to inflation, to prevent inflation taking a hold through expectations. The reason for this is quite simply that it is more costly in terms of reduced production and employment to force down inflation expectations once they have become established at a higher level rather than to prevent them rising.  Parallels between the current situation and 2001 plus 2002 Let us take a look at the current situation and begin with the price rises. Now, as in spring 2001, inflation has risen as a result of temporary factors pulling up the general level of prices. During 2001 mad-cow disease and foot-and-mouth disease pushed up meat prices and poor harvests led to soaring prices on fruit and vegetables. Then as now there was also a water shortage in the hydroelectric power companies’ reservoirs, which pushed up electricity prices. At the moment, it is electricity and oil prices that are soaring and have pushed up inflation figures above the target level in January. This becomes particularly clear if one separates energy prices from the inflation figures for January (Diagram 1). The Riksbank’s assessment is that the upturn in inflation is temporary, as it was in 2001, and we can expect to see lower inflation as early as the late spring and summer. However, our assessment is based on the assumption that those setting prices will not try to compensate themselves for the temporary price increase. If this occurs, there is a risk of inducing tendencies towards an inflation spiral, which the Riksbank could not stand by and witness in silence. At the same time, it would be very unfortunate, particularly in the light of the challenges facing the Swedish economy, to be forced to manage contagion effects from the energy price rise with interest rate rises.  If one looks at the economic climate, I consider the similarities between the present situation and this time last year to be more striking than a comparison with 2001. Here I am mainly referring to the fact that economic prospects were at that time very uncertain with regard to how far the adaptation process had come after the over-optimism of the previous years, which had led to abnormally high share prices 
  and overly large investments by companies in the USA. Let me go back in time roughly one year and see what conclusions can be drawn from last year and what implications they might have for future developments.  Developments 2002 to 2003 At the beginning of last year there were signs of a light at the end of the economic outlook tunnel. I wasn’t working at the Riksbank then, so don’t be surprised if parts of my historical description differ slightly from that of the Riksbank, as expressed in the Inflation Reports.  The signs of a turnaround were most pronounced in the USA, but there were also some signals that Europe was on the threshold of a recovery. The reduction in stocks appeared to be well on its way, which is usually the first requirement for an upturn in production. However, for a production increase brought about by adjustment in stocks to be durable, it must be supported by a lasting increase in demand. Household consumption continued to increase, but there was no upturn in investment. The imbalances in trade and industry in the USA were perhaps more tangible than many had anticipated. Bankruptcies and accounting scandals created further unease on the financial markets, which then fell at a rate reminiscent of the 1930s crisis. In Europe the signs of economic recovery mainly concerned more optimistic expectations; expectations which were not later realised. The largest euro economy, Germany, in particular proved to be in a poorer condition than anticipated. However, here it was not a question of imbalances like those in the USA, but structural problems, such as a high level of unemployment that had set in and weak public finances, which made it difficult to conduct an economic policy that would support the business climate. Furthermore, the expected supporting forces from the other side of the Atlantic for the export industry were weaker the expected.   In Sweden, the slowdown during 2001 had a limited effect on unemployment. The Riksbank’s calculations at the beginning of 2002 indicated that resource utilisation was relatively strained. Economic policy had a stimulating effect on the economy, through lower taxes and higher transfers. Given these conditions, when the signals of a recovery became clearer at the beginning of 2002, the Riksbank elected to raise its steering interest rate on two occasions during the spring, by a total of 0.5 percentage points to 4.25 per cent. These increases should also be regarded in the light of the fact that inflation was still at a high level then and risked having a negative effect on inflation expectations. During the spring the rate of price increase turned back towards the target of 2 per cent as forecast.  As an external analyst my assessment differed slightly from that of the Riksbank. This applied to both the international picture, where it was uncertain whether a turnaround had actually taken place, and resource utilisation in Sweden and the risk of tension that could cause rising inflation. I interpreted the high rate of wage increase that we had then as a delayed effect of an overheated labour market during 2000 and part of 2001. Shortages on the labour market had eased considerably in spring 2002. In the services sector, as in construction, capacity utilisation had fallen significantly, which indicated that wage increases would gradually become more subdued. I therefore perceived the inflation risk as less evident and did not see any immediate need for raising the interest rate.   It is clear that the inflation risk the Riksbank seemed to see declined as unease on the financial markets grew in the wake of bankruptcies and corporate scandals in the USA. Gradually, unease increased because of security policy developments. The financial unease gradually infected the real economy; confidence among companies and consumers began to fall in several countries over the summer and it became increasingly clear that total demand had been negatively affected. This contributed to enabling the Riksbank to lower the repo rate twice during the autumn, measures that were in my assessment quite fitting under the circumstances. What we can observe today, compared with one year ago, is that the questions baffling forecasters are roughly the same and that they are dominated by the question of how far the adaptation process following from the stock market bubble has come. Today an additional factor making assessments more difficult is the threat of war in the Middle East. We do not know whether there will be a war or how it will all end. The crisis also creates uncertainty that makes it difficult to correctly interpret economic signals. In addition, the more prolonged the crisis is, the greater the risk that the actual uncertainty will have a negative effect on the real economy.  I shall now turn towards the future and discuss developments over the coming 1-2 years.   
  Right conditions for a recovery in the USA… One difference now compared with the situation one year ago is that the adaptation of the imbalances in the US economy has probably progressed further. Consolidation of balance sheets has continued, productivity is strong and normal business activity patterns indicate that the conditions should be relatively favourable for an increase in industrial production during the spring. Low stocks levels in relation to sales and an investment ratio that is below the long-term trend would indicate this is the case. An expansionary economic policy provides further support for the optimism. However, the question most people are asking themselves now, as they were in 2002, is whether the adaptation to the imbalances has reached a sufficient stage to enable a broad, lasting increase in demand that can take over as the driving force behind a production increase. It is much too early to be able to give a clear answer here. If we look at households in the USA, we can see that they have become more passive since the December Inflation Report was published. The explanation could be the security policy unease and the still weak stock markets. Continuing high oil prices will also cut into disposable incomes. However, the expansionary economic policy should partly counteract these effects. All in all, I believe that the picture of a relatively prolonged recovery in the USA, where growth gradually increases over the year and attains the economy’s long-term sustainable level, remains for the most part intact. … while the conditions for a turnaround in the euro area are poorer. The total international recovery expected during the coming year does not look to be as strong as the Riksbank anticipated in December. The background to this is that developments in the euro area in general and in Germany in particular look rather gloomier than they did before. The euro area’s export industry is hampered by international uncertainty, as well as a stronger euro and a weak labour market is affecting households’ consumption and confidence in the future.  This means that the international economic prospects look rather poorer now, which was also the conclusion of the Executive Board at its monetary policy meeting on 6 February. However, this assessment is based on the assumption that the Iraq crisis will develop in a way that will not significantly deteriorate economic prospects.  Flat growth path for the Swedish economy The financial unease has also affected the Swedish economy. Industrial production has stood still during the autumn and order books have been slow to fill. This is perhaps not so strange in the light of the “wait-and-see” mentality prevailing on important export markets. However, as the international economic climate improves, this and the cyclical pattern for investment are expected to give impetus to industrial production in Sweden.  Over the past six months, Swedish households have become increasingly pessimistic in their view of the future, which is perhaps understandable taking into account the negative news with which they are confronted: rising energy prices, higher taxes and expected cuts. The scope for consumption will be under pressure from these factors in the near future. At the same time, households’ savings were at a high level in 2002, which means that there may be some scope to increase consumption despite the restraining effects. Altogether, I believe there is also reason for a downward revision of the estimate of the Swedish growth rate over the coming years. The expected upturn is assessed to be somewhat superficial. This also assumes that the Iraq conflict does not develop in a way that will seriously deteriorate future prospects. The shaping of monetary policy A decisive factor in the shaping of monetary policy in future is the total picture of inflation prospects. A slightly more subdued growth in demand both in Sweden and abroad is expected to lead to capacity utilisation being slightly less strained. At the same time, energy prices have pushed up inflation. However, the Riksbank’s assessment is that the upturn in inflation is temporary and that there is 
  reason to expect lower inflation as early as the late spring and summer. Although, as I said earlier, this assumes that those setting prices and wages do not attempt to compensate themselves for the temporary price rise.  All in all, it is a question of balancing the risks of, for instance, a weaker growth in the economy, against the risk that the upturn in inflation will have contagion effects.

 BIS Review 12/2003 1 Linah K Mohohlo: 2003 Monetary Policy Statement Statement by Mrs Linah K Mohohlo, Governor of the Bank of Botswana, Gaborone, 25 February 2003. *      *      * Introduction  I am privileged and honoured to welcome you to this important event in the calendar of the Bank - the presentation of the Monetary Policy Statement for 2003.  Let me begin by refreshing memories on the objective and content of the Monetary Policy Statement, which the Bank of Botswana issues every year. The Statement serves several purposes. First, it provides an opportunity for the Bank to report on inflation and monetary policy developments in the previous year, and to present its assessment of the outlook for inflation in the current year. Second, it enables the Bank to outline policy issues and the approach that will be taken in formulating its policy stance in response to inflation-related developments throughout the year. Third, the Monetary Policy Statement contains, certainly since last year, the Bank’s annual objectives for inflation and credit growth, and an explanation of how these are derived. The Statement, therefore, plays an important role in conveying to stakeholders and the public at large a range of information relating to one of the Bank’s core functions - the formulation and implementation of monetary policy.  While the transparency entailed in the presentation of the Monetary Policy Statement is important in its own right, it is also important in influencing economic and financial expectations, as well as the behaviour of economic agents. The Bank’s aim is to engender a public expectation of sustainable low inflation consistent with the broad objective of macroeconomic balance as a basis for sustainable growth. In addition, the Statement serves as a vehicle for enhancing the accountability of the Bank to its stakeholders.  In my remarks this evening, I will present only the main highlights of the full text of the 2003 Monetary Policy Statement. It is important, therefore, that you take the time to read the full text of the Statement, so you can obtain a more detailed analysis of monetary policy developments.  I will briefly review the behaviour of inflation in 2002 and its underlying causes, before assessing the extent to which monetary policy succeeded in achieving its objectives in 2002. I will then outline the Bank’s view of prospective economic and financial developments in 2003 and, on the basis of that assessment, the policy outlook for the current year.  The Bank’s Monetary Policy Framework and Objectives  I believe you are aware that the principal objective of monetary policy in Botswana, as it is for most central banks around the world, is to control inflation; in particular, it is to ensure that inflation is predictable and maintained at low levels. By carrying out this responsibility of controlling inflation, the Bank contributes, along with other Government policies, to the ultimate objective of promoting a stable macroeconomic environment. This supports rising incomes and living standards for Batswana, along with other national objectives, especially economic diversification which, in turn, depends on export competitiveness. You will agree that export competitiveness cannot be achieved unless Botswana’s inflation is low and comparable to the average of trading partner countries, such as South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and mainland Europe. This requirement is the basis for determining the desired range of inflation.  The framework within which policy is determined identifies the key relationships of the inflationary process. It is a well-known fact that excessive expenditure in relation to available goods and services in any given period pushes up prices - this is the concept referred to as demand-pull inflation. It is also well known that much expenditure, especially by the private sector, is financed through borrowing from the banking system. Hence the Bank determines the growth rate in bank credit that would be consistent with a low and sustainable level of inflation. The framework also identifies the tool used in controlling inflation, and as is the case with most central banks, the tool used by the Bank is interest rates. Obviously in deploying the interest rate instrument, the Bank strikes a careful balance between the need to discourage excess credit growth, and the need to encourage productive investment as well as financial savings.  
  In formulating the monetary policy stance, the Bank closely examines the factors that influence inflation. This analysis is necessary because the Bank is only equipped to deal with changes in inflation which are primarily due to domestic demand pressures. Furthermore, such pressures tend to have persistent, rather than erratic effects, such as those that may be due to transitory developments or supply fluctuations. That is why, in addition to the headline inflation data published by the Central Statistics Office, the Bank examines the underlying inflation trend, or core inflation. This is a measure of inflation which excludes the impact of factors which are transient in nature; it also excludes exceptional changes in administered prices and/or indirect taxes, and is a more precise measure of price developments in any economy. The Bank recognises the need, however, to respond to any impact that the transitory developments may have on underlying inflation, particularly their effect on inflation expectations and second-round influences on price changes.  In a market-based economy such as Botswana’s, monetary policy influences inflation indirectly through its effect on interest rate changes, which then influence credit as a key means of financing expenditure on both consumption and investment. The effectiveness of interest rates in controlling credit is monitored closely. The Bank also recognises that the rate of growth of government spending is an important component of domestic demand, since the Government allocates large amounts of funds to finance public consumption and investment. The fact that the Government plays a large role in the economy underscores the need for complementarity between fiscal and monetary policies in achieving the inflation objective.  This is the policy framework that provides a backdrop to the Bank’s assessment of the economic and financial environment over the past year, in which inflation or price developments took place.  Developments in Inflation in 2002  As you will no doubt recall, the Monetary Policy Statement for 2002 set an inflation objective range of 4 - 6 percent. In setting this objective, the Bank was aware that headline inflation would be influenced by a number of transitory factors, especially the introduction of the 10 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) in July 2002. Before the introduction of VAT, annual headline inflation stabilised at around 6 percent during most of the first half of 2002. However, following the introduction of VAT, and as you will recall, inflation started rising, and increased from 5.9 percent in June 2002 to just over 11 percent by the end of the year. The Bank had anticipated a temporary increase in headline inflation arising from the introduction of VAT, of between 4 percent and 6 percent over and above underlying inflation. This prospect was conveyed in a press release in June 2002. It was pointed out, at the time, that the VAT-related price increases would be a one-off temporary adjustment and that, in the absence of any significant second-round price effects, due for instance to compensatory wage increases, the impact of VAT would not result in a sustained rise in inflation.  In the event, and in line with the Bank’s expectations, the effect of VAT was that the month-on-month rate of change in prices rose from an average of 0.5 percent over the twelve months to June 2002, to 3.2 percent a month later in July 2002. Thereafter, the monthly rate of price increases progressively slowed down to reach 0.4 percent in October. The monthly price increase was then higher in November, primarily due to technical adjustments to some components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket, particularly the adoption of a new billing system by the Botswana Telecommunications Corporation.  Although overall inflation increased sharply in the second half of the year, an analysis of the inflation trend that discounts the impact of VAT and other technical adjustments to data suggests that underlying inflation was around 6 - 7 percent for 2002, which was a little above the upper end of the Bank’s policy objective for that year.  A closer look at the sources of inflation in 2002 provides further support to the conclusion that, while headline inflation was influenced by VAT and other price adjustments, the underlying rate was mostly contained. Prices of almost all categories of commodities rose at a higher rate in 2002 compared to 2001 as had been expected, given the wide-ranging impact of VAT. Food prices, however, rose at a much faster rate than the average, due in part to drought conditions in the region. Food price inflation rose from approximately 4 percent in December 2001 to over 14 percent by the end of 2002. This accounted for almost half of the rise in overall inflation during the year, and reinforces the view that, after taking account of the impact of VAT and other exceptional factors, such as volatile food prices, underlying inflation was largely contained during 2002.  
  The relatively moderate rise in underlying inflation was to some extent supported by a fairly benign inflationary environment in the world’s major economies. Although all major economies experienced moderately higher inflation, mainly as a result of rising energy prices, especially oil, average inflation rose by less than 1 percentage point, from 1.2 percent in 2001 to 2 percent in 2002. The inflation trend in South Africa was somewhat different; price increases were sharp, mostly due to the effects of the depreciation of the rand that had occurred towards the end of 2001. Inflation in South Africa was also affected by increases in food prices and labour costs. Core inflation in South Africa was 12.2 percent in December 2002 compared to 5.8 percent at the end of 2001.  The combined effect of all these developments was that average inflation of Botswana’s trading partners rose from 4.2 percent at the end of 2001 to 8.4 percent at the end of 2002, and was reflected in a rise in the cost of imports. In this connection, it should be pointed out that Botswana’s inflation briefly fell below that of trading partner countries in the middle of the year, although it was subsequently higher due to the impact of VAT.  In light of the moderate upward trend in underlying inflation, the Bank continued to restrain the growth rate of commercial bank credit to the private sector. After an adjustment to take account of the extension and subsequent early repayment of loans by certain large borrowers, using offshore funds, credit rose by 21.4 percent over the year, compared to 18.1 percent in 2001. This growth rate was well above the Bank’s target range of 12.5 - 14.5 percent, which had been judged to be consistent with the economy’s underlying growth potential and the inflation objective.  Moreover, the high rate of growth of Government spending, estimated at 18 percent during 2002, albeit below the 20 percent growth rate recorded in 2001, also continued to exert pressure on inflation, thereby placing a heavier burden on monetary policy. The expansionary fiscal policy implied an undesirable imbalance between fiscal and monetary policies in dealing with inflation.  Monetary Policy Implementation During 2002  In light of the high growth rate of credit and the need to contain inflationary expectations following the introduction of VAT, the Bank tightened monetary policy towards the end of the year by raising interest rates by a total of 1 percent in October and November 2002 - half a percent at each time.  Consistent with past practice, the two changes in interest rates were immediately followed by press releases, which emphasised that the increase in interest rates was not a response to the rise in inflation resulting from the introduction of VAT, because the Bank considers the VAT-induced impact on inflation as a transitory event, which did not directly justify a monetary policy response. The Bank’s focus was on the impact that VAT may have on inflationary expectations. Hence it was important to forestall the development of expectations of higher inflation by pointing out the dangers of accommodating second-round effects of VAT-related price increases and advising against possible compensatory wage increases. Higher interest rates were, therefore, aimed partly at ensuring that such expectations do not develop. This was done in order to demonstrate the Bank’s commitment to containing inflation arising from any temporary VAT-related price increases, and in order that expectations of rising prices do not become entrenched. There was also a need for a tighter monetary policy given that credit growth was still higher than desired.  The effect of the exchange rate on inflation was benign during 2002. While the Pula appreciated in nominal terms against major international currencies, it depreciated by 8 percent against the rand, resulting in an overall stable nominal effective exchange rate of the Pula. However, as inflation was higher in Botswana than in trading partner countries, largely due to the impact of VAT, the real effective exchange rate of the Pula appreciated by 2.6 percent in the year to December 2002; and to that extent, Botswana’s trade competitiveness was eroded.  The Outlook for Inflation in 2003  The performance of the global economy is expected to improve further in the course of 2003, with world output currently forecast to grow by 2.5 percent, up from an estimated 1.7 percent for 2002. Despite the forecast improvement in growth, inflation is expected to remain low and stable since the growth in world output will still be below trend. There is, however, considerable uncertainty with respect to oil prices due to the situation in the Middle East and Venezuela, as well as an imminent war in Iraq. Nevertheless, as inflation continues to be largely under control, it is anticipated that major 
  world economies will maintain stimulative monetary policy which, in some instances, will be supported by expansionary fiscal policy.  Inflation in South Africa, which is the most important external influence on inflation in Botswana, rose sharply during 2002. It is, however, expected to slow down in 2003, reflecting the recent strengthening of the rand, the tight monetary policy stance and supportive fiscal policy. Despite these favourable developments, it is unlikely that South Africa’s inflation target of 3 - 6 percent will be met during 2003. Forecasts of core inflation in South Africa for the year put it at between 7 percent and 8 percent, from just over 12 percent in 2002. For the other key trading partners, inflation is expected to remain around its current rate of 2 percent. Therefore, if the nominal effective exchange rate of the Pula is unchanged, Botswana’s imported inflation is likely to be lower in 2003 than it was last year.  Demand in Botswana, as reflected by the growth in commercial bank credit and government expenditure, was still undesirably high by the end of 2002. However, it is expected that the increase in interest rates in the last quarter of 2002 will, in due course, moderate the growth in bank lending. Furthermore, the recently released 2003/04 Government Budget indicates that expenditure will grow at a much slower rate of around 4 percent. This laudable fiscal restraint, together with the expected reduction in credit growth, should help to moderate inflationary pressures. The Government’s decision not to award a public sector pay rise in 2003 should contribute further towards restraining demand pressures. It is hoped that this favourable scenario will not be undermined by the findings of the ongoing Salary Structure Review Commission. Be that as it may, prospects for 2003 are generally of a better balance between monetary and fiscal policies, and this augurs well for a sustainable lower inflation in 2003.  Against this background, it is the Bank’s view that inflation in the first half of 2003 will be around the present level of 10 to 12 percent, before falling by the middle of the year and during the remaining months of 2003. This projection is based on the fact that most of the year-on-year effect of VAT on the Consumer Price Index will drop out after July 2003. The outlook is also predicated on the success of monetary policy in restraining credit growth, and the fact that government spending will indeed slow down. It is also expected that there will be no further undue external inflationary pressures generated by further large increases in prices of food and/or oil, or import prices more generally.  Bank’s Monetary Policy Stance in 2003  As highIighted earlier, the Bank seeks to achieve a rate of inflation that, at a minimum, will maintain relative stability in the real exchange rate and avoid the need for a devaluation of the Pula. The annual inflation objective is based on an assessment of forecast inflation for trading partner countries. Although the forecast for Botswana’s trading partners’ inflation for 2003 is slightly higher than the initial forecasts for 2002, which were used in the calculations of last year’s inflation objective, there are strong reasons for maintaining the inflation objective range of 4 - 6 percent for 2003. First, by reducing Botswana’s inflation to below the forecast average of trading partner countries, the range of 4 - 6 percent will provide an opportunity to regain some of the competitiveness lost last year as a result of a relatively higher level of inflation in Botswana. Second, underlying inflation remains close to the upper end of this inflation objective, which means that the 4 - 6 percent range remains both a desirable and feasible objective for 2003. Third, there remain concerns about the risks of further VAT-induced increases in inflationary expectations. Hence it is important for the Bank to promote expectations of a sustainable low inflation.  The range for the growth rate of private credit that is considered to be compatible with achieving this inflation outcome is 12 - 14 percent. As in the past, this range is calculated from the expected annual capacity for growth of the non-mining sector of the economy, as contained in the ninth National Development Plan (NDP 9); it is also based on the desired level of inflation for the year, with an allowance for the process of financial deepening as the economy develops.  Conclusion I wish to conclude by underscoring the main message of this year’s Monetary Policy Statement - that inflation should continue to be restrained during 2003. This effort will be supported by an expected favourable external and domestic developments, although there are uncertainties about the price of oil. In major industrial countries, output growth is expected to improve, while inflation is forecast to 
  remain under control. Except for the threat of a possible oil price increase and the lagged impact of last year’s inflation increase in South Africa, there is minimal risk of external pressures on inflation.  Here at home, it is anticipated that credit demand will slow down in response to the increase in interest rates in late 2002; this should ease demand pressures and curtail higher inflationary expectations. Moreover, fiscal restraint, as underscored by the much reduced growth rate of government spending for the ensuing fiscal year, is expected to contribute towards reducing inflationary pressures this year.  In light of these prospects, the task for monetary policy in 2003 will be to ensure that underlying inflation does not increase; the objective is also to reverse the upward trend in overall inflation that was experienced in 2002 to a downward path of the Bank’s desired range of 4 - 6 percent by the end of this year. While the Bank will continue to respond appropriately to monetary and inflation developments, the fiscal restraint that characterises the 2003/04 government budget should contribute to a balanced sharing of the burden of containing inflation as between monetary and fiscal policies during 2003.  I thank you for having joined us this evening and for your kind attention.  Thank you Director of Ceremonies. 
 BIS Review 12/2003 1 Birgir Ísl Gunnarsson: The policy and objectives of the Central Bank of Iceland Article by Mr Birgir Ísl Gunnarsson, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Central Bank of Iceland, published in the Morgunbladid Newspaper, in Reykjavík, 28 February 2003. *      *      * When the Central Bank of Iceland became an independent institution in 1961 it was generally believed, both here in Iceland and abroad, that several different simultaneous objectives could be set for central banks. Low inflation, full employment and strong economic growth were among the objectives that people felt central banks should be able to achieve. Gradually it became clear that this would not work. In the work of a central bank, these objectives can come into conflict with one another, resulting in an economic fiasco. As a result, in recent years legislation on central banks has been altered in many countries and the banks assigned one principal objective: ensuring price stability. Inflation is primarily a monetary phenomenon, persistent inflation being the result of insufficient restraint in monetary policy. In the long term, monetary policy thus has an impact on price levels but less on economic growth and employment. With free movement of capital between countries, the principal instrument of a Central Bank is interest rates; in the long run this instrument can only achieve one macroeconomic objective, i.e. to ensure price stability. New legislation When new legislation was adopted for the Central Bank of Iceland in 2001, these international developments were taken into consideration and the Icelandic Act patterned on recent legislation in other industrialised countries. There was broad political consensus on this, as people realised that low inflation is one of the cornerstones of economic growth and improved living conditions. In addition to the legislation, inflation targeting was introduced as the Bank’s objective in a joint declaration by the government and the Central Bank. The decision to float the Icelandic króna was taken at the same time, since experience had shown that in the long run it was impossible to ensure a specific exchange rate with free movement of capital in and out of the country. In such case the exchange rate is determined by the market where supply and demand control the value of the króna.  This new framework for monetary policy was immediately subjected to a baptism of fire. The Icelandic economy was overheated and inflation rising rapidly. The Central Bank had to respond by raising interest rates. The fall of the króna played a part in the elimination of the current account deficit much more rapidly than anyone had dared to hope two years ago. The economy is more stable at the moment than it has been for some time and, acccording to the outlook, the current slight slowdown will be short-lived. The Central Bank’s tight monetary stance has, on the other hand, brought results, as last November inflation dropped below the target of 2½ %.  Old theories reappear Recently there has been extensive discussion concerning the Central Bank of Iceland, its policy and objectives. Now that inflation has been subdued, old theories to the effect that the Central Bank should pursue multiple objectives have once more come to the fore. The Bank is to ensure full employment, it should have specific exchange rate objectives and ensure economic growth. These views reflect considerable over-estimation of the power of the Central Bank and the instruments at its disposal. It is also an oversimplification to focus exclusively on interest rates, as many people do, and expect that further interest rate reduction will solve all the problems. The Central Bank has, over the past two years, cut its rates thirteen times, and the bank’s policy rate is currently 5.3%. While this is naturally a higher rate than in the Euro zone, the problems which have to be grappled with there include long-term economic stagnation and high unemployment, and the future is by no means bright. In Norway, on the other hand, the Central Bank rate is 6%, to take an example of a neighbouring industrialised country. The Central Bank of Iceland’s real policy rate is currently around 2¾% considering future prospects, which is slightly under current estimates of the equilibrium interest rate. The Bank’s interest thus has a stimulating effect on the economy, and note that real interest rates at present are lower than they have been since the spring of 1996. It should 
  also be borne in mind that changes in interest rates only affect demand and inflation with a considerable time lag, so that the full effect of interest rate cuts in recent months will not be felt for some time yet. ISK exchange rate No one doubts the importance of the ISK exchange rate for the Icelandic economy. The exchange rate has enormous impact on price levels and the performance of the export and competitive sectors. On the other hand, people must realise that the Central Bank has only limited long-term effect on the exchange rate. Many aspects of the economy affect the exchange rate. These include, for instance, foreign trade, foreign investments in Iceland and investment by Icelanders abroad, not to forget expectations of future economic developments. There is little doubt that expectations concerning power-intensive industry developments have influenced the exchange rate in recent months. Interest rates certainly affect the exchange rate, but experience both in Iceland and elsewhere shows that this effect eventually disappears, as long as monetary policy aims at maintaining long-term inflation comparable to that of the country’s trading partners. At the same time, intervention by central banks can have a temporary impact. If, however, the exchange rate is forcefully headed in a certain direction, no central bank can withstand this trend for any length of time. This has been the experience throughout the world, wherever there is free movement of capital between countries. This was also the experience of the Central Bank of Iceland when it attempted to check the slide of the króna from mid-year 2000 to autumn 2001. To demand now that the Central Bank adopt exchange rate objectives is unrealistic. The only option to peg the currency is to return to former practices and introduce currency restrictions, but who wants to go back to that? Cutting interest rates beyond what the Bank’s inflation targets allow, in order to force down the exchange rate, would be highly inadvisable. The nominal exchange rate might temporarily drop somewhat, but it is practically certain that inflation would once more heat up and soon we would end up with the same real exchange rate as before, in addition to having kindled the flames of the next period of overheating and instability. Slowdown in the economy After a protracted period of high economic growth, which ended in overheating, we now have a slight slowdown in the economy and increased unemployment. It has, among other things, been claimed that this slowdown is in particular the result of a tight monetary policy. Our experience, as well as that of other countries, shows that a temporary slowdown is often an unavoidable consequence of strict economic management, aimed at controlling over-expansion and holding inflation in check. This is one reason why it is so important to prevent such waves from becoming too high. It is, however, an oversimplification to claim that monetary policy alone makes the decisive difference. Interest rates primarily affect demand in the economy. There are, on the other hand, many other factors which affect both demand and supply in the economy. These include, for instance, fishing quotas, public finances and public investment, foreign investment, e.g. in heavy industry, and the wage policy of the social partners. People who make these decisions control important economic instruments which are beyond the reach of the Central Bank. There are thus many parties involved in managing economic affairs and the Central Bank is far from the only party responsible here. Actions to boost economic growth and reduce unemployment Recently a number of actions have been announced to relax restraint in the economy. The full effect of major interest rate cuts in recent months has yet to be felt. The Central Bank has also announced imminent relaxation of reserve requirements, which will release funds in the banking system and should lead to interest rate decreases there. Each day the Central Bank has puchased foreign currency, in so doing placing some ISK 11 billion in circulation since September, which has certainly slowed the exchange rate rise. The government has decided to accelerate certain projects on which it will spend ISK 6 billion. Local authorities and other parties have announced measures aimed at the same objective. So it is clear that much has been done which can be expected to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment in the coming months. Ahead of us are the most extensive construction projects in Icelandic history, which will have a major impact on the economy in both the short and long term. They will require sound economic management. It is important to foresee early enough what effects this development could have if no 
  action were taken. It would be completely irresponsible to simply allow things to take their course as if nothing needed to be done to compensate for these developments, as has actually been proposed in some quarters recently. The Central Bank’s analysis of the proposed development indicates that, with appropriate economic management actions, it should be possible to maintain economic stability and keep inflation under control. The Central Bank of Iceland will do its utmost to achieve this, as it naturally bears an indisputable legal responsibility to do so. 
 BIS Review 12/2003 1 Nout Wellink: The position of women in the financial sector Address by Dr Nout Wellink, President of the Nederlandsche Bank and President of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Conference on “Women at the Decision Making Positions”, organised by the Russian Association of Regional Banks, Amsterdam, 24 February 2003. *      *      * I rarely have the privilege of addressing an audience largely made up of women. That in itself is telling - and is not a good sign. But the fact of the matter is that the financial world is still dominated by men. That applies to both commercial and central banks, and the Netherlands is no exception. So, in the run-up to International Women’s Day, you have every reason to hold this conference to focus on the role of women at senior management levels in the financial sector.  The position of women in the labour market can and must be improved, notably in the financial sector. That’s not just because I think women deserve a better deal but also, if not mainly, because it would be good for companies and for society as a whole to see an improvement in women’s labour market participation and their chances to advance to the top. The world would be a bleaker place if it only consisted of men, and the same applies to organisations. An organisation with a mix of men and women on all levels has a more pleasant atmosphere, which possibly makes for a better performance. Moreover, the economy as a whole will benefit from higher women participation rates, for the participation rate among women in the euro area is one of the reasons why the growth of income per capita here lags behind that in the United States. And women should be appropriately rewarded, of course. Which reminds me of what was written about Alan Greenspan in a recent biography. When still running his own financial consultancy, some 40 years ago, Greenspan chose to recruit women rather than men. His motivation was purely rational. He was convinced that women were just as qualified as men, but since the labour market did not fully appreciate the quality of women they were undervalued and hence cheaper. Greenspan used his sharp insight to benefit from this arbitrage opportunity. Back to the present day. The good news is that in the euro area the labour market participation for women aged between 24 and 45 is far higher than that for those of 45 and over. This indicates an improvement over time and is a promising development. The bad news is that women still lag far behind in terms of qualitative participation. Let me keep to the Netherlands on this point. According to a report by our Social and Cultural Planning Office a few years ago, not a single woman sat on the Managing Boards of the top 25 Dutch companies. In the top 100, there was only one woman to over 400 men, and women made up no more than 2.5% in the top 5000. The situation on the Supervisory Boards was better, but with an average of one woman to 12 men, still not exactly positive. And as far as our banking sector is concerned, I am not sure whether we would have sufficient women top managers to create a delegation like yours. As regards the position of women in senior management, I must unfortunately share some of the blame. The Nederlandsche Bank has one women among the 12 members of its Supervisory Board. Prince Claus, the late husband of our Queen Beatrix, was instrumental in getting her on our Supervisory Board by stressing time and again that the successor to him should be a woman. Our Governing Board is made up entirely of men, so in that respect we have a lot to learn from your country. Two of our eight deputy executive directors are women. While this is an improvement on the past, we still have a long way to go. We are hence actively working on a plan for a larger number of women at the Nederlandsche Bank, with more advancement to the top. Before I tell you how we intend to do this, let me first go into the reasons why women lag behind.  Both demand and supply factors play a role. As regards demand, all too often, women are passed over as potential candidates for recruitment or promotion. Whereas some feel that this is done with intent, I am inclined to think that it is an unconscious process, arising from a stereotyped view of men and women. In fact, research indicates that men are inclined to appoint men, and women are inclined to appoint women. Since management traditionally consists of men, it is easy to see where the glass ceiling comes from, and that it will not disappear unless we make a conscious effort.  Turning to supply, and women themselves have a role to play here, several causes present themselves. Women are less self-confident than men, are not as quick to think that they’re suitable or to push themselves forward. That is not just my impression, it has been confirmed by psychological 
  research. Another factor is that women sometimes have other preferences in respect of combining their career and family. That is only to be respected and means that, wherever we can, we should create the conditions for combining work and childcare. Not every job can be done part-time but there are plenty of positions, even at senior levels, that offer the flexibility that women prefer because of personal circumstances.  That brings me to the Nederlandsche Bank’s policy in this area. Let me begin with the plus-es. Our general terms of employment are well-disposed towards women. We have a standard 36-hour working week, opportunities for all, including senior staff, to work part-time, flexible working hours and good financial arrangements for childcare. Our recruitment policy is geared to attracting women employees, and in fact over time more women, especially the higher educated who are the high potentials for advancing to the top, have joined the Bank. To give you some figures, whereas our percentage of female employees increased merely from 30 to 34 percent over the last 6 years, the percentage of women in the higher salaried positions has doubled in that period.  But, and that is a minus, we apparently don’t do enough to allow women to advance to the top. Whereas 25% of our female employees has an academic background, only 11% reaches the level of senior management. So we still have a long way to go.  One initiative in the Netherlands to promote the advancement of women in the boardroom has been the creation of a network of ambassadors, comprising top male executives in larger organisations who are willing to push for more opportunities for women. I was recently asked to join this network. As one of the ambassadors, I am obliged to draw up three personal points for action and to stick to them.  Your conference gives me a wonderful opportunity to announce my three personal points for action or, to use words that I feel more confortable with, policy targets. If it’s up to me, what will the Nederlandsche Bank do in the near future to stimulate women’s advancement to the top?  (cid:1)(cid:2)My first personal point of action is to make it more visible, both to the outside world and to everyone working at the Nederlandsche Bank, that I am committed to promoting the career possibilities of women in our organisation. Research has shown that explicit commitment by board members makes women more confident to apply for senior positions. Moreover, it makes managers more aware that they are expected to pay attention to women candidates when it comes to promotion, and to be flexible when it comes to the demands of those who have the ambition to combine a career with the care of a family. This conference is one way to create this visibility, for which I thank you. Giving interviews on the subject is another and I promise that in the course of this year I will actively look for possibilities to get press coverage of my views on the subject.  (cid:1)(cid:2)My second point of action is to invite high potential women working at the Nederlandsche Bank for a discussion about the problems they encounter in their job fulfilment and career planning. If I want to promote opportunities for women in my organisation, I must have a clear picture of how they perceive the glass ceiling. I intend to discuss the outcome of these conversations with our management. I expect that from this exchange of information we will be able to draw lessons that may be translated in specific measures for improvement of the career possibilities for women.  (cid:1)(cid:2)For my third point of action I would like to draw upon that information. I intend to establish a (moving) target figure for the participation of women candidates in our management trainee programme. Not all high potential women may be interested in a career to the top, for the reasons I mentioned earlier. But, depending on the number of women that are, I will establish a target rate of participation of women in our management development programme. Moreover, when it comes to promotions I want every shortlist to contain as a rule at least one woman.  Sticking to these three personal points of action, or policy targets, is a question of commitment. Being a central banker, I am well aware of the importance for my reputation of holding on to this commitment. But not only my reputation is at stake. Promoting opportunities for women in the financial sector is very important, as we are responsible for bringing out the best in our human capital, male and female. I hope that this conference, and the other activities being organised for International Women’s Day, will contribute to more equal and fair representation in management in general and in the financial sector in particular. 
 BIS Review 11/2003 1 Jean-Claude Trichet: The European Monetary Union and the euro Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor of the Bank of France, at the Financial Forum 2003, organised by The Wall Street Journal Europe and The New Economy Forum, Madrid, 25 February 2003.  *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and an honour to be with you today, on the occasion of the “Financial Forum 2003”, organised by the New Economy Forum and the Wall Street Journal Europe. I would like to present my views on the successful set-up of the euro, on the economic and financial integration of Europe and on the challenges that the euro-zone will confront going forward. The Euro: built on a successful set up Set-up of the Eurosystem The single monetary policy is formulated and implemented within a sound institutional framework, the Eurosystem, comprising the European Central Bank and the twelve national central banks of the euro area. Three principles underpin the Eurosystem: independence, transparency and decentralisation. The independence of both the European Central Bank and national central banks is enshrined in the Treaty. When exercising their powers and carrying out their tasks and duties, neither the central banks of the Eurosystem nor any member of its decision making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions, from any government of a Member State or from any other body. Independence refers to institutional, operational and financial independence. We consider that independance as defined above contributes to the clarity and the credibility of the single monetary policy. Transparency and accountability: elected authorities, key economic players, as well as all European citizens must be fully informed on the conduct of the single monetary policy. At the European level, the ECB maintains a permanent dialogue with the European Council and the European Parliament, as do national central banks with national institutions. The ECB is the only central bank in the world to enforce the concept of regular, frequent, real-time communication in the domain of monetary policy. Indeed, once a month, immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council, the President of the ECB holds a press conference. The independence of a central bank and its democratic accountability are two sides of the same coin. In this respect, both public speeches and testimonies by the President of the European Central Bank and by the Governors of national central banks, to the attention of institutions as well as public opinion, are crucial. An important part of our collective duty consists of tirelessly explaining the rationale that underpins the Governing Council’s decisions.  Lastly, decentralisation: as the subsidiarity principle underlies the whole European construction, decentralisation is a major principle of the architecture of the Eurosystem. The Eurosystem is a team whose members work in close co-operation, and the team spirit is really strong and fruitful. Monetary policy decisions are taken, at the centre, by the Governing Council, and are implemented by the national central banks in a closely co-ordinated way. ECB governance On 3 February 2003, the Governing Council of the ECB unanimously approved a Recommendation for a European Council decision, which is aimed at adjusting the voting modalities in the Governing Council in an enlarged euro area, in accordance with article 10.6 of the Statutes introduced by the Treaty of Nice. This adjustment became necessary so as to maintain the efficiency and timeliness of the Governing Council’s decision-making process. The Recommendation has been submitted to the EU Council. We hope that it will eventually be endorsed by the Heads of State and Government after both the European Parliament and the European Commission, which has already delivered its opinion, have been consulted.  
 2 BIS Review 11/2003 As soon as the number of members of the Governing Council will reach 22, the total number of voting rights will be limited to 21. The six executive board members will have a permanent voting right and the NCB Governors will share the remaining 15 voting rights which will rotate among them according to pre-established rules. To ensure that all decisions taken by the Governing Council are representative of the euro area economy as a whole, Governors will be allocated to groups which differ with respect to the frequency with which their members will have voting rights. The allocation of Governors to groups will therefore be done in accordance with a ranking of their respective NCB’s, reflecting mainly the size of economies and of financial sectors. All in all, this recent recommandation from the Governing Council is testimony to its ability to smoothly adapt its internal governance to the challenges posed by enlargement. Strategy of the single monetary policy The Maastricht Treaty clearly defines the ultimate objective of the single monetary policy, that is to say maintaining price stability. However, for attaining this goal, it is essential to clearly define price stability: we define it as a year-on-year increase in the overall Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) of below 2% in the whole euro area. Bearing in mind this objective, our monetary policy strategy is based on two “pillars”. We have first assigned a key role to the monetary aggregate M3. This “pillar” is based on a reference value which is set at 4.5% for the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3. The concept of a reference value does not mean that the Eurosystem is committed to automatically correcting deviations in monetary growth in the short term. Naturally, we also follow the components and counterparts of M3 closely. In this regard, the development of loans to the private sector, as well as the evolution of government finance and capital flows with the rest of the world, deserve a particular attention. However, it is common sense to say that monetary developments do not account for all the risks to price stability. This is why we have defined a second “pillar” for our monetary policy strategy, consisting of a broad range of variables that are referred to as indicators for the euro area price outlook.  The relatively low yields on long-term euro-denominated bonds confirm investors’ confidence in the new currency. This was not the case four or five years ago. At that time, financial markets were convinced that the euro would be the weighted arithmetic mean of its legacy currencies and would not inherit the level of confidence and credibility of the strongest of these. The euro has actually been founded on a benchmarking principle, not on a convergence towards an average. This may explain why the interest rates of the euro were the lowest in Europe from the outset.  To sum up, we consider the maintenance of price stability over the medium term to be the Eurosystem’s greatest contribution to fostering an environment which is conducive to sustainable growth and employment. And, it is also its greatest contribution to limiting unnecessary volatility of output and employment in the short run.  The success, thus far, of our strategy does not mean that our current monetary policy strategy is engraved in the marble. With the benefit of hindsight, 2003 seems the appropriate point in time to take stock of our experience thus far and to reflect on the various elements of the strategy. This issue is actively dealt with our Eurosystem’s staff and we plan to complete this evaluation in the course of the spring and to publish it. Needless to say that the decision to undertake an in-depth assessment of our experience does not necessarily imply that substantial changes are contemplated. Successful technical framework The launch of the euro on the financial markets, on 1 January 1999, has been an indisputable success from a technical point of view. This is a great achievement since many observers doubted of the immediate success of a technical challenge of such a magnitude. Three orientations still shape this success: • the monetary policy framework includes a set of instruments chosen with a view to observing the principles of market orientation, equal treatment, simplicity, and transparency. The decentralisation of operations has undoubtedly contributed to the smooth functioning of the framework. Maintaining a close contact between commercial banks and their national central banks has helped financial markets to quickly adopt the harmonised practices 
 BIS Review 11/2003 3 relating to open market operations, eligible collateral for credit operations and minimum reserve systems. • operational efficiency is highlighted by the precise adjustment of banking liquidity and effective steering of short-term interest rates; the Eurosystem has demonstrated this efficiency, in the days after the tragic events of 11th September 2001, by acting quickly and by ensuring a smooth and orderly functioning of the European financial markets. Here again, doubts had been previously raised on the ability of the Governing Council to make decisions swiftly. • security is provided by the procedures and systems implemented, both for the execution of inter-bank transactions, and vis-à-vis large-value payments. The inter-bank market has become highly integrated thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the real-time transfer of large-value payments throughout the euro area and in other EU countries. Let me turn now to the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, which has been the last step of a now more-than-twenty-year process of monetary integration. Euro changeover On 1 January 2002, the euro banknotes and coins were issued and became legal tender in the countries of the euro area. This was a unique and highly symbolic milestone for Europe. Let me first stress that, thanks to national efforts and the co-ordination by the European Commission and the Eurosystem, almost 100 % of cash transactions in the euro area were being carried out in euro only two months after the changeover.  Although the practical changeover to the euro might be considered as an outstanding achievement, we should remain vigilant on the following issues: • First, price stability. Although some increases in prices of a certain number of consumer goods and services have been reported, the first evidence shows that, overall, the effect of the changeover on price stability has been marginal. But consumers must keep alert, while companies and retailers remain responsible as regards price setting. In the end, competition should also contribute to lowering the prices in the short-to-medium term. • Second, we must closely monitor the risks of counterfeiting of notes and coins: the information campaign of the Eurosystem “The Euro. Our money” was aimed at familiarising all the European citizens with their new banknotes and coins (and their security features) and, by doing so, it helped them identify the obviously fake banknotes. All institutions concerned, both national and European, are co-operating closely to prevent and fight counterfeiting. Right now, counterfeit banknotes are scarce and conspicuous. The credibility of the Eurosystem and of the single monetary policy, and the successful changeover to the euro represent major achievements. They certainly contribute to the efficient functioning of EMU and to European economic and financial integration, as I will explain it right now.  * * * EMU: a balanced concept fostering economic and financial integration EMU is an economically sound and well-grounded concept. A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of sceptics that the euro would really be launched. The opinion that the single currency would never exist has of course been disproved by the facts. Nevertheless, objections are still being raised from time to time, on the alleged grounds that the euro area economy comprehends inconsistencies that could endanger and challenge the viability of EMU, all the more so since the European Union is about to welcome new members. Some observers thus claim that the lack of co-ordination between European economic policies, in the absence of a political federation, is likely to deprive the area of an appropriate policy-mix. Others blame the lack of instruments allowing us to tackle asymmetric shocks that may arise, and underline the lack of flexibility or the absence of mobility of the European labour force. Others claim that the 
 4 BIS Review 11/2003 presumed economic divergences and structural gaps among euro area countries are too large to ensure a viable monetary union. How do we respond to these important objections? (1) It is not disputable that for EMU to function well, Member States, especially the major ones in terms of GDP, must be aware of the spill-over effects that national economic policies may trigger. The existence of spill-over justifies the implementation of a close co-ordination between national economic policies. This is embodied in the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to consider national economic policies “as a matter of common concern” and subject them to a multilateral procedure. Practically, member States have designed institutions and mechanisms to promote appropriate co-ordination. We can now say that EMU has in turn been beneficial to the European economic and financial integration as a whole. Indeed, a coherent operational framework has been provided for the co-ordination of economic policies through close mutual surveillance (under the responsibility of the “Euro Group” and the Ecofin Council) and through the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, discussed each year by the Heads of States and Governments, help monitor macroeconomic and structural developments in the Member States. I would like to briefly recall why the Stability and Growth Pact plays such an important role: • By supervising the fiscal policies of the euro area Member States, the Pact together with the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines contributes to ensuring an appropriate policy mix within the euro area. It is essential for conducting a meaningful monetary policy, to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a significant federal budget. • By setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits, the Pact also helps prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium which would be transferred from poorly managed economies to them through the channel of the single currency. As regards the second common criticism against EMU, that is to say the lack of instruments to respond to asymmetric shocks, I would like to stress that the Stability and Growth Pact helps countering this argument. Indeed, by urging countries to aim at a fiscal position “close to balance or in surplus” in the medium term, the Pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase, if need be, providing that they do not exceed the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods, that can be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks. The last set of criticisms focuses on presumed economic divergences between economies within the euro area. To answer this last objection, I would like to put forward a few ideas: • Firstly, monetary union does not necessarily imply that, at any given point in time, all participating countries will have the same rate of inflation or growth, even though the creation of the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. For example, inflation divergences across countries or regions may be accommodated in a monetary union as part of the process of convergence of productivity and living standards. • Secondly, I would like to quote Professor Robert Mundell, who made, at the beginning of 1998, an interesting clarification of the Optimal Currency Area theory, and argued that in the event of a shift in demand from one member country to another, creating unemployment in the first and inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not necessarily be able to solve the problem. I quote: “If the argument for devaluation were valid, it could be applied to every state, province or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued!”. Even though the EMU relates to a single monetary policy, it also relates to the harmonisation of other markets, i.e. goods and services, as well as financial markets. In these areas, the integration process is well on track. 
 BIS Review 11/2003 5 EMU fosters economic and financial integration Financial Europe under construction: the reorganisation of capital markets In 1999, as soon as the euro was launched, one of the expected advantages was the prospect of deeper, larger and more integrated capital markets contributing to reducing the cost of capital for businesses and giving Europeans a greater range of saving options. These expectations have become reality in both the money market and longer-term capital markets. On the euro money market, the unsecured deposit inter-bank market is highly integrated. EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks that are fully accepted by all market participants. This is reflected, for instance, in the huge development of the euro interest-rate swap market.  On the euro bond market, the integration process has registered three main developments: • a rapid internationalisation: The introduction of the single currency has fostered the euro-denominated private bond market, by enlarging the potential pool of investors, notably international investors.  • increased competition between issuers, which has encouraged the standardisation of sovereign bonds, the gradual convergence towards “best practices”, the development of a range of attractive and actively traded benchmark issues (especially for sovereign bonds). Besides, competition has also enhanced liquidity as issuers have increased the average size of outstanding bonds. • the modernisation of market structures: besides the rapid development of electronic trading, the consolidation of Central Securities Depositories is also paving the way for a more efficient functioning of Delivery-versus-Payment procedures, and easier and safer channels of settlement of cross-border securities transactions. This last point is of particular relevance for the Eurosystem, as the smooth functioning of European securities settlement infrastructure is key for the practical implementation of monetary policy. On the equity market, the elimination of the currency risk within the euro area has led investors to shift from a domestic orientation to a more international, sectoral one. The creation of a wide range of pan-European sectoral indices was, thus, a direct consequence of these changes in investor strategies.  Additionally, the introduction of euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the financial sector. For instance, in this respect, we can stress current trends in mergers or close co-operation between banks, stock exchanges, securities settlement systems, clearing houses. Had the euro not been created, would it have been thinkable for the Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris security exchanges to jointly create EURONEXT? The large European goods and services market. Such changes in the European financial landscape have significantly improved the efficiency of capital allocation. The euro contributes to enabling European savers to easily select the most efficient investments. It also helps the productive sector and companies to achieve significant economies of scale, enhances the transparency of the market and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers.  Moreover, the pace of internationalisation of the euro area economy has been further spurred by the euro. Allow me to give just one example: the level of accumulated foreign direct investment abroad by French residents since 1999 amounted to EUR 380 billion (i.e. four times its pre-1999 level). Indeed, capital flows between the Euro area and the rest of the world mirror a high degree of attractiveness: over the years 1999-2001, the Euro area has registered total inward direct investments worth 719.8 billion Euros.  At this point, one may wonder which conditions are required to ensure the success of the euro and EMU in the medium term. I believe that we have to tackle three main challenges: structural reforms, financial stability and the accession to the EU of new Member States. * * * 
 6 BIS Review 11/2003 Challenges ahead Structural reforms The first challenge is, beyond dispute, to implement structural reforms in the euro area’s economies. Structural reforms were crystallised at the European level in what is called the Lisbon strategy. The first objective of this strategy is to substantially raise our potential output growth. The second is to make our economies more competitive. Implementing the reforms: the Lisbon strategy The European Council meeting held in Luxembourg in December 1997 explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected to achieve enhanced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council, held in March 2000, further enhanced the medium-term strategy to introduce structural reforms in the Union. This strategy aims to make the European Union the world’s most dynamic knowledge economy by 2010. It has since been amended so as to include social issues (at the Council of Nice in late 2000) and environmental issues (at the Council of Gothenburg in mid 2001).   What has been achieved to date in the field of structural reforms is quite encouraging. Noticeable successes have already been registered with regard to policies, such as new rules in telecommunications, electricity and gas markets. The current 2002 Broad Economic Policy Guidelines evaluation exercise is an opportunity to check on the progress accomplished in reforms that were agreed in Lisbon and recently reasserted in Barcelona. Before reviewing the priority areas where fresh impetus is required, I wish to briefly make two remarks:  First, the responsibility for structural reforms in the European Union rests with the individual Member States. Consequently, there is a wide variety of institutional solutions and regulatory arrangements across countries and sectors. I nevertheless consider that such a decentralised approach should be considered as an opportunity, rather than a disadvantage. It encourages “cross fertilisation” of best practices through increased co-ordination of Member States’ structural policies.  My second remark relates to the changeover to the euro. This event has been a major structural reform in itself, i.e. a powerful drive towards restructuring the European economy.  An important objective consists in raising the potential output growth of the European economy If France and Europe seek to secure sustainable growth at levels that are as high as possible, the key variable is potential output growth. There are three ways of raising the level of potential output growth:  First, to boost investment: the more we invest and the lower inflationary pressures, the stronger potential output growth. For example, a two-point increase in the productive investment ratio (productive investment / GDP, 11,4 % during the last five years in France) over the next decade would bring about an average acceleration of more than 0,5 point in potential output growth over the same period. The second way of raising potential output growth is to increase the quantity of actual labour: The European Council of Lisbon set as a central objective the rise of the employment rate of our populations from 60 to 70 % in 10 years. The Council also fixed two sub objectives: to raise the employment rate of women to 60 % and employment rate of older workers (from 55 to 64 years old) to 50 %. As a comparison, the same overall employment rate stands at 75 % in the USA. Although some progress has been achieved in this area, the lack of substantive change and the tendency in some member states to continue to use early retirement schemes remain causes for concern. The third way of raising potential output growth is to promote ways to boost gains in labour productivity: This can be achieved by increasing competition, encouraging enterprise and innovation, and improving the workforce’s skills. Indeed, on the basis of hours worked, productivity in the EU reached in 2001 83% of the level of that in the US, which points some room for improvement.  
 BIS Review 11/2003 7 That strategy should be pursued whilst increasing the overall competitiveness of our economies The Euro area displays sound macroeconomic fundamentals and satisfying price competitiveness. Sound macroeconomic fundamentals make the Euro area an attractive place to invest in : no major imbalances may be observed contrary to other major areas. Indeed, the Euro area provides for a low and stable inflation environment, roughly balanced external accounts, abundant private savings, and sound financial systems. Then, in terms of real effective exchange rate, the Euro area has constantly gained in competitiveness over the past few years. In the 3rd quarter of 2002, even though the Euro real exchange rate deflated by unit labour costs in total economy versus the rest of industrialised countries appreciated by 5.4% year-on-year, it is still below its long term average (1987-2001) by 12.3%, according to the European Commission calculations.  If I refer more specifically to what has been observed in the past in France, an economic strategy, based on a moderate increase in unit costs of production, gave us an important edge: the considerable improvement in the cost competitiveness of the French industrial sector from the mid-1980s has contributed extensively to boosting growth. The French economy grew faster than major euro area economies from 1997 to 2001 (+ 15,4 % in France compared to + 13,4 % in the euro area), while repeatedly recording a large current account surplus. This improvement in our overall cost-competitive situation has progressively materialised into growth, job creations and solid external accounts.  Competitiveness is also linked to European harmonisation in other fields, for example in the service industries. Most of the barriers to trade in services appear to be due to national regulations and should be abolished or alleviated. While the Eurosystem acts mainly as a stimulus in the process of structural reforms, it also plays a leading role in ensuring financial stability. This brings me to the second challenge that EMU will have to take up. Financial stability Like any independent central bank, the Eurosystem has to fulfil two main functions: firstly, ensuring price stability, which is a key condition for sustained growth, and secondly, preserving financial stability, which has become a critical challenge in a globalized world economy. I insist on the highly complementary nature of these two objectives, as price stability is the foundation on which financial stability is built. The adequacy of European institutional arrangements for financial stability The adequacy of European institutional arrangements for financial stability has been reviewed in depth at the EU level. In two reports, in April 2000 and April 2001, the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) took stock of the supervisory and regulatory mechanisms in the EU and examined the issue of financial crisis management. It concluded that the current arrangements provided a coherent and flexible basis for safeguarding financial stability and recommended a further strengthening of cross-border and cross-sector co-operation. I fully share the assessment put forward in these reports and I would like to stress here the special responsibilities of central banks, due to: their position at the heart of financial systems, their role as liquidity supplier to the economy, their close and constant contact with credit institutions, their contribution to banking supervision and to the safe and efficient functioning of payment systems, and at least for some of them, their contribution to the safe and efficient functioning of securities clearing and settlement systems. To sum up, an institutional framework in which the Eurosystem’s responsibilities for monetary policy in the euro area are coupled with extensive supervisory responsibilities of NCBs in domestic markets, and with reinforced co-operation at an area-wide level, seems appropriate to tackle the changes triggered by the current financial trends and the introduction of the euro. 
 8 BIS Review 11/2003 Two points of particular relevance for the financial regulatory framework Let me conclude on this important topic by stressing two points of particular relevance for the European financial regulatory framework: • There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem welcomed the objective of the European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, to accelerate completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan can be implemented by 2005. This Plan is regularly reviewed by European authorities, and progress is being made.  • The Eurosystem also supports the strategic conclusions of the Committee chaired by A. Lamfalussy on the integration of the European securities markets, ratified by the European Council meeting in Stockholm in 2001 and approved by the European Parliament in early 2002. We are convinced that the implementation of these broad guidelines and the new cooperation structures at the European level will help make it possible to take full advantage of the introduction of the euro.  • In the field of financial regulation and supervision, ECOFIN Council (December the 3rd 2002) approved a report by the Economic and Financial Committee which made proposals concerning the cooperation structures at the European level for financial regulation and supervision. These new arrangements are now being implemented. In this regard, one of the statutory tasks of the Eurosystem is, according to the Treaty, to contribute to the smooth conduct of prudential supervision policies and the stability of the financial system. I am therefore convinced that the involvement of central banks in this issue will remain absolutely crucial. • Finally, since the tragic events of 11 September and their impact on financial stability, concerns over the potential abuse of the financial system for the financing of terrorism have received top priority in international and European regulatory discussions. The international community and, within it, the financial community, should step up its efforts to hunt down money used by organised crime and terrorism. We shall not be successful overnight, but, today, there is a strong political determination on the part of the international community to co-operate on this issue. As far as the fight against organised crime and terrorism is concerned, we can no longer accept that certain players are not prepared to observe the rules of international legal co-operation.  Beyond structural reforms and financial stability, the accession of new Member States to the European Union and to EMU is the third challenge that I have identified. The last challenge but not the least. Accession of new Member States to the EU and EMU Twelve countries from central, eastern and southern Europe are currently negotiating accession to the EU, of which ten, according to the calendar endorsed by the European Council, will join the E.U. as early as the 1st of January 2004. This provides further evidence of the attractiveness of the European framework, which has provided us with both political stability and economic progress for half a century.  The accession countries have accomplished significant progress in stabilising and strengthening their economies and institutions. Observing the accession countries since the beginning of the nineties, we see the major improvements that these countries have made on the road towards convergence with the EU.  Nevertheless, there is also general agreement on the fact that the gap in terms of average GDP per capita between the accession countries and the euro area, although diminishing, still remains quite significant. On average, GDP per capita in terms of purchasing power parity is around 44% of that of the euro area, while in terms of current exchange rates it is only around 22%. The size of the gap, combined with the limited growth differentials between the two groups of countries, suggests that the process of real convergence will be very gradual. Indeed, real convergence is essential to create economic cohesion within EMU and promote integration between Members States, thereby helping to minimise the risk and the effects of asymetric shocks. The Eurosystem, and notably the Banque de France, is following the enlargement process with a great deal of attention. Let me stress a few points of particular relevance for the Eurosystem and for 
 BIS Review 11/2003 9 accession countries themselves, on the road towards catching up with the EU and achieving convergence. • Firstly, nominal convergence, which is requested in order to adopt the euro, must be sustainable and therefore constitutes a medium-term objective, rather than a short-term priority. Indeed, the EU Treaty calls, as a prerequisite for adopting the euro, for a high degree of sustainable convergence in the fields of price stability, government fiscal position, stability of the exchange rate, and long-term interest-rate levels.  Therefore, nominal and real convergence should be pursued in parallel, and are not antagonistic, in the interest of both accessing countries and the euro area. • Secondly, I note that many accession countries have already expressed their intention to join ERM II as soon as possible after EU entry. This intention is to be welcomed. However, it should be clear that the ERM II is not expected to be adopted by new members immediately after EU accession, nor is intended to be limited to only two years, which is the minimum period of time prior to adopting the euro. It would be misleading to consider ERM II as a mere “waiting room” before euro. On the very contrary, ERM II is to be considered as a “training room”. This mechanism will allow countries to retain some limited exchange rate flexibility during the catching-up process. ERM II membership also offers a meaningful, flexible but credible framework for : - increasing convergence with the euro area,  - tackling the challenges faced by accession countries on the road towards the adoption of the euro,  - contributing to macroeconomic and exchange rate stability,  - helping determine the appropriate level for the eventual irrevocable fixation of parities. This is to be accomplished in the best interest of the candidate countries themselves. • Thirdly, a sound and efficient banking and financial system is key. Significant progress has been made over the past few years in rehabilitating the banking sector and encouraging structural reforms and foreign ownership. Progress in corporate governance, the enhancement of the legal and supervisory frameworks that support the banking sector are also crucial. They are conducive to achieving the macroeconomic objectives of the accession countries. * * * To conclude, let me stress two words: rapidity and stability. Rapidity is a key word. We have not much time to meditate, decide, implement. The structural reforms, that we are badly in need of, must be implemented as rapidly as possible if Europe is to be up to its historical challenges. The Chinese say “It is later than you think” has never been so true. In any case, history itself does not wait for us. And when I look back, over the last twenty years, it seems to me that an unfortunately well-founded criticism could be that we have constantly under-assessed the rapidity of the stream of history: the rapidity of the deterioration of the situation in the USSR, the rapidity of the collapse itself, the rapidity of the enlargement process, the depth, the strength and intensity of the “desire of Europe”, which is spreading over in the countries in transition. Second word: stability. Economic and financial stability, in a period of excessive volatility and of wide boom-bust episode, financial and real stability appear to be a very precious asset. We have built a new world: technology has permitted instantaneous communication and incredibly powerful real-time computation. Globalization has created new cultural, conceptual, commercial and financial links between all economies including previously centrally planned systems; together technology and globalization are progressively driving us to a unified planet of universal rules and regulations, code of conduct and practices, market procedures and market instruments, accounting standards, etc. In this new world, phenomena which had traditionally a local or a national impact may be amplified and become dangerous at the global level: amplification of financial cycles, herd behaviour, global contagion. Analysing the opportunities and the risks, and understanding the functioning of our system with a view to making it as stable as possible is a very exciting, ambitious and urgent task.

 BIS Review 11/2003 1 Nicholas C Garganas: Exchange-rate regimes on the road to EMU: lessons from Greece’s experience Luncheon address by Mr Nicholas C Garganas, Governor of the Bank of Greece, at the Seminar on “Monetary Strategies for Accession Countries”, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, 28 February 2003. The references for the speech can be found on the Bank of Greece’s website. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank Magyar National Bank, the Institute of World Economics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and the Center of European Integration Studies of the University of Bonn for inviting me to speak to you today.  In contemplating the subject of this seminar, one is struck by how dramatically things have changed in the course of a decade. In 1992 and 1993, when the Exchange Rate Mechanism - or ERM - underwent a series of speculative attacks, the prospects of a European monetary union were viewed, by many observers, with considerable skepticism. This skepticism was not without foundation. After all, hadn’t there been previous false starts on the road to EMU? Hadn’t the Werner Report prescribed a European monetary union by the end of 1970s? Yet, here we are today, having fulfilled the dreams of Pierre Werner and his colleagues and having celebrated the fourth birthday of EMU.  Today, I would like to address some lessons from the experience of Greece, the newest member of the euro area, in its quest for EMU membership. I will confront what appears to be a dilemma. As we have heard this morning, much of the economics profession appears to have been converted to the “hypothesis of the vanishing middle”; for economies well integrated into world capital markets, there is little, if any, middle ground between floating exchange rates and monetary unification. Effectively, this hypothesis rules out intermediate regimes. Yet, a requirement for entering the euro area is participation in ERM II, which is, after all, an intermediate regime. How can this dilemma be resolved? The Retreat from Intermediate Regimes Before I discuss Greece’s experience, let me address the reasons underlying the retreat from intermediate regimes. What has caused this retreat? First, an explosive increase in capital flows during the 1990s has made the operation of intermediate regimes problematic. As has already been discussed at this seminar by Jorge Braga de Macedo and Helmut Reisen, according to the thesis of the Impossible Trinity, developed in the 1980s, under a system of pegged exchange rates and free capital mobility, it is not possible to pursue an independent monetary policy on a sustained basis. Eventually, current-account disequilibria and changes in reserves will provoke an attack on the exchange rate. The enormous increase in capital flows has been accompanied by abrupt reversals of these flows. Whereas the logic of the thesis of the Impossible Trinity suggests that exchange-rate attacks typically originate in response to current-account disequilibria and build up gradually, in fact, recent speculative attacks have often originated in the capital account, have been sudden and difficult to predict, and have included the currencies of countries without substantial current-account imbalances. Capital-flow reversals have involved a progression of speculative attacks, mostly against pegged-exchange-rate arrangements. These reversals of capital inflows and resulting exchange-rate devaluations or depreciations have often been accompanied by sharp contractions in economic activity and have, at times, entailed “twin crises” - crises in both the foreign-exchange market and the banking system.  Finally, there has been a tendency of instability in foreign-exchange markets to be transmitted from one pegged-exchange-rate regime to others in a process that has come to be known as “contagion”. The victims of contagion have seemingly included innocent bystanders - economies with sound fundamentals whose currencies might not have been attacked had they adopted one of the corner solutions.  
 2 BIS Review 11/2003 This triad of factors - (1) the difficulty of conducting an independent monetary policy when the exchange rate is pegged and the capital account open, (2) sudden capital-flow reversals, and (3) contagion - have profoundly affected the way we think about exchange-rate regimes.  The Experience of Greece: Pre-ERM The foregoing factors significantly affected the Greek economy in the 1990s. Through 1994, the performance of the Greek economy was pretty dismal. Growth was almost flat, and inflation and the fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP, were in the double-digit levels throughout the period. Other EU countries were moving forward in their quests to become members of EMU while Greece was falling farther and farther behind. Clearly, a regime change was called for. It came in 1995. The signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the government’s publicly-stated objective of joining the euro area provided powerful incentives for mobilising broad public support for policy adjustment. Among the policy measures undertaken were the following:  • Fiscal policy was progressively tightened. The fiscal deficit, as a percentage of GDP, fell from over 10 per cent in 1995 to around to 4 per cent in 1997.  • Financial deregulation, which had begun in the late 1980s, was completed and in 1994 the capital account was opened. The deregulated financial system facilitated the use of indirect instruments of monetary policy so that small, frequent changes in the instruments became feasible, enabling rapid policy responses.  • The Greek Parliament approved independence of the Bank of Greece and provided the Bank with a mandate to achieve price stability.  For its part, beginning in 1995, the Bank of Greece adopted what became known as a “hard drachma policy”, under which the exchange rate was used as a nominal anchor. For the first time, the Bank announced a specific exchange-rate target. Underlying this policy, both in Greece and elsewhere during the 1990s, was the belief that the adoption of a visible exchange-rate anchor could enhance the credibility of the dissinflationary effort because (1) the traded-goods component of the price level could be stabilised and (2) wage-settling and price-setting behaviour were restrained.  I will not go into details of the operation of the hard-drachma policy. Suffice it to say that, during the years 1995-97, real interest rates at the short-end were kept in the vicinity of 5 per cent. Fairly specific targets for the exchange rate were announced in each of the three years and were achieved. Importantly, inflation fell from about 11 per cent in 1994 to under 5 per cent at the end of 1997 while, in the first three years of the policy, real growth almost tripled compared with the rate of 1991-94.  Yet, as is typically the case with all nominal-anchor exchange-rate pegs, this regime produced difficulties. As predicted under the thesis of the Impossible Trinity, the ability to conduct an independent monetary policy under an exchange-rate peg and open capital account became increasingly demanding. The wide interest-rate differentials in favour of drachma-denominated financial instruments led to a capital-inflows problem. The Bank of Greece responded by sterilising these inflows, limiting the appreciation of the nominal exchange rate, reducing the impact of the inflows on the monetary base, and buying time for other policies to adjust. Still, the sterilisation entailed quasi-fiscal costs and, by preventing domestic interest rates from falling, tended to maintain the yield differential that had given rise to the inflows. Additionally, the Greek economy experienced a fundamental problem associated with all exchange-rate nominal-anchor pegs during the move to lower inflation; the real exchange-rate appreciated significantly contributing, along with strong domestic demand, to a widening current-account deficit. This circumstance brings me to the second and third of the triad of factors - sudden capital-flow reversals and contagion. The widening current-account deficit, combined with rapid wage growth, fed market expectations that the drachma was overvalued and provided the basis for contagion from Asia, which commenced with the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997. The sharp rise in interest rates required to support the drachma increasingly undermined growth and fiscal targets. A further regime shift was needed.  That regime shift was provided by the ERM. Effective March 16, 1998, the drachma joined the ERM at a central rate that implied a 12.3 per cent devaluation against the ECU. As I will explain, entry into the ERM allowed Greece to orient its policies to stability, fostering convergence. Because participation in 
 BIS Review 11/2003 3 the ERM, without severe tensions, plays a role in the convergence criteria for joining the euro area, it acts as testing phase for the central rate as well as for the sustainability of convergence in general.  Lessons from the ERM  Before I discuss the drachma’s experience in the ERM, let me posit a question: What kind of an intermediate exchange-rate regime do we have in mind when we refer to the ERM? In my view, the present ERM system is the result of an evolutionary process. Like all Darwinian evolutions, several distinct versions of the species can be distinguished. To provide analytic focus, I think it useful to distinguish among the following. ERM Mark 1. This species lasted from the inception of the EMS, in 1979, to 1987. Compared with the 2 per cent bands under the Bretton-Woods system, the ERM bands of fluctuation, at 4.5 per cent, were fairly wide and the system was supported by capital controls. For some currencies, the bands were even wider, at 12 per cent. Small realignments occurred frequently. Between March 1979, when the system started, and January 1987, realignments occurred on eleven occasions. The foregoing features of the system allowed France, for example, to devalue the franc by shifting the upper and lower limits of its band without affecting the market exchange rate, helping to forestall the possibility of the large profit opportunities that give rise to speculative attacks.  ERM Mark 2. What has been dubbed the “new EMS” began to take shape in 1987. Increasingly, the deutsche mark was used as a nominal anchor, with the Bundesbank’s reputation as a stalwart inflation fighter supporting the monetary authorities of some participating countries in their efforts to attain anti-inflation credibility. Except for an implicit devaluation of the Italian lira in January 1990, when that currency moved from the wide band to the narrow band, realignments ceased to be a characteristic of the system. In 1990, the remaining capital controls were eliminated by participating countries. German reunification required a tight monetary policy to counterbalance the large fiscal deficits generated by reunification. With other ERM countries in recession and requiring a loosening of monetary policy, the ERM was confronted with a classic (n-1) problem. ERM Mark 3. Beginning in September 1992, many of the currencies participating in the ERM were subjected to attacks, eventuating in a series of devaluations and the suspension of the pound sterling and the Italian lira from the system. These attacks were sudden and massive. Thus, they were different from the currency realignments of the 1980s, which were mainly the result of pressures that had build up gradually in response to current-account disequilibria. With the lifting of capital controls, the attacks in 1992-93 arose on the capital account and sometimes infected the currencies of countries with seemingly-sound fundamentals, such as France. Several new terms made their way into the lexicon of economists: (1) capital-account-driven crises, (2) sudden-stops, and (3) contagion.  ERM Mark 4. In a last-ditch effort to rescue the system, in August 1993 the ERM bands were widened to ± 15 per cent. As things turned out, this move helped salvage the system. It provided necessary breathing space for nominal convergence to occur. ERM Mark 5, or formally, ERM II. Under the present arrangement, exchange-rate stability is explicitly subordinated to the primary objective of price stability for all participating currencies and obligations under the system are deliberately more asymmetric than under the previous ERM. The notion of asymmetry is particularly important in underlining the principle that it is the country whose currency comes under pressure that has to undertake the necessary policy adjustments.  Let me now return to the case of the drachma and the ERM. By the time that the drachma entered the ERM, in March 1998, the participating countries had demonstrated their determination to form a monetary union by attaining considerable nominal convergence, as specified in the Maastricht criteria. This convergence took place under a backdrop of market-based economies that could compete effectively in an open economic and financial system. In these conditions, the system built up a considerable amount of trust. As Otmar Issing has pointed out in several recent papers, the trust evoked by governments, including in their ability to deliver credible, non-inflationary policies, is a prerequisite for the existence of a stable currency, both internally and externally. When the drachma entered the ERM, it became a beneficiary of the credibility established in the system over the previous years. It also benefited from the market’s knowledge of the availability of the system’s mutual support facilities, such as the Very Short-Term Financing Facility. Yet, Greece’s participation was not a free ticket. The other participants in the system did not wish to endanger the 
 4 BIS Review 11/2003 credibility that had taken so long to achieve. They rightly asked for an entry fee. This fee included the following elements.  • The new central rate - which as I have noted, involved a 12.3 per cent devaluation - had been agreed by all members.  • The devaluation of the drachma was both backward looking and foreward looking. The magnitude of the devaluation took account of both past inflation differentials between Greece and other EU countries and prospective differentials in the period leading up to Greece’s expected entry into the euro area. Thus, the new central rate was meant to be sustainable.  • A package of supportive fiscal and structural measure was announced. Efforts to restructure public enterprises were stepped up. The aim of the measures was to ensure the sustainability of the drachma’s new central rate. In other words, the ERM was meant to be a testing phase for EMU participation, not a free pass into the euro area.  Unlike many other devaluations of the mid-1990s and late-1990s, the drachma’s devaluation was not followed by further rounds of speculative attacks, nor by a financial crisis. Unlike other devaluations, it was not followed by contraction in economic activity, but by an acceleration. Moreover, and again in contrast with the other devaluations of this period, the impact of the drachma’s devaluation on inflation was strictly contained. What accounts for the drachma’s successful exit from one central rate to another? In my view, the key ingredients of the successful devaluation were the following.  • Unlike other currencies that were devalued during the mid-1990s and late 1990s, the drachma exited a unilateral peg and entered a systems’ arrangement, benefiting from the credibility of the ERM.  • Fiscal tightening continued following the devaluation. The fiscal deficit, as a per cent of GDP, fell to about 1 per cent in 1999, from 4 per cent in 1997. Labour-market policy gradually adjusted to the needs for fiscal discipline and for enhancing international competitiveness.  • Prudential regulation and supervision of the banking system had been strictly enforced and there was no net foreign exposure of the banking system. Thus, there was no currency-mismatching problem - i.e., large, uncovered foreign-currency positions, which, under conditions of currency devaluations, raise the debt burden of domestic foreign-currency borrowers, resulting in bankruptcies and financial crises.  In addition to placing the Bank of Greece’s disinflation strategy within a new institutional framework that gave it added credibility, the ERM provided another important advantage. Entry at the standard fluctuation bands of ± 15 per cent gave the Bank ample room for manoeuvre. Thus, when capital inflows resumed following ERM entry, the Bank allowed the exchange rate to appreciate relative to its central rate, helping to maintain the tight monetary-policy stance and to contain the inflationary impact of the devaluation. The exchange rate remained appreciated relative to its central rate throughout the rest of 1998 and for all of 1999. In 1999, for example, the drachma traded (on average) 7.7 per cent above its central rate while, for most of that year, the three-month interbank rate stood about 700 basis points above the corresponding German rate. As a result of the tightened and consistent policy mix, inflation reached a low of 2 per cent during the second half of 1999. Then, in order to limit the degree of depreciation that would be required for the market rate to reach its central rate and the resulting inflationary pressures, the central rate was revalued by 3.5 per cent in January 2000. The rest, as they say, is history; having fulfilled all the Maastricht criteria, on January 1, 2001 Greece became the 12th member of the euro area.  Concluding Remarks  What are the key lessons that emerge from Greece’s experience? Let me highlight the following.  First, an intermediate exchange rate regime can be viable in today’s world of high capital mobility provided that (1) the participants adhere to sound and sustainable policies, including those that ensure the existence of a well-functioning market economy, and, (2) the intermediate regime is used as a transitional arrangement on the road to the corner solution of a monetary union. There is no contradiction between the existence of ERM II and the hypothesis of the vanishing middle regime.  Second, ERM II provides the credibility of a systems’ arrangement, built up in a Darwinian evolution, and flexibility through the wide fluctuation bands that may be necessary to achieve nominal 
 BIS Review 11/2003 5 convergence. The credibility derived by participating in the ERM II should not, however, be endangered by use of frequent adjustments of the central parity. As the ERM experiences of the 1980s and 1990s vividly demonstrated, frequent adjustments of central parities within a pegged regime are feasible only in the presence of capital controls. In today’s world of high capital mobility, exchange-rate changes are not instruments that policy-makers can use flexibly and costlessly. The more often they are used, the less can be the credibility of a pegged exchange-rate system. Third, the need of a consistent policy mix is crucial and has important implications in terms of how we need to view policy analysis. An implication of both the Mundell-Fleming model and Mundell’s famous assignment problem is that monetary policy and fiscal policy constitute two, separate policy instruments. Yet, the simple accounting fact that government expenditure has to be financed by either taxation, borrowing, and/or money creation, implies that any analysis of monetary policy must make consistent assumptions about fiscal policy. Monetary policy and fiscal policy, in other words, are not independent policy instruments. They must work in tandem on the road to EMU, and in EMU.  Fourth, ultimately, a credible exchange-rate regime depends upon the trust evoked by governments. A governance structure that enforces the rule of law and sanctity of contracts and a political system that delivers credible, non-inflationary policies are prerequisites for the existence of a stable exchange-rate regime. Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for your attention.  
 BIS Review 10/2003 1 Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Basel II Testimony by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade and Technology, Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C., 27 February 2003.  *      *      * Chairman King, Congresswoman Maloney, members of the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade and Technology: It is a pleasure to appear before you this morning on behalf of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to discuss Basel II, the evolving new capital standard for internationally active banks and bank holding companies. At this time, bank supervisors in this country and abroad are evaluating the results of a recent survey to assess the potential quantitative impact of the current proposals on the world's large banks. In addition, the supervisors in the United States are still incorporating feedback from our discussions with bankers, an ongoing process that will continue even after final rules are adopted. From the U.S. perspective, a hallmark of the Basel II process has been the effort to tailor the capital framework to the evolving industry best practices. We intend for these dynamic efforts to continue.  That having been said, after almost five years of discussion and revision, Basel II is about ready for the last rounds of comment - which we anticipate this spring and summer. We expect the Basel Committee to approve its package by late this year, the corresponding U.S. rulemaking process to be completed next year, and implementation to begin in late 2006. Banks need some certainty for planning, but this is not inconsistent with further changes between 2004 and 2006, and thereafter, as we learn more and as practices evolve.  Why is a new capital standard necessary? The supervisors in this country have determined that Basel I, the current capital regime adopted in 1988, must be replaced for the most complex banks for three major reasons: defects in Basel I as it applies to these large entities, evolution in the art of risk management, and increased heterogeneity and concentration in the banking system.  Defects in Basel I Basel I was a major step forward in capital regulation. Indeed, for most banks in this country, Basel I is now - and for the foreseeable future will be - more than adequate as a capital framework. Most banking institutions in this country engage in businesses with risks that counterparties and supervisors can evaluate relatively easily. Moreover, because of their lack of geographical diversification and/or limited alternative funding sources, the market continues to force most banks to carry capital positions considerably in excess of regulatory minimums under Basel I. For these reasons, U.S. supervisors do not believe the benefits would exceed the costs of requiring most banks to shift to Basel II. However, for the small number of large, complex, internationally active banking organizations, Basel I has serious shortcomings, which are becoming more evident with time. Developing a replacement to supply to these banking organizations is imperative.  First, Basel I is too simplistic to adequately address the activities of our most complex banking institutions. Basel I categorizes each bank's assets into one of only four categories, each of which represents a certain risk class. Each risk class has its own risk weight that is multiplied by 8 percent to get the minimum capital charge: zero for most sovereign debt, 20 percent of 8 percent for most intra-bank exposures and for agency securities, 50 percent of 8 percent for residential mortgages, and 100 percent of 8 percent for all other exposures. These "all other" credits include essentially all corporate and consumer loans, meaning that the whole spectrum of credit quality over which banks do much of their lending - from Aaa to the most speculative credits - receives the same regulatory capital charge. The lack of differentiation among the degrees of risk means that the resultant capital ratios are too often uninformative and might well provide misleading information for banks with risky or problem credits or, for that matter, with portfolios dominated by very safe loans.  
  Moreover, the limited number of risk classes not only limits the value of the capital requirement but also creates a regulatory loophole that creates incentives for banks to game the system by capital arbitrage. Capital arbitrage, in this case, is the avoidance of certain minimum capital charges through sale or securitization of those assets for which the capital requirement that the market would impose is less than the regulatory capital charge. Clearly, the market believes that the 4 percent capital charge on most residential mortgages (50 percent of 8 percent) and the 8 percent on most credit cards (100 percent of 8 percent) is higher than the real risk, facilitating the securitization and sale of a large volume of such loans to other holders. This behavior is perfectly understandable, even desirable in an economic efficiency sense. But it means that banks that engage in such arbitrage retain the higher-risk assets for which the regulatory capital charge - calibrated to average quality assets - is on average too low.  Supervisors, through the examination process, are, to be sure, still able to evaluate the true risk position of the bank, but the capital ratios of the larger banks are becoming less and less meaningful, a trend that will only accelerate. Not only are creditors, counterparties, and investors less able to evaluate the capital strength of individual banks from what are supposed to be risk-based capital ratios, but regulations and statutory requirements tied to capital ratios have less meaning as well.  The evolving state of the art At the same time, risk management and appropriate capital determination have evolved significantly beyond the state of the art at the time Basel I was developed. Banks themselves have developed and adopted some of the new techniques to improve their risk management and internal economic capital measures. But clearly banks can go considerably further. Basel II would speed adoption of these new techniques and promote the future evolution of risk management by establishing a framework that is more risk-sensitive.  Increased heterogeneity and concentration in banking Finally, market pressures have led to consolidation in banking around the world. Our own banking system has not been immune; it, too, has become increasingly concentrated with a small number of very large banks operating across a wide range of product and geographic markets. Their operations are tremendously complex and sophisticated, and their significantly different strategies add a high degree of heterogeneity to their operations. At the same time, significant weakness in one of these entities, let alone failure, has the potential for severely adverse macroeconomic consequences. It seems clear that the regulatory framework should encourage these banks to adopt the best possible risk measurement and management techniques while allowing for the considerable differences in their business strategies. Basel II presents an opportunity for supervisors to encourage these banks to push their management frontier forward. Of course, change is always difficult, and these new mechanisms are expensive. But a more risk-sensitive regulatory and capital system would provide stronger incentives to adopt best practice internal risk management.  Let me be clear. If we do not apply more risk-sensitive capital requirements to these very large institutions, the usefulness of capital adequacy regulation in constraining excessive risk-taking at these entities will continue to erode. Such an erosion would present U.S. bank supervisors with a highly undesirable choice. Either we would have to accept the increased risk of instability in the banking system, or we would be forced to adopt alternative - and more intrusive - approaches to the supervision and regulation of these institutions.  Basel II I want to stress that the U.S. supervisory authorities intend to apply only the so-called Advanced Internal Ratings Based (A-IRB) version of Basel II. We will not be adopting the two other variants of Basel II - the Standardized and Foundation Internal Ratings Based Approaches - that have been developed by the Basel Committee. We expect to require about ten large U.S. banks to adopt the A-IRB approach, but we anticipate that a small number of other large entities will choose to adopt it as well after making the necessary investment to support their participation.  All other banks in this country will remain on the current Basel I capital standard when the new Accord is implemented. For these thousands of banks, the shortfalls of the current rules, as noted, are not sufficiently large to warrant a mandatory shift to the Basel II regime. However, any of these institutions 
  will have the option to adopt the A-IRB requirement, as we expect some large entities to do at the outset. If they seek to do so, however, they will have to meet the same high standards of internal infrastructure and controls that will be required of the core group.  The Federal Reserve Board believes that the A-IRB approach of Basel II will address the material defects of Basel I for these entities. By requiring strong internal standards as an entry criterion, the Basel II approach will ensure that these banks adopt structured, formal, empirically based methods of managing credit risk, which will lead to significantly improved risk-management capabilities at the very largest banks and other adopters. Capital requirements themselves will become more risk sensitive and less prone to artificial distortions. The poor incentive structure of Basel I will be removed for A-IRB banks. Supervisory practices will also become more consistent with evolving risk-management practices. Risk-based capital ratios will become more reliable as an indicator of financial strength.  I turn now to another aspect of Basel II: its three pillars. At the outset of the Basel II process, the supervisors on the Basel Committee determined that a robust capital adequacy framework should include three important elements or pillars. Pillar I consists of the minimum capital requirements themselves - that is, the rules by which a bank calculates its capital ratio and by which its supervisor assesses whether it is in compliance with the minimum capital threshold. Pillar II, the supervisory oversight pillar, encompasses the concept that well-managed banks should seek to go beyond simple compliance with minimum standards and perform for themselves a comprehensive assessment of whether they have sufficient capital to support their risks. In addition, supervisors should be in a position to provide constructive feedback to bank management on these internal assessments, or "economic capital", based on their knowledge of industry practices at a range of institutions. Finally, Pillar III seeks to complement these activities with market discipline by requiring banks publicly to disclose key measures related to their risk and capital positions. The concept of these three mutually reinforcing pillars has been key to the Basel II effort.  Pillar I: Minimum regulatory capital requirements The minimum capital requirements for credit risk under the A-IRB approach are built around the same concepts that underlie all modern portfolio-based methods for systematically measuring credit risk. The first, and perhaps most important, input to this approach is an estimate of the likelihood or probability that a borrower will default. Second, lenders need a sense of the size of the loss in the event of a default because they are often able to recover something from a defaulted borrower's assets or from collateral or a guarantee. Third, the lender, who often has an undrawn credit line or loan commitment to a borrower, needs to estimate what the amount borrowed is likely to be at the time a default occurs. These key inputs - probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) - are the building blocks of the A-IRB approach to estimating capital requirements. Many banks are currently working to improve their ability to estimate these quantities, using a wide variety of techniques from expert judgment methodologies to quantitative statistical models.  A-IRB permits banks to use any or all of these, requiring only that the procedure for estimating these three key parameters be based on empirical information, that it be rigorous, that it be reproducible by third parties, that the process be subject to strong internal controls, and that the results be shown to measure risk accurately. The supervisor must, in fact, validate the estimation procedures and the controls that support them before a bank can use A-IRB. As part of the validation process, a bank must demonstrate that these risk measures are in fact used in credit-granting decisions, as well as for other management purposes such as reserving and pricing. The intention is for the supervisor and the manager to focus on the same issues.  These estimated risk variables are inputs to regulatory formulas that will determine the minimum required capital for a given portfolio of exposures. Just as the methods of determining the inputs can change as the state of the art changes, the formulas that translate the inputs into capital requirements can be modified as well by the regulators. Basel II can improve as knowledge improves.  The rules surrounding Pillar I are clearly more complicated than I have just described, and the volume of comment letters and the number of pages that have been and will be published for comment will attest to that. One reason for that complexity is that the large, complex banking organizations, to which the rules are addressed are, in a word, complex. Simple rules just cannot address their issues and the nature of their business. These rules have been adjusted and modified significantly as a result of comments from bankers and other interested parties. Sometimes those comments have led to simpler rules. But, more often, they have led to even more complex rules because each complex bank to which they apply operates somewhat differently from other banks. Thus the rules have been modified 
  to address important and meaningful differences in risk. Simple rules too often become straightjackets; flexibility requires more complex rules.  Pillar II: Supervisory oversight Indeed, because even complex rules cannot adequately capture the risks and desirable procedures for each bank, the A-IRB establishes with Pillar II a mechanism for dialogue on risk and capital between bank managers and bank supervisors. I have already noted that supervisors will verify the process for determining credit-risk measurement, for ensuring ongoing control over the process of determining these risk-measure inputs, and for ensuring that the risk inputs are used for more than calculation of regulatory capital. In addition, Pillar II requires that the bank maintain its own internal assessment of its risk relative to its capital - both currently and over the cycle as well as in periods of stress - and that the supervisor review and respond to that assessment. The focus is on ensuring that the bank has strong risk-assessment capabilities and that the supervisor and the bank jointly assess and evaluate that capability.  This kind of dialogue cannot be captured by any set of rules. It will focus on a frank discussion of loss potential and of any unusual capital needs associated with unbundled risks not captured in Pillar I. It addresses the individual bank's special risk profile, its special business strategy - which might, for example, imply geographic or borrower concentrations - or its unique cyclical sensitivities. Such discussion, review, and analysis are focused on the individual bank's possible unique need for a capital buffer - an amount in excess of its Pillar I minimum. Such buffers are designed to minimize the risk that losses and capital erosion could trigger undesired responses under prompt corrective action and the associated reactions that could affect financial and real macroeconomic stability.  Pillar II, we should be clear, has some drawbacks. It is inherently less transparent than Pillar I because outsiders will not know which portion of a bank's excess capital is deemed "necessary" to address a particular risk specific to the bank and which portion is truly an "extra" cushion. It is also more difficult - although not impossible - for supervisors to require an uncooperative bank to hold Pillar II capital than rule-imposed Pillar I capital.  Pillar III: Market disclosure Basel II seeks to minimize the public difficulty of interpreting capital ratios by requiring public disclosure of considerable quantitative and qualitative information, including, in effect, the risk inputs I described earlier. Such disclosures also provide incentives for banks - the disclosers - to adopt better risk-management techniques and to link their capital requirements to their risk profiles. All these results will enable the public to make comparisons among banks more easily. Indeed, the ability to compare will be an important constraint on any supervisor, foreign or U.S., who might not diligently apply the rules to its banks; outliers will appear unusual and, with insufficient explanation, be subject to market discipline.  Indeed, a key reason for Pillar III is to seek to harness market discipline to bring pressure on banks to adopt safe and sound practices. Public disclosure increases market discipline in two ways. First, by providing more information, it enables the market to impose differential funding costs and availability on banks, related to the risks they take; additional risk requires additional Pillar I capital, but the disclosure of that risk and the size of the capital buffer also affects the minimum price that counterparties require to provide funding. Second, as noted, it facilitates comparisons across banks. Because outliers will be subject to particularly close review by the market and other national regulators, banks and their regulators will have more difficulty evading their minimum capital requirements.  Key issues Not surprisingly with such a significant proposal, some are concerned about certain aspects of Basel II. It might be useful to the subcommittee if, in the remainder of my comments, I focus on a number of issues that have been raised. Before I do, however, I want to reiterate to the subcommittee that the process of developing the Basel II proposals has involved a truly unprecedented dialogue with banks on a wide variety of issues. That dialogue is still going on, especially with regard to technical issues involving retail credit, risk-mitigation techniques, securitization, and other matters, including some that should be called to your attention.  
  Operational risk One of the early decisions by the participants in the Basel II process was to focus more clearly on credit risk in the capital determination process. Doing so required that all the other risks that had been combined with credit risk in Basel I be unbundled. Several years ago, the first necessary step in the unbundling of these risks was taken when the market risk of trading activities was separated for its own treatment. The Basel II effort has focused very carefully on the credit risks that banks take and has sought to ensure that the framework appropriately measures the marginal contribution of such risks to a bank's total risk profile. But this focus implies the need to consider the way to address other important banking risks. Some of these risks are sufficiently modest that they can be addressed through the supervisory process - Pillar II. But one risk, operational risk, has been historically so important in the depletion of capital and the failure of banks that it should be subject to specific Pillar I minimum capital requirements.  Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events, and it includes legal and compliance-related risks. These risks and their associated losses are often in the news: rogue traders, fraud and forgery, settlement failures, inappropriate sales practices, poor accounting and lapses of control, troubles in acting as custodians and managing assets, and legal settlements involving significant payments for losses alleged to have been caused by banks. All of these costs have been substantial both here and abroad.  Indeed, many banks, in their internal economic calculations, already allocate a significant portion of their capital for operational risk - averaging 17 percent in the subset of large banks we sampled. A couple of banks even make the amount public, and increasingly the market is sensitive to the fact that not all excess regulatory capital is held just as a general buffer, that is, that excess regulatory capital is not necessarily excess economic capital. But the public is unable in most cases to differentiate the excess regulatory capital held for specific purposes from that held for general purposes. This inability is a particular problem under Basel I for those entities with modest credit risk and dominant operating risk. Under Basel I, the regulatory capital is driven solely by credit risk, and therefore the requirement tends to be too low for activities that do not entail much credit risk but do expose the bank to operational risk. The A-IRB banks under Basel II that specialize in such activities - for example, processing securities and payments and acting as custodians - will experience increases in their regulatory capital requirements on those activities. Every day these entities transfer very large amounts of federal funds, act as custodians for massive quantities of securities, and dominate payments and securities transfer systems. Disruptions in their operations can cause, and have caused, serious difficulties in world financial markets.  U.S. supervisors will propose that those banks that are required, or that choose, to adopt the A-IRB approach to Basel II will also be required to hold capital for operational risk, using a procedure to develop the size of that charge known as the advanced measurement approach (AMA). Because of earlier comments by U.S. bankers, the amount of required operational risk capital will not be subject to a minimum floor nor will the charge be based on revenue. Rather, under the AMA, A-IRB banks themselves will have the primary responsibility for assessing their own operational risk capital requirement. This requirement will be a Pillar I charge and will be disclosed to market participants under Pillar III. The banks that remain under Basel I will not be subject to an operational risk capital charge in the United States.  The advanced measurement approach gives banks the flexibility to develop their own methodology for calculating the operational, or "op", risk capital charge. The supervisor, to be sure, will require that the procedure be comprehensive, systematic, and consistent with certain broad guidelines. These guidelines specify such factors as the necessity for independent risk management, board and senior management oversight, audits, the use of historical internal and external loss data, scenario analysis, and so forth. The supervisor must review and validate each bank's process, but again considerable flexibility exists for individual bank application. The op risk capital charge is expected to reflect banks' own environment and control mechanisms and can be reduced by insurance and other risk mitigants. For example, if a bank invests in improved contingency procedures and approaches, we would expect such an investment to be reflected in a reduction in the need for operational risk capital under the AMA.  Several U.S. banks that are developing an op risk capital requirement under the advanced measurement approach have told us that they are very comfortable with the results so far. Importantly, they say that the procedures have allowed them to better identify business activities and practices that pose operational risks and that they have taken steps to minimize the risks. That result is critical to 
  supervisors who believe that the AMA methodology will produce a lasting discipline for banks, encouraging them to think carefully about and minimize the risks associated with their business activities. Supervisors expect the advanced measurement approach to provide the incentives to invest in new systems and practices that will reduce the potential for serious losses from operational risk.  Operational risk and the AMA are issues that I call to the subcommittee's attention because I am aware of a very few banks that aggressively oppose this aspect of Basel II. Accordingly, I have held a number of discussions with bankers on this subject over the last year, including many direct conversations with the senior bankers who have expressed the most concern about the issue. As I indicated earlier, I believe this sort of dialogue has been essential to the appropriate development of the Basel II framework and is something that we will continue to emphasize. But as a bank supervisor and as a central banker, I have to say that we have not found the arguments of the operational risk skeptics to be convincing.  The skeptics argue that the cost of developing and using the advanced measurement approach and the associated capital charges divert resources away from actual investment in risk-reducing systems and better backup systems. As I will discuss more fully, Basel II, without doubt, is costly; but the final judgment for any expenditure must rest on the balance between costs and benefits. We and, as noted, many banks believe that the AMA is critical for the kind of formal analysis that focuses banks' attentions on the operational risks they face. We are also convinced that the explicit Pillar I capital charge creates incentives for them to reduce these risks while ensuring that minimum capital is allocated to absorb the remaining risk.  Critics also argue that an explicit Pillar I capital charge would upset the competitive balance with nonbank and foreign bank competitors. Foreign regulators, it is argued, will be less aggressive in their rule enforcement than U.S. regulators. As I earlier suggested, Pillar III - disclosure - will highlight any significant differences across banks, in the expectation that counterparties will penalize inconsistent risk measures. In addition, the Basel Supervisors Committee has set up an implementation group of senior supervisors to coordinate the application of the rules across countries.  As for nonbanks, the argument ignores the significant edge banks will continue to have from access to the discount window and the Federal Reserve's payments system. This competitive edge attracts customers and lowers funding costs relative to nonbanks. In addition, most of the banks that have expressed concern about the operational risk capital charge are already carrying large excess regulatory capital positions, supplementing their quite small current regulatory capital. Indeed, we do not believe that these entities would have to raise any new capital to meet the proposed op risk charges, but rather would simply shift excess to required capital. "Excess" regulatory capital may be reduced for some banks under Basel II, but we believe that such reductions because of op risk are perfectly consistent with making capital requirements both more risk sensitive and more transparent, not to mention more accurate.  The effort not to raise regulatory capital requirements is underlined by the critics' preference that op risk capital needs be addressed in Pillar II - that is, it should be part of the undisclosed capital buffer developed as part of the supervisory oversight of banks on a case-by-case basis. We again disagree. Excess regulatory capital would appear larger than it should, and the transparency of the proposed procedure would be lost. Inevitably, such an approach would treat banks with similar risks differently. Supervisors would also have less leverage over a bank's capital allocation for op risk and third parties would have more difficulty comparing capital among banks than they would under a Pillar I rule.  In short, we have not been convinced by the arguments we have heard, and we still believe that op risk is every bit as real a risk as credit risk and should be treated in the same way - with an explicit Pillar I capital charge.  Commercial real estate Some banks - mostly those that would not be subject to the A-IRB capital requirements unless they chose to become so - oppose the higher capital charges that A-IRB banks would generally face on their commercial real estate loans. These banks argue that bank lenders have learned from the losses of the 1980s and early 1990s and now do much better underwriting by insisting on more borrower equity and better appraisal procedures for commercial real estate. These improvements, critics argue, have reduced default rates and losses and, if anything, argue for lower, not higher, capital requirements or at least the same capital charge that is applied to business loans under A-IRB.  
  Setting aside that the system has not been tested by a true real estate cycle since the early1990s, the supervisors agree that commercial real estate underwriting has significantly improved. These improvements have been incorporated into the empirical analysis that our staff has used in developing the Basel II proposals. In the view of the Federal Reserve, however, capital requirements should be based on more than just the chance that an individual loan will default: They should also be based on the tendency of defaults to occur at the same time, in "clumps" - what economists refer to as high asset correlation. Defaults and losses occurring in clumps require higher capital than such losses spread out over time. According to our analysis, this clumping tendency is much stronger for commercial real estate credits than for business loans. Moreover, though improvements in underwriting have made individual loans safer, the asset correlations among such loans in a given portfolio - the "clumping" tendency - has not changed as a result of improved underwriting.  The staff of the Federal Reserve has discussed this issue with bankers and has shown them an analysis - based on several data sets and using different methodologies - requesting their evidence of any errors or new data sets that challenge the staff's conclusion. The Federal Reserve is in the process of making this analysis widely available and is again asking for critical evaluation and any contradictory information. We are, in short, willing to listen. If banks can provide evidence that this proposal embodies erroneous assumptions or is otherwise analytically faulty, we will change it.  Cost. Implementing A-IRB in this country is going to be expensive for the small number of banks for which it will be required, for those banks choosing it, and for the supervisors. For the banks, the greatest expense is in establishing the mechanisms necessary for a bank to evaluate and control their risk exposures more formally. Nonetheless, such costs are modest relative to the size of recent charge-offs. The A-IRB approach will not eliminate losses: Banks are in the business of taking risk and where there are risks, there will be losses. But we believe that the better risk-management that is required for the A-IRB will reduce losses and provide benefits to bank stakeholders and the economy. The cost-benefit ratio looks right.  Furthermore, attributing all the costs associated with adopting modern, formal risk-management systems to Basel II is a logical fallacy. The large banks required to adopt A-IRB - banks that must compete for funding in a global marketplace - would ultimately have to undertake such measures with or without Basel II. Basel II may well speed up the adoption process, but many of the costs attributed to Basel II actually just reflect the costs of doing business in an increasingly complex financial environment.  Competitive equity Some regional banks have told us that they are concerned that regional, and perhaps smaller, banks will be competitively disadvantaged by Basel II, even if they are not required to adopt A-IRB. Their concern has two parts.  First, some regional banks feel that market pressure and the rating agencies will force them to adopt A-IRB and, as a result, to incur significant costs. Our discussions with rating agencies do not support the regional banks' fears. Indeed, our sense is that the rating agencies feel that adoption of A-IRB by regional banks at this time would not be cost effective. In our opinion, any regional bank interested in adopting the A-IRB approach at its inception should carefully assess the costs and benefits of doing so.  That said, we expect the art and science and, indeed, the very language, of risk management to migrate toward that used for A-IRB. Over the years ahead, as the new risk-management techniques become more cost effective for them, regional banks, we suspect, will adopt these techniques and, thereafter, probably adopt the A-IRB at the regulatory level. But adopting them now would be premature, and we believe that regional banks will not be pressured to do so by either the rating agencies or the regulators.  The second part of the competitive equity concern is the belief by some regional and community banks that they will be placed at a competitive disadvantage with A-IRB banks because of the larger banks' lower regulatory capital charges on residential mortgages, loans to smaller businesses, and certain retail loans.  The direct competitive impact on Basel II and Basel I banks is important. Of course, the rulemaking process in the United States will probe the issue fully. However, a number of factors suggest that the concern about competitive impact is not well founded.  
  In terms of overall capital, A-IRB banks will likely face lower capital charges for some types of lending, but they will also face higher charges on other loan categories, such as commercial real estate finance and higher costs of developing the risk-management infrastructure to be an A-IRB bank. They will also be subject to an explicit capital charge for operational risk and the cyclical buffer in Pillar II that will not be imposed on non-IRB banks.  In the individual loan markets for which Basel II lowers A-IRB capital charges, we also have reason to believe that competitive balance will not be disrupted. In the business loan market, for example, the smallest banks do not directly compete with the banks that will be required to adopt A-IRB. Small banks' close ties to local communities afford them substantial information advantages over larger banks. As a result, they tend to focus on relationship lending to small businesses and individuals. A-IRB banks, in contrast, tend to make such retail loans by using automated underwriting tools. Larger regional banks are more likely to compete directly with A-IRB banks, but for two good reasons we believe that Basel II will not affect these banks significantly.  First, today not regulatory capital but economic capital - the individual bank's management judgment about internal capital allocations for its own decisionmaking - drives loan pricing and origination decisions. Nothing in Basel II will change for the capital charges implied by economic capital. Moreover, for some years, as I discussed earlier, when there has been a difference between regulatory and economic capital, sophisticated banks have used capital arbitrage techniques to reduce their effective regulatory minimums. Asset securitization deals, in particular, have allowed banks to dramatically reduce the amount of capital they currently hold for residential mortgages and many retail loans. Regulatory capital arbitrage - market reality - thus has already reduced the effective capital charge for the loans for which A-IRB banks will receive lower on-balance capital charges. Basel II increases transparency by bringing regulatory minimums more in line with reality, but it will not change the status quo competitive environment very much, if at all. In short, Basel II will bring A-IRB banks' regulatory capital charges more in line with the capital charges they have, through arbitrage, already obtained.  The second reason minimum regulatory capital requirements are unlikely to significantly affect competitive behavior is that most well managed banks carry sizable excess capital buffers. Smaller banks in particular, operating with less leverage than larger banks, hold substantial excess regulatory capital, which reflects their lack of diversification and more limited access to funding. Basel II will not change that fact. Under Basel II, small banks will continue to hold more capital than A-IRB banks, but A-IRB banks' true risk-based capital positions will be measured more accurately.  Conclusion The Basel II effort reflects the collective judgment of the supervisors of the world's largest and most complex banking organizations, including those of the United States, that the activities and practices of such firms have been outgrowing our existing supervisory approaches. At the same time, the role of these banks in our financial systems continues to grow. In my judgment, we have no alternative but to adopt, as soon as practical, approaches that are appropriately suited to the task of bank supervision of our larger banks in the twenty-first century.  The Basel II framework is the product of extensive multiyear dialogues with the banking industry regarding state-of-the-art risk-management practices in every significant area of banking activity. Accordingly, it provides a roadmap for the improved regulation and supervision of global banking. Basel II will provide strong incentives for banks to continue improving their internal risk-management capabilities as well as the tools for supervisors to focus on emerging problems and issues more rapidly than ever before.  I am pleased to appear before you today to report on this effort as it nears completion. Open discussion of complex issues has been at the heart of the Basel II development process from the outset and no doubt will continue to characterize it as Basel II evolves further.  
BIS Review 10/2003 1 Alan Greenspan: Deposit insurance  Testimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C., 26 February 2003.  *      *      * Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and members of the Committee, it is a pleasure to appear once again before this Committee to present the views of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on deposit insurance. Rather than refer to any specific bill, I will express the broad views of the Federal Reserve Board on the issues associated with modifications of deposit insurance. Those views have not changed since our testimony before this Committee on April 23, 2002.  At the outset, I note that the 2001 report of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) on deposit insurance highlighted the significant issues and developed an integrated framework for addressing them. Although as before the Board opposes any increase in coverage, we continue to support the framework constructed by the FDIC report for addressing other reform issues.  Benefits and costs of deposit insurance Deposit insurance was adopted in this country as part of the legislative effort to limit the impact of the Great Depression on the public. Against the backdrop of a record number of bank failures, the Congress designed deposit insurance mainly to protect the modest savings of unsophisticated depositors with limited financial assets. With references being made to "the rent money," the initial 1934 limit on deposit insurance was $2,500; the Congress promptly doubled the limit to $5,000 but then kept it at that level for the next sixteen years. I should note that the $5,000 of insurance provided in 1934, an amount consistent with the original intent of the Congress, is equal to slightly less than $60,000 today, based on the personal consumption expenditures deflator in the gross domestic product accounts.  Despite its initial quite limited intent, the Congress has raised the maximum amount of coverage five times since 1950, to its current level of $100,000. The last increase, in 1980, more than doubled the limit and was clearly designed to let depositories, particularly thrift institutions, offer an insured deposit free of the then-prevailing interest rate ceilings on such instruments, which applied only to deposits below $100,000. Insured deposits of exactly $100,000 thus became fully insured instruments in 1980 but were not subject to an interest rate ceiling. The efforts of thrift institutions to use $100,000 CDs to stem their liquidity outflows resulting from public withdrawals of smaller, below-market-rate insured deposits led first to an earnings squeeze and an associated loss of capital and then to a high-risk investment strategy that led to failure after failure. Depositors acquiring the new larger-denomination insured deposits were aware of the plight of the thrift institutions but unconcerned about the risk because the principal amounts of their $100,000 deposits were fully insured by the federal government. In this way, the 1980 increase in deposit insurance to $100,000 exacerbated the fundamental problem facing thrift institutions - a concentration on long-term assets in an environment of high and rising interest rates. Indeed, it significantly increased the taxpayer cost of the bailout of the bankrupt thrift institution deposit insurance fund.  Despite this problematic episode, deposit insurance has clearly played a key - at times even critical - role in achieving the stability in banking and financial markets that has characterized the nearly seventy years since its adoption. Deposit insurance, combined with other components of our banking safety net (the Federal Reserve's discount window and its payment system guarantees), has meant that periods of financial stress no longer entail widespread depositor runs on banks and thrift institutions. Quite the opposite: Asset holders now seek out deposits - both insured and uninsured - as safe havens when they have strong doubts about other financial assets.  Looking beyond the contribution of deposit insurance to overall financial stability, we should not minimize the importance of the security it has brought to millions of households and small businesses with relatively modest financial assets. Deposit insurance has given them a safe and secure place to hold their transaction and other balances.  
The benefits of deposit insurance, as significant as they are, have not come without a cost. The very process that has ended deposit runs has made insured depositors largely indifferent to the risks taken by their depository institutions, just as it did with depositors in the 1980s with regard to insolvent, risky thrift institutions. The result has been a weakening of the market discipline that insured depositors would otherwise have imposed on institutions. Relieved of that discipline, depositories naturally feel less cautious about taking on more risk than they would otherwise assume. No other type of private financial institution is able to attract funds from the public without regard to the risks it takes with its creditors' resources. This incentive to take excessive risks at the expense of the insurer, and potentially the taxpayer, is the so-called moral hazard problem of deposit insurance.  Thus, two offsetting implications of deposit insurance must be kept in mind. On the one hand, it is clear that deposit insurance has contributed to the prevention of bank runs that could have destabilized the financial structure in the short run. On the other, even the current levels of deposit insurance may have already increased risk-taking at insured depository institutions to such an extent that future systemic risks have arguably risen.  Indeed, the reduced market discipline and increased moral hazard at depositories have intensified the need for government supervision to protect the interests of taxpayers and, in essence, substitute for the reduced market discipline. Deposit insurance and other components of the safety net also enable banks and thrift institutions to attract more resources, at lower costs, than would otherwise be the case. In short, insured institutions receive a subsidy in the form of a government guarantee that allows them both to attract deposits at lower interest rates than would be necessary without deposit insurance and to take more risk without the fear of losing their deposit funding. Put another way, deposit insurance misallocates resources by breaking the link between risks and rewards for a select set of market competitors.  In sum, from the very beginning, deposit insurance has involved a tradeoff. Deposit insurance contributes to overall short-term financial stability and the protection of small depositors. But at the same time, because it also subsidizes deposit growth and induces greater risk-taking, deposit insurance misallocates resources and creates larger long-term financial imbalances that increase the need for government supervision to protect the taxpayers' interests. Deposit insurance reforms must balance these tradeoffs. Moreover, any reforms should be aimed primarily at protecting the interest of the economy overall and not just the profits or market shares of particular businesses.  The Federal Reserve Board believes that deposit insurance reforms should be designed to preserve the benefits of heightened financial stability and the protection of small depositors without a further increase in moral hazard or reduction in market discipline. In addition, we urge that the implementing details be kept as straightforward as possible to minimize the risk of unintended consequences that comes with complexity.  Issues for reform The FDIC has made five broad recommendations.  1.  Merge BIF and SAIF The Board supports the FDIC's proposal to merge the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) with the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). Because the charters and operations of banks and thrift institutions have become so similar, it makes no sense to continue the separate funds. Separate funds reflect the past but neither the present nor the future. Merging the funds would diversify their risks, reduce administrative expense, and widen the fund base of an increasingly concentrated banking system. Most important, because banks and thrift institutions receive the same level of federally guaranteed insurance coverage, the premiums faced by each set of institutions should be identical as well. Under current arrangements, the premiums faced by equally risky institutions could differ significantly if one of the funds falls below the designated reserve ratio of 1.25 percent of insured deposits and the other fund does not. Should that occur, depository institutions would be induced to switch charters to obtain insurance from the fund with the lower premium, a result that could distort our depository structure. The federal government should not sell a single service, like deposit insurance, at different prices.  
2. Reduce statutory restrictions on premiums Current law requires the FDIC to impose higher premiums on riskier banks and thrift institutions but prevents it from imposing any premium on well-capitalized and highly rated institutions when the corresponding fund's reserves exceed 1.25 percent of insured deposits. The Board endorses the FDIC recommendations that would eliminate the statutory restrictions on risk-based pricing and allow a premium to be imposed on every insured depository institution, no matter how well capitalized and well rated it may be or how high the fund's reserves.  The current statutory requirement that free deposit insurance be provided to well-capitalized and highly rated institutions when the ratio of FDIC reserves to insured deposits exceeds a predetermined ratio maximizes the subsidy provided to these institutions and is inconsistent with efforts to avoid inducing moral hazard. Put differently, the current rule requires the government to give away its valuable guarantee to many institutions when fund reserves meet some ceiling level. This free guarantee is of value to institutions even when they themselves are in sound financial condition and when macroeconomic times are good. At the end of the third quarter of last year, 91 percent of banks and thrift institutions were paying no premium. That group included many institutions that have never paid a premium for their, in some cases substantial, coverage, and it also included fast-growing entities whose past premiums were extraordinarily small relative to their current coverage. We believe that these anomalies were never intended by the framers of the Deposit Insurance Fund Act of 1996 and should be addressed by the Congress.  The Congress did intend that the FDIC impose risk-based premiums, but the 1996 act limits the ability of the FDIC to impose risk-based premiums on well-capitalized and highly rated banks and thrift institutions. And these two variables - capital strength and overall examiner rating - do not capture all the risk that institutions could create for the insurer. The Board believes that the FDIC should be free to establish risk categories on the basis of any economic variables shown to be related to an institution's risk of failure, and to impose premiums commensurate with that risk. Although a robust risk-based premium system would be technically difficult to design, a closer link between insurance premiums and the risk of individual institutions would reduce moral hazard and the distortions in resource allocation that accompany deposit insurance.  We note, however, that although significant benefits from a risk-based premium system are likely to require a substantial range of premiums, the FDIC concluded in its report that premiums for the riskiest banks would probably need to be capped in order to avoid inducing failure at these weaker institutions. We believe that capping premiums may end up costing the insurance fund more in the long run should these weak institutions fail anyway, with the delay increasing the ultimate cost of resolution. The Board has concluded, therefore, that if a cap on premiums is required, it should be set quite high so that risk-based premiums can be as effective as possible in deterring excessive risk-taking. In that way, we could begin to simulate the deposit insurance pricing that the market would apply and reduce the associated subsidy in deposit insurance.  Nonetheless, we should not delude ourselves into believing that even a wider range in the risk-based premium structure would eliminate the need for a government back-up to the deposit insurance fund, that is, eliminate the government subsidy in deposit insurance. To eliminate the subsidy in deposit insurance - to make deposit insurance a real insurance system - the FDIC average insurance premium would have to be set high enough to cover fully the very small probabilities of very large losses, such as those incurred during the Great Depression, and thus the perceived costs of systemic risk. In contrast to life or automobile casualty insurance, each individual insured loss in banking is not independent of other losses. Banking is subject to systemic risk and is thus subject to a far larger extreme loss in the tail of the probability distributions from which real insurance premiums would have to be calculated. Indeed, pricing deposit insurance risks to fully fund potential losses - pricing to eliminate subsidies - could well require premiums that would discourage most depository institutions from offering broad coverage to their customers. Since the Congress has determined that there should be broad coverage, the subsidy in deposit insurance cannot be fully eliminated, although we can and should eliminate as much of the subsidy as we can.  I note that the difficulties of raising risk-based premiums explain why there is no real private-insurer substitute for deposit insurance from the government. No private insurer would ever be able to match the actual FDIC premium and cover its risks. A private insurer confronted with the possibility, remote as it may be, of losses that could bankrupt it would need to set especially high premiums to protect itself, premiums that few, if any, depository institutions would find attractive. And if premiums were fully priced by the government or the private sector, the depository institutions would likely lower their 
offering rates, thereby reducing the amount of insured deposits demanded, and consequently the amount outstanding would decline.  3.  Relaxing the reserve ratio regime to allow gradual adjustments in premiums Current law establishes a designated reserve ratio for BIF and SAIF of 1.25 percent. If that ratio is exceeded, the statute requires that premiums be discontinued for well-capitalized and highly rated institutions. If the ratio declines below 1.25 percent, the FDIC must develop a set of premiums to restore the reserve ratio to 1.25 percent; if the fund ratio is not likely to be restored to its statutorily designated level within twelve months, the law requires that a premium of at least 23 basis points be imposed on all insured entities.  These requirements are clearly procyclical: They lower or eliminate fees in good times, when bank credit is readily available and deposit insurance fund reserves should be built up, and abruptly increase fees sharply in times of weakness, when bank credit availability is under pressure and deposit fund resources are drawn down to cover the resolution of failed institutions. The FDIC recommends that surcharges or rebates be used to bring the fund back to the target reserve ratio gradually. The FDIC also recommends the possibility of a target range for the designated reserve ratio, over which the premiums may remain constant, rather than a fixed target reserve ratio and abruptly changing premiums.  We support such increased flexibility and smoothing of changes in premiums. Indeed, we recommend that the FDIC's suggested target reserve range be widened to reduce the need to change premiums abruptly. Any floor or ceiling, regardless of its level, could require that premiums be increased at exactly the time when banks and thrifts could be under stress and, similarly, that premiums be reduced at the time that depositories are in the best position to fund an increase in reserves. Building a larger fund in good times and permitting it to decline when necessary are prerequisites to less variability in the premium.  In addition to supporting a widening of the range for the designated reserve ratio, the Board recommends that the FDIC be given the latitude to temporarily relax floor or ceiling ratios on the basis of current and anticipated banking conditions and expected needs for resources to resolve failing institutions. In short, to enhance macroeconomic stability, we prefer a reduction in the specificity of the rules under which the FDIC operates and, within the broad guidelines set out by the Congress, an increase in the flexibility with which the board of the FDIC can operate.  4. Modify the rebates system Since its early days, the FDIC has rebated "excess" premiums whenever it considered its reserves to be adequate. This procedure was replaced in the 1996 law by the requirement that no premium be imposed on well-capitalized and highly rated institutions when the relevant fund reached its designated reserve ratio. The FDIC's 2001 proposals would re-impose a minimum premium on all banks and thrift institutions and a more risk-sensitive premium structure. These provisions would be coupled with rebates for the stronger entities when the fund approaches the upper end of a target range and surcharges when the fund trends below the lower end of a target range.  The FDIC also recommends that the rebates not be uniform for the stronger entities. Rather, the FDIC argues that rebates should be smaller for those banks that have paid premiums for only short periods or that have in the past paid premiums that are not commensurate with their present size and consequent FDIC exposure. The devil, of course, is in the details. But varying the rebates in this way makes considerable sense, and the Board endorses it. More than 900 banks - some now quite large - have never paid a premium, and without this modification they would continue to pay virtually nothing, net of rebates, as long as their strong capital and high supervisory ratings were maintained. Such an approach is both competitively inequitable and contributes to moral hazard. It should be addressed.  5. Indexing ceilings on the coverage of insured deposits The FDIC recommends that the current $100,000 ceiling on insured deposits be indexed to inflation. The Board does not support this recommendation and believes that the current ceiling should be maintained.  In the Board's judgment, increasing the coverage, even by indexing, is unlikely to add measurably to the stability of the banking system. Macroeconomic policy and other elements of the safety net - 
combined with the current, still-significant level of deposit insurance - continue to be important bulwarks against bank runs. Thus, the problem that increased coverage is designed to solve must be related either to the individual depositor, the party originally intended to be protected, or to the individual bank or thrift institution. Clearly, both groups would prefer higher coverage if it cost them nothing. But the Congress needs to be clear about the nature of a specific problem for which increased coverage would be the solution.  Depositors. Our most recent surveys of consumer finances suggest that most depositors have balances well below the current insurance limit of $100,000, and those that do have larger balances have apparently been adept at achieving the level of deposit insurance coverage they desire by opening multiple insured accounts. Such spreading of assets is perfectly consistent with the counsel always given to investors to diversify their assets - whether stocks, bonds, or mutual funds - across different issuers. The cost of diversifying for insured deposits is surely no greater than doing so for other assets. A bank would clearly prefer that the depositor maintain all of his or her funds at that bank and would prefer to reduce the need for depositor diversification by being able to offer higher deposit insurance coverage. Nonetheless, depositors appear to have no great difficulty - should they want insured deposits - in finding multiple sources of fully insured accounts.  In addition, one of the most remarkable characteristics of household holdings of financial assets has been the increase in the diversity of portfolio choices since World War II. And, since the early 1970s the share of household financial assets in bank and thrift deposits has generally declined steadily as households have taken advantage of innovative, attractive financial instruments with market rates of return. The trend seems to bear no relation to past increases in insurance ceilings. Indeed, the most dramatic substitution out of deposits has been the shift from both insured and uninsured deposits into equities and into mutual funds that hold equities, bonds, and money market assets. It is difficult to believe that a change in ceilings during the 1990s would have made any measurable difference in that shift. Rather, the data indicate that the weakness in stock prices in recent years has been marked by increased flows into bank and thrift deposits even without changed insurance coverage levels.  Depository Institutions. Does the problem to be solved by increased deposit insurance coverage concern the individual depository institution? If so, the problem would seem disproportionately related to small banks because insured deposits are a much larger proportion of total funding at small banks than at large banks. But smaller banks appear to be doing well. Since the mid-1990s, adjusted for the effects of mergers, assets of banks smaller than the largest 1,000 have grown at an average annual rate of 13.8 percent, more than twice the pace of the largest 1,000 banks. Uninsured deposits, again adjusted for the effects of mergers, have grown at average annual rates of 21 percent at the small banks versus 10 percent at the large banks. Clearly, small banks have a demonstrated skill and ability to compete for uninsured deposits. To be sure, uninsured deposits are more expensive than insured deposits, and bank costs would decline and profits rise if their currently uninsured liabilities received a government guarantee. But that is the issue of whether subsidizing bank profits through additional deposit insurance serves a national purpose. I might add that throughout the 1990s and into the present century, return on equity at small banks has been well maintained. Indeed, the attractiveness of banking is evidenced by the fact that more than 1,350 banks were chartered during the past decade, including more than 600 from 1999 through 2002.  Some small banks argue that they need enhanced deposit insurance coverage to compete with large banks because depositors prefer to put their uninsured funds in an institution considered too big to fail. As I have noted, however, small banks have more than held their own in the market for uninsured deposits. In addition, the Board rejects the notion that any bank is too big to fail. In the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), the Congress made it clear that the systemic-risk exception to the FDIC's least-cost resolution of a failing bank should be invoked only under the most unusual circumstances. Moreover, the resolution rules under the systemic-risk exception do not require that uninsured depositors and other creditors, much less stockholders, be made whole. The market has clearly evidenced the view, consistent with FDICIA, that large institutions are not too big for uninsured creditors to take at least some loss should the institution fail. For example, no U.S. banking organization, no matter how large, is AAA-rated. In addition, research indicates that creditors impose higher risk premiums on the uninsured debt of relatively risky large banking organizations and that this market discipline has increased since the enactment of FDICIA.  To be sure, the real purchasing power of deposit insurance ceilings has declined. But there is no evidence of any significant detrimental effect on depositors or depository institutions, with the possible exception of a small reduction in those profits that accrue from deposit guarantee subsidies that lower the cost of insured deposits. The current deposit insurance ceiling appears more than adequate to 
achieve the positive benefits of deposit insurance that I mentioned earlier, even if its real value were to erode further.  Another argument is often raised by smaller banks regarding the need for increased deposit insurance coverage. Some smaller institutions say that they are unable to match the competition from large securities firms and bank holding companies with multiple bank or thrift institution affiliates because those entities offer multiple insured accounts through one organization. I note that since the Committee's last hearings on this issue, the force of small banks' concerns has been reduced by recent market developments in which small banks and thrift institutions can use a clearinghouse network for brokered deposits that allows them to offer full FDIC insurance for large accounts. The Board agrees that such practices by both large and small depositories are a misuse of deposit insurance. Moreover, raising the coverage limit for each account is not a remedy for small banks because it would also increase the aggregate amount of insurance coverage that multidepository organizations would be able to offer. The disparity would remain.  Conclusion Several aspects of the deposit insurance system need reform. The Board supports, with some modifications, all of the recommendations the FDIC made in the spring of 2001 except indexing the current $100,000 ceiling to inflation. The thrust of our recommendations would call for a wider permissible range for the size of the fund relative to insured deposits, reduced variation of the insurance premium as the relative size of the fund changes with banking and economic conditions, a positive and more risk-based premium net of rebates for all depository institutions, and the merging of BIF and SAIF.  There may come a time when the Board finds that households and businesses with modest resources are having difficulty in placing their funds in safe vehicles or that the level of deposit coverage appears to be endangering financial stability. Should either of those events occur, the Board would call its concerns to the attention of the Congress and support adjustments to the ceiling by indexing or other methods. But today, in our judgment, neither financial stability, nor depositors, nor depositories are being disadvantaged by the current ceiling. Raising the ceiling now would extend the safety net, increase the government subsidy to depository institutions, expand moral hazard, and reduce the incentive for market discipline without providing any clear public benefit. With no clear public benefit to increasing deposit insurance, the Board sees no reason to increase the scope of the safety net. Indeed, the Board believes that as our financial system has become ever more complex and exceptionally responsive to the vagaries of economic change, structural distortions induced by government guarantees have risen. We have no way of ascertaining at exactly what point subsidies provoke systemic risk. Nonetheless, prudence suggests that we be exceptionally deliberate when expanding government financial guarantees.  
 BIS Review 29/2003 1 Toshiro Muto: Structural changes in the world economy and challenges facing Japan(cid:146)s economy Speech by Mr Toshiro Muto, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the JCIF International Finance Seminar, Tokyo, 17 June 2003. *      *      * I. Structural changes in the world economy A. Economic globalization and innovation in information technology (IT) Looking back, after the turn of the century, at the second half of the 20th century, we can assess it as an era marked by the lengthy Cold War after World War II. Before the close of the 20th century, however, the Cold War came to a dramatic end, with the collapse of the Berlin Wall in November 1989. Behind the change in the Cold War structure, the worldwide spread of the market economy worked as a driving force, as seen in the expansion of free markets in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The end of the Cold War further accelerated globalization of the market economy in the 1990s. Eastern Europe joined the world trade structure and has been playing an increasingly important role as a supply base especially in the euro area. In Asia, China, which had already introduced the market mechanism before the end of the Cold War, has become a giant supply base for developed countries including Japan. Exports from China currently account for approximately 15 percent of world exports after adjusting for purchasing power parity, a rise from around 5 percent in 1990. In the United States, imports from Latin America currently account for approximately 16 percent, an increase from around 11 percent in 1990. These facts vividly illustrate the trend of economic globalization driven by the chemistry of market mechanisms and changes in the international political system. B. Industrialization of emerging economies and development of IT-related industries Against the background of the economic globalization in the 1990s, emerging economies have industrialized rapidly and elevated their importance in the world economy. In the meantime, innovation in IT has also contributed to economic globalization, nurturing the IT-related industries that came to have great influence on the world economy. Since the IT-related industries have a multinational structure involving emerging economies, the growth in IT-related industries inevitably strengthened global economic linkages. Although these changes will help facilitate new economic structures in the long run, they sometimes engender negative aspects. The global inventory adjustments in IT-related areas that began around the end of 2000 are still fresh in our memories. In these developments, not only the United States but also Europe and Japan, as well as East Asian economies, experienced simultaneous stagnation due mainly to the decrease in exports, production, and investment in IT-related areas. C. Globalization of financial markets The expansion of the market economy and technological innovation have encouraged the development of financial markets in emerging economies, as well as realized new financial instruments such as derivatives. They have consequently strengthened global linkages of capital markets. The globalization of financial markets has facilitated the rapid industrialization of emerging economies by promoting capital inflows. On the other hand, financial crises in certain countries or areas could spread more easily than before to other countries, as seen in the Asian currency crisis in 1997, the Russian financial crisis, and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. Central banks in many countries, including the Bank of Japan, have cooperated in various forms of research on this issue recently. 
 2 BIS Review 29/2003 D. Worldwide disinflationary trend Structural changes in the world economy also affect the environment for prices. A worldwide disinflationary trend had become conspicuous in the 1990s, reflecting an increase in supply capacity worldwide due to the industrialization of emerging economies, technological innovation, and macroeconomic policies adopted in many countries to restrain inflation. Inflation rates in the G-7 countries averaged about 10 percent during the 1970s and about 5 percent during the 1980s. The simple average of the rates, however, declined to 2-3 percent after the start of the 1990s, and in the second half of the decade remained at 2-3 percent in the United States, United Kingdom, and Italy, and fell below 2 percent in the other G-7 countries. Japan has been experiencing gradual deflation, as consumer prices have ranged from -1 to zero percent year on year since the middle of 1998. In Europe and the United States, this disinflationary trend has brought real economic benefits, by securing a stable foundation for economic activity. The United States enjoyed a long-lasting economic expansion accompanied by price stability during the 1990s. The improvement in productivity reflecting technological innovation in IT-related industries has often been credited with this, particularly in discussion of the so-called (cid:147)new economy.(cid:148) In Europe, European Monetary Union was achieved since inflation rates in the countries joining the union declined to levels that satisfied the convergence criteria. On the other hand, central banks in many countries are becoming increasingly concerned with the risk of price declines, which have not occurred in the decades since the Great Depression. The background to this is that inflation rates, particularly those of major industrialized countries, have trended downward to nearly zero percent amid the disinflationary trend worldwide. Although it does have a positive effect on real economy, it has brought about the risk that inflation rates could turn negative if downward pressure on prices increases from either the demand or supply side. The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate gradually from 2001 in response to economic developments, and it has accordingly declined from 6.5 percent at the start of 2001 to 1.25 percent. The European Central Bank (ECB) also gradually reduced the main refinancing operations rate from 4.75 percent at the beginning of 2001 to 2.5 percent, followed by a further reduction to 2.0 percent on June 5, 2003. In line with such monetary policy developments, central banks overseas sometimes refer to the risks of price declines in their statements. The Federal Reserve, for example, commented that (cid:147)the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level(cid:148) in its public statement after the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on May 6, 2003. In addition, several central bank officials have commented on the manoeuvrability of monetary policy against the background of price declines. Conventional monetary easing calls for reducing short-term interest rates. However, there has been no definite answer yet, either theoretically or empirically, to the question of whether there remains scope for further stimulation of economic activity with monetary policy measures under the (cid:147)zero lower bound(cid:148) of short-term interest rates. For this reason, central banks overseas are paying greater attention to the conduct of monetary policy by the Bank of Japan, which has taken unprecedented quantitative easing measures since March 2001. II. Issues facing the Japanese economy A. The catch-up of emerging economies Bearing in mind the structural changes worldwide I have described, I would like to focus on the issues facing the Japanese economy. During the Cold War period, Japan achieved remarkable economic growth, driven mainly by the enhanced competitiveness of the manufacturing sector, to the extent that Japan became known as the (cid:147)factory of the world.(cid:148) However, many of the Japanese industries that brought about the economic growth in the postwar era are now facing competition from their counterparts in emerging economies that are rapidly catching up. The share of trading partners in Japanese exports and imports has changed substantially. In the past, the United States took the overwhelming majority of Japanese exports, and a fairly large proportion of imports were from oil producing countries. However, the share of imports from the Middle East, which was nearly 30 percent in the mid-1970s, has been declining, to about 10 percent recently. On the other hand, the share of trade (both exports and imports) with East Asian economies, which was 
 BIS Review 29/2003 3 around 25 percent in the mid-1980s, recently exceeded 40 percent. In particular, the share of imports from China in total Japanese imports expanded to 18 percent in 2002 from 5 percent in 1990. The share of imports from China has overtaken that from the United States, making China the largest importer for Japan. An examination of imports reveals that the character of Japan(cid:146)s trade structure - importing raw materials for manufacturing and exporting products - has changed. For instance, the share of raw materials in total imports from East Asian economies has declined to about 15 percent recently, from about 35 percent in 1990. In the meantime, that of machinery and textile goods has exceeded 50 percent recently, compared with around 25 percent in 1990. The degree of penetration of imported products in the domestic market illustrates a rise in the value added to imported products. In the 1990s, the growth in penetration of textile goods was conspicuous, but since 2000 it has leveled off at around 30 percent. The penetration of electrical and general machinery has increased to nearly 30 percent very recently, from 17-18 percent in 2000. These changes reflect progress in industrialization and the accumulation of technology in East Asian economies since 1990. They are also attributable to Japanese firms(cid:146) activities to transfer production sites overseas. At the same time, these changes make us consider what kinds of industries we should nurture and what types of economic value we can create as sources of Japan(cid:146)s future growth. B. The aging economy Japan is shifting from a growing economy to a mature one at an unprecedentedly fast pace. Since the second half of the 1980s, Japan(cid:146)s birthrate has been declining significantly and the aging of the population pyramid has accelerated. The nation(cid:146)s population is expected to decrease from 2006. Given these circumstances, the Japanese socioeconomic system, including the employment system, social security, local budget and tax systems, needs to be drastically reconstructed from one based on a growing economy to one suited to a mature economy. The reforms of the system comprising the economy and society of a nation inevitably entail conflicts of interest, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to resolve such conflicts through the benefits from economic expansion. Thus, it is a very difficult challenge indeed for Japan to implement reconstruction of its socioeconomic system in order to catch up with changes in economic and social environments, while achieving a national consensus. C. Emergence and bursting of the bubble economy Given the various changes I have mentioned, from the second half of the 1980s through the 1990s it was necessary for Japan to embark on nurturing new industries that could be the leading industries in the 21st century, as well as implementing fundamental changes in its socioeconomic system. However, during that period the bubble emerged and burst, and caused serious delay in such structural changes. Overheating of domestic demand and a sharp rise in asset prices due to the bubble allowed inefficient sectors to be preserved and permitted unprofitable investment businesses to expand. In the financial sector, a substantial rise in land prices caused an expansion of bank lending in a period when more emphasis should have been placed on financing through capital markets and securitization. Furthermore, the bursting of the bubble combined with characteristics of the financial system indigenous to Japan - a high proportion of bank lending - caused serious problems that restrained economic activity for a long time, such as the problems of nonperforming loans (NPLs) and firms(cid:146) debt overhang. Efficient reallocation of resources through structural adjustments should have been realized as a result of risk-taking activities of various economic entities to explore business frontiers. However, the financial strength of banks and firms and hence their risk-taking capacity were damaged significantly. Against this background, macroeconomic policies in the 1990s had to continuously deal with downward pressure on the economy stemming from the bursting of the bubble. D. Recent developments in the economy Now I would like to touch briefly on the recent developments in the economy. In the first half of 2002, Japan(cid:146)s economy recorded relatively high growth supported by an increase in exports that reflected global inventory restocking in IT-related goods. Since the second half of 2002, however, economic activity in Japan has been basically flat. Despite the fact that corporate profits have recovered 
 4 BIS Review 29/2003 reflecting the increase in exports and production, firms have not yet embarked on active investment due to uncertainty about the economic outlook. The employment and income situation of households remains severe, as firms have continued to reduce personnel costs. In this situation, private consumption, which constitutes a major part of aggregate demand, remains flat, although it is fairly firm relative to the level of income. With regard to the outlook, Japan(cid:146)s exports are expected to start increasing at a moderate pace, based on the assumption of a gradual recovery in overseas economies. However, the pace of the recovery in Europe and the United States is likely to be moderate. In addition, it seems likely that the growth in East Asian economies, which has been fairly rapid so far, has slowed at least for the time being due to the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We must continue careful monitoring of Japan(cid:146)s economy, taking into account the effects from the developments in overseas economies and Japan(cid:146)s financial system. III. Monetary policy of the Bank of Japan A. Conduct of monetary policy In order to place the economy back on a sustainable growth path and overcome deflation as soon as possible, the Bank has been implementing extraordinary monetary easing measures, which far exceed the category of (cid:147)conventional(cid:148) monetary policy. In March 2001, the Bank implemented the (cid:147)quantitative easing(cid:148) framework to increase further its liquidity provision to the money market in a situation where short-term interest rates had declined to virtually zero. The outstanding balance of current account deposits at the Bank expanded from 4 trillion yen at the time to close to 30 trillion yen at present. The Bank announced that it would continue the framework of the quantitative easing until the consumer price index (CPI) records a year-on-year increase of zero percent or more on a sustainable basis. The Bank also steadily increased its purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), and is currently purchasing a little less than 15 trillion yen worth of JGBs annually, which is roughly equivalent to half the total value of newly issued government bonds. The Bank also introduced the Lombard-type lending facility whereby financial institutions can borrow funds, within the eligible collateral pledged, from the Bank at the official discount rate that is now 0.1 percent. The Bank has widened the range of eligible collateral to asset-backed securities (ABSs) and many other new financial assets. As I mentioned earlier, several central bank officials overseas have commented recently on conceivable options of monetary easing under the (cid:147)zero lower bound(cid:148) of short-term interest rates. As possible measures to be taken solely by the central bank, they raised the increase of liquidity provision, the announcement to continue monetary easing into the future, the increase of the outright purchases of government securities, extending the central bank(cid:146)s discount windows to commercial banks with low interest rates, and widening the range of eligible collateral. The Bank has already implemented most of these unconventional measures in its quantitative easing framework. The effects of extraordinary easing measures by the Bank of Japan have been observed in financial markets. Even when there were various shocks due to problems in the domestic financial system, the terrorist attacks in the United States, and the military action against Iraq, a liquidity shortage did not materialize in the money market, and short-term interest rates have continued to be virtually zero, including longer-term rates such as those on term instruments. This situation is a marked contrast with that in 1997-98 when the failure of a few large financial institutions triggered concerns about the availability of liquidity at Japanese banks, and as a result, the so-called (cid:147)Japan premium(cid:148) expanded and a sharp credit contraction occurred in corporate financing. The Bank(cid:146)s policy commitment - that it will continue the current framework of monetary easing until the CPI records a year-on-year increase of zero percent or more on a sustainable basis - leads market participants to believe that short-term interest rates will continue to be zero at least until the actual inflation rate turns positive. As a result, risk premiums reflecting future fluctuations in interest rates have declined considerably, and the decline in interest rates has spread to even longer-term rates. The yields on five-year JGBs are in the range of 0.1 and 0.2 percent, those on ten-year JGBs have fallen below 0.5 percent, and those on 30-year JGBs are around 1 percent. Thus, the government is able to raise funds at almost zero or an extremely low cost. The cost for the private sector of raising funds has also declined. 
 BIS Review 29/2003 5 However, despite drastic monetary easing by the Bank, economic activity and price developments have not been influenced much so far. This is due to various factors. First, there was originally very little room for interest rates to decline further. As a consequence of the Bank(cid:146)s large-scale monetary easing since the bursting of the bubble, the overnight call rate was already below 0.5 percent in 1995, and long-term interest rates were already at around 1.5 percent at the time of the introduction of the quantitative easing framework. In this situation, the effects of various additional easing measures have remained marginal, especially when the economy has been under substantial adjustment pressures. The concern of many central banks about the risks of a price decline is based on a reflection of such uncertainty and limitation of the effectiveness of monetary easing under the (cid:147)zero lower bound(cid:148) of short-term interest rates. The second factor, as I mentioned earlier, is that the risk-taking capability of private entities, such as commercial banks and firms, has been greatly impaired. The transmission mechanism of monetary easing effects depends heavily on private entities(cid:146) risk-taking activity. In a normal situation, liquidity provision by a central bank to commercial banks encourages more lending because their liquidity constraints are eased. However, at present, the capital constraints arising mainly from the NPL problem, not liquidity constraints, bind commercial banks(cid:146) lending capacities. This is the major reason why bank lending has continued to decline and the growth in the money stock has been sluggish, although the monetary base has been expanding. Furthermore, whether the portfolio rebalancing effect - that is, the mechanism whereby a central bank(cid:146)s increase of liquidity provision still increases financial institutions(cid:146) investment in risk assets even after short-term interest rates reach the zero bound - occurs also depends on the extent to which financial institutions actively take risks. So far, they have been reluctant to take risks, and have mostly invested funds provided by the Bank in credit-risk-free assets such as cash, excess reserves, and government securities. As I have mentioned, the Bank is struggling under many constraints, not only the (cid:147)zero lower bound(cid:148) on interest rates which is a fundamental problem in monetary easing, but also the impaired risk-taking capability of the private sector, and malfunctioning of the transmission mechanism of monetary easing. This has been an issue not only in monetary policy but also in recent macroeconomic policy as a whole in Japan. Throughout the 1990s, I was in charge of executing fiscal policy. During the period, Japan has taken substantial measures both in monetary and fiscal fronts. However, given that fiscal policy is determined in the political situation at the time, and since the growth expectation has been declining and the private sector(cid:146)s risk-taking capability has been impaired, multiplier effects of public investment and tax cuts have also been constrained. As the central bank has been struggling with the problem of malfunctioning of the transmission mechanism, the fiscal authorities have also been struggling with the problem that fiscal expenditure has not led to vigorous spending by the private sector. B. Issues regarding further policy measures There are various debates outside the Bank about further policy options, and the Bank is always examining a wide range of imaginable options. I would like to raise some points that I think are important in discussing future policy conduct. First of all, we must bear in mind that Japan(cid:146)s efforts to overcome deflation ultimately aim at realizing the sound and continuous prosperity of its economy. With a growing number of countries shifting to a market-led economy and economic globalization advancing, it is essential to make full use of the private sector(cid:146)s initiatives and market mechanisms as well as maintain favorable relationships with other economies for Japan to continue enjoying economic prosperity in the future. If Japan took policy measures that distorted market mechanisms in the medium to long term, caused inefficiencies in the economy, or greatly impaired relationships overseas, the prospects for economic prosperity in the 21st century would be substantially narrowed. It is important that various policy options be consistent with the direction desired for the economy. Furthermore, in conducting economic policies, it is essential to maintain the capacities to respond to various shocks and uncertainties, which are often unpredictable because of imperfect knowledge, in order to secure economic stability. Once the confidence of the public and market participants in such capacities of economic policies is lost, this can cause serious instability in the economy and financial markets. Past experience tells us that public confidence in policy entities, once lost, is extremely difficult to restore in a short period of time. 
 6 BIS Review 29/2003 As an independent central bank, the Bank should bear in mind its accountability to the public for its policy measures. There have been the arguments outside the Bank that the Bank purchases risky assets that central banks normally do not purchase. In this respect, we must bear in mind that the central bank ultimately belongs to the people. If a central bank buys some assets, it virtually means that it uses the people(cid:146)s money to buy them. In the current situation where short-term interest rates have reached the zero bound and conventional monetary easing tools have been exhausted, the Bank must consider measures that go beyond the boundaries of traditional monetary policy and sometimes approach the realm of fiscal policy. However, it is vital for the Bank to evaluate policy options from the perspective of whether they are consistent with the Bank(cid:146)s accountability to the public and thus make a balanced judgment. This point becomes all the more serious as policy options could have greater influence on the distribution of income and risks in the private sector. C. Issues of inflation targeting I would like to briefly talk about issues of inflation targeting. Inflation targeting is a policy framework adopted in several countries in which a state of price stability, the goal of monetary policy, is expressed in terms of a desirable rate of inflation in numerical values. I think that the background of the argument regarding inflation targeting in Japan differs somewhat from the original thinking that I have described. The thinking that underlines the current argument advocating the adoption of inflation targeting in Japan seems to be as follows: real interest rates, which are derived by subtracting the inflation expectation rate from nominal interest rates, might be reduced if the inflation expectation rate increased, and declaration of a numerical target might contribute even when there is virtually no room for further reduction in nominal interest rates. Whether inflation targeting brings about its intended benefit, that is, to enhance the transparency of monetary policy and to stabilize people(cid:146)s expectation, largely depends on the following: how credible is the target? That is to say, to what extent are the tools and mechanism to achieve the target assured? As of now at least, it is hard to say that we are sufficiently equipped, considering the several constraints surrounding the current conduct of monetary policy. Like any other central bank, the Bank needs to examine every possible measure to enhance the transparency of its conduct of monetary policy. The Bank fully recognizes the fact that inflation targeting could be an important policy tool for the purpose, once we enter the stage where manoeuvrability is restored to monetary policy and the transmission mechanism recovers its function. The Bank will continue to examine the issue in the future. Bearing the lack of such manoeuvrability and the malfunctioning of transmission mechanism at present, however, I think it is critically important and urgent to take practical steps to restore the effectiveness of the transmission mechanism through which monetary easing influences economic activity and prices. I would like to emphasize that it would be a complete misunderstanding of the Bank(cid:146)s policy intention to conclude that the Bank is not actively implementing monetary policy to overcome deflation, based solely on the fact that the Bank does not adopt inflation targeting at this juncture. The Bank is willing to bring the inflation rate back to above zero percent, that is, a slightly positive rate, by doing its utmost and to maintain it at around that level. D. Enhancing transmission mechanism of monetary easing Amid various constraints imposed on its policy as I have mentioned, the important policy task of the Bank is to enhance the transmission mechanism of monetary easing. As the credit intermediary function of banks is not working properly, one of the contributions of the central bank to enhance the transmission mechanism is to encourage the development of securitized financing tools and capital markets that could complement and substitute for bank lending, and improve the financing environment for small firms. The relatively high share of bank lending, which is one of the features of Japan(cid:146)s financial structure, contributed to absorbing shocks from the downturn in economic activity within banks(cid:146) assets, and thus succeeded in diminishing their effects on the economy as long as the impacts of the shocks were limited. However, when significant shocks such as those accompanying asset price falls occurred, the concentration of the loss to the banking sector caused substantial damage to its capital base and risk-taking capability. This, in turn, amplified the effects of the shocks through tightening of corporate financing conditions. 
 BIS Review 29/2003 7 This problem could be partially resolved if alternative financial markets substituting for bank lending were developed to a significant degree. The development of such markets would not only contribute to smooth corporate financing, it would also work as a discipline on banks(cid:146) lending activities, for example, by encouraging banks to formulate lending rates which reflect credit risks more accurately. In addition, broadening the scope of economic entities that take credit risks attached to the corporate sector could enlarge the risk-taking capacity of banks. Investors would be able to realize portfolios by utilizing a broader range of instruments with various combinations of risks and returns. A new financing channel of this kind is imperative to cope with the financing needs of the corporate sector, as the economy becomes mature. Based on this thinking I have described, this April the Bank started examining the policy option of temporary purchase of ABSs with underlying assets such as receivables and loans related to small to medium-sized firms. The Bank decided the purchasing scheme at the Monetary Policy Meeting on June 11, 2003, taking into account various comments from market participants. Although it is an unconventional measure for a central bank to directly take on private-sector credit risk, we thought it necessary to promote smooth corporate financing by nurturing the ABS market and to enhance the effectiveness of monetary easing, giving due consideration to the required functions of Japan(cid:146)s financial system in the future and the current weakness in the credit intermediary function of the banking system. At the same time, the Bank will pay careful attention to avoid distortion of the ABS market and to maintain the soundness of the Bank(cid:146)s balance sheet. IV. For the revitalizing of Japan(cid:146)s economy A. The need for efforts by a wide range of economic entities I would like to briefly discuss my thinking on the efforts necessary to revitalize Japan(cid:146)s economy. As I mentioned at the outset, the world economy is undergoing structural change and industrialization in emerging economies is advancing. In this situation, Japan should foster new industries that will lead the economy in the 21st century with high productivity and value-added that are suitable to a developed nation. Such efforts are indispensable to ensure economic prosperity in the future, since we will not be able to count on an increase in the population as a source of economic growth and an improvement in productivity is virtually the only way to create growth. At the same time, it is necessary to drastically reconstruct the socioeconomic system, which has been based on an expanding economy, into one fitted to a mature economy. It is very difficult to achieve a national consensus regarding changes in the system itself. If the changes in the socioeconomic system cannot catch up with the actual economic and social developments, however, economic revitalization will be hampered through the effects of the disincentives. There is another problem regarding private economic entities: the risk-taking capability of financial institutions and firms is impaired because of the sluggish growth expectation after the bursting of the bubble. This problem undermines the effect of various policy actions. Therefore, the efforts of the government, the private sector, and the central bank must be concerted to overcome such complex issues facing the economy. As part of this, Japan should present a vision of the future socioeconomic system it seeks to attain, including the social security system and the relationship between the central and local governments, and seek to continuously take actions in accordance with this vision. Japan(cid:146)s prosperity in the 21st century should be achieved through maximum utilization of private-sector initiatives and market mechanisms, as for example an investment and funds intermediary, throughout the economy. At present, the private sector cannot fulfill the role to the utmost because of its limited financial strength, and in some cases public authorities are required to support private-sector initiatives. The Industrial Revitalization Corporation of Japan established last month is a major example of a public initiative to support private activities, and I hope it will be utilized effectively and contribute to the revitalization of the economy. At the same time, such policies and support as a whole must be in line with the nation(cid:146)s vision, that is, an economy exploiting the full benefits of private-sector initiatives and market mechanisms. Continuing to take these policy actions in harmony with the future visions will heighten the growth expectation of the private sector and induce demand. 
 8 BIS Review 29/2003 B. Reviving the financial system Finally, I would like to comment more specifically on issues concerning the Japanese financial system. In order to revive the economy, it is indispensable to realize a situation in which Japan(cid:146)s financial system performs the credit intermediary function fully. Discussion on putting the financial system on a sounder basis often focuses attention on the disposal of NPLs. Although this issue is very important, the disposal of NPLs is just one of the prerequisites for achieving the much broader task of reviving the financial system. The most vital necessity in the medium to long term is to construct a new financial infrastructure, which can play a key role in the economy in the 21st century. After World War II, Japanese financial institutions raised their profitability by maintaining a certain asset size, supported by high economic growth and private savings. In undertaking risk management, a basic function of commercial banks, most of the work associated with assessing the profitability and risk of each individual project was often substituted by monitoring the price of real estate that had been pledged as collateral. This system was based on the condition that real estate prices continued to rise. Market participants are now keenly watching whether Japanese financial institutions can generate a new business model and establish a sufficient foundation for profitability in the future, now that the external environment that supported their profitability in the postwar era has drastically changed. The value-added and the profit of financial institutions are ultimately generated from their activities of taking and controlling various risks such as credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. For the Japanese financial system and economy to revive, it is extremely important that Japanese financial institutions create a new business model that ensures a foundation for profitability while supporting the Japanese economy in the 21st century. I think it is essential for financial institutions to make further efforts in this respect. The Bank of Japan will make its best effort on various fronts, such as enhancing the transmission mechanism of monetary easing, promoting the permeation of the easing effects through the economy, as well as ensuring financial market stability. As other developed countries are keenly watching our monetary policy conduct, it is my sincere hope that Japan realizes sustainable economic growth accompanying price stability, and succeeds in recording a victory over deflation. 
 BIS Review 29/2003 1 Michael C Bonello: Population ageing - a major challenge for policymakers Speech by Mr Michael C Bonello, Governor of the Central Bank of Malta, at the opening session of two workshops on pension reform, organised in Floriana, Malta, by the World Bank Institute, 9 June 2003. *      *      * I should first of all like to thank the World Bank Institute for choosing Malta as the venue for this Workshop and to welcome you all to our country. Your presence here continues a centuries-old tradition whereby Malta exploits its location at the centre of the Mediterranean and its reputation for hospitality to bring people and ideas together. Malta is currently undergoing a rapid transformation in a bid to seize the opportunities arising from accession to the European Union and from the further consolidation of its trading relationship with its Southern and Eastern neighbours. The economy, albeit small, has a number of vibrant sectors ranging from high-tech manufacturing to world-class conference tourism. As in the case with many other countries, however, the long-term prospects for economic development in Malta will be inevitably affected by the impact of population ageing. Given that the population support ratio, defined as the number of persons of working age to those of pension age, is expected to halve over the next 25 years to just over 2, this impact is likely to be significant. The global and regional dimensions of population ageing Malta is by no means an exception in this regard. By the middle of this century, the median age of the world population is expected to increase by 10 years to 36 years. Globally, the proportion of persons aged 60 years and older is forecast to double. The fastest growing group of the older population is made up of those who are 80 years old or more. This age category is projected to increase more than five-fold over the next 50 years. While ageing is indeed a global phenomenon, it is likely to represent a more onerous challenge for developing countries than for developed ones. The majority of persons aged 60 and over will be found increasingly in developing countries; and as the pace of population ageing is much faster in these countries, they will have less time to adjust to its effects than the developed countries. Developing countries, moreover, will have to meet this challenge starting from a lower level of socio-economic development. For instance, the elderly in developing countries will be living mostly in rural areas and hence will face additional difficulties compared to their counterparts in developed countries who tend to live in urban centres. These differences imply that the policymaking capacity of developing countries will be tested more severely. More specifically, there will be important decisions to take regarding social security schemes, particularly traditional pension systems in which today(cid:146)s workers pay for the benefits of today(cid:146)s retirees. This will no doubt involve making difficult choices, some of which may have painful consequences in the short run, but which are essential for sustained economic development. The economic consequences of population ageing This is the case because population ageing is expected to have wide-ranging and long-lasting economic effects, involving not just government revenue and expenditure but also national saving and investment ratios as well as the labour market. The main issue that comes to mind when mentioning population ageing is its impact on government finances. Most countries, including Malta, presently operate pay-as-you-go pension systems. The ageing phenomenon undermines the financial viability of pay-as-you go systems by reducing the number of contributors relative to beneficiaries. Ageing also entails increased government expenditure on health, and especially on the care of the elderly. The challenge to public finances is even greater if, as is the case in Malta, the budget is already in deficit. Changes in the age distribution of the population are also likely to affect a country(cid:146)s private consumption and saving patterns. The (cid:145)life-cycle hypothesis(cid:146) suggests that individuals tend to even out consumption outlays over their lifetime, such that a person saves during the working years in order to 
 2 BIS Review 29/2003 finance consumption during retirement. A rising trend in the proportion of elderly people, therefore, tends to be accompanied by a decline in the national saving ratio. OECD projections, in fact, point to a reduction in saving rates of between 5 and 12 percentage points of GNP over the period 1980 to 2025. Such a contraction could lead to a vicious circle, as the resulting higher interest rates reduce investment, adversely affecting economic growth and, in turn, the ability to finance social security commitments. Ageing could also have a negative impact on financial markets. Pension funds are at present major players in most stock markets. As the baby boom generation retires during the current decade, most of these funds will have to gradually liquidate their assets, probably leading to downward pressures on share prices. This would in turn create a negative wealth effect, as declining asset prices dent the purchasing power of households and give rise to a reassessment of consumption patterns. The simultaneous decline in fertility rates, meanwhile, is expected to adversely affect the supply of labour and its quality. A smaller labour force would act as a drag on potential output growth, and impact negatively on competitiveness by tightening labour market conditions, leading to upward pressures on wages and inflation. An older work force is also likely to be less mobile and flexible, albeit more experienced. Policy measures to address the challenge In economic terms, population ageing is tantamount to a negative supply shock, of which the fiscal impact is but a manifestation. More fundamentally, the ageing phenomenon undermines the economy(cid:146)s productive base and its competitiveness. The adverse effects of the reduction in output are meanwhile compounded by higher consumption, which tends to crowd out investment expenditure and exert adverse pressures on price levels and the external balance of payments. The desirable outcomes of policies intended to meet population ageing are, therefore, not hard to identify. Such policies must aim at producing an increase in productive capacity and output, and stimulating saving and investment, thereby alleviating pressures on inflation, fiscal resources and the external account. Indeed, these outcomes are desirable independently of population ageing, but are rendered even more urgent by the onset of the phenomenon. It is the way in which this strategy is to be implemented that is often subject to contention. Opinions tend to diverge because it is not always appreciated that any course of action chosen, including a passive stance, involves sacrifices. An increase in resources devoted to pensions must imply higher taxation, a reduction in funds allocated to other equally worthy causes, or burdens on society as a whole in terms of higher inflation and interest rates. On the other hand, reforms that should engender a win-win situation in the long run could perhaps impose sacrifices on a number of individuals in the short term. It is, therefore, important to promote an informed debate which takes account of the costs and benefits involved in any course of action, with a view to reaching agreement on viable solutions. The nineties, in fact, saw many governments implementing pension reform initiatives, generally based on the three-pillar approach advocated by the World Bank. Under this approach, individuals may have up to three different sources of revenue during retirement, namely a basic state pension, the balance accumulated in a mandatory pension account and voluntary saving arrangements. A number of international studies show that the replacement of pay-as-you-go pension regimes by funded systems provides more incentives for private saving, and reduces the scope for tax evasion by linking contributions paid into the system directly to the benefits received. This contributes to increased investment and augments the productive base, thereby facilitating the financing of social security expenditure commitments. Apart from specific reforms in the social security system itself, an improvement in the fiscal position would have an overall positive macroeconomic effect, compensating in part for the addition in aggregate demand brought about by ageing. The lower absorption of resources by the State could also lead to a higher average level of productivity and to an improvement in the country(cid:146)s balance of payments. Productive capacity would also be enhanced if the State creates fiscal and other incentives for individuals to provide for their own needs after retirement, leading to an increase in the household saving rate and, consequently, also to a faster accumulation of capital. Fiscal consolidation will, however, only solve part of the problems created by population ageing. The negative supply shock caused by this phenomenon must also be countered by a positive shock. 
 BIS Review 29/2003 3 Supply-side reforms aimed at increasing the availability and the efficient use of economic resources are, therefore, essential. The efficiency of markets can be improved by implementing a vigorous competition policy and reducing public sector involvement in the economy. Productive capacity would also be improved through such policies as market liberalisation, greater investment in infrastructure and education, and a market-driven industrial policy. Structural rigidities in the labour market must be eliminated in order to decrease their disincentive effects in terms of the labour supply and the work ethic. A labour market policy intended to increase skills, and consequently the employability of individuals, is also desirable. Conclusion This (cid:147)grey cloud(cid:148) on the horizon, therefore, appears to have a silver lining in the form of appropriate policy responses that would effectively enhance the welfare of populations. Moreover, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, has said: (cid:147)Trees grow stronger over the years, rivers wider. Likewise, with age, human beings gain immeasurable depth and breadth of experience and wisdom. That is why older persons should be not only respected and revered; they should be utilized as the rich resource to society that they are.(cid:148) The wealth of skills and experience that older people bring to the workplace, to public life and to the family are generally not recognized. Technological advances and new ways of organizing society can be put to good use to increase the participation of older people in work and to make appropriate socio-economic changes. 
 BIS Review 29/2003 1 Lars Heikensten: The Riksbank and the euro Speech by Mr Lars Heikensten, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the Society of International Treasurers Convention, Stockholm, 17 June 2003. *      *      * Let me begin by thanking you for the invitation to come here and speak on the subject of EMU. Approximately three months remain until 14 September when the Swedish people will vote on whether to participate in monetary union. In the event of a (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote, Sweden will enter monetary union in 2006 and introduce the euro as its currency. The right of determination over our interest rate level will then be transferred to the European Central Bank (the ECB). On the other hand, a (cid:147)no(cid:148) vote would generally imply (cid:147)business as usual(cid:148) for the Riksbank. Today, I will be speaking about some of the implications for the Riksbank and our operations in the event of a (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote in the referendum. I will begin by speaking about the preparatory phase, that is, from 14 September until 1 January 2006, during which time preparations will be conducted in the Swedish economy for a changeover to the euro, and the krona will join the exchange rate mechanism, ERM2. Subsequently, I will talk on the issue of monetary policy as it will be conducted by the ECB and point to differences as well as similarities with how it is conducted today. Thereafter, I will touch upon the effects of a changeover on our work with financial stability. Finally, I will mention a number of issues concerning the role of the Riksbank in the event of entry into monetary union and the implications for our operations. But before I go into these issues I would like to emphasise a number of points. This is not a campaign speech. In 1994 and 1997, the Riksbank adopted a position in favour of Sweden joining monetary union from its inception. The General Council of the Riksbank was then of the opinion that the advantages of participation outweighed the disadvantages. However, the Executive Board of the Riksbank has decided against taking a position on the issue. We have interpreted our role as being a provider of factual information to make it easier for the Swedish people to form their own opinion on the matter. Having said that, there is nothing to prevent individual members of the Executive Board from expressing their personal opinion on the issue. We have all done that. I myself am in favour of Swedish participation in monetary union. The preparations Should a majority of the Swedish vote (cid:147)yes(cid:148) to the euro, work will begin to pave the way for Swedish entry into monetary union. The Riksdag is then expected during the autumn to make a formal decision that will enable Sweden in practice to become a member of monetary union. At the same time, it is necessary that the legal and practical adaptations that are a precondition for our participation be prepared and decided upon before the EU(cid:146)s finance ministers within the scope of the ECOFIN Council take the final decision. If the referendum results in a (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote, the Riksbank will be required to help ensure that entry into monetary union proceeds in a stable, smooth manner. Since the middle of the 1990s, the Riksbank has been collaborating with the financial sector via the SIFS group - Consultation and Information with the Financial Sector - with a view to ascertaining the adaptation measures necessary ahead of a potential Swedish changeover to the euro and how long these measures would take to implement. The aim has been to make the time between a Swedish Riksdag decision in favour of participation and entry itself as short as possible. The Swedish government has recommended that Sweden, in the event of a (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote, should strive to enter monetary union on 1 January 2006, and that this should be carried out through a direct changeover or (cid:147)big bang(cid:148). The switch-over of all electronic transactions in society would then be made simultaneously with the cash changeover. This proposal has been welcomed by the financial sector, and there are good chances therefore of a smooth, efficient changeover to the euro at the beginning of 2006. For the Riksbank, a changeover to the euro would of course be a major project. The practical preparations would include ensuring the production of new banknotes and coins, as well as the replacement of the old ones. The latter would entail a considerable logistical operation. For example, a couple of hundred large lorries would be required simply to deliver the necessary coins at the time of 
 2 BIS Review 29/2003 the introduction. But there is more to it than that. Computer systems would need to be converted, not least at the Riksbank, but also in many other areas of society. The Riksbank would also expend a lot of effort on providing information to the general public about the implications of a changeover. In addition, there would be a number of changes in our own operations, which I will return to later. Participation in ERM2 One important question that would become relevant during the preparatory phase is how best to ensure exchange rate stability against the euro within the scope of the exchange rate mechanism ERM2, the successor to the ERM system. In this regard, there may be reason to say something about history. The Riksbank has previously, mainly over the years 1995-1997, considered the issue of ERM participation and the possibilities for combining this with the inflation target policy that has been conducted for a number of years. During that time, the Riksbank was legally responsible for the exchange rate regime, and the reasons therefore for considering ERM participation were quite simply to prevent the regime of floating exchange rates from constituting a formal obstacle to Swedish participation in monetary union, in the event this was to become a possibility. When the government then decided that there was insufficient popular support for Swedish participation in monetary union, the question of changing the exchange rate regime was dropped. In connection with the Riksbank being made formally independent in 1999, new legislation on exchange rate policy was also introduced. Nowadays, it is the government that decides upon the issue of our exchange rate regime, although the Riksbank determines how it is to be implemented. In other words, it is the government that would decide whether and when the krona should join the exchange rate mechanism ERM2. Following that, the ministry of finance and the Riksbank would decide what rate between the krona and euro we assess to be consistent with a stable development of the economy. There are very good reasons to agree upon a common line of action. This is why we are holding discussions already among toplevel officials about an appropriate line of reasoning, the results produced by different estimation methods, etc. If we do not reach agreement, it is likely to be difficult to hold effective discussions with our European partners. A decision on participation in ERM2 and on the central rate and fluctuation bands at which the krona should join would be taken through common accord of the finance ministers in the euro area Member States, the ECB, the central bank governors and finance ministers of the applicant country and the other ERM2 countries, i.e. Denmark at present. In practice, a decision would be preceded by contacts between representatives of the ministry of finance and the Riksbank as well as with our colleagues in a number of euro area Member States and Denmark. The first official step in the negotiations would be taken within the framework of the EU(cid:146)s economic and financial committee (EFC). Only if the committee should fail to reach agreement would direct negotiations between the concerned central bank governors and finance ministers take place. Then, when the irrevocable conversion rate against the euro is to be determined in connection with entry into monetary union, this would be decided unanimously by the ECOFIN Council members from the euro area Member States and Sweden. Central rate in ERM2 The central rate is the krona/euro exchange rate against which the criterion of exchange rate stability would be evaluated prior to entry into monetary union. It is natural to seek to ensure that the central rate is set at a level which also becomes the conversion rate for the Swedish krona in monetary union. Generally, this has also been the norm; only in a couple of cases has a central rate been changed during the two years preceding entry into monetary union. It is important to point out that it is not possible to exactly determine a (cid:147)best(cid:148) central rate or irrevocable conversion rate. What may appear to be the best value of the exchange rate for the economic climate today does not have to be the most appropriate for all time when new data on the economy has been received. A certain capacity for adjustment is therefore necessary within the economies to manage the consequences of the altered circumstances with a fixed exchange rate. With the aid of various models, we can describe conceivable development paths for the exchange rate, given certain assumptions about how the economy will develop in other respects. When performing these kinds of forecasts, the analysis is usually carried out in terms of the real exchange rate instead of the nominal rate. The real exchange rate is the nominal rate adjusted for any 
 BIS Review 29/2003 3 differences in the price level between the countries in question. The reason that it is often more interesting to perform analyses using the real exchange rate is that the most important macroeconomic relationships and theories about these are based on real instead of nominal exchange rates. The real exchange rate is a relative price between baskets of goods in different countries, thus reflecting both international competitiveness and purchasing power. In principle, a suitable central rate for the krona could be estimated by producing a forecast for the nominal krona/euro rate for the exact date on which ERM2 membership is expected to begin. However, all of this is complicated by the existence of several theories for exchangerate determination and the uncertainty of the forecasts themselves. Nor are models capable of encapsulating all the relevant aspects that could conceivably affect the development of the exchange rate, which is why it would be necessary to complement the modelbased analysis with different kinds of expert assessments. This implies that we have to confine ourselves to narrowing in on an interval of conceivable central rates. In various situations, including the December Inflation Report in 2002, the Riksbank has shown forecasts of the krona(cid:146)s real exchange rate against the euro according to a number of models under the assumption of a floating nominal exchange rate in the future. Forecasts of this kind underline what I(cid:146)ve just said: the forecast outcome is highly dependent on the chosen model of application. Common to all models, however, is that they predict a strengthening of the real exchange rate over the coming years. According to the models, this strengthening is due to the expected development of a number of factors including relative GDP, Sweden(cid:146)s relative net assets, our terms of trade, relative demography, etc. When we adjust the forecast of the real exchange rate for the expected difference in inflation between Sweden and the euro area, we get similar development paths for the nominal krona/euro rate. As differences in inflation are expected to be small, the forecast strengthening of the real rate is also reflected in the nominal rate. Towards the end of the forecast period, the rate should lie, according to the assessments of the Riksbank, within an interval of approximately 8.20 to 9 kronor per euro. The forecast for the rate at the end of 2003, however, consists of a narrower interval, around 8.50 to around 9 kronor per euro. Consequently, should Sweden join ERM2 around the end of the year, this kind of estimate would advocate a suitable central rate between the interval 8.50 to around 9 kronor per euro. It should be noted that the models imply an expected strengthening in both real and nominal terms but that this strengthening from next year onward will be rather limited. When choosing a central rate, it is vital to find a rate vis-(cid:224)-vis the euro that is consistent with a balanced development in the Swedish economy in both the short and long term. It is important to remember that the real exchange rate, i.e. the relative price between baskets of goods in Sweden and the euro area Member States would be variable even if were to introduce the euro as our currency. But the adjustment would then occur through the relative rate of price increases. A central rate that is overly weak would therefore provide stimulus to the Swedish economy that could lead to higher inflation than in the other participant countries as well as unemployment at a later stage when the impact of the weaker competitiveness makes itself felt. With an overly strong rate, the risk instead is of lower inflation than in the other countries, initially having a negative impact on growth and employment. This line of reasoning also clearly demonstrates the connection to fiscal policy. A weaker exchange rate requires tighter fiscal policy and vice versa. In practice, it is not possible to base the choice of the central and conversion rate only on model estimates of what is a desirable longterm rate. It is also important to take into account expected developments in the coming years. It is not in the interests of either Sweden or the other involved countries to have problems arise during the period of Swedish participation in ERM2. In this respect, the economic climate is a factor that demands attention. Previous experience also indicates that negotiations of a central rate would be influenced by the rate that has prevailed between the krona and the euro in recent years. Recent market assessments have been in an interval between 8.50 and 9 kronor per euro, as I mentioned earlier. Monetary policy strategy in ERM2 If Sweden were to join monetary union, the responsibility for ensuring a balanced development in our economy would essentially lie with the government and the Riksdag. There is reason to underline the fact that this would already occur during the ERM2 period, even if the shift in responsibility for 
 4 BIS Review 29/2003 stabilising the economy from monetary policy to fiscal policy would be a gradual one. As the effects of economic policy are exerted with a time lag, this is something that fiscal policy decisionmakers should already be considering. For the Riksbank, the issue would be to define a strategy for monetary policy in the light of the boundaries imposed by fiscal policy and the central rate and conversion rates chosen for the krona versus the euro. Essentially, it is a question of conducting monetary policy in a way that would make the conditions as favourable as possible for ensuring both the attainment of the price stability target and the objective of holding the exchange rate close to the central rate. This is a pre-requisite if we are to meet the entry requirements, or convergence criteria, of monetary union. From this perspective, it is interesting that the forecasts of the development of the exchange rate and inflation indicate that a relatively stable development for both of these variables is to be expected over the coming years. In ERM2, the Riksbank would still have control over the repo rate. Given the boundaries established by fiscal policy in particular, this should be set with the aim of ensuring price stability, as is the case today. Normally, this should not constitute a problem as regards the exchange rate. ERM2 provides considerable scope for targeting monetary policy at price stability. This applies of course for the normal band widths of –15 per cent, but would also apply for the narrower bands of –2.25 per cent, which the European Commission has used in its evaluations. Just like today, there is therefore reason to continue publishing inflation reports and to hold regular monetary policy meetings. Swedish experiences from recent decades of fixed exchange-rate regimes have, as we all know, not been entirely positive. The events of 1992 are still fresh in our memories. But a lot has happened over the past ten years. Our economic policy has become credible and successful. In recent years, it has followed the same principles as those in the euro area and has been characterised by efforts to achieve price stability and sound public finances. Participation in ERM2 would not change the stance or objective of policy of course. Tensions stemming from a lack of competitiveness in the Swedish economy are also unlikely; the rate is set partly to ensure a reasonable level of competitiveness, while inflation over the coming years can be expected to be more or less in line with that of the euro area. Moreover, the process for other countries(cid:146) entry into monetary union was smooth in spite of the fact that the circumstances in many cases were less favourable at the time than in Sweden today. For instance, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the third stage and the introduction of the euro is now gone. In light of this, there is no reason for concern over participation in ERM2. The objective of keeping the exchange rate stable and close to the central rate would be facilitated by the fact that the central rate chosen for ERM2, as I mentioned earlier, can be expected to be the conversion rate vis-(cid:224)-vis the euro on a known date in the future. This is an absolutely crucial difference compared with the systems of fixed exchange rates previously adhered to by Sweden. If the exchange rate nevertheless should unexpectedly move to an extent considered inappropriate, interventions could be made in the foreign exchange market. Such interventions would have certain potency due to the fact that they would involve the purchase and sale of currencies that will be traded at the same price for all time. To clarify this, interventions could be made in the form of futures contracts with a maturity date beyond the date of entry. The single monetary policy Entry into monetary union would imply Sweden becoming part of the euro area and the European Central Bank assuming responsibility for monetary policy. Target and strategy Both the Riksbank and the ECB have the task of maintaining price stability and, to the extent that it does not conflict with the price stability target, promoting a balanced development of economic activities. The Riksbank(cid:146)s inflation target entails keeping annual inflation as measured by the consumer price index, CPI, at 2 per cent with a tolerance for deviations of 1 percentage point upwards or downwards. Given that monetary policy exerts its impact on the economy with a time lag, our work is based in practice on ensuring that future expected inflation is 2 per cent. Our underlying assumption is that the time lag in policy is mainly one to two years. However, there is sometimes reason to refrain from achieving the target as defined in this way. This may be the case when inflation is affected by transitory effects, such as quickly rising or falling energy prices or changes in indirect taxes or 
 BIS Review 29/2003 5 mortgage interest expenditure. For this reason, the Riksbank also makes use of measures of inflation that exclude such effects. Inflation measured by the index UND1X is one example. Moreover, there may be reason after a shock to bring inflation back to the target in the somewhat longer term. This enables us to avoid overly negative implications for production and employment. The ECB measures price stability as a year-on-year increase in consumer prices of below, but close to, 2 procent. The target relates to inflation measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, HICP. The idea is to reach the goal in the medium term, which implies that the ECB also disregards transitory effects on inflation. Consequently, the ECB(cid:146)s definition is similar to our own. There are some differences, however. One is that the ECB(cid:146)s target is defined in terms of HICP. The consumption basket in HICP is narrower than in CPI due to the fact that areas for which statistics are not yet harmonised have been excluded. The differences between HICP and the different measures normally used by the Riksbank are generally rather small. Another difference is the target level. The Riksbank works with a definite central target surrounded by a symmetrical interval. Previously, the ECB(cid:146)s target was for inflation to be below 2 per cent. It was at the ECB Governing Council(cid:146)s evaluation of its monetary policy strategy in May this year that the target of keeping inflation close to 2 per cent was specified. With this, the ECB has become more precise in its definition. Compared with the Riksbank, the difference in target level is small and should not make any great difference in practice. The most significant difference in target definition is that the ECB(cid:146)s target relates to inflation for the euro area as a whole, while the Riksbank(cid:146)s target applies of course to Sweden only. The ECB(cid:146)s policy implies therefore that the rate of inflation in individual Member States can be both higher and lower than 2 per cent without constituting neglect of the ECB(cid:146)s target. This is also the case in reality, as shown clearly by the inflation outcomes that have been measured. The same applies to Sweden but on a smaller scale; inflation can be different in Norrbotten and Sk(cid:229)ne. When formulating monetary policy, the ECB attaches special importance to monetary aggregate and credit variables. A reference value for the annual increase in the monetary aggregate has been set, currently amounting to 4.5 per cent. In general, however, the interest rate adjustments implemented by the ECB have not been justified on the basis of developments in the monetary aggregate. This has been clear on several occasions in recent years, when the refi rate has been lowered in spite of the fact that the rate of increase in the monetary aggregate clearly exceeded the reference value. The evaluation of the strategy in May also resulted in measures of the monetary aggregate being given a role primarily as indicators of future inflation. Naturally, the Riksbank also follows monetary aggregate and credit variables, even if we have not assigned them special significance when assessing inflation. Therefore, the formulation of policy nowadays is also quite similar in this respect as well. Finally, allow me to point out that despite the similarities in the formulation of policy, it can not be ruled out that price and wage increases in Sweden may sometimes be both too high and too low. The main reason is that the ECB(cid:146)s policy is targeted at average price increases in the euro area as a whole. Partly as a result of this, there is reason to discuss both the role of fiscal policy and the functioning of the labour market in the event of an introduction of the euro in Sweden. It is particularly important that fiscal policy be conducted in a way that ensures that reserves will be available during economic declines and that institutional conditions are created to facilitate necessary decisions for tighter fiscal policy to be taken on time. Decision-making and communication In the event of participation in monetary union, the Riksbank Governor would become a member of the ECB Governing Council, which is the highest decision-making body of the European Central Bank. I would then, just like all the other members of the Governing Council, have the opportunity to say what interest rate level I believe to be the best taking into account developments in the entire euro area. I would be a member of the Governing Council in a personal capacity, i.e. I would not be permitted to seek or receive instruction from other individuals or institutions. One issue that has been the subject of much discussion is the voting modalities in the Governing Council. Initially, the Riksbank Governor would always have the right to vote on interest rate decisions. This would change in the future, however. Once the number of Member States in the euro area exceeds 15, a new decision-making arrangement will enter into force. The Member States will be divided into groups according to size, and the voting rights will be rotated between the participants in 
 6 BIS Review 29/2003 the respective groups. For Sweden, the long-term implication is that the central bank governor, once all current and new EU Member States are participating in monetary union, would be able to vote on approximately 60 per cent of the decisions. The central bank governor of a large country like Germany, on the other hand, which has around nine times as many inhabitants, would be able to vote at 80 per cent of the meetings. However, all central bank governors would have the right of attendance and expression at all meetings. From a Swedish perspective, this appears to be a rather advantageous solution in my opinion. The ability to exert influence on the formulation of policy is important of course, particularly from a democratic point of view. But it is not simply a question of voting rights, which is the impression one gets sometimes when listening to the debate. Firstly, it is important to remember that the central bank governors must act in the interests of the entire euro area when setting interest rates. In other words, they must not give priority to national interests. Thus far, there have not been any votes held in the ECB Governing Council; rather, monetary policy has been determined through consensus. In addition, all central bank governors have the right of attendance, even under the new proposal, and can therefore be involved in discussions on the stance of policy. My own experience from other, similar discussions in the central bank sphere is that solid, wellfounded arguments weigh heavily and, in practice, play a more important role than the size of the country and the possibility to press a voting button. What I know about how the ECB Governing Council works in monetary policy discussions supports this viewpoint. For my own part, I believe that too much attention has been paid to the voting modalities. Other factors can be particularly important in ensuring effective monetary policy. Personally, I would emphasise the internal discussion processes, which I believe to be vital. These should be of high quality and transparent, and provide scope for different decision-makers to become involved on equal terms. Clarity and transparency is also important externally, ensuring more precise and meaningful criticism, which in turn can improve and speed up internal thought processes. Also in these respects, there are a number of similarities between the Riksbank and the ECB. Both institutions publish assessments of inflation prospects, hold press conferences in connection with their interest rate decisions and justify and explain their formulation of policy before various political bodies. In addition, a gradual evolution of intellectual thought takes place within both the Riksbank and the ECB. It is likely that this will bring us closer together. The most significant differences, in my opinion, relate to the clarity of the assessments, where the Riksbank and other countries that work with explicit figurebased targets and publish inflation reports are clearer. The Riksbank also has an internal preparation process with broad participation. Finally, we publish the minutes of Executive Board meetings in which the opinion of each member is evident. The latter issue has a different (cid:147)charge(cid:148) at European level since there is a risk that a genuinely single monetary policy would be undermined if individual positions were made public. Monetary union and financial stability in Sweden The Riksbank not only has the task of maintaining price stability but also that of promoting a safe and efficient payment system. In light of this, allow me also to say something about the potential implications of entry into monetary union from this perspective. The financial markets in Europe have developed rapidly over the past decade, partly as a result of the fact that the freedom to trade financial services is fundamental to the cooperation in the EU. Competition for the national banks has hardened. The single currency has contributed to the evolution of a far better capital market outside the banks, which has increased competition further. In several large European countries, a process of structural transformation in the banking systems is underway, much like that experienced in Sweden in connection with the banking crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. When competition grows stiffer, it can of course pose a threat to stability, especially if the banks are not accustomed to competition and are also weakly capitalised. In Sweden, the banks have operated in a competitive environment since the deregulation of the 1980s and have been forced into a process of considerable rationalisation. Capitalisation is also satisfactory. There is reason to believe that the Swedish banks would be able to take advantage of the less expensive borrowing conditions in a single currency market and that they would be able to spread their risks over a greater number of counterparties, which would be positive for stability. In the long run, the banks(cid:146) customers may find it easier to come into contact with other European banks. This is an important aspect of increased 
 BIS Review 29/2003 7 competition, although wise lenders nevertheless respect the (cid:147)church tower(cid:148) principle, namely to lend only to those that you know well - those that you can see from the local church tower. I do not believe that a single currency in itself would increase credit risk in the banks. If monetary union in the long run were to result in a more integrated market for financial services, the current Swedish banks would most likely be rather small participants in this market, and each bank would be less important for the effective functioning of the payment system. Their significance for financial stability would decrease and the need for public intervention to safeguard stability in the financial system would therefore also be reduced. The reason for this quite simply is that the effect of one or a number of participants failing would not be as big if the system was supported at European level by a large number of participants, as opposed to being dependent on a small number of participants, as the Swedish system is today. A more advanced securities market would also serve as a buffer, both for borrowers and savers. This would make the banks less systemically important. All in all, I believe that the Swedish banks are well equipped to face stiffer competition and that the effects of monetary union on stability in the financial system would primarily be positive. The securities markets, both stock exchanges and systems for the clearing and settlement of transactions, are presently undergoing rapid development in Europe. It is likely that the principal force driving this development is technological advances that enable cost savings, and Sweden will be able to take part in this whether we use kronor or euro. However, as with trade in other markets, trade on stock exchanges is of course facilitated by a single currency. As regards the system for large-value interbank payments - the real-time system for gross payments known as RIX in Sweden and managed by the Riksbank - monetary union would involve major changes. It is likely that we would not have a separate system for such payments after membership, but in some way would connect to the new European system (TARGET2). There would be considerable efficiency gains to be made here. However, the stability aspect of this must be given attention. The operational risk would increase when a greater number become dependent on one big system. With regard to the Riksbank, the direct effects of participation in monetary union on the work with financial stability would not be particularly large. Even if Sweden were to join monetary union, the Riksbank, under present rules, would be responsible for making decisions on providing emergency liquidity assistance to Swedish institutions. Furthermore, the vulnerability of the banks and the payment system would not change overnight but would continue to be largely national in nature, as long as the European banks and payment systems have not become genuinely integrated. The oversight and management of crises would therefore have to be carried out by national authorities. The big difference is that international cooperation would become even more important. In the long term, as banks and securities markets become increasingly more integrated, new and interesting issues would arise on how best to carry out international supervision and oversight. In this discussion, if Sweden were to join monetary union, our voice would carry greater weight as a member of the ECB Governing Council and in the cooperation of finance ministers. This is also important for our ability to influence how integration in general proceeds and thereby also for the financial sector(cid:146)s conditions in Sweden.   The role of the Riksbank If Sweden were to join monetary union, the Riksbank would become part of a bigger whole, the Eurosystem. This does not mean that the Riksbank(cid:146)s tasks would disappear, however, as claimed time and again by one of my predecessors Lars Wohlin. The majority of the Riksbank(cid:146)s tasks would remain relatively unaffected by our participation. As I just mentioned, this applies to our work on financial stability, which would essentially remain a national responsibility for the foreseeable future. The Riksbank(cid:146)s operational tasks such as monetary policy transactions, the management of the Riksbank(cid:146)s assets, the collection of statistics, the management of banknotes and coins and various administrative tasks would also remain. I also object to the claim that the Riksbank would become a branch office of the ECB. In actual fact, the national central banks of the Eurosystem own the ECB. If Sweden were to join the Eurosystem, we would become a member of the board and be able to influence how the system as a whole develops in the future. That is hardly an opportunity available to local offices of other organisations. In addition, the Eurosystem is a decentralised system, in which the vast majority of tasks are carried out by the 
 8 BIS Review 29/2003 national central banks. Many tasks are also performed at national level completely outside the framework of the Eurosystem.    The main change if Sweden were to participate in monetary union would be that decisions on the interest rate level in Sweden would be taken by the ECB Governing Council instead of by the Executive Board of the Riksbank. The decisive factor for the setting of rates would be the inflation prospects for the euro area as a whole. As Riksbank Governor, I would become a member of the ECB Governing Council and take part in the monetary policy decisions there. Naturally, this would affect our work on monetary policy. Prior to taking its interest rate decisions, the ECB does not perform its own assessments of inflation prospects for smaller Member States such as Sweden, so this would remain our responsibility. In light of this, it is natural that we should continue to publish assessments of the Swedish economy a couple of times per year. In this way, we would be able to make a contribution to the economic policy debate in Sweden. These assessments would also be important when we motivate, explain and justify the single monetary policy in Sweden. As part of the Eurosystem, the Riksbank would participate in the comprehensive analysis activities of the ECB. If we are to have any influence in this process, it is important that we have performed good analyses that are tailored to the essential, relevant issues prior to the ECB(cid:146)s meetings. This points to a certain shift in focus from our day-to-day forecasting activities to in-depth analyses that are also of relevance to policy. One consequence of the Riksbank no longer setting the interest rate level in Sweden would undoubtedly be a decrease in the level of attention paid to our activities in the media and elsewhere. This would primarily have direct effects for the members of the Executive Board but is not something that worries me. However, it could also affect our ability to attract employees. Certain categories of employee may no longer consider us to be as exciting a workplace. For others, the opposite may be the case, particularly for those that want to work in a more international environment. Transparency is and has been a guiding principle of the Riksbank for many years. Should Sweden decide to join monetary union, the Riksbank would continue to be a transparent institution. In some respects, our actions would be naturally restricted by the common regulations for the euro area. To the extent we perceive this to be a problem for our operations and an obstacle to the transparency we safeguard, we would of course seek to effect a change.   Concluding remarks Approximately three months remain until 14 September, when the Swedish people will be saying (cid:147)yes(cid:148) or (cid:147)no(cid:148) to the euro in a referendum. In light of this, I have addressed some issues today that are directly relevant to the Riksbank(cid:146)s operations and the preparatory work that we are carrying out in the event of a (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote. During the preparatory phase, Sweden may - if the government so decides - join ERM2. We are well prepared for this, having an economy that is in step with that of the euro area. Membership in ERM2, for a country on its way into monetary union, is different to the systems of fixed exchange rates in which Sweden has previously participated. This is partly due to the fact that the central rate chosen can be expected to become the conversion rate for entry into EMU. This would reduce the risk of uncertainty over the krona(cid:146)s development. As a member in ERM2, there would still be scope for the Riksbank to promote price stability, although this scope would diminish the closer to entry we come. Responsibility for stabilising the economy would gradually shift over to fiscal policy. If Sweden were to join monetary union, the interest rate level would be set by the ECB. The differences that exist between the Riksbank(cid:146)s and ECB(cid:146)s work methods should not be exaggerated. With the ECB(cid:146)s latest clarifications, this has become even more obvious. But as regards the internal preparation processes, clarity and transparency, a number of differences remain. If the referendum results in a (cid:147)yes(cid:148) to the euro, I will be talking an active part in these issues as a member of the ECB Governing Council. The Riksbank also works with financial stability. In this area, the institutional changes would not be that great as a result of Sweden joining monetary union. In the long term, however, the financial system in Europe would be reshaped. It is important that we have both insight and influence in this process in order to be able to do a good job at the Riksbank and also to be able to contribute to creating the best possible conditions for the Swedish financial sector. 
 BIS Review 29/2003 9 Finally, I mentioned the Riksbank(cid:146)s own activities after a potential entry into monetary union. Media interest in the Riksbank would certainly diminish somewhat if we no longer set the repo rate. However, our work tasks and operations would not be affected that much. Most important would be changes in the area of monetary policy. Our perspective would have to become more European, while we would also be an important part of the domestic debate on economic policy. In conclusion, allow me to note that a (cid:147)no(cid:148) to the euro would not entail any major changes for the Riksbank(cid:146)s day-to-day business. I expect that we would continue to conduct our operations in much the same way as before. There is a risk, however, that our significance in the international arena would diminish further. 
 BIS Review 29/2003 1 Toshihiko Fukui: Challenges for monetary policy in Japan Speech by Mr Toshihiko Fukui, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Spring Meeting of the Japan Society of Monetary Economics, on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, Tokyo, 1 June 2003. *      *      * Introduction I am honored to have this opportunity today to address such a distinguished audience. Members of this esteemed society are generous enough to provide us at the Bank with their opinions and the fruits of their researches, which we in our turn take into consideration when we examine our policy measures from all angles. I should like, therefore, at the outset of this speech, to express my sincere gratitude to all of you for continuing to stimulate the intellectual debate in this way. The society and the Bank have a long history of good communication, as indeed is recorded in our Archive, and the first example of this was a speech given by Keizo Shibusawa, then Deputy Governor of the Bank, at the inaugural meeting of the society in June 1943. The meeting was held incidentally a year after the Bank of Japan Law of 1942, modeled on the law governing the Reichsbank, the then central bank of Germany, became effective under wartime legislation. In his speech, Deputy Governor Shibusawa emphasized the principle of maintaining the value of the currency when formulating monetary policy, stating that, although the demands on policy of a given time or situation may exert some influence, the fundamentals of this principle do not change. While I can only guess what was actually in Deputy Governor Shibusawa(cid:146)s mind at the time he made this statement, my own understanding is that, at a time when the war was producing upheaval in both the economic and the financial environment, he wished to remind his listeners of the importance of orthodox central banking. At the same time, I believe he wished to convey his sincere hope that the society(cid:146)s members would continue to analyze the fundamentals of the currency system, making full use of their expertise. Another example may be found in a speech given at the 40th anniversary meeting of the society in 1983, when the Japanese economy was at the peak of its postwar prosperity. Discussing the mandate of the Bank of Japan, Governor Haruo Mayekawa stated that, in conducting monetary policy, the highest priority should naturally be placed upon the stability of prices. He concluded his speech by observing that the formulation and execution of successful policy could only be achieved if the policy measures employed had a solid theoretical foundation. Ten years ago in June, I was, as an Executive Director of the Bank, invited to the 50th anniversary meeting of the society and presented a speech titled (cid:147)Missions and Responsibilities of a Central Bank in a Contemporary Context.(cid:148) At that time, the economy was deteriorating following the bursting of the asset price bubble, and looking back, as I prepared my speech for today(cid:146)s occasion, at the path trodden by Japan(cid:146)s economy over the last decade, I was impressed by the fact that the surrounding environment has become much more severe, although the basic mandate of the central bank, to maintain the stability of prices, has not changed in the least. Even if we restrict our attention to the area of monetary policy, there have undoubtedly been a number of changes worthy of note. The first and most important of these is the change that has taken place in the financial environment, and here the substantial decline in interest rates is most notable. In fact, the level of interest rates was already low a decade ago, as the economy continued to deteriorate following the bursting of the asset price bubble, and weak balance sheets in both the corporate and financial sectors suggested that deep adjustments were inevitable. In these circumstances, the Bank took a series of monetary easing measures, and the official discount rate had declined to the then unprecedented level of 1.75 percent by the end of 1993. The same period saw a moderate decline in the overnight call rate to the range of 2.0-2.5 percent from 3.5-4.0 percent. At that time an official discount rate of 1.75 percent was considered extremely low and was indeed the lowest level of this rate since the Bank began operation in 1882, a period that included the financial crisis of 1927 and the fiscal expansion policy adopted by Finance Minister Korekiyo Takahashi in the 1930s. In retrospect, however, there was an enviable amount of room left for interest rate reductions, and hence interest rates were useful as policy tools. 
 2 BIS Review 29/2003 Recently, in contrast, not only the overnight call rate but almost all money market rates have declined to a level close to zero percent. Moreover, since spring 2001, the Bank has moved into territory unexplored by any central bank in history by implementing quantitative easing with interest rates already at the zero bound. I stated at my inaugural press conference that a central bank conducting monetary policy with very little room left for interest rate reductions is like a boxer fighting with his hands tied behind his back. Even with our hands tied, we at the Bank have not given up fighting and are indeed doing the best we can. It was, however, beyond anyone(cid:146)s imagination in 1993 that the Bank would be fighting against deflation under such a constraint. The second major change concerns the revision of the Bank of Japan Law. A sense that the previous Bank of Japan Law was not quite in tune with the current of change characterizing the world(cid:146)s central banking systems and financial markets would no doubt have already existed in 1993, but this had not yet advanced to the stage of making specific proposals for revisions to the Law. The situation changed rapidly, and four years later, in 1997, the revised Bank of Japan Law was enacted, and has been in effect since April 1998. The focus of the revision has been greater independence for the Bank in conducting its monetary policy and calls for improved transparency. This in its turn has led to a significant reorganization of the Policy Board, through which the Bank makes monetary policy decisions independently, and the Bank marked a new start with a completely new governing structure. The transparency of the Bank(cid:146)s policy conduct was also improved by the publication of the minutes of every Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) of the Bank(cid:146)s Policy Board. Any visitor to the Bank(cid:146)s Web site can see that, in addition to the minutes, a significant amount of information is being released including reports of the Governor(cid:146)s press conferences, texts of speeches given by senior officials, and an abundance of research materials detailing the background to policy decisions. The third and the most recent change concerns the increasing global interest in monetary policy within economies suffering from deflationary trends. In 1993, in spite of the similar background situation, that is, strong downside risks to the world economy and consistently falling inflation rates, there seemed to be no particular concern anywhere in the world about the decline in inflation rates per se. A quick check of the keywords appearing in articles in major newspapers at that time reveals that people(cid:146)s attention was overwhelmingly focused on inflation rather than deflation. Recently, however, as disinflation has progressed, interest rates have fallen across the world. An international comparison of the levels of money market rates reveals several countries whose current rates lie within the 0-1.0 percent bracket, in particular Switzerland at 0.2 percent and Singapore at 0.5-0.6 percent. In the United States, the policy interest rate currently stands at 1.25 percent, which, if we make a direct comparison, is the level seen in Japan at the beginning of 1995. An increasing number of people are now interested in deflation. Looking back at developments over the last decade, I have been struck anew by how immensely important it is for the central bank to gain reliable insights into the outlook for the economy. At the same time, we clearly cannot be too surprised at the fact that, with the passage of time, changes have taken place in the debate surrounding monetary policy. We at the central bank must continue to make efforts to gain new insights and learn from new ideas, while not allowing ourselves to fall captive to whatever mindset is dominant at a particular point in time. I feel acutely the importance of further interaction with the academic world, because cutting-edge research on financial and economic theory is fundamental to our efforts. Since I assumed the office of Governor in March this year, and indeed before, I have had the opportunity to listen to a wide range of advice, and have learnt much from opinions voiced about the Bank and forwarded to me not only from members of the society but also from other academics both at home and abroad. At the same time, I am afraid that I must admit to feeling a certain degree of frustration, in the light of my long years of experience as a central banker, as I listen to some of the opinions. I cannot help but feel that there is still significant progress to be made in establishing a creative process whereby the Bank first provides academics with sufficient information about the issues it is facing, and then works together with them based on the same information in its search for fresh policy solutions. 
 BIS Review 29/2003 3 We are fortunate to have among the current nine members of the Policy Board three members who have spent a number of years in senior academic positions. In addition, there are an increasing number of former Bank staff currently working at academic institutions and devoting their efforts to bridging the gap between theory and practical policy. With their help, we expect to be able to extend our links with the academic world, thus not only gaining the benefit of academics(cid:146) advice but also contributing to their research by sharing our practical experiences. This has been a somewhat protracted introduction. My aim today, however, is to share with you, as frankly as possible, my own current thinking with regard to the conduct of monetary policy, which I hope will be of interest to you. I hope also that my remarks will play a part in further strengthening the constructive relationship that already exists between academics and the central bank. I. Functions of the quantitative easing framework First, I would like to briefly explain the basic framework underlying current monetary policy and to describe how monetary policy measures have been implemented within this framework. The current framework we are adopting is called quantitative easing and was introduced on March 19, 2001. It has three main features. I will explain the implications of each point in as contemporary a context as possible. A. Adoption of quantitative indicators in money market operations The first feature of the quantitative easing framework is the change in the operating target for money market operations from the uncollateralized overnight call rate to the outstanding balance of current account deposits at the Bank. Whether it is possible to enhance monetary easing effects even after short-term interest rates reach the zero bound is a major issue that continues to attract debate. Still, it was quite natural for a central bank to pay attention to the amount of liquidity provision and expect effects from a further increase in liquidity provision even when short-term interest rates had fallen to zero percent, or rather for the very reason that they had reached this zero bound. When the quantitative easing framework was introduced in March 2001, the target for the outstanding balance of current account deposits at the Bank was 5 trillion yen, which exceeded the total reserve requirement at the time by slightly less than 1 trillion yen. When I took office as Governor, the target range for the outstanding balance had already been set at (cid:147)around 17 to 22 trillion yen,(cid:148) and the Bank has since steadily raised it. At the MPM on April 30, the Bank raised the range by 5 trillion yen to (cid:147)around 22 to 27 trillion yen,(cid:148) and then again to (cid:147)around 27 to 30 trillion yen(cid:148) at the MPM on May 20. As a result, the outstanding balance has increased sixfold over the course of the last two years. The Bank(cid:146)s repeated raising of the target for the outstanding balance was decided in view of the economic outlook and the financial market situation. As mentioned in the Bank(cid:146)s (cid:147)Outlook and Risk Assessment of the Economy and Prices,(cid:148) released in April, monetary easing measures have effectively blocked the channels through which various shocks induce liquidity concerns, and have thereby secured financial market stability, helping to prevent the economy from falling into a deflationary spiral. On the other hand, it should also be pointed out that, even though the outstanding balance of current account deposits has increased considerably since the introduction of the quantitative easing framework, the Bank(cid:146)s drastic quantitative easing has not been quite strong enough by itself to boost the economy and prices. Why is this so? It may have been because the adjustment pressure on the economy was, and is, still quite strong. However, one of the effects expected from the introduction of quantitative easing was the so-called (cid:147)portfolio rebalancing effect.(cid:148) The Bank thought that, even when the marginal value of liquidity services became zero, people would start to rebalance their portfolios by investing in assets with higher marginal values whether these were real or financial assets, if the Bank increased further its provision of liquidity. The aim of this process was thus to generate positive economic momentum, acting, for example, to push up asset prices. So far, however, the effect has not been widely observed. It might also be fair to touch upon the issue of the decline in the functioning of financial markets, especially the money market, since the introduction of the quantitative easing framework. With zero interest rates, money market participants have been less willing to invest their funds in the market, because returns from such transactions have not been sufficient to cover their trading costs. Due to the Bank(cid:146)s ample provision of liquidity, there has been a sharp decrease in trading volume among 
 4 BIS Review 29/2003 market participants, with the exception of trading carried out with the Bank. As a result, more market participants have become concerned about whether they will be able to raise funds in the market smoothly in the future even if they offer higher interest rates. Ironically, the decline in the functioning of the money market has increased the precautionary demand of financial institutions for increased current account deposits at the Bank. At the time of the introduction of the quantitative easing framework, there were doubts about whether the Bank would be able to provide sufficient liquidity to achieve its target for the outstanding balance. In fact there were frequent cases of undersubscription, where bids fall short of the Bank(cid:146)s offers, in the Bank(cid:146)s funds-supplying operations. However, such undersubscription has not occurred recently, and the Bank has been able to push through substantial increases in its target for the outstanding balance of current account deposits. The more the Bank proceeds with monetary easing to secure financial market stability, the more demand for current account deposits increases due to the impaired functioning of the market. As a result, the Bank will have to meet this increased liquidity demand in order to secure market stability. This is the dilemma the Bank currently faces. All drastic policy measures have negative side effects. The fundamental issue, therefore, is not whether such side effects exist; rather, it is how to make effective use of the stimulative effects of quantitative easing measures on the economy and prices, while giving due consideration to the possible emergence of excessive side effects. Before we move on to deal with this point in more depth, I would like to comment on the remaining two features of the quantitative easing framework. B. Increasing the Bank(cid:146)s outright purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) The second feature of the quantitative easing framework is the decision to increase the Bank(cid:146)s outright purchases of JGBs when this is deemed necessary for the smooth provision of funds to meet the target balance of current account deposits at the Bank. At the same time, there is a ceiling on the Bank(cid:146)s outright purchases of JGBs which prevents the amount of JGBs held by the Bank from exceeding the outstanding amount of banknotes issued. With interest rates on financing bills (FBs) and treasury bills (TBs) close to zero, there emerged a situation for holders of FBs and TBs similar to holding the equivalent amount of current account deposits at the Bank. For this reason, it is likely that the demand for holding current account deposits by selling FBs and TBs will become saturated. Realizing this, the Bank decided to secure smooth provision of liquidity by purchasing JGBs. The effect of these increased purchases of JGBs has been to raise total purchases by the Bank to 1.2 trillion yen per month, up from 400 billion yen until March 2001. As a result, the outstanding amount of JGBs purchased by the Bank is at present equivalent to roughly 60 percent of the monetary base. The Bank(cid:146)s purchases of JGBs have indeed contributed to the smooth implementation of quantitative easing. However, as long-term interest rates have been declining, even JGBs have almost become substitutes for current account deposits at the Bank. At present, ten-year JGBs have fallen to slightly above 0.5 percent and even 30-year JGBs are below 1.0 percent. The average maturity of newly issued JGBs in Japan is currently about five years. The fact that yields on five-year JGBs are in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 percent indicates that the government has already been raising funds at an interest rate of virtually zero percent. Thus, the Bank(cid:146)s execution of a market operation that involves exchanging JGBs for current account deposits at the Bank is becoming equivalent to exchanging ten 1,000 yen notes for one 10,000 yen note. In opposition to this view, there is an argument that, as long as long-term interest rates are not in fact zero percent, there is still a difference between current account deposits at the Bank and JGBs. The corollary is that market operations involving the exchange of JGBs for current account deposits are indeed meaningful, and a massive large-scale purchase of JGBs by the Bank would be effective. There is also an argument that it is inappropriate to allow long-term interest rates to decline any closer to zero percent. According to this view, the Bank should enhance the effects of quantitative easing not merely by increasing quantity but also by introducing qualitative improvement of quantitative easing measures through the purchase of other types of assets. C. Policy commitment based on the consumer price index (CPI) The third feature of the quantitative easing framework is the Bank(cid:146)s explicit commitment based on the year-on-year growth rate of the CPI: namely that the Bank will maintain the current framework for 
 BIS Review 29/2003 5 money market operations until the CPI (excluding fresh food, on a nationwide basis) records a year-on-year increase of zero percent or more on a sustainable basis. The idea of the first feature, as I have already explained, is to achieve further increases in the Bank(cid:146)s provision of liquidity even after short-term interest rates have reached the zero bound. The idea of the third feature is to achieve an easing effect by the Bank(cid:146)s commitment to keep short-term rates at low levels well into the future. In this way, even if short-term rates come up against the lower bound, the Bank can still (cid:147)borrow(cid:148) from the effect of the future low rates. Thus, the fundamental aim of the third feature is to lower longer-term interest rates across the board by (cid:147)borrowing(cid:148) future monetary easing through the commitment. This policy commitment shows the Bank(cid:146)s determination to put a stop to price declines by binding future monetary policy to the actual inflation rate. However, this should not be misunderstood as inflation targeting. I am fully aware of views that the Bank should adopt inflation targeting instead of the current commitment. However, it should be noted that, in a sense, this commitment has significant implications that go beyond those of standard inflation targeting. In a standard inflation targeting regime, a central bank raises the policy interest rate when the expected inflation rate rises above the target inflation rate, even if the actual inflation rate is considerably below the target inflation rate. Given that people(cid:146)s expectations regarding the inflation rate vary greatly, it may be inevitable that even a slight change in prices triggers speculations at a very early stage about future monetary policy. In contrast, the Bank(cid:146)s policy commitment states that the Bank will continue to implement drastic quantitative easing until the year-on-year change in the CPI, that is, the change in actual prices, becomes positive. In other words, this policy commitment means that, unless year-on-year changes in the CPI become positive on a sustainable basis, the Bank will continue to implement drastic monetary easing measures even after the economy has started to improve and inflationary expectations are emerging. This is thus an extremely strong policy commitment through which the Bank is implicitly (cid:147)borrowing(cid:148) from the effects of future monetary easing. The Bank(cid:146)s strong policy commitment, which has (cid:147)borrowed(cid:148) the effects of low future interest rates and kept long-term interest rates stable at low levels, can be said to have succeeded in keeping real interest rates low enough to prevent the economy, which has been suffering from deflation, from falling into a deflationary spiral. However, the potential growth rate of the economy and the marginal productivity of capital have declined, causing firms to revise downward their forecasts for the GDP growth rate and remain cautious in investing. In accordance with the relationship between the natural and market interest rates defined by Knut Wicksell, while the natural interest rate has been quite low, the market interest rate has continued to be high relative to the natural interest rate, and thus seems to have failed to boost economic activity. Thus, there still remain many issues that must be resolved for the current framework of quantitative easing to become more effective. It is also true, as I mentioned earlier, that monetary easing measures have effectively blocked the channels through which various shocks induce liquidity concerns, and have thereby secured financial market stability, contributing to preventing the economy from falling into a deflationary spiral. The effects of quantitative easing measures should therefore not be underestimated. In 1997-98, the financial crisis in Asia and the failure of a few large Japanese financial institutions triggered concerns among financial institutions about the availability of liquidity, and as a result, there was a sharp credit contraction and the economy deteriorated rapidly. In contrast, although there have been factors causing uncertainty about the Japanese financial system, such as the terrorist attacks in the United States, the military action against Iraq, and the decline in Japanese stock prices, credit contraction stemming from liquidity concerns has not occurred since the introduction of the quantitative easing framework. And thus, any deterioration of the economy that such a contraction might have caused has been avoided. As described above, even after short-term interest rates had reached the zero bound, the Bank did not throw up its hands in defeat but rather continued to make efforts by providing ample liquidity and (cid:147)borrowing(cid:148) from the effects of future monetary easing. At present, Japanese financial institutions are still in the process of improving their soundness, and with the globalization of the economy, progress in IT, an extremely rapidly aging society, and an equally rapidly declining birthrate, the economy faces major structural changes. The people of the entire country are struggling to find ways to overcome the difficulties in this unprecedented process of transition. In such a situation, it is natural for the public to have high expectations of the country(cid:146)s 
 6 BIS Review 29/2003 central bank. In order to meet these expectations, I am adamant in my determination to duck no challenges, but to put all my knowledge and experience into overcoming these difficulties. II. Issues on further improvements in monetary policy In order to further improve monetary policy, I think it is important to address various issues related to monetary policy and to discuss them thoroughly. Some of these issues may fall within the scope of conventional economic analysis and may thus be dealt with using the appropriate analytical tools. Other issues, such as defining the purview of the central bank and addressing its position within a democratic society, may however fall outside the scope of conventional economic analysis. Keeping these points in mind, I would like to elaborate in what follows on some issues which need to be clarified with regard to the Bank(cid:146)s efforts to improve the current quantitative easing framework. Currently, a variety of views are held by people outside the Bank requesting further monetary easing measures. Some of these views are as follows. One view holds that, if the effect of the quantitative easing on the economy and prices is not fairly strong, the Bank should increase the provision of liquidity significantly. This view recommends that, in doing so, the Bank consider the option of purchasing financial assets whose risk profiles differ from JGBs, and which are not, under normal circumstances, the object of central bank purchases. Another view proposes that the Bank seek to exert stronger pressure on public expectations by fundamentally changing the structure of its current policy commitments. A. Changes in the structure of policy commitments I would like to start this section by discussing possible changes in the structure of the Bank(cid:146)s policy commitments. Here, clearly, the focus of attention must be whether to adopt inflation targeting. As I have already mentioned, by comparison with current policy commitments, one of the problems of adopting inflation targeting is as follows. Assuming that a target has been established (for example, at 2 percent), if the expected inflation rate rises above the target and the Bank does not start tightening at that early stage, the actual inflation rate is likely to go beyond the target. Since the Bank(cid:146)s current policy commitments do not assume such a tightening at an early stage, they actually run a risk in the direction of greater inflation than in the case of standard inflation targeting. Therefore, the following issues become very important: whether it is truly desirable at this particular juncture to exchange the current policy commitment for one that might require an earlier and more forceful tightening of monetary policy by setting a target; or whether the Bank should allow a temporary overshooting of the inflation rate; and in either situation, how the Bank would be able to restabilize the expected inflation rate. When setting an inflation target, either as a certain range or a level of the inflation rate, the Bank would aim to achieve this target within a specified period, although there would be allowance for some slippage. Clearly a prerequisite for such a policy to be convincing to the public is that the Bank is at least reasonably, if not absolutely, confident that it has at its disposal the policy tools necessary to achieve its goal. In this regard, there are those who maintain that the Bank need only boldly commit itself to taking any unconventional policy measures necessary to achieve the inflation target. Indeed, some economists seem to have formed a critical view that it is the Bank(cid:146)s own skepticism about the effectiveness of its monetary policy which is preventing it from hammering out a more forceful commitment and from having a more potent influence on the public(cid:146)s expectations. However, having had their expectations that the economy would return to a sustainable growth path left unfulfilled so often since the bursting of the asset price bubble, people in Japan are not so naive as to trust unconditionally the mere announcement of an inflation targeting policy by the Bank; nor indeed would the rest of the economy respond by taking an immediate turn for the better. Unless Japan(cid:146)s economy benefits from positive external factors such as a surge in foreign demand, a policy announcement by the Bank aimed at influencing public expectations will become effective only after the Bank has successfully demonstrated that an effective transmission mechanism exists between the Bank(cid:146)s policy and an actual stimulative effect on economic growth. Therefore, it is important for the Bank not only to pursue further monetary easing, but also to devise and implement a variety of policy measures which contribute directly to improving the transmission mechanism. The Bank is fully aware that inflation targeting enjoys relatively wide support among academics, and that many central banks have adopted inflation targets of one kind or another. It has become one of 
 BIS Review 29/2003 7 the important policy tools for central banks to enhance transparency. In that sense, I have no intention of flatly denying the concept behind the policy measures related to inflation targeting. I would like to examine, in the process of reviewing how to make full use of the monetary easing policy in the future, whether we can reorganize the policy framework of the Bank, and whether there will be any room for introducing such a tool as inflation targeting within that framework. I cannot predict honestly what results will be produced by this wide-ranging discussion, or when. B. Additional measures to encourage the effects of monetary easing to permeate through the economy The fundamental policy issue confronting the Bank is what exactly it can and should do in order to encourage the effects of monetary easing to permeate through the economy. The Bank(cid:146)s quantitative easing policy, by providing ample liquidity in the form of the current account balance at the Bank, aims at improving the overall financial environment for firms and households, and thus at stimulating the economy. If the current quantitative easing does not have a strong effect on the economy, this can be interpreted as follows. The transmission mechanism between the Bank(cid:146)s ample provision of liquidity and the stimulative effect on firms and households is not functioning properly. To put it another way, the liquidity provided by the Bank is circulating within the financial sector and not flowing out of it, or the stimulative effect of low interest rates is not working in such a way as to permeate through the economy. This phenomenon of a choked or blocked channel in financing is closely related to the fact that the financial institutions(cid:146) credit intermediary function is deteriorating due to the nonperforming-loan problem. The most important issue in making the effects of the monetary easing permeate through the economy is to actively support financial institutions(cid:146) efforts to reestablish their soundness. At the same time, the Bank believes it is necessary also to apply itself on a second, parallel policy front, exercising its ingenuity in devising its own measures in the area of money market operations and corporate financing. As you are all aware, at the MPM held in early April 2003 the Bank decided to start examining a new scheme to promote smooth corporate financing by nurturing the asset-backed securities (ABSs) market. The Bank(cid:146)s initiative in this regard is unprecedented in the sense that it will be purchasing ABSs, which are private debts, outright and thus stepping into the realm of credit risk. ABSs possess a number of advantageous characteristics. By pooling risks, they act to reduce the overall level of credit risk, relative to the sum of the individual risks. In addition, by restructuring the overall risk into multiple layers representing different degrees of risk, they can also attract investors who have a variety of different risk preferences. Indeed, the rationale behind the Bank(cid:146)s decision to examine the feasibility of ABS purchases is as follows. Given the current situation in which financial institutions are performing their credit intermediation function only imperfectly, if the Bank can succeed in making use of these features produced by the process of financial innovation, it will be able to promote the interaction between market-based financing and bank lending. And thus it will contribute to establishing a new channel for smooth corporate financing for firms, especially small and medium-sized firms. Some people argue that the Bank should not restrict its purchases to ABSs but should also boldly purchase a wide range of assets such as those related to stocks and real estate, breaking with the traditional framework. The Bank, of course, is always ready to give serious consideration to any measure that might help bring the economy back to a sustainable growth path. Having said this, I would therefore like now to discuss some of the possible perspectives and criteria important in considering what kind of assets the Bank should and should not purchase. The first criterion, which may overlap somewhat with what I have mentioned earlier, is whether the Bank(cid:146)s purchases of a particular type of asset will help the monetary easing effects to permeate through the real economy; and whether such a purchase offers any actual improvement over the existing transmission mechanism. The second criterion is related to whether the Bank(cid:146)s purchases might distort the market mechanism. If the Bank(cid:146)s decision to take on credit risk, as described above, ends up distorting market evaluations of prices and weakening the reflection of risk contained in credit spreads, the supply of credit will not increase and the effectiveness of monetary easing will suffer as a result. If the Bank dares to take on risk by purchasing new types of assets, it is most desirable that the Bank(cid:146)s initiative becomes a catalyst in enhancing the development of the market. 
 8 BIS Review 29/2003 The background of seeking public comment in examining possible purchases of ABSs by the Bank is that we felt it was important to find a way of participating in this market so that the Bank(cid:146)s initiative does not distort the price-discovery function of the market and also enhances the development of the market. Now that we have received many valuable comments from market participants, we are working on the concrete plan of the scheme, referring to those comments. C. Role of capital for the central bank I have been discussing how the Bank may be about to expose itself to credit risk by implementing a new measure in starting ABS purchases. The corollary of such a step is the possibility that the Bank might incur a capital loss. Given the current severe economic and financial situation, when the Bank started to purchase stocks held by banks, it was determined to take any measures, even highly risky ones unthinkable under conventional conditions, if and when they were absolutely necessary to fulfil its mandate. At the same time, we set a principle of limiting the Bank(cid:146)s risk exposure to the level at which it does not impair the Bank(cid:146)s financial soundness. The Bank gave due consideration to the principle when it decided the stock-purchasing plan, and will also apply the principle in drawing concrete plans of the framework for ABS purchases, particularly in assessing risks. I would like to consider in more detail the subject of a central bank(cid:146)s financial soundness, particularly the role of its capital. I am aware that there are those who do not fully understand, from an economic perspective, why the central bank should be concerned about the soundness of its capital base. It is, after all, reasonable to assume that, unlike ordinary commercial banks, central banks can continue their operations and avoid bankruptcy, even in the face of insolvency, since they have the authority to issue banknotes. So how can we explain this observation consistently with the fact that most central banks are exerting themselves to maintain substantial capital holdings? Also, how can we explain cases in developing countries where a country(cid:146)s central bank has fallen into excessive debt on a grand scale, and until its capital position was properly restored, its ability to conduct monetary policy was greatly damaged in practice, even though this phenomenon is not predicted in theory? The above cases of actual behavior of some central banks indicate that central banks(cid:146) concern with the soundness of their capital base might not be grounded purely in economic theory but may be motivated rather by the political economic instincts of central bankers. In other words, once the restriction that (cid:147)the central bank should only take risks consistent with the level of its self-imposed capital base(cid:148) is violated, the boundary between the functions of the central bank and those of the government may become difficult to discern. Consider a case where, for whatever reason, a central bank(cid:146)s capital becomes depleted, and the bank requires financial support from the government. The central bank might either run into difficulties in conducting its policy and other business operations or might cause the view to spread that it will, and eventually it will become difficult to maintain public confidence in the currency. This argument brings us to the fundamental issue of how the central bank should function in a democratic society. There are two problems pertaining to a central bank(cid:146)s significant risk-taking activity of purchasing risk-bearing assets. The first is that it might potentially incur losses, and the burden of this would effectively be transferred to the public through reductions in payments to the national treasury, or, in the worst-case scenario, through injections of public funds to restore the balance sheet of the central bank. The second problem is that such purchases, depending on the central bank(cid:146)s selection of assets, would inevitably affect the allocation of resources at the microeconomic level. Both problems lead us to the question of the role of a central bank, whether it should approach the territory of fiscal policy. The basic principle underlying the determination of how tax revenue should be spent in a democratic nation is as follows: expenditure should be carried out through fiscal policy, following formal approval of the government budget by the Parliament. If resources are to be allocated outside the market mechanism as part of economic policy, it is the government that should take the initiative, not the central bank. The purchase of risk-bearing assets by the central bank should therefore be very carefully planned and conducted with discipline. Drawing a clear line on such issues is a difficult task. In practice, monetary policy cannot be conducted with any great degree of flexibility and the central bank can only purchase FBs and TBs when there is 
 BIS Review 29/2003 9 a strict rule preventing it from taking on any risk, because to do so would involve stepping into the territory of fiscal policy. This is the reason why a more feasible practice has been adopted in many countries whereby the central bank reserves the ability to act flexibly within the level of the risk consistent with maintaining an adequate level of capital in the relatively long term. If the public allows the central bank to take on a certain level of risk within the context of flexible monetary policy, then it would be appropriate for the public to support the risk-taking behavior of the central bank by restoring its capital base should the latter be damaged as a result of taking risks. In such a way, the balance between democracy and a central bank(cid:146)s flexibility in conducting its monetary policy could be maintained. Concluding remarks When I attended the society(cid:146)s meeting ten years ago, I concluded my remarks by citing a famous statement by John Maynard Keynes which runs as follows: (cid:147)There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency.(cid:148) I commented on the quotation that (cid:147)these words have often been used to describe the evils of inflation and have come to find general acceptance. Yet, I believe that the statement should also be understood to connote the stability of the financial system. I believe that money is truly capable of functioning as the social and economic lifeblood of a country when its value is properly maintained through monetary policy, and also when smooth functioning of the payment and settlement systems is fully ensured.(cid:148) I still believe in the truth of what I said. I must add here that there is another aspect to the maintenance of price stability that requires particular attention today. That is the necessity of confronting deflation, the new enemy with whom we at the central bank must now engage, and I believe that this should be of equal importance to fighting inflation. Neither macroeconomics nor finance textbooks have yet managed to provide a practical solution to the problems related to the deflation with which we are now faced. On the other hand, the latest research in the United States has started to produce useful theoretical analyses of the fundamental effects of monetary and fiscal policies under the zero interest rate constraint, one of the issues the Bank has been tackling in the last few years. This is an area of study in which we are eagerly awaiting progress. I also believe that the Bank(cid:146)s deflation-fighting experiences will add important chapters to finance textbooks in the 21st century. 
 BIS Review 29/2003 1 David Dodge: Recent economic developments and the conduct of monetary policy Speech by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Metropolitan Halifax Chamber of Commerce, Halifax, 18 June 2003. *      *      * Good afternoon, and thank you for the invitation to speak with you today. It(cid:146)s great to be back in Halifax, one of Canada(cid:146)s most colourful port cities. It is the wonderful juxtaposition of the new with the old - Halifax(cid:146)s modern focus with its rich maritime traditions - that makes this city special. It(cid:146)s been a year since I last spoke in Halifax, and a lot has changed since then. We(cid:146)ve witnessed some extraordinary events, both in Canada and around the world. On the whole, Canada(cid:146)s economy has withstood the turmoil quite well. The impact of some more recent events is not yet clear. Still, I will try today to outline how our economy has evolved over the past year and to lay out the issues that we(cid:146)ll be assessing as we prepare our July Monetary Policy Report Update. Watching conditions and demand pressures As we at the Bank of Canada set monetary policy, we watch all the events affecting our economy, including global geopolitical, economic, and financial conditions. We do this with a view to keeping domestic inflation near the 2 per cent midpoint of Canada(cid:146)s inflation target range of 1 to 3 per cent. As we have often said, delivering an environment of low, stable, and predictable inflation is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to a strong, sustainable economy and rising living standards for Canadians. Such a low-inflation environment also helps keep our economy near its production potential over time. To achieve those goals, we keep a close eye on the factors influencing demand and production capacity - factors that will, in turn, influence inflation over the medium term. And we adjust monetary policy to keep the future trend of inflation near the 2 per cent target midpoint. Where we(cid:146)ve been As I(cid:146)ve said, it(cid:146)s been a year since I last spoke in Halifax. But to place our recent experience in some context, I should go back a bit further than that - to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. In the wake of that terrible event, the Bank of Canada quickly and aggressively cut its policy interest rate to shore up confidence and support domestic demand. This action, together with earlier reductions in our policy interest rate, meant that the Bank had injected considerable stimulus into the economy. By the spring of 2002, evidence had already started to build that demand was recovering more quickly than had been anticipated. So, even though demand pressures were not yet showing up in prices, we began to remove some of that monetary stimulus. We raised our key policy interest rate three times between April and July 2002, by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point. By last autumn, inflation in Canada was on the rise. But we refrained from raising interest rates any further at the time, because we judged that the pickup in inflation was mainly the result of one-off factors and would be reversed over the next year or so. As well, there was considerable geopolitical and financial uncertainty, which, combined with global economic weakness, pointed to restrained total demand for Canadian goods and services. Through the first quarter of this year, CPI inflation climbed well above the 2 per cent target. Much of the rise was the result of higher energy prices. We also saw a marked increase in our measure of core inflation, which strips out the eight most volatile items - including gasoline, heating oil, and natural gas - from the CPI basket, as well as the effect of changes in indirect taxes on the remaining CPI components. The rise in core inflation was exacerbated by further increases in automobile insurance premiums. But even allowing for the unusual and extraordinarily large increases in insurance premiums, inflation was well above target. This suggested that strong domestic demand was putting pressure on production capacity. In this environment, some indicators of short-term inflation expectations edged up, although longer-term expectations remained around 2 per cent. 
 2 BIS Review 29/2003 In view of these inflation developments, the momentum of domestic demand, the narrowing of interest rate spreads in credit markets, and diminishing geopolitical uncertainty, we raised our target overnight rate by 25 basis points in March and again in mid-April - bringing it to 3.25 per cent. In our April Monetary Policy Report, we stated that the risks confronting the world economy appeared to be more evenly balanced than they had been in the autumn. The Canadian economy was projected to strengthen appreciably towards the end of 2003 and to grow somewhat above its production potential during 2004, thanks to a pickup in economic activity in the United States and further improvements in business and consumer confidence. We concluded in April that although growth would likely remain somewhat below potential in Canada for the first three quarters of this year, most of the small amount of economic slack that would open up this year would have closed by the end of 2004. We projected that core inflation would likely fall to about 2 1/2 per cent in the second half of this year and to about 2 per cent by early 2004 as some of the special factors pushing up inflation ran their course. We also pointed out that total CPI inflation would continue to be importantly affected by swings in crude oil prices and that it would likely fall temporarily below the core rate in the first half of 2004 before steadying out at a rate close to core inflation. Factors influencing monetary policy In the April Monetary Policy Report, we listed a number of factors that we intended to watch closely as we set monetary policy. These factors are the pace of economic expansion in the United States and overseas, the strength of domestic demand, financial market conditions, and the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. So, let me review how we have seen these factors evolving. I(cid:146)ll start with the external environment. In Europe, domestic demand and economic growth have continued to disappoint. Japan(cid:146)s economy has also remained weak. While demand growth in the rest of Asia has been strong, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is clearly going to slow growth in some countries. In the United States, domestic demand has not been recovering as quickly as expected, which has negative implications for Canadian exports, at least over the short term. Consumer spending continues to underpin economic activity in that country. However, business fixed investment has not yet picked up. Expectations as to when the U.S. recovery will occur have been pushed back until late this year when confidence levels should improve, and when the impact of very expansionary monetary and fiscal policies should begin to be fully felt. Now, let(cid:146)s turn to the second factor - domestic demand in Canada. On the whole, demand has remained quite strong, supported by a healthy employment market, low interest rates, and a recovery in corporate profits. While growth in consumer spending slowed slightly in the first quarter, it was still quite strong, especially on housing. Governments and businesses both increased their spending. As a result of strong domestic demand, gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of almost 2 1/2 per cent in the first quarter, up from about 1 1/2 per cent in the final quarter of 2002. In Nova Scotia, we are seeing some fall-off in consumer spending. Business investment prospects have also been dampened by the postponement of natural gas projects. Still, most forecasters predict Nova Scotia(cid:146)s economy will continue to grow at the Canadian average rate this year. A third factor on our watch list is the evolution of conditions in financial markets. Last autumn, we witnessed sharp increases in risk premiums because of uncertainty in financial markets. In recent months, these risk premiums have declined, and conditions in both debt and equity markets continue to improve. This reflects reduced uncertainty and bodes well for business spending going forward. Before moving on to the fourth factor, I(cid:146)d like to mention several developments since April that have implications for the economic outlook. Together, these developments point to near-term growth in Canada that will be lower than we expected at the time of our April Monetary Policy Report. SARS is having a significant impact on the hospitality industry, not just in Toronto, but across the country - including here in Atlantic Canada. More recently, the closure of export markets because of the discovery in Alberta of an isolated case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) is having an impact on the beef and beef-processing industry. And, of course, problems in several important East Coast fisheries are affecting employment and production in this region. 
 BIS Review 29/2003 3 As you well know, since mid-April there has also been a further sharp adjustment in the value of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, including ours. The magnitude and speed of the Canadian dollar(cid:146)s rise has been greater than anyone had anticipated and will have a dampening influence on aggregate demand later this year and next. We are working to understand all the factors behind these exchange rate movements. In setting monetary policy, we have to take into account the effects on aggregate demand of these factors, as well as the effect of the exchange rate movements themselves. Exchange rate movements also have a direct effect on the prices of traded goods and services and, therefore, on inflation. However, our research has shown that, in economies such as Canada(cid:146)s, the effect of exchange rate movements on consumer prices has been less pronounced in recent years, when inflation was relatively low, than was the case in earlier years when inflation was high. The inflation picture This leads me to the fourth factor that we watch closely in setting monetary policy(cid:151)the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. Let me start with inflation. In the 3 June press release that announced our latest interest rate decision, we pointed out that inflation has declined more than expected. Some of this decline is due to transitory factors, most notably, the rebate on electricity prices in Ontario. Thus, we expect some temporary rebound in core inflation in the coming months, as these factors unwind. Nevertheless, it now appears that both core and total CPI inflation will return to the 2 per cent target somewhat earlier than the Bank had anticipated in April. This is, in part, because of some near-term softness in demand. Also, the appreciation of the Canadian dollar will somewhat dampen the rise in total CPI, although it is not expected to have as large a direct effect on core CPI. Now, a word on inflation expectations. As I mentioned, we were concerned in April that the sharp rise in CPI inflation last winter was starting to push up Canadians(cid:146) expectations of inflation. The recent easing in inflation is likely to act as a moderating influence on those expectations. We will be seeking evidence of this in our regular survey of businesses prior to our next fixed announcement date. ********************** Let me sum up. Today, I have outlined some of the recent developments that will influence the demand for Canadian goods and services. They include continuing weakness in the U.S. and global economies, and concerns about the economic impact of SARS and BSE. These developments likely mean a very weak second quarter and point to some continuing softness in the Canadian economy in the third quarter. Looking forward, it remains our view that growth in Canada(cid:146)s economy will be underpinned by the strength of domestic demand and a rebound in the U.S. economy towards the end of 2003 and through 2004. However, the appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, which is an outcome of various influences at work in both the Canadian and global economies, will be a factor influencing aggregate demand. We will provide Canadians with a more considered and complete picture of our views on the economy in our next Monetary Policy Report Update, which will be published on 17 July. Ladies and gentlemen, Halifax is a city that has withstood some extraordinary events in its long history. The Canadian economy, too, has been buffeted by some remarkable winds this year - some fair and some foul. But we have weathered them well, and I believe we will continue to do so. I can assure you that the Bank of Canada will continue to provide monetary policy that contributes to a strong, stable, and sustainable economy. 
 BIS Review 28/2003 1 Niklaus Blattner: The financial system and the regulatory challenges in securities clearing and settlement systems Speech by Prof Dr Niklaus Blattner, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank. at the Seventh Conference of Central Securities Depositories, Lucerne, 12 June 2003. The references for the speech can be found on the Swiss National Bank's website. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen I would like to talk to you about some basic issues and some regulatory and oversight challenges in securities clearing and settlement systems. Judging by the growing number of reports, the way your industry performs has been closely scrutinised over the last few years. Considering, for example, the G-30 Report on Global Clearing and Settlement or the second Giovannini Report, it strikes me that the emphasis has not only been put on the identification of potential difficulties and issues. In addition, responsibilities to resolve these difficulties are assigned and timetables are established. The debate has thus gained a new dimension. I shall start from a rather academic perspective, but nevertheless please count on my devotion to a number of very practical issues. I shall first discuss one of the basic functions of a financial system, which is the provision of clearing and settlement services, and its contribution to welfare. However, as we live in a less than perfect world, I shall focus on a number of important imperfections that tend to affect the smooth functioning of a financial system. Then, since these imperfections shape the responsibilities and interventions of the regulatory and oversight authorities including central banks I shall deal with the nature of oversight. Finally I shall turn to a number of contemporary challenges that regulatory and oversight authorities face in the field of securities clearing and settlement systems. 1. The provision of clearing and settlement services by the financial system and its contribution to welfare What is the basic role of a financial system? In my context a financial system can be understood as a set of instruments, of markets and of institutions. Following Merton and Bodie (1995) the primary role of the financial system is “to facilitate the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both across borders and time, in an uncertain environment”. In other words a financial system can be understood as the dynamic response of institutions and processes to changing imperfections such as information and transaction costs. From a practical point of view a financial system is meant to provide for the allocation of economic resources to productive investment opportunities, the trading of risks, the collecting and processing of information. Prominently this also includes the provision of clearing and settlement services. Let me concentrate on the latter, i.e. on the provision of clearing and settlement services. There is no doubt that Central Securities Depositories (CSDs), International Central Securities Depositories (ICSDs) and Central Counterparties (CCPs) are among the crucial building blocks of any well-organised financial system. They facilitate the allocation of resources and their deployment within a financial system by reducing risk and transaction costs. By facilitating market exchange of complex financial services they can be taken as a means to achieve efficiency gains within a financial system. Various mechanisms are provided to clear and settle securities transactions. Common features of these mechanisms are, e.g., that they provide for a technical infrastructure to exchange payment and settlement instructions and that they rely on commonly agreed rules and processes. There is widespread agreement that these mechanisms have been fairly successful in reducing settlement risks and transaction costs. With respect to the business activities of market utilities I can mention, e.g., the dematerialization and immobilisation of securities or the increasingly pervasive application of the delivery-versus-payment principle. In essence the clearing and settlement function provided in a financial system contributes to the reduction of imperfections and thereby makes possible increasingly more integrated and efficient 
 2 BIS Review 28/2003 economic systems. This improvement, in turn, facilitates capital accumulation and technological innovation that underlie the implementation of investment projects. Thereby a long-term economic growth process is supported and, correspondingly, welfare is improved. Let me state the obvious with Levine (1997): “the development of financial markets and institutions is a critical and inextricable part of the growth process […]”.  However, despite the tremendous efficiency gains obtained through the emergence of the financial system, the improvement process is far from being over. In reality there continue to remain some important imperfections, which have always been with us and which tend to re-emerge in a new shape whenever measures are taken to eliminate them. I would now like to discuss some of these imperfections and their implications for your industry. 2. Some imperfections of the financial system Among the imperfections that affect the smooth functioning of a financial system I shall focus on asymmetric information, on negative externalities and on limited competition.  A first imperfection that typically impairs the smooth functioning of a financial system is asymmetric information (Mishkin, 1997). Indeed, information may not be universally or commonly shared within the financial system. Differences in information endowment – another way to define asymmetric information – are likely to lead to differing behaviour by different classes of agents. This will have an impact on price formation and will affect market exchange.  The first example is known as adverse selection and derives from Akerlof’s seminal contribution on the market for “lemons” (1970). For those of us who are not native English speakers: In colloquial English a lemon is a good of very low quality. What is going on in a market for “lemons”? According to Akerlof the seller knows the intrinsic quality of the good or services supplied, while the buyer has no means of knowing it. The buyer will then be ready to pay a price reflecting an average quality. However, since the price of the high quality good or services lies above that average price the seller who has high quality items will withdraw from the market. Therefore only a market for medium and low quality goods will emerge. Consequently most buyers will be disappointed and the high quality suppliers will be frustrated. Ultimately this might even lead to an extinction of the market for those goods and services the quality of which cannot be correctly assessed by buyers. To eliminate this breakdown of market exchange due to adverse selection quality screening is required. Market utilities such as CSDs, ICSDs or CCPs contribute to soften the problem of adverse selection. Indeed, these utilities may monitor their participants by defining financial and technical criteria to be met permanently. This ensures a certain quality of the participants. For example I may refer to Central Counterparties who have long recognised the value-added of such a monitoring function. As you know, CCPs replace numerous bilateral counterparty risks that market participants face through a single counterparty risk towards itself. This transfer of risk tends to be efficient since the CCP is best positioned to monitor the risks of all the participants of the system. Another means to soften the problem of adverse selection is the provision of delivery-versus-payment mechanisms since they eliminate principal risk in securities settlement. All in all, market utilities that ensure a certain minimum quality of the participants and reduce principal risk contribute to limiting the damage of adverse selection. The second example based on asymmetric information is moral hazard. While adverse selection stands in the way of the closure of deals, moral hazard occurs after a contract was concluded. If these contracts are insufficiently structured counterparties have an incentive to adopt a behaviour which is undesirable to their partners. Moral hazard thus refers to the negative effects of the behaviour of the contract-taker on the contract-issuer. The textbook example here is the one where the holder of a fire insurance contract does not take enough precautions to prevent the outbreak of a fire since he trusts in the insurer’s cover. Only by introducing a certain degree of co-insurance in the contract can these negative effects on the contracting partners behaviour be mitigated.  In the field of securities clearing and settlement systems, the design and implementation of various mechanisms may contribute to overcome the problem of moral hazard. Let me give you some examples. An obvious mechanism is to forbid uncovered (or unpriced) overdrafts since such overdrafts might encourage exaggerated risk taking. Some form of collateralisation usually provides the correct incentives. Another means to create the right incentives to avoid moral hazard is for CCPs to set up margining mechanisms to collateralise participants’ open positions. Lastly, market utilities 
 BIS Review 28/2003 3 may design and implement default funds to which both the defaulting and the surviving participants have to contribute, thereby reducing the occurrence of moral-hazard-like behaviour among them. The second imperfection that typically affects a financial system are externalities. “Externalities” stands for the indirect impact of the behaviour of agents on each other caused by failures in market pricing. Negative externalities or external costs result from uncompensated disadvantages. Positive externalities or external benefits result from advantages that not have to be paid for. Externalities lead to market failure, i.e. in the loss of efficiency. In a financial system the efficiency losses in particular of negative externalities can be exacerbated by contagion. More specifically the failure of one institution may have a negative impact on others.  As an example from the world of CSDs and ICSDs take the risk of operational failure. In a world of interlinked systems operational problems can easily spill over from one system to another. Possibly, large parts of a financial system can be infected by an event that first occurred in one of the systems only.  Asymmetric information and negative externalities affect CSDs and ICSDs fundamentally. These institutions are meant to facilitate the exchange of financial services. In order to succeed they must be structured so as to reduce asymmetric information and externalities. The elimination of market imperfections can even be seen as their “raison d’être”. However, the elimination of market imperfections is a formidable task. Partly it is of public good nature. Consequently, while clearing and settlement institutions may effectively reduce market failure and thereby create value for the economy as a whole, more narrow-minded but nevertheless rational market participants might on the contrary pursue more limited goals. The protection of existing or the creation of additional market failures, although inefficient on the whole, can be a profitable activity for an individual or for a single group of participants in a financial system. Therefore market imperfections once identified and addressed with appropriate measures are likely to permanently change their form and place and to challenge even the best of existing institutional arrangements time and again.  A third imperfection that may affect a financial system is an unsatisfactory level of competition. When saying this I do not refer to perfect competition as described in textbooks but rather have in mind market contestability. Contestability excludes undue pricing power by market participants, the existence of collusion among market participants and barriers to entry. You will certainly agree with me when I say that there is no guaranty or a kind of “natural law” that leads markets to organise themselves according to the requirements of contestability. The free play of market forces is the exception rather than the rule. Economic agents individually benefit from rule bending. In addition, and this is of particular relevance in clearing and settlement, the presence of high fixed costs constitute relevant barriers to entry. From experience we know that these barriers reduce competition or eliminate it all together. In extreme cases we speak of a “natural monopoly” which call for regulation by public authorities.  Market imperfections such as asymmetric information, negative externalities or limited competition have shaped the evolution of financial systems everywhere. Financial market institutions were created partly in reaction to these imperfections and continuously adapt themselves when faced with fresh challenges. Additional support comes from the public regulatory and oversight regimes, especially in the field of securities clearing and settlement systems. 3. The definition of oversight  At this stage I switch perspectives and I would like to briefly explain what central bankers, including myself, have in mind when referring to an effective oversight regime. Broadly speaking oversight can be defined as a central bank’s contribution to the smooth functioning of payment, clearing and settlement systems. Oversight differs from supervision, which aims at monitoring the soundness of financial institutions at the micro level. It also differs from surveillance, which focuses on a smooth functioning of financial markets. Furthermore there is a wide consensus, at least among central banks, on what the objectives of oversight should be: maintaining the safety of payment, clearing and settlement systems and promoting their efficiency. It is worth stressing that such a consensus has resulted from a sometimes lengthy but never discouraging learning process within the central bank community. Keeping in mind the positive achievements regulatory and oversight authorities have reached so far I now would like to address some challenges that we still face in this field. 
 4 BIS Review 28/2003 4. Regulatory and oversight challenges in securities clearing and settlement systems First of all let me clarify a fundamental point. Some people claim that the regulatory and oversight authorities' objective of promoting the stability of the financial system hides an undue interventionist activism. Well, such claims are besides the mark. Financial stability depends on how we deal with imperfections in the financial system. Thus we should not waste our time discussing whether such an intervention is necessary or not. We should rather focus on how the authorities should shape the process. The challenges regulators and overseers face in the area of CSDs, ICSDs and CCPs are numerous and, I dare say, well known if we consider the avalanche of standards and recommendations that have been published over the last three years. The CPSS-IOSCO Recommendations for Securities Settlements Systems, the Report of the Wise Men, the G-30 Report on Global Clearing and Settlement and both Giovannini reports provide indeed an excellent view on what and how improvements should be achieved in the area of securities clearing and settlement systems. I also strongly believe that a co-operative approach among the financial intermediaries, the service providers and the regulators is the right way to achieve efficiency gains and risk reduction. There is no sense in pursuing the complex goals of market efficiency in a financial system independently. As I mentioned before, clearing and settlement institutions are by their very nature meant to overcome market imperfections. This task is huge, however. Support from public authorities sometimes comes in handily; sometimes it is the sine qua non for the success of a financial system. But the relevant perspective is that of co-operation and not of “autonomous” infighting between the representatives of free enterprise and those of Hobbess Leviathan-type of government.  Against this background let me take a bird’s eye view of some challenges that regulatory and oversight authorities should tackle to facilitate initiatives to resolve the identified issues. A first challenge is the need for a common approach of the regulatory and oversight authorities. This need arises from several factors. For instance, clearing and settlement of securities transactions occur in different institutions located in different jurisdictions. The whole infrastructure underlying these transactions has reached a global dimension. Over the past decades cross-border infrastructures have deployed their activities essentially as a complement to domestic systems, but I expect them start playing a more powerful role at a domestic level as well. The common approach to regulate and oversee cross-border securities clearing and settlement systems, which I have referred to previously, is being worked on. The various standards and recommendations that have been issued recently is proof this. Some may set the accent on the divergences, misinterpretations or on the incompleteness of these standards and recommendations. I do not refute them but I also see the value added of sharing the same language to tackle complex issues. Regulatory and overseers tend to adopt a pragmatic approach where one authority takes on a leadership role and consults with other relevant authorities. Such a model based on the Lamfalussy standards (1990) has already been put in place among central bankers and has proven to be effective in the context of the Continuous Linked Settlement system (CLS). A second challenge that the authorities face lies in the risk of cross-border financial transactions. Indeed, whereas the nature of the risks remains basically the same, both the probability of occurrence of an adverse event and the risk exposures themselves have clearly increased. The added dimension of cross-border activities lies in potential spillover effects due to the interlinking of systems. Credit, liquidity and operational risk events occurring in one jurisdiction may indeed trigger a systemic crisis by spilling over to foreign financial markets. Not only systems of the same nature, i.e. payment systems, but also different systems such as payment, clearing and settlement systems have been linked at an international level. A promising outcome would be a cross-border delivery-versus-payment mechanism that relies on central bank money. All in all, the current and, if feasible, future linkages explain why regulatory and oversight authorities have to widen the focus of their responsibilities further. A third challenge relates to in-house clearing, payment and settlement mechanisms at large custodians. This commercial function has undergone a remarkable process of concentration in the last few years. Some of these service providers have become very significant for the stability of the financial system as witnessed by the events of September 11, 2001. However, independent of specific events, the question arises whether regulatory and oversight control has kept up with this development everywhere. It is indeed rather problematic that custody activities lie in a grey area between banking supervision and system oversight. In some countries where the tasks deriving from banking supervision and system oversight are performed by separate authorities the regulatory and oversight 
 BIS Review 28/2003 5 framework is very likely to be incomplete or at least sub-optimal unless the two authorities succeed in establishing a strong and effective co-operation. This aspect seems all the more important as large custodians tend to become direct competitors to traditional market utilities like CSDs and ICSDs. This said, I must admit that regulatory and oversight authorities should address this issue with the aim of allowing an acceptable level playing field among large custodians and providers of market utilities. The aim here is not the protection of incumbents against efficient predators - or of Little Red Riding Hood against the big bad wolf - but rather to restrict the use made by large individual suppliers of their powerful market position which eventually could lead to outright dependency of the former customers of CSDs and ICSDs on huge and incontestable financial service suppliers.   In view of these challenges, there is good reason to critically reassess rules and regulations related to securities clearing and settlement systems as well as to the way regulatory and oversight responsibilities are implemented in practice. A predominantly national approach no longer serves market needs. And an essentially sectoral solution, where payment system overseers and securities regulators do not co-operate in an integrated way, is inappropriate. Therefore I welcome the second Giovannini Report which provides an excellent view on how efficiency gains and further risk reduction in the field of securities clearing and settlement systems should be achieved. In Switzerland as in several other countries oversight of clearing, payment and settlement systems is still work in progress. A draft of the revised National Bank Law has been submitted and is being discussed in Parliament. The revised law will presumably enter into force in May 2004. It is intended to explicitly vest the responsibility of overseeing payment systems as well as securities clearing and settlement systems with the Swiss National Bank (SNB). The revised law will thus formally express that an efficient and secure financial market infrastructure is imperative for the implementation of monetary policy and for the stability of the financial system. The inclusion of clearing and settlement systems follows from the obvious fact that, given their linkages, these market utilities are of considerable systemic importance.  The SNB, however, can only fulfil this expanded mandate by closely co-operating with other authorities. Domestically the SNB will work hand-in-hand with the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (SFBC), our banking supervisor. The SNB will focus on systemic issues while the SFBC will deal with institutional aspects. This job-sharing is based on the premise that each authority will be able to make use of its comparative advantage. Furthermore, if oversight activities require it, the SNB will be able to co-operate with foreign authorities. 5. Conclusion I would like to conclude my address with a repeated call for co-operation. In the field of financial system stability there is no alternative to close co-operation between private market players like you and the regulatory and oversight authorities. On the one hand it makes sense in this field to rely on market forces to stimulate, as energetically as possible, an eagerness for progress and innovation. Institutions like CSDs, ICSDs and CCPs are made to make markets work. On the other hand we have to take into consideration that there are economic forces working in this area that may nevertheless lead to sub-optimal outcomes. Therefore, regulators and overseers must take on a more active, complementary role.  First, the financial system can be affected by problems of asymmetric information, in particular in the form of moral hazard. It may also entail negative externalities, which by definition are not internalised by individually optimising market players. Specifically in the field of clearing, payment and settlement systems, where such externalities are present, regulatory and oversight authorities aim at taking into account these systems as a whole, thereby focusing on the links between all components. In other words, some of these systems are "too interlinked to fail" and must therefore be regulated and overseen with special care. Second, the financial system may be subject to limited competition. In the field of securities clearing and settlement systems the production of services is based on processes with high fixed costs. There is thus a risk that the free play of market forces is limited and that actual market developments might lead to monopolies that greatly damage efficiency. Regulatory and oversight authorities must therefore also make it their goal to prevent potential abuses of market power. Against this background, I strongly believe that trust-based co-operation between the providers of market utilities and regulatory and oversight authorities remains the key to the continued successful 
 6 BIS Review 28/2003 development of an efficient and secure financial system that can handle fast-changing needs in the future. Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for your attention. 
 BIS Review 28/2003 1 Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Basel II - some issues for implementation  Speech by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Basel Sessions 2003, Institute of International Finance, New York, 17 June 2003.  *      *      * I appreciate the opportunity provided by the Institute of International Finance to participate in your all-day session on Basel II. It has taken a long time to reach this stage in the negotiations for a new capital accord: five years, 3-1/2 quantitative impact surveys, three consultative papers, and numerous outreach meetings with industry representatives. The process is not yet complete. In a continuation of one of the most transparent efforts to vet a regulatory proposal, we are asking for comment, and again we will carefully consider suggestions to improve the proposal on the basis of evidence and analysis submitted. Perhaps some of those suggestions will come from the sessions today.  I think you will see from a comparison of the third consultative paper (CP3) with its predecessor that we are listening to what the public and the industry have been saying. Our response to comments has often added complexity to provide options in the context of a worldwide banking system in which countries and individual banks have different procedures and approaches. We have made every effort to avoid cookie-cutter rules for complicated banking structures. Those efforts continue. For example, in the United States, our Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) will seek further comment on additional options for securitization and risk mitigation as well as the treatment of various retail exposures, any one of which may require further negotiation at Basel. Complexity is also added because we are attempting to include principles of modern finance and risk-management, all of which involve complex statistical, and thus mathematical, techniques. Of course, it is exactly that direction that banking and its best-practice management have been taking over the last decade. In short, complexity in many cases provides options and in most cases is simply a part of modern finance.  The details are not yet cast in concrete. A point I want you to keep in mind is: We will seriously consider suggestions for furthering the objectives of more-risk-sensitive capital requirements and better risk measurement and management in the least costly and most efficient way. At this point, however, comments must be analytical and empirical if they are to be helpful and likely to modify the proposal.  The Framework As we involve ourselves in the fine detail of Basel II, it is useful to keep in mind what we are trying to do. We are developing a replacement for the current capital accord, Basel I, an agreement that simply is no longer consistent with the way the world's largest banks conduct their business. From the perspective of banks, supervisors, and, let us not forget, counterparties and stakeholders, capital is a cushion to ensure safety and soundness and to provide a benchmark against which the financial condition of banks can be measured. The large banks of the world have so changed the nature of how they do business that for them Basel I neither provides an appropriate cushion nor an accurate risk benchmark. It must be replaced, particularly in a world whose financial markets are so interrelated that substantial difficulties at any one of the largest banks, let alone a failure, could place all the large banks of the world at risk.  Indeed, with due regard for an international level playing field, which I will discuss later, we should consider that the need of all of our countries for economic stability should be paramount in our supervisory and regulatory judgments. It is worth emphasizing that substantial disruptions in our financial systems linked to a large bank failure could raise the risk of a regulatory, if not legislative, response that would likely add restrictions greatly limiting the flexibility and efficiency of our banking system. In addition, perhaps one of the largest risks to the safety of the world banking system is the competitor - either local or cross-border - that erroneously evaluates risk, acts on that evaluation, and induces a competitive response that increases risk exposures broadly.  For both reasons, action is imperative. It must be taken both by banks and by their supervisors to improve risk measurement and management; to link to the extent we can the amount of regulatory minimum capital to the amount of risk taken; to attempt to further focus the supervisor-bank dialogue on the measurement and management of risk and the risk-capital nexus; and to make all of this 
 2 BIS Review 28/2003 transparent to the counterparties and uninsured depositors that ultimately fund - and hence share - the risk positions. In a rather large nutshell, that is what Basel II seeks to do, while at the same time seeking a level regulatory playing field for banks that compete across borders.  Cyclicality Many critics - in and outside of the industry - have raised concerns that the framers of Basel II have unintentionally overlooked a byproduct of the package that will tend to destabilize the world's economies. With all the world's banks on the same regulatory structure, these critics argue, the typical business cycle will be accentuated by Basel II as perfectly reasonable estimates of probabilities of default and of loss given default decline in economic expansions and rise as the economy weakens. The resultant changes in the cost and availability of credit will be pro-cyclical, that is, will exacerbate cyclical patterns in the real economy.  But we should recognize some important responses that have emerged from regulators and markets: flatter risk functions have been adopted in the Basel II proposal; banks maintain buffer capital stocks; Basel II requires that, under Pillar 2, supervisors and banks discuss the size of the necessary buffer capital that each bank should carry for cyclical purposes; and the proposed rules require stress-testing of risk parameters. Perhaps a more important point is that, in evaluating the pro-cyclicality argument, we should not forget the cyclicality in bank credit flows that we see in history. If we are to truly evaluate the critics' concerns with post-Basel II pro-cyclicality in bank credit flows, we should be sure that it is compared with the pre-Basel II pattern.  Until quite recently, systematically and formally managing many of the key risks taken by banks, in particular their credit risk, was quite difficult. The techniques for quantifying and measuring risk, and the technology and instruments to manage and distribute it, simply did not exist. Individual credit-risk decisions tended to be made by lending and credit officers who used their judgment to decide who was given credit and who was not. A characteristic of lending officers is that they are paid to make loans, and in competitive lending markets they want to make sure they maintain, if not increase, market share. This is not to say that lending officers are uninterested in risk management but rather that their focus is on finding a way to make the loan. In a world of judgment, the risk manager had considerable difficulty in persuading lending officers, indeed management, about excessive risk when quantitative procedures and systems did not exist. Differences in judgment are difficult to resolve.  That is probably the reason that bank credit availability has historically demonstrated a clear cyclical pattern that is consistent with the credit-making decision process I have just described and that, in turn, has exacerbated real economic cycles. During economic recoveries, bank credit officers would become more optimistic and willing to lend, an attitude that only strengthened during booms; in such times the voices of risk managers, even supervisors, calling for caution were likely to carry less weight. During recessions, with losses clear and write-offs rising, caution would come to the forefront, and more-restrictive attitudes toward lending would be reinforced by the arguments of risk managers and supervisors who could point to the losses.  One can, I think, begin to notice a change in recent years in this typical pro-cyclical behavior in bank credit availability in the United States. The change first became apparent in the minimal credit losses at the large U.S. banks during the Asian debt crisis and Russian debt default in the late 1990s. It was also noticeable when these same entities began to tighten lending standards during the later years of the last expansion, in contrast to typical patterns, in which tightening occurred near or after the peak. The moderation of pro-cyclical behavior is also apparent in the continued strength in the portfolios of these organizations and in the modest spreads on their subordinated debt during the recession. To be sure, part of the explanation is new techniques and instruments for shifting and sharing risks. But at bottom, I would argue, we are beginning to see the payoff from more-formal and rigorous quantitative risk-management techniques for credit decisionmaking, techniques that have also been central to the development of new instruments for hedging, mitigating, and managing credit risk.  Basel II builds on and formalizes these developments in bank credit risk management. Such a regime of greater formal attention to risk exposures, as under Basel II, offers the hope of a more stable pattern of credit availability. Quantitative risk management should reduce the buildup of excessive unintended credit risks that have been assumed in expansions and thereby minimize the losses and associated tighter lending standards during recessions. Such lending behavior, in turn, might well reduce the cyclical pattern in minimum capital requirements that would occur without the better risk-management techniques required under the proposed Basel II. The response to more-formal risk 
 BIS Review 28/2003 3 management thus creates the reasonable prospect of a reduction in concerns about the pro-cyclicality of capital ratios under Basel II.  In the past, problems have arisen when banks have been too complacent in their judgments of risks during good times, too slow to react when the situation turns, and too risk-adverse once their losses have turned out larger than anticipated. A process that encourages banks to think more carefully and more pro-actively about all of these possibilities offers the hope of a significant improvement in the way that they manage themselves over the course of the business cycle.  Risk will continue to vary over time. Ignoring that fact is in no one's interest. In fact, capital ratios under Basel I by default fail to convey that pattern to managers, stakeholders, and supervisors because the risk categories are insufficient to recognize changing risk.  The proposed Basel II, in contrast, would convey to managers, to supervisors, and importantly, to the public how risk changes as capital requirements respond to changes in the real underlying risk. A sufficiently risk-sensitive capital regime would impart timely information regarding risk. That, in turn, would allow adjustments in lending policies sufficiently early to limit excessive swings in lending behavior. Risk sensitivity in capital requirements would damp swings in credit availability and thereby reduce both credit sprees and credit crunches.  Supervisors prefer - or at least ought to prefer - the regulatory capital ratios that convey more information. Supervisors, banks, and the public should want to understand when bank portfolios are facing higher risks or when an updated estimate of risk relative to capital reveals a warning sign that requires attention. No such early warning system is provided by a system of capital requirements that does not signal that a bank has a problem until the problem is severe enough to have already eroded the underlying capital. That is, a capital system with little risk sensitivity creates the potential for problems to escape undetected for longer periods. Such delays increase the likelihood that the underlying problems will not be addressed soon enough and will grow larger.  Dispersion in capital requirements under Basel II Basel II is designed to deliver capital requirements that are more risk sensitive. As such, one can expect that some banks - those with less risk exposure - will see their required capital decline; those with larger risk exposures should see their required capital rise. On average, we expect capital requirements for the total of credit risk and operational risk to remain about unchanged for the banking system. As I have just discussed, the resultant dispersion of capital requirements seems desirable to supervisors for its portfolio inducements, for its aid in supervisory evaluations, and for its contribution to safe and sound banking.  The dispersion of capital requirements has also created an unexpected criticism from some observers: it will distort the competitive landscape, as if somehow lower capital requirements were a random gift and higher capital requirements a random penalty, rather than correctly reflecting underlying risk.  To be sure, some, but not all, of the concern in this country has reflected objections from banks that will not be required to apply Basel II - and thus will not see their capital requirements change at all. Some of these entities fear they will face a rival that will get a capital break because the rival is following Basel II and has lower risk exposures recognized by the new accord.  The extent to which regulatory capital requirements drive pricing or profitability is an empirical question. My own view is that in a world in which banks hold capital buffers and can securitize and sell assets, and with bank management increasingly allocating resources and making decisions on the basis of internal economic capital measures, the answer must be: not very much, if at all. Rather, I believe that we are increasingly observing that pricing decisions reflect economic capital allocations that are risk based. We have tried hard to set risk-based regulatory capital requirements in Basel II below economic capital measures so that regulatory requirements will not affect the allocation of capital within the bank. If we make a mistake and set the regulatory capital requirements too high relative to market-based economic capital, we can read the effect of our error right away in the securitization of the exposure; securitization is a release valve that relieves the pressure of our mistakes.  To be sure, as better risk measurement and management results in more sensitive risk-based pricing, we may well see that exposures with higher capital charges are priced higher than those with lower capital charges. But such observations should not lead us to confuse cause and effect. The regulatory 
 4 BIS Review 28/2003 capital charges and price of credit will both be reflecting the same thing - risk; the higher price won't be a reflection of the higher capital charge.  U.S. Scope of Application No discussion on Basel II with a room full of global bankers would be complete without a discussion of the intended scope of application of Basel II in this country. In particular, I would suspect that you want to hear about the implications for the integration of your U.S. and worldwide operations. A week ago, I gave a rather full presentation on that issue to the Institute of International Bankers, and I call your attention to that statement, which is available at the Board's web site.1 But this afternoon let me present the highlights of what I said.  First, what do we plan to do? In this country, we intend to offer only the advanced approaches under Basel II: the Advanced version of the Internal Ratings Based approach (A-IRB) for credit risk and the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) for operational risk. There will be no Foundation IRB and no Standardized approach for credit risk in the United States for any U.S. chartered bank - domestic or foreign; nor will there be a Basic Indicator or Standardized method for calculating operational risk for any U.S. chartered bank. In this country, only the largest, most internationally active banks will be required to adopt Basel II: A-IRB and AMA. The proposed criteria indicate that about ten such banks will be in this "core" group. In addition, any U.S. bank - including any subsidiary of a foreign bank - that meets the infrastructure requirements of the A-IRB approach may choose Basel II; we expect that, initially, about another ten banks will do so. The twenty or so U.S. banks that we expect to operate in the near future under Basel II - the ten mandatory core banks and the ten banks choosing Basel II - account today for 99 percent of U.S. bank foreign assets and two-thirds of total domestic consolidated assets of all U.S. banking organizations.  Those banking organizations in this country not in the core group and not choosing to adopt Basel II will remain on the current capital regime (Basel I). They will not be subject to explicit operational risk capital requirements. These banks may also opt in to Basel II (A-IRB and AMA) whenever they wish, provided they meet the infrastructure requirements.  Why did we not make the other Basel II options available in the United States? We have made it clear from the outset that the new accord would apply in this country only to those institutions that genuinely competed across national boundaries to ensure, in so far as possible, a level competitive playing field internationally. Only a small number of U.S. institutions meet the test of truly operating across borders. They happen to be very large and, hence, the authorities here concluded that they should be subject to the most sophisticated Basel II versions so that they receive the very real benefits of improved risk measurement and management and a more risk-sensitive regulatory capital requirement and so that they operate under the increased market discipline that comes from improved disclosure and greater transparency. Indeed, very large banks that do not meet the internationally active criterion will also be required to become core banks for these reasons.  The banks that will remain under the current capital regime in this country have certain attributes that led the authorities to conclude that, for those banks, realizing the benefits of Basel II would impose costs that exceeded those benefits. Most of these banking organizations have relatively straightforward balance sheets that would benefit less from the Basel II risk-measurement and management requirements. In addition, in this country, our banks are subject to the requirements of prompt corrective action and minimum leverage and to statutory provisions that induce them to hold buffer capital far above the minimum requirements. More than 93 percent of the expected Basel I banks hold capital that is in excess of 10 percent of their risk-weighted assets. Moreover, in this country, requirements of the sort found in Pillar 2 have been in existence for many years and are well ingrained into our supervisory process. The U.S. banking system also has a greater tradition of disclosure, as those of you with U.S. subsidiaries well know.  Thus, the cost-benefit analysis suggested that it would not be responsible to require most of our banks - entities that do not operate across national borders - to adopt Basel II, especially because thousands of them would probably choose the standardized version that adds only modest credit-risk sensitivity to risk-based capital requirements. Smaller banks in many other countries, we believe, would benefit                                                       1  http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2003/200306102/default.htm  
 BIS Review 28/2003 5 from adherence to Pillars 2 and 3, and we hope they adopt Basel II, but our banks already operate under regimes fairly close to what the simpler versions of Basel II would provide.  In light of their capital and supervision, we anticipate that U.S. banks with modest overseas activities operating under Basel I rules would be able to continue their overseas operations without having to adopt Basel II. Their subsidiaries, of course, would be subject to the rules and requirements of the host country. And, U.S. authorities will make available to host-country supervisors whatever information is required.  U.S. branches of foreign banks would be basically unaffected by Basel II rules because they are not subject to direct capital requirements. And U.S. supervisors expect to find any variant of Basel II applied in foreign countries to be acceptable for our evaluations of well-capitalized standards at the consolidated parent level. However, U.S. subsidiaries would be subject to our rules for domestic banks and thus would have to choose either the A-IRB and AMA approaches or remain under the current Basel I rules.  We do understand that this could present some complications for foreign banks using approaches for their consolidated organizations that are not offered in the United States, such as Foundation IRB for credit risk. When the parent organization's approach does not align with what the U.S. subsidiary must choose (either advanced approaches or current rules), some adjustments will indeed be necessary. U.S. supervisors and their counterparts from Basel member countries are already working, through the Basel Accord Implementation Group (AIG), to resolve cross-border implementation issues and minimize burden created from differences in home and host-country rules. We understand, however, our responsibilities to work with foreign banks to address the remaining conflicts.  When foreign banks with U.S. subsidiaries adopt IRB variants at home and Basel I rules in the United States, U.S. supervisors would be prepared to assist them, and their supervisors, in helping the subsidiary bank here provide the requisite inputs for calculation of capital at the global, consolidated level. When the foreign bank adopts at home the IRB variant not available in this country, the Foundation IRB, the issues are more complicated; if the bank wants its U.S. subsidiary to also be on IRB, doing so would require that subsidiary to adopt the Advanced IRB version here. To meet the requirements for risk measurement and management required by the authorities for U.S. markets, that subsidiary would have to invest the resources to estimate loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) parameters for their corporate exposures.  Such an effort is not without cost, but we are willing to work with such banks to ease their transition. We are, for example, prepared to explore the possibility of allowing U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks to use conservative estimates of LGD and EAD for a finite transitional period when data are not yet available for parts of some portfolios. This possible option would, if adopted, apply equally to fully domestic U.S. banks adopting A-IRB. We might also be willing to work out transition methodologies to permit foreign banks to allocate their overall operational risk capital charge for their consolidated entity between their parent and U.S. A-IRB bank subsidiary - for a limited time. Such transition approaches are indicative of our willingness to approach the implementation of our scope of application policy in a pragmatic way.  The U.S. authorities strongly encourage U.S. banks and foreign banks concerned about cross-border implementation to establish a dialogue with supervisors in their respective home jurisdictions and, for foreign banks in the United States, also with U.S. supervisors; we want these banks to comment on any documents addressing cross-border issues, so that AIG members can tackle these issues together. The authorities here want to hear your observations on how to avoid creating undue burdens on foreign banks while at the same time retaining our ability to shape the risk-measurement and management methods employed by banks in our own markets.  Summary Basel I must be replaced for the large, internationally active banks of the world because it no longer produces an adequate indicator of the strength of such banks, and, moreover, that indicator does not vary as risk changes. Basel II is designed to improve risk management and measurement, to link required capital to risk, to focus supervision more closely on these variables, to make such relationships more transparent, and to facilitate a level playing field for banks that compete across national borders. Critics concerned about the pro-cyclicality of Basel I should compare the likely post-Basel II pattern with the pattern of earlier years; in doing so, they should consider the extent to which better risk management, a more risk-sensitive capital requirement, and the rise in market discipline 
 6 BIS Review 28/2003 that comes from greater transparency will modify bank lending patterns, particularly the unintended acceptance of risk during expansion periods.  The U.S. authorities are proposing that in this country the A-IRB and AMA approaches of Basel II be required of the largest, most internationally active banks that meet certain size and foreign-activity criteria and be permitted for any other bank that meets the infrastructure prerequisites of the A-IRB and AMA approaches. All other banking organizations would remain under Basel I. The proposal would not permit any banking organization in this country to operate under the Standardized or Foundation IRB approaches of Basel II.  We will be working with the AIG at Basel to minimize any issues that may arise because of different capital regimes for the consolidated operations of foreign banks and the choices available to their subsidiaries in the United States. U.S. supervisors will cooperate with foreign supervisors to provide any required inputs from U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks that the home-country supervisors need for their consolidated supervision. The U.S. banking agencies are also willing to consider possible transition methodologies to assist foreign banks that want to use IRB here to adopt the A-IRB and AMA approaches. We urge the U.S. bank subsidiaries that are commenting on the U.S. ANPR to advise both U.S. and home-country supervisors of the problems that our proposed scope of application may cause them. In particular, we solicit suggestions that address these potential problems but still recognize the desire of the U.S. authorities to apply only the advanced versions of Basel II in this country. 
 BIS Review 27/2003 1 Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Uncertain times - Economic challenges facing the United States and Japan Speech by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Institute of International Bankers, New York, 11 June 2003.  *      *      * Despite heavy doses of monetary and fiscal stimulus, the Japanese economy remains mired in a mild, yet protracted, deflationary slump. The origins of the slump date to the bursting of the land and equity price bubble in the early 1990s. Economic weakness, in turn, has led to a sustained deflation that has proven unexpectedly difficult to cure.  Here in the United States, the economy has also struggled of late, following a sequence of adverse shocks during the past three years. We have had our own asset bubble, of course, and the steep fall in equity prices since the spring of 2000 has almost halved household equity wealth. The horrific events of September 11, 2001, shook financial markets, and the troubling evidence of corporate malfeasance revealed during the Enron and other scandals, combined with heightened geopolitical tensions that preceded the war in Iraq, tested the willingness of market participants to assume risk. These adverse developments were reflected in a precipitous decline in capital expenditures, which has contributed to a few years of subpar growth. These developments also put considerable downward pressure on inflation, to the point that increases in core consumer prices are now at a rate not seen on a sustained basis in almost forty years. In fact, after its most recent meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee noted that the probability of unwelcome further downward pressure on prices over the next few quarters exceeds that of a pickup in inflation.  With near-term economic prospects in the United States still somewhat clouded, market commentators have increasingly focused on the possibility that the United States may follow Japan into a deflationary slump. However, I do not believe that the United States is at the brink of significant and sustained deflation. Indeed, I believe that the probability of such an eventuality is quite low. But as the Japanese experience shows, the onset of deflation can be unexpected, and so to leave the topic unexamined would be imprudent. Of course, public interest is another reason to discuss the issue and contribute, one hopes, to the stock of intellectual capital. Accordingly, I think it is useful to discuss some lessons that can be drawn from the Japanese experience and, with that as background, to examine some reasons that a harmful deflation is unlikely to take hold in the United States. Before proceeding, let me note that the comments expressed reflect my views only and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the FOMC.  First, I want to explain the theoretical view of the dangers associated with deflation. A harmful deflation, such as the type experienced by Japan since the mid-1990s, is almost always a consequence of depressed aggregate demand. A deflationary slump driven by contracting demand is more dangerous than a typical economic downturn because of its potential adverse effects on financial markets and the limitations it places on conventional monetary policy. Deflation of sufficient magnitude may result in the falling of nominal interest rates to zero - their practical minimum. This floor, commonly called the (cid:147)zero bound,(cid:148) exists because lenders will always prefer to hold cash rather than credit instruments bearing a negative nominal interest rate. In a recession in which short-term nominal interest rates have already been pushed to zero, therefore, further downward adjustment in nominal interest rates is difficult, if not impossible. Because the real interest rate equals the nominal interest rate less the expected rate of inflation, the zero bound on nominal interest rates can lead to rapidly increasing real rates if deflation intensifies. Rising real interest rates, in turn, discourage borrowing, and so capital outlays by businesses, purchases of homes by families, and other types of spending decline further. This deterioration in aggregate demand adds to deflationary pressures and pushes real interest rates even higher.  Besides raising the real cost of borrowing, deflation can erode the quality of business and household balance sheets. Even if debtors can refinance existing loans at zero (or very low) nominal interest rates, a sustained fall in prices will transform what might otherwise be a manageable level of nominal debt accumulated by businesses and households into a rising and potentially debilitating level of real debt and real debt service costs. The consequent financial distress of debtors can lead to widespread defaults, bankruptcies, and bank failures, with potentially devastating consequences for the entire financial system.  
 2 BIS Review 27/2003 The adverse effects of deflation go beyond financial markets. Deflationary pressures can impede the effective clearing of labor markets. Because employers often have difficulty cutting the nominal wages of their employees, real wages may rise as prices decline, and higher unemployment may result.  Deflation also raises a barrier to those monetary policy actions conventionally used to stimulate aggregate demand. Faced with a normal economic downturn, a central bank would lower its target for the short-term nominal interest rate - the overnight federal funds rate in the United States or the overnight call money rate in Japan - to stimulate aggregate demand. In a deflationary environment, in which short-term nominal interest rates have already been pushed to zero, the central bank can no longer ease policy in the usual way.  That is not to say that a central bank with its traditional policy rate at zero lacks tools to boost aggregate demand and thereby combat deflation. In fact, central banks have a number of other means at their disposal to stimulate spending should nominal interest rates hit the zero bound.  A central bank can increase the supply of reserves to the financial system through regular open-market operations even after short-term nominal interest rates have hit zero. Such actions may demonstrate a resolve by the central bank to keep short-term interest rates at zero for a prolonged period of time, with the intention of raising inflation expectations and lowering real interest rates.  Arguably, a more effective approach to combating deflation - and a relatively straightforward extension of current operating procedures - would be for a central bank to stimulate aggregate demand by lowering interest rates further out along the maturity spectrum. A central bank could expand its open market purchases of longer-term government securities, in sizable quantities if necessary, to drive term premiums lower. Of course, because long-term interest rates incorporate term premiums as well as discounted expectations of future short-term interest rates, the success of operations focused on influencing parts of the yield curve would be bolstered by a credible promise to move the short-term policy rate along a trajectory consistent with the targeted longer-term yields.  Alternatively, as economists have long recognized, a central bank could influence expectations of future short-term interest rates directly by committing to keeping the policy interest rate at zero for a specified and relatively long period of time or until some intermediate macroeconomic target - such as the termination of declining prices - was achieved. As a practical matter and to underscore its commitment to boosting aggregate demand, a central bank could write options that would, for a pre-specified time, make its raising interest rates costly, or it could operate in the forward interest rate market. If such actions were successful, yields on longer-term government securities would decline. Through arbitrage across financial instruments, yields on longer-term private instruments, such as corporate bonds and home mortgages, would likely follow suit. A sufficient downward adjustment of interest rates over the term structure of government and private securities should stimulate spending and thus help end deflation.  Importantly, describing what a central bank could do is easy, but these actions are not simple to execute or without downside risks. In particular, such policies would pose a considerable challenge for a central bank regarding communication. For example, if a central bank tried to cap a longer-term yield below the prevailing market rate, it would, to be most effective, need to convince market participants that it was committed to keeping the short-term policy interest rate low for an extended period. If this commitment was not viewed as credible, the central bank(cid:146)s purchases of securities to lower longer-term yields would likely have to be massive, given that the term premium component of longer-term interest rates appears rather insensitive to the outstanding supply of various securities. Such a situation would give rise to a risk that the targeted security might become disconnected from the rest of the yield curve and private interest rates.  The Federal Reserve has experience in using these tools, although admittedly not in a deflationary environment. Therefore, to describe these tools as (cid:147)unconventional(cid:148) may not be entirely appropriate. Rather, they are (cid:147)rarely used.(cid:148) In particular, between 1942 and 1951, the Federal Reserve successfully maintained an interest-rate ceiling on longer-term Treasury yields at 2-1/2 percent. From 1979 through much of 1982, the FOMC targeted the amount of nonborrowed reserves in the banking system in an effort to reduce inflation. And around the century date change, the Federal Reserve wrote options on repurchase agreements to reassure market participants that adequate liquidity would be available. To be sure, our understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism in the United States when prices are on a distinct downward trend has not been informed by recent experience, and so calibrating the effects of such policy actions may be difficult. Thus, preventing deflation remains preferable to reversing it. However, if an economy slips into deflation, my belief is that a sufficiently determined central bank can spur aggregate demand and end the deflation.  
 BIS Review 27/2003 3 Skeptics may point to Japan, where interest rate cuts and other monetary policy measures have been ineffective in jumpstarting the economy. The Bank of Japan lowered short-term interest rates considerably over the 1990s, after the bursting of the asset price bubble and against the backdrop of a stagnant economy. The overnight nominal interest rate fell from slightly more than 8 percent in 1991 to 1/2 percent in 1995, where it stayed until being lowered essentially to zero in 1999. However, the loosening of monetary policy in the early 1990s, though probably appropriate given the expectations of future economic developments generally held at that time, in retrospect proved to be too slow in light of the declines in spending and prices that subsequently occurred  Amid persistent price deflation - and face to face with the constraints on monetary policy imposed by the zero lower bound on short-term nominal interest rates - the Bank of Japan introduced what it called a (cid:147)quantitative easing(cid:148) framework in March 2001. This framework included switching the operating target for money market operations from the overnight interest rate to the outstanding balance of reserve accounts held by financial institutions at the central bank. In an attempt to change deflationary expectations, the Bank of Japan stated that it would continue to target reserve accounts until the core consumer price index showed a twelve-month inflation rate of zero or above. Over the roughly two years since then, reserve accounts at the Bank of Japan have risen nearly six-fold, from ¥5 trillion in March 2001 to about ¥28 trillion today. In addition, since March 2001 the Bank of Japan has increased the monthly amount of its outright purchases of long-term government bonds from ¥400 billion to ¥1.2 trillion. I assume that these monetary policy actions have provided some support for economic activity. However, the Japanese economy appears not to have returned to a path of sustainable growth for several reasons, some of which may require responses by entities other than the Bank of Japan.  First, the Bank of Japan introduced quantitative easing only after prices were already on a sustained downward trajectory; perhaps, even then, efforts were not aggressive enough, given entrenched deflationary expectations. Since early 1995, consumer price inflation has been around or below zero, and by March 2001, prices were declining at nearly 1 percent per year.1 According to surveys of private economists and further evidenced by very low interest rates on long-term Japanese government bonds, deflation had clearly become embedded in expectations.  Second, the stimulus provided by monetary policy in Japan continues to be damped by well-recognized problems in Japan(cid:146)s banking sector. Factors such as low profitability and insufficient actions to restore the banking sector(cid:146)s health have combined to erode banks(cid:146) capital base. Because I believe strongly in capital levels that fully reflect differing categories of risk, I think that the recent strengthening of auditing rules for evaluating the use of deferred tax assets as bank capital is a step in the right direction. However, insufficient capital continues to plague the banking sector, and without the cushion of a strong capital base, banks give evidence of remaining extremely risk averse. Commercial bank lending has thus continued to decline, while banks(cid:146) holdings of less risky long-term government bonds have soared. Because banks play an even more crucial role in Japan(cid:146)s financial system than in other industrialized countries, problems in its banking sector are particularly damaging to the transmission of monetary policy and to the economy more generally.  Finally, demand for business and consumer credit in Japan is weak according to the results of various surveys. In a deteriorating economic environment, businesses as well as banks appear to have pulled back from risk-taking. As evidenced by very low long-term interest rates, expectations of future economic growth seem bleak. Capital-output ratios are still high, returns on assets are low, corporate profits are poor, and the economic outlook is fraught with uncertainty. It is not surprising then that firms are not borrowing to finance new investment. Rather, observers argue that much bank lending will keep ailing and inefficient firms afloat and further crowd the field against the dynamic, innovative enterprises needed to fuel sustained expansion. Japan appears to have become a society in which economic agents - banks, insurance companies, corporations, and households - have lost their appetite for risk. This risk aversion has hurt Japan(cid:146)s economic performance, since risk-taking is critical to growth in a market economy.  These crucial factors have limited the effectiveness of both conventional and unconventional monetary policy measures in Japan. In the United States, economic and financial fundamentals are much sounder than those prevailing in Japan when the Bank of Japan started to implement unconventional                                                       1  Measured inflation, even after adjustment for the hike in the value-added tax in 1997, showed small positive rates during 1996 and 1997. But changes in the consumer price index are widely considered to be biased upward, suggesting that true inflation probably remained negative. 
 4 BIS Review 27/2003 measures. The available evidence suggests that the U.S. real economy is currently stronger, better balanced, more productive and more dynamic than the Japanese economy was at a comparable period. The economy(cid:146)s ability to weather the adverse shocks of recent years reflects flexible and efficient markets for labor and capital and dramatic gains in information technology, which have markedly improved the ability of businesses to address incipient economic imbalances before they inflict significant damage.  To be sure, considerable uncertainty attends the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy, and recent readings on production and employment have been disappointing. However, a balanced assessment would also take into consideration the fact that the reduction in Iraq-related uncertainties and some recent positive news regarding corporate earnings have caused the tenor of financial markets to improve noticeably: Equity prices have risen, risk premiums of corporate debt have fallen, crude oil prices have declined sharply, and consumer confidence has rebounded since the early spring. Whether this improvement in overall financial conditions is a precursor to sustained recovery in the broader economy is unclear. Fortunately, for the longer term, productivity growth in the United States has remained remarkably robust. Rapid growth of output per hour boosts expectations of future advances in wages and profits, leading eventually to higher aggregate demand.  Another key difference between the two countries is that the U.S. financial system continues to function smoothly. Domestic commercial banks are very profitable overall and are well capitalized, and bank regulators have shown a willingness to move quickly to address problems. In contrast, Japanese banks remain saddled with a significant volume of nonperforming loans. Accordingly, the process of financial intermediation through banks has been constricted, hampering the Bank of Japan(cid:146)s attempts to increase liquidity and to stimulate the flow of credit.  On a related point, the existence of highly developed and integrated U.S. financial markets means that the proportion of financing flows intermediated by the banking system in the United States is considerably smaller than in Japan(cid:146)s bank-centered financial system. As a result, the transmission of monetary policy in the United States operates through multiple and complementary channels. Japan(cid:146)s dependence on the banking system, a system that has largely ceased to function, represents a further constraint on the transmission of monetary policy in that country. Thus, it seems appropriate for Japan to continue its efforts to develop deeper and more liquid capital markets.  Demand for business and consumer credit in the United States is stronger than in Japan, and corporate balance sheets are in better shape. The continued rapid pace of technological innovation is likely to create expanding opportunities for profitable investment and thereby strengthen further the demand for credit. Although business spending on fixed capital has yet to stage a convincing comeback, firms eventually will have to increase such outlays, given the relatively high rates of depreciation on certain types of capital.  Finally, as mentioned earlier, by the time the Bank of Japan implemented the quantitative easing framework in March 2001, yields on long-term government securities had already reached a very low level. In the United States today, by contrast, the relatively steep Treasury yield curve affords greater scope for reducing longer-term interest rates.  In conclusion, the risk of deflation, a decline in the general price level, appears remote in the United States. Although the near-term outlook is uncertain, the fundamentals are sound. Furthermore, I am confident that, in the unlikely event a harmful deflation emerges in the United States and the Federal Reserve needs to turn to a broader range of monetary policies, such tools will be effective in boosting aggregate demand and putting the economy back on track to sustainable growth.  We at the Federal Reserve have been able to glean much from the Bank of Japan(cid:146)s experience with monetary policy at the zero bound. In particular, the Bank of Japan(cid:146)s implementation of many innovative policy measures has enhanced our understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism in a low-inflation environment, a valuable ingredient in monetary policy decisionmaking today. For that reason, I am pleased to have had this opportunity to address the Japan Society today. 
 BIS Review 27/2003 1 Joseph O Sanusi: Information and communication technology for the social transformation of Nigeria Special remarks by Dr Joseph O Sanusi, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, delivered at the Dinner/Investor Forum organised by Leapfrog Venture Partners Ltd during the National Summit on SMIEIS, Victoria Island, Lagos, 10 June 2003.  *      *      * The Representative of the Honorable Minister of Industries, The Executive Governor of Lagos State, His Excellency, Alhaji Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Chief Executives of Banks and Other Financial Institutions, Members of Non-Governmental and Multilateral Agencies, Distinguished Industrialists, Ladies and Gentlemen. It is my pleasure and privilege to make this special remark at this historic investor forum/dinner aimed at educating and enlightening us on the efforts of Leapfrog Venture Partners Nigeria Limited in promoting and training skilled manpower for the social transformation of Nigeria. Let me state at the onset that, when the organizers of this forum approached me to be the Special Guest of Honor, I was hesitant in accepting it. However, because of how close this subject is to my heart and in my firm belief of the role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the promotion of SMEs in Nigeria, I accepted to attend. May I seize this opportunity to congratulate the organizes of the forum, for their foresight and wisdom in selecting such an important and relevant theme, (cid:147)Information and Communication Technology for The Social Transformation of Nigeria(cid:148). The effort is also commendable because currently we require massive investments in Information and Communication Technology in order to develop our socio-economic infrastructure.  As you all know, advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) were pivotal to the recent social and economic transformation in both the industrialized and developing countries. The increasing spread of ICTs has opened new opportunities for developing countries to harness for the attainment of their socio-economic and developmental goals. It is, pertinent to note that, although there have been several efforts at the highest levels of government and industry to promote the construction of a national information infrastructure, the attempt by Leapfrog Ventures is a very bold step by a private entrepreneur in this direction. We must all join hands with Leapfrog Ventures in order for Nigeria to reap the predicted social and economic benefits.  Distinguished Participants, Ladies and Gentlemen, as you are aware, recent advances in digital technologies have separated further, the divide between the rich and poor countries. Since there is no comprehensive solution for this problem within the current conventions, it is imperative therefore that we explore the potential ways of utilizing digital technologies in empowering our people and communities to better perform their tasks and roles in our increasingly technologically driven, information centered and knowledge-based economy. We are all aware that, by developing and executing a robust ICT strategy, many developing nations and companies have enhanced their cutting edge and vastly improved their core competencies in these areas. Some of these nations and companies have achieved competitive edge because the improvements in their ICT had allowed them to leverage the benefits of network economies, knowledge management and the advantages of rapid, frictionless, information flow. They have optimized the full spectrum of their capabilities and have from it, realized significant gains in sharing information, products, ideas, and intellectual capital. They have, in that way, positioned themselves in leadership roles in the global market place of the new millennium. There is no gainsaying that, the evidence with independent initiatives all over the world, has revealed the potentials of Information and Communication Technology in, namely:- (i) Empowering people to help themselves in a very broad range of applications, irrespective of their age, gender, race or level of education; (ii) Addressing the multi-dimensional nature of poverty; and (iii) Transferring the initiatives for development from outside sources to individuals, communities, local authorities and nations.  These developments had together put a lot of emphasis on information networks and data bases for both government and large scale commercial uses. The social application of these technologies calls 
 2 BIS Review 27/2003 for emphasis on more user-friendly software, that people (including illiterate people) could interact with by entering their own information, for their own purposes, at a very low cost and at their own time. In addition, it demands quick access to the relevant information from distant sources. It is my noble opinion therefore, that since the technology is already here, what is absent is, a funding mechanism that will allow poor people access to such information and, the enabling environment in which this can be achieved. I think it was, Peter Drucker, the doyen of Management, who stated that, (cid:147)the importance of information technologies is not in their ability to increase the efficiency of current approaches but because they enable us to do new things(cid:148). Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, it is in this vein that I commend the efforts of the West African Institute of Information and Communications Technology (WAIICT) in their endeavor to build the first West African advanced and integrated information and communications technology institution of higher learning and to concomitantly, create Nigeria(cid:146)s Silicon Valley (ICT cluster). I was reliably informed that, the Institute will provide an opportunity for Nigerian and West African youths, to acquire the relevant skills and critical competencies required to participate in the new global information and communications technology-driven economy and provide the necessary human capital that would give them a competitive edge in the global market place. I am also aware that, WAIICT(cid:146)s proposition is simply to identify the best and brightest young men and women with interests in technology, and train them into world-class programmers and software developers. In addition, the Institute will equip students with the strategic and operational skills to manage projects and corporate enterprises to ensure that technology remains tied to market needs. The WAIICT initiative is also patterned along global ICT developments, where software development and programming languages require basically similar skills. I am tempted to say that with such an initiative, the West African sub-region and indeed the entire continent of Africa, can enjoy the benefits of an ICT revolution because of the availability of English-speaking, high quality and low cost labor. The need for software engineers in Germany has led the Foreign Minister to visit India on several occasions to lure Indian engineers into Germany. It has even prompted a revision of the German Immigration laws to accommodate that economic need. Another example is the case of ACS, a Ghanaian telecomputing, data processing and transcription service company, which is focused on serving high end U.S. clients and providing hardware and software training all over the continent. These examples suggest to me that Nigerian companies can also compete in the offshore IT space. Permit me, Ladies and Gentlemen to stress that, overall, the application of ICTs to facilitate the provision of public services, achieve productivity gains, improve the quality of life of our citizenry, and enhance access to information and facilitate knowledge-based sharing are all not only desirous but very necessary, for Nigeria to properly position itself and assume the much desired leadership role in our increasingly globalizing, information and communications technology driven world economic system. It is instructive to note that, since these achievements represent feats that Nigerian companies are yet to emulate, taking advantage of such opportunities requires the systematic creation of a competitive knowledge economy. This is what I think WAIICT is going to provide. It is a need that they have correctly identified to provide and I am calling on all patriots to join WAIICT in meeting this need. In concluding my brief remark this evening, May I state that poverty sits like an open sore on the consciences of the Nigerian elite. We should remember that many of the South East Asian countries who have leapfrogged their stages of development and are today, part of the emerging economies, were at the same level of development with Nigeria some three decades ago. With a mono-cultural economy totally dependent on oil, the diversification of the Nigerian revenue base becomes a compelling necessity and this can only be achieved through massive investments in Information and Communications Technology (ICT). India currently earns twice as much from software exports as Nigeria earns from oil. The time for us to act is now. Leapfrog Ventures Nigeria limited is bold to take the bull by the horn. Let us therefore support this worthy endeavor to transform the Nigerian economic landscape by investing in the shares of the West African Institute of Information and Communications Technology, giving grants or endowing Professorial chairs. I urge WAIICT investors to explore opportunities in the SMIEIS scheme which has accumulated over N14.6 billion naira as at end-May, 2003 With these few remarks, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish you an appetizing dinner.  Thank you for your time. 
 BIS Review 27/2003 1 Jean-Pierre Roth: Recent financial and economic developments in Switzerland Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the half-yearly media news conference, Berne, 13 June 2003. *      *      * The National Bank has decided to leave the target range for the three-month Libor rate unchanged at 0.0%-0.75%. For the time being, the three-month Libor is to be kept at the lower end of the target range at 0.25%. In the past two years we took decisive steps in response to declining economic growth and to the upward trend of the Swiss franc. Owing to the low inflationary pressure we have narrowed the target corridor for the three-month Libor by a total of 3.25 percentage points since March 2001. Interest rates were last lowered on 6 March of this year. The recovery of the global economy is likely to be delayed still further so that in Switzerland, too, any perceptible economic upswing can only be expected to materialise during the course of 2004. We are therefore maintaining our expansionary monetary policy and shall keep the attractiveness of Swiss franc investments low. This does not jeopardise price stability. Assuming that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 0.25%, average annual inflation is expected to amount to 0.6% this year, 0.4% next year, and 1.2% in 2005. For 2003 we anticipate real economic activity to stagnate overall. Let me continue by saying a few words about the financial markets. After that, I will focus on the Swiss economy and our new inflation forecast. The last part of my remarks will concentrate on the latest adjustment to the ECB(cid:146)s monetary policy concept and the National Bank(cid:146)s profit distribution. Financial markets After the war in Iraq the financial markets reassessed the economic situation. The risks emanating from the international political situation lost significance, and the markets returned their focus on the fundamentals. The different markets have been giving off mixed signals. On the one hand, yields on long-term bonds in the major currencies fell to their lowest level in years. This is a reflection of the fact that bond markets expect low inflation and subdued economic movement for an extended period. Equity markets, on the other hand, recovered somewhat in the second quarter. Risk premiums on corporate bonds went down as well. This is a sign that some market participants are quite confident that corporations will make a stronger showing. Exchange rates underwent a revaluation too. The marked decline of the US dollar against the euro can partly be interpreted as a normalisation after the previous exaggerations, and partly be attributed to the widening disequilibrium in the balance of payments and in the US budget. Moreover, given the extremely low US dollar interest rates, currency risks could be hedged at favourable conditions by concluding forward contracts - an attractive option in times of decreased risk capability. With the resulting forward sales the dollar came under further pressure. As regards the Swiss franc, we have noted that the euro/franc exchange rate has for the first time reached its pre-9/11 level.   The price losses on equities of the past few years - the SPI today is approximately 40% below its peak - have had a significant effect in Switzerland. They put pressure on both corporations and individuals, with foreseeable higher old-age provisions and nascent insecurity in this area being one of the concerns. The Swiss financial sector, which makes an above-average contribution to gross national product, has been particularly hard hit by the stock market correction. The cut-backs which are now necessary in the financial sector will put a strain on the Swiss economy for an extended period to come.  Economic activity Economic activity in Switzerland weakened in the first quarter of 2003. According to preliminary estimates of seco, real gross domestic product contracted compared with the previous period and was again slightly below the previous year(cid:146)s level. The renewed deterioration in the economic situation did not come unexpectedly. It was primarily the result of the recurring downturn of the global economy, which is partly a reflection of the uncertainties in connection with the Iraq war. Swiss exports were 
 2 BIS Review 27/2003 down again in the first quarter, and the foreign trade contribution became distinctly negative. Consumer spending had a slightly stabilising effect while investments continued to decline overall.  Even though geopolitical uncertainties have meanwhile largely given way, the economic situation in Switzerland remains difficult. The marked deterioration in the labour market makes for more uncertainty and depresses consumer sentiment. Even though there are first signs suggesting a stabilisation of demand for capital goods, corporate investment activity is still at a low ebb. Despite the weaker franc against the euro, incoming orders and the order backlog stayed at an unsatisfactory level up until April. Capacity utilisation in the industry remains inadequate. Swiss gross domestic product is therefore not likely to grow in the second quarter of 2003 either. Any recovery of the Swiss economy is dependent on a sustained increase in growth in exports, which should then lead to a turnaround in the currently still weak capital spending. We expect that this upswing will set in gradually in the second half of 2003 and then continue at a more vigorous pace next year. Private consumption should also pick up a little more. GDP growth is therefore likely to increase somewhat in the second half of the year but will nevertheless remain moderate. In the current year we anticipate real economic activity to stagnate overall. For next year we expect a perceptible economic upswing. We are likely to see a continued rise in unemployment to the end of the year and do not expect the labour market to improve before the middle of 2004.  Inflation forecast I shall now turn to the course of inflation and our new inflation forecast. Annual inflation, as measured by the national consumer price index, stood at 1.0% both in the fourth quarter of 2002 and the first quarter of 2003. In April, inflation dropped to 0.7% and amounted to 0.4% in May. This decline is primarily attributable to a basis effect. While inflation of domestic goods has remained fairly stable as of late, inflation of imported goods was relatively volatile. This is a result of oil prices having fluctuated sharply in the recent past. With regard to domestic goods, it is striking that rents have not risen for a while now while prices for other services - particularly public services - have augmented at an above-average rate. The core rate of inflation calculated by the National Bank has stood at slightly below 1% for a while.  This year the National Bank began publishing its inflation forecast once every quarter. Our inflation forecast of March 2003 (the dash-dotted green curve in the graph) shows that at that time we assumed, based on a stable three-month Libor rate of 0.25%, that inflation would gradually rise to 2.5% in the fourth quarter 2005. This inflation forecast was based on the assumption that the US economy would see a decisive recovery already from the second quarter of 2003, followed by an upswing in Europe toward the end of 2003. This proved to be too optimistic a scenario. In our latest inflation forecast (red dashed curve) we anticipate a renewed delay in the global recovery of just over half a year. Growth in the US, however, is likely to pick up as early as 2003. The US economy is not expected to reach its growth potential before the end of 2004, however. Economic activity in Europe will only see modest growth for the time being. We anticipate that a significant acceleration of growth will not set in before the middle of 2004, with potential growth being reached in the course of 2005. We assume that the dollar/euro rate will remain at about the current level and that the oil price will be around $25 per barrel. On the assumption that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 0.25% during the next three years, average inflation should amount to 0.6% in 2003, drop to 0.4% in 2004 and climb to 1.2% in 2005. It is thus forecast to remain under 1% until mid-2005. In the course of 2005, however, an acceleration will get under way, with forecast inflation reaching the 2.5% mark in the second quarter of 2006.  The new forecast is consistently below that of March 2003. The low inflation at the beginning of 2004 is attributable to a basis effect as a result of the development of oil prices. The lower inflation forecast for the period thereafter is due to the delayed economic upswing. According to the new forecast, inflation in 2006 is no longer in the range that the National Bank equates with price stability. It should be noted that these forecasts assume that monetary policy will remain expansive over the next three years. We can preempt such a rise in inflation by tightening monetary policy at a later time. 
 BIS Review 27/2003 3 Relaxed monetary policy Our interest rate cut of 50 basis points last March was the last possible downward interest rate adjustment. Our intention was to resolutely counter the appreciation of the Swiss franc vis-(cid:224)-vis the euro in the current difficult economic environment. So far, it has been a successful step: the Swiss franc has depreciated markedly against the euro. Monetary conditions have again become considerably more relaxed. For the time being, we intend to continue to implement an expansionary monetary policy and to support the economic recovery in Switzerland. Swiss franc investments are to remain unattractive in the foreseeable future. Economic recovery is still uncertain. There is even recurring talk of a deflation risk in Switzerland. We consider this to be a minimal risk. In a few months, inflation may well be negative. An actual deflation spiral leading to a strong decline in the demand for goods and in output is, however, highly unlikely as long as the Swiss franc does not appreciate inordinately. We shall therefore continue to take decisive steps to combat a tightening of the monetary conditions brought about by any significant rise of the Swiss franc against the euro.  You will certainly have taken note of the high growth rates of the money supply aggregates in the last few quarters. The money supply aggregates are currently growing at rates last seen at the end of the eighties. The question arises to what extent this expansion in the money supply has an inflationary effect. First, let it be said that we are deliberately conducting an expansionary policy. That partly explains the above-average money supply growth. It also must be noted, however, that the painful experiences investors have made on the stock markets and the uncertain economic situation have significantly heightened the preference for liquidity. A look at credit statistics confirms that the money supply did not grow as a result of credit creation and therefore does not serve to finance any existing demand for goods. Moreover, our economy currently has free capacities so that increased demand will not immediately push up prices. We are therefore convinced that we have sufficient time at our disposal to keep inflation within the bounds of price stability by tightening monetary policy at a later point in time.  I should like to emphasise once more that in the present situation other efforts are needed besides an expansionary monetary policy in order to maintain or to enhance the attractiveness of Switzerland as an industrial and business centre. Such efforts include a further liberalisation of the domestic economy, an increase in competitiveness in the structurally weak sectors, and sound public finances. Adjustment of the monetary policy concept of the ECB A few weeks ago, the European Central Bank (ECB) finalised a monetary policy assessment and slightly adjusted its monetary policy concept. In future, the ECB will no longer lay down the reference value for the money supply M3 every year but will keep it unchanged for longer periods of time. In communicating its monetary policy decisions, the ECB will, other than in the past, first comment the general price and economic development and only afterwards the development of the money supply. Furthermore, the ECB has confirmed its definition of price stability. It considers price stability to have been achieved when the inflation rate is below 2%. At the same time, the ECB has announced that it will now be aiming at an inflation rate of nearly 2% in the medium term. The National Bank defines price stability in the same way as the ECB. The question thus arises whether we, too, should as a principle aim at the upper level in the range of price stability. We see no reason to make any changes in our concept. Switzerland is a small open economy and the proportion of imported goods in the national consumer price index amounts to 25%. As a result of exchange rate fluctuations, the inflation rates are significantly more volatile than in the euro area. There is therefore no sense in aiming at an excessively narrow range of inflation. Such temporary fluctuations in inflation do not pose a problem for the Swiss economy and should not be countered by means of special monetary policy actions. Furthermore, the euro area also has the problem that there is a large spread in inflation between the peripheral countries and the countries at the centre. In striving for an inflation rate of less than, but close to, 2% in the medium term in the entire euro area, the ECB is trying to prevent inflation in the central countries from being pushed down towards zero, or even below zero, for any length of time. In Switzerland, this problem does not exist as only inflation measured in Switzerland is relevant for our monetary policy.  
 4 BIS Review 27/2003 Additional agreement between the Federal Department of Finance and the SNB on the distribution of profits on the free assets At yesterday(cid:146)s meeting the Bank Council of the National Bank agreed to an additional agreement between the Federal Department of Finance and the Swiss National Bank on the distribution of profits on the free assets (income on reinvested proceeds from gold sales). The profit distribution of the National Bank will thus increase by Sfr 300 million to a total of Sfr 2.8 billion (for the financial year 2003) in spring 2004. In 2005 and 2006, it will be gradually raised up to Sfr 3 billion. The National Bank(cid:146)s profit distribution has so far not taken account of this income on reinvested gold proceeds.  On discussing this transaction, the bank authorities of the National Bank expressed their concern that it was now even more obvious that the National Bank(cid:146)s profit transfer was reaching a level that cannot be maintained in the long term. The Governing Board shares the bank authorities(cid:146) concern that a later return to the (cid:147)normal level(cid:148), which will only amount to approximately Sfr 1 billion, is likely to create considerable political difficulties.  From today(cid:146)s vantage point, it cannot be ruled out, moreover, that as a result of the additional distribution on the income-yielding free assets the National Bank(cid:146)s provisions will be reduced more rapidly than had been assumed when the main agreement on the National Bank(cid:146)s profit distribution was concluded in April 2002. At 2.9% a year, the income forecast on which this agreement was based is rather optimistic given the low yield level on the financial markets for some time to come. It may therefore well be that a downward adjustment will become necessary as early as 2007, when, in terms of the agreement, the level of distribution will be reconsidered. In any case, the National Bank does not consider an annual profit distribution of Sfr 3 billion from 2007 onward as by any means a certainty.  We think it is important to draw attention to these risks well in time. We also explained them to the Head of the Federal Department of Finance and asked him to advise the responsible persons of the cantons of our misgivings.

 BIS Review 26/2003 1 Bank of Japan’s June report of recent economic and financial developments1 Bank of Japan, 12 June 2003. *      *      * The Bank’s view2 Economic activity remains virtually flat as a whole, although exports are currently showing some weakness. With regard to final demand, business fixed investment is on a gradual recovery trend, albeit showing some fluctuations. Meanwhile, private consumption continues to be weak, housing investment remains sluggish, and public investment is declining.  Net exports are currently somewhat weak, although their underlying trend remains virtually flat.    Industrial production continues to be basically level in response to these developments in final demand.  Under these circumstances, corporate profits continue to recover, although the pace is moderating.  As for the employment situation, the number of employees, which covers various types of employees including non-regular employees such as temporary workers, appears to be declining at a slower pace.  However, the increase in the overtime hours worked and new job offers has come to a halt.  Firms are still maintaining their stance on reducing personnel expenses, and household income continues to decrease with the ongoing decline in wages.  The employment and income situation of households overall remains severe. Turning to the economic outlook, a widely shared view of the prospect for overseas economies is that the growth rate, especially that of the U.S. economy, will accelerate in the second half of this year with diminishing uncertainty regarding Iraq-related developments.  For the time being, however, the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy is projected to remain very gradual.  Moreover, the growth of East Asian economies at present is likely to be slowing at least temporarily, due mainly to the deceleration of domestic demand in South Korea and the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).  In this situation, for the time being, exports are projected to be slightly weak or flat and industrial production is expected to remain virtually level.   With respect to domestic demand, public investment is projected to follow a declining trend, and private consumption is likely to remain weak for some time due to the severe employment and income situation.  An uptrend of business fixed investment will be established once exports and production increase clearly again, but for the time being, the increase in business investment is expected to remain very modest.   Overall, assuming that the growth rate of overseas economies accelerates in the second half of this year, the uptrend in exports and production will resume sooner or later, which in turn will initiate the momentum for an economic recovery in Japan.  However, a self-sustaining recovery in domestic demand is unlikely to gain momentum for some time, since production is expected to be virtually unchanged for the time being while downward pressures such as excessive labor input and debt persist.  As for the outlook for the external environment, there continues to be substantial uncertainty about the outlook for the U.S. and European economies as well as the possible effects of the SARS epidemic in the East Asian region, whose economies are closely linked to Japan’s.  On the domestic side, developments in the financial system and their influences on stock prices, corporate finance, and the economy continue to require careful monitoring.   On the price front, import prices and domestic corporate goods prices have turned to decline, mainly reflecting crude oil prices that fell back in early spring.  The rate of decline in corporate services prices                                                       1  This report is based on data and information available at the time of the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting held on June 10 and 11, 2003. 2  The Bank’s view of recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on June 10 and 11, 2003 as the basis for monetary policy decisions. 
 2 BIS Review 26/2003 expanded in April, as many firms reprice at the beginning of a new fiscal year.  Meanwhile, the rate of decline in consumer prices has diminished due mainly to the rise in medical treatment costs in line with the reform of the medical insurance system. Looking at the conditions influencing price developments, import prices are expected to continue declining for the immediate future, due mainly to the lingering effects of the fall in crude oil prices.  On the domestic side, the supply-demand balance in the macroeconomy, ongoing technological innovations in machinery, and the streamlining of distribution channels will continue to exert downward pressure on prices.  In addition, the increase in commodity prices has peaked out.  Based on these factors, domestic corporate goods prices are likely to continue declining.  Meanwhile, consumer prices are projected to continue falling at the current moderate pace on a year-on-year basis.  While the rise in prices of petroleum products is peaking out, the import of consumer goods, which is strongly related to low-price strategies of firms, is not increasing as it once was.   As for the financial environment, the outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank of Japan is recently moving at around 28-29 trillion yen, as the Bank has been providing more ample liquidity in accordance with the guideline for money market operations decided at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on May 20.  Under these circumstances, the overnight call rate continues to move at around zero percent.  Longer-term interest rates remain steady at low levels. Yields on long-term government bonds have declined to the 0.4-0.5 percent level, as banks and institutional investors continue to increase investment in government bonds.  Yield spreads between private bonds (bank bonds and corporate bonds) and government bonds are at historical lows. Stock prices have risen following the recovery in U.S. and European stock prices.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average is recently moving at the 8,500-9,000 yen level. In the foreign exchange market, the yen depreciated as market participants became sensitive to a possible market intervention and as some U.S. economic indicators improved.  The yen is currently traded in the range of 117-119 yen to the U.S. dollar.   With regard to corporate finance, private banks remain cautious in extending loans to firms with high credit risks while they continue to be more active in extending loans to blue-chip companies.  Recently, their lending attitudes seem to be becoming slightly more accommodative in areas such as interest margin charges.  Meanwhile, the lending attitudes of financial institutions as perceived by firms, particularly small ones, remain severe.  In the corporate bond and CP markets, the issuing environment for firms with high credit ratings continues to be accommodative, and the environment for firms with relatively low credit ratings is improving. Credit demand in the private sector continues to follow a downtrend mainly because business fixed investment is at low levels and firms are continuously reducing their debts. Amid these developments, private banks’ lending continues to decline by about 2.0-2.5 percent on a year-on-year basis.  The amount outstanding of corporate bonds and CP issued is moving at around the previous year’s level.   Meanwhile, according to business surveys, although there seem to be slight improvements, financial positions of firms, particularly those of small firms, remain severe. The year-on-year growth rate of the monetary base rose somewhat and is around 15 percent.  The year-on-year growth rate of the money stock is around 1.5 percent.  Funding costs for firms continue to be at extremely low levels on the whole. Against the above background, the financial developments are summarized as follows.  Money market conditions continue to be extremely easy due partly to the additional monetary easing by the Bank.  Long-term interest rates are declining further and stock prices are recently recovering.  The money stock and the monetary base maintain high growth rates relative to that of economic activity as a whole.  In corporate finance, the fund-raising environment has not changed significantly, that is, the environment for firms, particularly with high credit risks, remains severe, although slight improvements are observed such as in the issuing environment of corporate bonds and CP.  Developments in the financial and capital markets, the behavior of financial institutions, and the situation of corporate finance continue to require close monitoring. 
BIS Review 26/2003 1 Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Basel II - scope of application in the United States Speech by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Institute of International Bankers, New York, 10 June 2003.  *      *      * I am delighted to join you today as you gather for your Annual General Meeting of the Institute of International Bankers. Larry Uhlick suggested that I might provide an overview of key trends and developments in the regulation and supervision of internationally active banks. Basel II, of course, is the key issue today, and given that the U.S. agencies' position on scope of application has clear implications for your banks' operations in this country, choosing Basel II and its scope of application in the United States as my topic was not difficult.  As you all know, Basel II refers to the proposed new capital accord developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The committee's third consultative paper was issued for public comment about six weeks ago, and the U.S. agencies plan to issue their preliminary proposals for implementation in this country next month in an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR). At the same time, the U.S. authorities will release the first of a series of draft supervisory guidelines to assist bankers in understanding what supervisors will be expecting of U.S. banks. The agencies are actively seeking comments on all these documents. It is not too late to shape Basel II's final form or the way it will be implemented in this country, provided that comments are directed at the way to improve methods and procedures for obtaining the same objectives. We are open-minded and are willing to make changes that meet such criteria.  Even though the U.S. ANPR has not yet been released, the authorities have already made known their intended scope of application in this country: which banks will be required to apply Basel II, which banks may choose to adopt the new accord, and which banks may choose to remain under Basel I. This decision is of particular interest, I would think, to this audience because it raises the risk that non-U.S. banks will be required to operate in the United States under rules that will differ from those that apply to their parent bank in their home country and affiliated banks in third countries. I hope that, by the time you leave this room, you will see that such potential conflicts are more apparent than real.  Scope of Application in the United States The major goal of the Basel Accord of 1988 (Basel I) was to align the capital requirements of institutions that competed across national boundaries. The Group of Ten and other nations that subsequently adopted Basel I applied it to all their banks, but the Accord focused, and its proposed new version continues to focus, on obtaining a level playing field for cross-border banks. Throughout the discussions and negotiations of Basel II, the United States has emphasized that its interest is in ensuring that banks competing in each other's countries be subject to the same capital regime. Of course, we also want at least those banks to benefit from more-risk-sensitive capital requirements that call for more-sophisticated systems for risk measurement and management.  We have concluded, therefore, that the U.S. chartered banks (including subsidiaries of foreign banks) that both are large in scale and have significant foreign activities should be required to adopt Basel II. These U.S. banks are significant competitors in foreign markets and must, if we are to honor our commitments to other countries, be subject to the new Accord. The exact parameters that establish this core set of U.S. banks, those that will be required to adopt Basel II, will be released in the ANPR next month. There are about ten such banks, and each one has been notified about the requirement.  The U.S. authorities are also proposing to permit any U.S. bank that can meet the infrastructure requirements for the advanced approaches for handling credit and operational risk to choose to follow Basel II capital requirements. Our best guess is that another ten or so banks will choose Basel II capital requirements in this country in the first round. We believe that the decisions of these banks will reflect their perceptions of their self-interest from either their implied new capital charges under Basel II or the message they want to send their counterparties about their risk-management techniques. We expect that, as time passes, additional larger banks, responding to market pressures, will opt for Basel 
2 BIS Review 26/2003 II. Moreover, the current activities of still other banks suggest that current trends will put them in the mandatory core group in coming years.  As U.S. supervisors have previously stated, in this country we expect to apply, for regulatory capital purposes, only the advanced internal-ratings-based (A-IRB) approach for credit risk and the advanced measurement approach (AMA) for operational risk. In line with our additional goal of improving risk-management techniques, the authorities believe that the largest, most complex, internationally active banking organizations in the United States - those that our screening criteria determine to be core banks - should be subject to the most sophisticated version of Basel II. To be clear, we are not proposing to implement either the standardized or the foundation internal-ratings-based (F-IRB) approaches within the United States.  The twenty banks that we are assuming will be under Basel II in this country either by, or shortly after, the initial implementation date would account for about 99 percent of the foreign assets held by the top fifty domestic U.S. banking organizations. We believe that this high percentage clearly signals our intent to meet our obligation to ensure cross-border competitive equality of capital regimes. That the same twenty banks also currently account for approximately two-thirds of the domestic assets of U.S. banking organization indicates their importance to our banking and financial system. These entities must operate under the best risk-management standards with the most risk-sensitive capital treatment.  We do not intend to require the thousands of other banking organizations in the United States, including U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks that do not meet the mandatory criteria, to adopt Basel II.1 Unless they choose to adopt Basel II, they will remain under our current regulatory capital rules, which are based on Basel I. Those banks remaining under Basel I will not be subject to an explicit regulatory capital charge for operational risk. To be sure, any of these organizations can choose the Basel II requirements whenever they want, provided they meet the infrastructure prerequisites of the A-IRB and the AMA approaches to Basel II. We believe that the cost-benefit nexus will make this option infeasible for most of these banks in the years immediately ahead, but ultimately that decision resides with the banks themselves. Nonetheless, as the cost of risk-management techniques decline with their wider dissemination and as counter-parties and stakeholders seek the comfort that comes with banks' application of more-sophisticated risk-management techniques, the larger regional banks may wish to migrate from rules based on Basel I to those based on Basel II. Even if larger regional banks do not formally choose to operate under Basel II for regulatory purposes, we expect they may wish to make use of the risk-management process that underlies Basel II. Indeed, I should emphasize that the movement toward more-sophisticated risk management, the prerequisite of A-IRB and AMA, is occurring, and would continue to occur, independent of Basel II. This movement is clearly a market trend reflective of evolving technology, growing complexity, and the understanding of modern finance.  For thousands of U.S. banks, the migration to a regulatory capital regime based on advanced risk-management techniques is unlikely to occur for many years, however. As a supervisor who believes strongly in a safe and sound banking system, I want to share with you why it is totally acceptable that these entities, whose activities are almost completely limited to those within the United States, remain on the less risk sensitive capital rules based on Basil I.  First, their balance sheet and operational structure are relatively straightforward and do not require the sophisticated risk-management techniques of modern finance, although most of these institutions have adopted some of them, like credit scoring.  Second, most of these banks already hold considerable capital: More than 93 percent of them have risk-weighted capital ratios in excess of 10 percent - fully 2 percentage points over the minimum and a capital buffer of 25 percent.2 In part, this strong capital position reflects market realities required of entities whose scale makes raising additional capital, especially under duress, very difficult and whose geographic concentrations of credit risk require greater capital support. In part, it reflects the desire of bank management to hold buffer capital - above regulatory minimums - for the flexibility and survivability that additional capital provides for smaller banks. And in part, it reflects statutory provisions in the United States that link permissible activities to capital positions - including minimum                                                       1  At the end of 2002, there were in the United States 4,998 bank and financial holding companies (some with more than one bank subsidiary) and 1,493 independent banks (not in holding companies), for a total of 6,491 banking organizations. 2  These well-capitalized banks account for 96.5 percent of the assets of all the U.S. banks that are not in the top twenty banks that are likely to be under Basel II. 
BIS Review 26/2003 3 leverage ratios of equity to unweighted total assets; thus as capital ratios decline, supervisors are required to take action. These "prompt corrective action" provisions play a significant role in maintaining the strong capital position of U.S. banks, above and beyond the Basel minimums.  Third, as this audience well knows, the United States for some time has had an effective Pillar II, or procedure for supervisory review and guidance. That supervisors evaluate and review banks' operations and policies and discuss their views and suggestions with bank managers has been part of our institutional framework. In certain cases, supervisors may encourage institutions to hold additional capital for risks, such as concentrations, that the Basel I rules do not capture directly. For the United States banking authorities, Pillar II of Basel II requires nothing new.  Finally, banks in this country have for quite a while disclosed their capital ratios. The banks that are publicly held and those that issue publicly held securities are required to disclose even more data, although admittedly less than the requirement proposed under Pillar III of Basel II. Moreover, even for smaller banking organizations, considerable information is publicly disseminated - for example, through our Call Reports - and is available for counterparties.  When the U.S. authorities considered the cost-benefit ratio of requiring thousands of our banks to become subject to Basel II - presumably the standardized version - we saw the benefits as (1) only slightly more risk sensitivity in the calculation of the minimum regulatory capital requirements under the Standardized version that presumably these banks would select, and (2) more disclosure under Pillar III. In exchange, smaller banks (1) would have to bear additional costs, even though they already maintain far more capital than any change in the required regulatory minimum would produce; (2) would not need, nor be required to adopt, any different risk-management techniques under the Standardized approach; (3) would benefit from no new supervisory oversight under Pillar II; and (4) already disclose considerable information. For all these reasons, the U.S. authorities did not believe that requiring most U.S. banks to bear the cost of shifting from Basel I-based rules to Basel II was reasonable.  Of course, supervisors of banks using Basel I-based rules in the United States will continue to seek a full understanding of each bank's process for risk measurement and management as part of their usual efforts to fully evaluate a bank's operations. Asking questions about these important management responsibilities is simply a part of appropriate supervisory oversight.  I underline that not many jurisdictions outside the United States have smaller banks - those likely to move to the Standardized version if they adopt Basel II - with the capital position, the intimate supervisory review, or the existing disclosure rules of U.S. banks. Thus, the proposal in this country has no implications for the desirability and benefit of applying Basel II to smaller banks in other jurisdictions that might benefit significantly from the Standardized Basel II approach. Indeed, the U.S. experience proves the value of enhanced supervision and greater transparency even for the smallest institution.  Implications for the treatment of U.S. banks abroad As many of you know, the Basel Committee has established a separate subgroup to deal specifically with cross-country implementation issues. The Basel Accord Implementation Group (AIG) comprises line supervisors directly involved in the supervision of large, complex banks in member countries. The AIG has already begun to explore and develop solutions for some of the complex issues arising from cross-border implementation. In addition, the members of the AIG have already established a constructive dialogue with a working group representing non-G10 jurisdictions on the practical challenges of implementation.  As I noted, we anticipate that U.S. banking organizations that account for 99 percent of the foreign assets and two-thirds of all assets of our domestic banking system will be under the A-IRB and AMA version of Basel II and thus will be fully compliant with the letter, and certainly the spirit, of the new Basel Accord. U.S. institutions operating under Basel II will apply the framework to the consolidated organization, so that the foreign branches and subsidiaries of these U.S. organizations thus will be in full compliance with the home country rules of the new Accord. We anticipate that these institutions, by operating under A-IRB and AMA, will also be in compliance with the regulatory capital rules of any host country in which they operate. Of course, foreign branches and subsidiaries of U.S. organizations will also have to comply with any special rules applied in the host country.  
4 BIS Review 26/2003 In addition, some U.S. organizations engaging in a relatively small amount of cross-border activity may decide to remain on Basel I-based rules in this country. We anticipate that, so long as their capital position remains strong and they present no supervisory issues, these entities will be able to continue their cross-border activities. In effect, we believe that our well-capitalized standards, combined with our strong supervisory framework, will allow U.S. banks to meet any requirements for consolidated capital requirements in foreign countries and that those standards result in capital requirements at least as prudent as Basel II approaches for their home country banks. In this case, too, any foreign subsidiary of a U.S. bank would naturally have to adhere to the host country rules applied to bank subsidiaries there. We acknowledge that some of these details still have to be clarified - exactly the task that the AIG has undertaken. But I would like to emphasize that these issues relating to Basel II are not necessarily new, since we have been dealing with differences in capital rules among countries for many years, but just perhaps more complex.  Implications for the treatment of foreign banks in the United States Now we have arrived at the point that you all have been waiting patiently to hear. What does the proposed scope of application of Basel II in the United States mean for the treatment of foreign banks that operate subsidiaries and branches in this country? It has, of course, few implications for branches in the United States because they are not directly subject to U.S. capital requirements. In addition, U.S. supervisors expect that whichever Basel II approach a foreign bank chooses for its consolidated operations will be acceptable for allowing branch and subsidiary operations in the United States or for evaluating the financial holding company well-capitalized criteria that are applied at the consolidated level. For that matter, we anticipate continuing to accept Basel I-based calculations for such purposes if that is the approach that the home country supervisor continues to employ.  Any U.S. bank subsidiary of a foreign bank will, of course, have to comply with U.S. rules for banks, just as foreign bank subsidiaries of U.S. banks will have to do in their host countries. The principle that subsidiaries must comply with host country rules has been discussed by the AIG, and this long-held view has been widely accepted. Moreover, national treatment requires that the rules that apply to purely domestic banks will apply equally to subsidiaries of foreign banks operating in a host country. In the U.S. context, this principle means that a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign bank will eventually have to choose whether it wants to be under the A-IRB and AMA approaches of Basel II, requiring it to meet the same infrastructure prerequisites as other U.S. banks, or to remain under the current Basel I-based rules.  Admittedly, this policy path chosen by U.S. supervisors may present some important choices for foreign banks that operate a U.S. bank subsidiary. For foreign banks operating under A-IRB and AMA on a consolidated basis under their home country rules, choosing A-IRB and AMA for their U.S. bank subsidiaries would not present any particular problems. Granted, there could be some differences in areas of national discretion for specific elements of the Accord; but in terms of the overall approach, things should align well.  The U.S. authorities understand, however, that some foreign banks, including those with subsidiaries here, are targeting the F-IRB approach as their preferred global starting point for Basel II. There would, of course, be no significant issue for such organizations if their subsidiary banks in the United States chose A-IRB and AMA while their parent remained on F-IRB. In this instance, the U.S. subsidiary would have to meet the U.S. requirements for A-IRB and AMA, but in so doing it would be able to deliver all the necessary inputs for F-IRB at the consolidated level.  A more difficult problem arises if the U.S. bank subsidiary remains on Basel I-based rules. The subsidiary would not be generating IRB parameter inputs for its U.S. regulatory capital requirements that could naturally feed into calculations for consolidated capital requirements for F-IRB at the home country level. Clearly U.S. supervisors see that this latter case could be burdensome for foreign banks, and we are prepared, with our colleagues on the AIG, to assist local subsidiaries in developing the inputs they need for the consolidated parent. In general, most of these banks already employ sophisticated risk-measurement techniques in order to compete in the U.S. market. Moreover, their exposures are skewed toward large corporate firms for which information that can be used to estimate the necessary risk inputs is abundant.  The most difficult problem occurs for a foreign bank that chooses F-IRB at home and chooses A-IRB here. The bank here will have to determine parameters for loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) for regulatory capital requirements on its corporate exposures here and use those 
BIS Review 26/2003 5 parameters in the risk measurement and management of the U.S. bank, whereas the parent bank will have to develop and use only probability of default (PD) estimates for such exposures at home. Gathering the data and generating viable estimates of LGDs and EADs poses some challenges. To be sure, we believe that the availability of external data sources developed in the United States to help in the generation of these variables will be reasonably wide. Still, some effort will be required, and that effort will not be costless. The cost of developing these parameters and using them in their U.S. operations is likely to be the most difficult problem for foreign banks that do not adopt A-IRB at home.  The U.S. agencies did not make their decisions about implementing only the most advanced versions of Basel II lightly. We concluded that, in our markets, entities that are large enough to use IRB techniques should do so using the more-sophisticated approach that includes LGDs and EADs in the process of risk measurement and management. We felt it was important to tailor implementation of Basel II to our own individual banking and financial environment, as other authorities will be doing for their own markets, even though it means the reconciliation of the different approaches to implementation across countries will create some complications for banking organizations. The AIG is working hard to minimize those effects, and we have confidence in their ability to develop reasonable and effective solutions.  Nonetheless, we appreciate our responsibility to work with U.S. subsidiaries whose foreign bank parent will, at least initially, adopt F-IRB in their home country. For example, we are prepared to explore the possibility of allowing U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks to use conservative estimates of LGD and EAD for a finite transitional period, when data are not yet available for parts of some portfolios. If adopted, this approach would apply equally to fully domestic U.S. banks adopting A-IRB. For both sets of banks, any transition measures would need to be limited in both scope and duration. We are also willing to consider methodologies that would permit foreign banks to allocate a portion of their overall operational-risk capital charge for the consolidated entity to the U.S. bank subsidiary, possibly including allocations from non-AMA approaches for a limited period of time. Such transitional approaches indicate our willingness to approach the implementation of Basel II pragmatically.  The upcoming ANPR will lay out these issues in more detail, from the perspective of the United States, but we will also have to incorporate the parallel work of the AIG. To the extent that you have concerns about cross-border implementation issues now, we urge you to engage in discussions with U.S. supervisors and provide comments on any U.S. documents that address the issue. In what perhaps would follow naturally, we also suggest that you inform your home country supervisors about these same issues so that discussions at the AIG level will be that much more efficient.  In short, let us know what problems our scope of application proposal may cause you, and most particularly, please let us know your suggestions for how to address them. As I have indicated, we are starting from the presumption that we intend to implement only the A-IRB and AMA alternatives of Basel II in the United States and are not eager to reverse course in that regard. Nevertheless, we do want to consider elements that would allow us to meet the objectives we consider to be important while limiting any unnecessary burdens on your institutions.  A digression Please allow me to comment briefly on the treatment of capital requirements for commercial real estate (CRE) exposures. I understand that this issue is not of primary concern to most foreign banks, but it may have become confusing for many observers of the U.S. position on Basel II.  For many, but not all, U.S. supervisors, CRE exposures in general, and CRE exposures to finance certain property types in particular, are believed to involve more risk than, say, commercial and industrial (C&I) loans. This view has been maintained despite the clearly improved underwriting and appraisal methods that followed U.S. banks' experience in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the associated changes in regulations. The continuing perception of higher risks for CRE credits, despite these developments, reflects the judgment and evidence that losses on individual defaulted CRE properties increase when defaults rise. In other words, CRE exposures have a high asset correlation and thus require higher capital charges.  For this reason, the U.S. representatives on the Basel Supervisors Committee argued strongly for two CRE capital functions that translated the risk parameters into capital requirements: One would be identical to the C&I function and would be for CRE exposures with low asset correlation, and one would require larger capital for the same risk parameters and would apply to exposures with higher asset correlation. Further, the Committee proposed in CP3 that, with certain exceptions, all 
6 BIS Review 26/2003 Acquisition, Development, and Construction (ADC) loans on CRE properties would be on the high asset correlation function and that nations would have the option of applying in their jurisdiction that higher function to those CRE loans on in-place property that they felt met thresholds for high asset correlation. Importantly, the Committee also agreed that, when countries did so, supervisors would ensure that all IRB banks - domestic and foreign - making similar loans in that jurisdiction would be subject to these definitions. Thus, for those of your institutions that finance office buildings in the United States, for example, this discussion is not purely academic.  The evidence available to the Federal Reserve seemed to support the need in the United States for the high asset correlation function for some types of CRE loans for in-place property. These data for banks, unfortunately, were for a limited period, and additional data that recently came to our attention for other lenders for a longer period produced conflicting evidence. Although our supervisory judgment still is that some of these exposures have high asset correlation, the mixed evidence does not support our position to the standard we believe necessary for applying such a distinction in the regulatory framework. Consequently, the ANPR to be released next month will propose that all CRE loans in the United States for in-place properties be on the low asset correlation function, as all C&I loans are. We will propose for comment the CP3 approach to ADC loans, with certain exceptions.  However, in reflection of supervisory concerns and judgment, we will propose that estimates of loss given default - a key risk parameter under Basel II - for CRE loans on in-place properties be based on historical loss rates during periods of high default. This approach, we believe, will capture some of the risk that has historically accompanied such exposures.  I would like to emphasize that this change in position reflects the evidence that was provided to us to supplement the evidence we gathered ourselves. It shows the willingness of the regulators to remain open-minded about the Basel II proposals, so long as comments are based on analysis and evidence and remain consistent with the objectives of Basel II.  Summary I will conclude by just noting a few highlights.  The U.S. authorities are proposing that in this country the A-IRB and AMA approaches of Basel II be required of only the large, internationally active banks that meet certain criteria for size and foreign activity and be permitted to any bank that meets the infrastructure prerequisites of the A-IRB and AMA approaches. All other banking organizations would remain under Basel I. The proposal does not offer the Basel Standardized or Foundation IRB approaches as additional alternatives.  This proposal, the authorities believe, is consistent with a level playing field internationally in that it requires the banks that compete materially across national boundaries to be under a Basel II capital regime. It would apply the most sophisticated option to the largest U.S. organizations for which better risk measurement and risk management are most critical. It permits U.S. organizations that wish to choose the more-sophisticated approaches to do so. But it avoids additional costs and burdens on most U.S. banking organizations - those that have less pressing needs for improved risk-management techniques and already have high capital positions, are effectively subject to Pillar II supervisory oversight, and disclose considerable information.  The U.S. authorities believe that the few U.S. banks that will remain on Basel I but that have small offices or subsidiaries abroad should be permitted by host countries to maintain those operations so long as the organization retains a high capital position and strong U.S. supervisory oversight. Foreign subsidiaries of U.S. banks, of course, would be subject to whatever requirements the host country imposes on all banks operating in its jurisdiction, including Basel II requirements.  We will be working with the AIG at Basel to minimize any issues that may arise because of different capital regimes for the consolidated operations of foreign banks and the choices available to their subsidiaries in the United States. U.S. supervisors will cooperate with foreign supervisors to provide any required inputs from U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks that the home country supervisors need for their consolidated supervision. The banking agencies here are also willing to consider transition methodologies to assist foreign banks that want to use IRB here to adopt A-IRB and AMA approaches. We urge U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks, in commenting on the U.S. ANPR, to advise both U.S. and home country supervisors of any problems that our proposed scope of applications may cause them and, in particular, of their suggestions for addressing these problems, while recognizing the desire of the U.S. authorities to apply only the advanced portions of Basel II in this country.  
 BIS Review 26/2003 1 I J Macfarlane: Recent financial and economic developments in Australia Opening statement by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, Melbourne, 6 June 2003.  *      *      * In the six months since we last appeared before this Committee we have received a lot of information on the world economy, but it has not resolved the uncertainties we have lived with for a year or so now. As you will recall, 2002 started out on a promising note, but the momentum of global growth waned in the second half of the year. A return to firmer growth was expected early in 2003, but observers watching for signs of that quickly found the picture clouded by concerns about the growing likelihood of war in Iraq, and then its actual occurrence. The war itself carried obvious risks, not least of which was a big rise in the price of oil, and its effects on confidence masked the underlying economic trends. The relatively quick resolution of hostilities, and the associated drop in the price of oil, was a major plus for the global economy, compared with the possible alternative. Confidence recovered some ground and attention returned to underlying economic trends, but the incoming data did not give any encouragement; it is now clear that a pick-up in global growth has not occurred in the first half of 2003. The international forecasting community have now pushed the forecast pick-up back to the second half of the year, though there are few signs in support of this view as yet. It is not surprising, in this environment, that financial markets are giving rather mixed messages. Around the world bond yields have fallen recently to historical lows, indicating participants in this market see a weaker outlook for growth and inflation. Equity markets, on the other hand, have been steadier, after two-and-a-half years of falls. In the United States markets have even made noticeable gains in recent weeks, suggesting that some of the gloom may be lifting. Foreign exchange markets continue the trend that started about 18 months ago, with the US dollar falling, the Yen remaining broadly stable and a group of currencies including the Euro, the Swiss Franc and the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars rising. Where does that leave Australia? I will start to answer that question in the traditional way by evaluating and then updating the forecasts that I gave the Committee last time. When we met in December last year, I said that we expected GDP to grow by 3 per cent through the year to June 2003, that is through the present financial year. This was slower than in other recent years, and an important reason for this was the temporary contractionary influence of the drought. When we moved the forecast horizon along six months, that is to the end of 2003, we expected the growth rate to rise to 3¾ per cent. The outcome for growth through 2002/03 looks like it will be close to the 3 per cent forecast, or only a little below it. As we look slightly further ahead, however, prospects are not as strong as they were. Instead of 3¾ per cent through calendar 2003, growth might now be more like 3 per cent. What has caused this downward revision to the outlook? The main explanation is the weaker performance of the world economy we have seen to date, which is affecting Australia’s trade performance. Our imports have continued to grow in line with our quite strong domestic demand, but our exports have fallen appreciably, and there is less confidence that they will be lifted in the near future by firmer foreign demand. I will say more about this in a few minutes. The inflation forecast I gave last time was for the rise in the CPI to exceed 3 per cent in the near term and then to ease to about 2¾ per cent in the 12 months to end 2003. The first part of this forecast has occurred as the CPI in the most recent 12-month period (to the March quarter 2003) ran at 3.4 per cent, pushed up by the high oil prices in that quarter. But the oil price pressures have already reversed, and when we looked at the likely outcome in the remainder of 2003 and into 2004 in the May Statement on Monetary Policy, we reduced our inflation forecast from 2¾ per cent to 2½ per cent, largely because of the higher exchange rate for the Australian dollar. Since the Statement was released, of course, the exchange rate has risen further. 
 2 BIS Review 26/2003 Let me say a little more about the domestic economy. The thing that stands out is that domestic demand had been growing at a very high rate. For example, it grew by 6½ per cent last year. This was unlikely to be continued over a long period, and over the most recent four quarters, it has slowed to 5½ per cent. We expect some further deceleration as we look ahead, but the most recent data do not suggest it will be large. Consumption has grown by 3½ per cent over the year to the March quarter and more recent data such as retail trade show good rises in the two most recent months – March and April. Given the growth in employment and incomes, and the fact that consumer confidence is above its longer-term average, prospects for consumption look quite good. Similarly, private investment according to the latest CAPEX survey is holding up well. We cannot expect a repeat of the 20 per cent growth we had last year, but a figure of the order of 10 per cent is likely, given the strength of investment in building and structures. The corporate sector is in excellent financial health, with conservative gearing, good profitability and ready access to credit, although it is not using much of this because of its ample internal sources of funds. Most of the surveys show readings at or above average for business conditions and business confidence. I do not wish to say much about residential construction other than that it has held up for longer than we or other forecasters expected, but it now appears to have peaked despite the boost that it is continuing to receive from alterations and additions. The experience among different industries is, as usual, quite varied. Although, in the aggregate, growth has been good, some sectors are suffering. Agriculture during the drought is the obvious example, but more recently the tourist and international transportation sectors have suffered a sharp fall in activity associated with the public reaction to the SARS virus, just when it looked like they were about to recover from the drop in travel associated with the Iraq War. Employment has grown by 2½ per cent over the past year although, as usual, the recorded figures show a very irregular pattern of growth. The unemployment rate at 6.1 per cent is about as low as it has been in the present expansion. As explained earlier, consumer prices are rising at 3.4 per cent per annum, and wage costs at about 3.6 per cent. Inflation has been close to or above 3 per cent for more than a year. This would be a source of concern if we expected the situation to persist long enough to become entrenched in expectations. But, as I said earlier, inflation is likely to decline in coming quarters, and overall growth in labour costs is consistent with the inflation target. These figures contrast with the much lower rates of increase occurring in major economies overseas where demand is much weaker and inflation targets – implicit or explicit – are, or are in danger of, being undershot. Before leaving the domestic economy, I will make a few remarks about the growth of credit. Aggregate credit has grown by 13 per cent over the past year, which is quite a high figure in an economy where nominal GDP has grown by 6 per cent. When we look more closely, we find that household credit has grown by 20 per cent and that credit to the household sector for housing purposes has grown by 21 per cent. Credit for investors in housing is growing at a pace of about 28 per cent. Thus, we have a situation where credit is growing a good deal faster than appears necessary to satisfy the needs of the economy, and that this situation is wholly due to credit being channelled into the housing sector. When we see these kinds of figures, it is hard not to conclude that a significant part of this must be directed to speculative purposes. There is, of course, plenty of other evidence to support this supposition. Overall, an examination of the domestic economy leads us to conclude that there is little or no evidence to suggest that monetary policy has been too tight, or is currently exerting a constricting influence on domestic demand. But that is only part of the story, and possibly the smaller part – policy must also take into account the impact of international forces. Let me now return, therefore, to the global economy, and then I will conclude by trying to make an assessment of the balance of risks which face the Australian economy. After the short-lived optimism that followed the end of the Iraq War and the fall in oil prices, and amidst the flow of mixed economic data, observers of the international economy were confronted with two pieces of news, both emanating from the United States, which gave pause for thought. The first was the Fed’s communiqué from the early May Federal Open Market Committee Meeting. In it, the Fed stated that the balance of risks on inflation was in the downward direction. While the Fed did not mention the word “deflation”, and it clearly does not regard that as the most likely outcome, 
 BIS Review 26/2003 3 markets interpreted the Fed as saying that deflation was now at least a possibility that had to be included into the range of conceivable outcomes. US bond yields soon dropped to 45-year lows.  The second piece of news from the United States was the Secretary of the Treasury’s comments on the value of the US dollar. This was virtually unanimously interpreted as signalling the end of the “strong dollar policy” and an acceptance that a declining dollar was in the interest of the US economy. The interpretation gained added plausibility, despite later denials, when it was seen in conjunction with the Fed’s earlier announcement on downward risks to the inflation outlook.  The likelihood that the US dollar might decline further, with tacit acquiescence from the US authorities, has led many observers to believe that a significant change is occurring in the international environment. A declining US dollar helps the US economy adjust to its problems, but also shifts those problems in part to other countries. In passing, I have to say that I am not criticising the United States for this – to date, they have shouldered more than their fair share of the responsibility for getting a global expansion going. But, if we are interested in increasing global growth, rather than just having a redistribution of the pattern of growth between countries, many countries which have enjoyed the stimulus of exporting to the United States when the US dollar was high will need to find domestic sources of expansion. There is a great deal of scepticism about how successful the two main areas outside the United States – Japan and the Euro area – will be in this endeavour. It is in this general context that some central banks have reduced interest rates over the past few days. As you know, we did not. This was not because we are unaware of the downward risks that are presented by the global economy, nor because we think our economy is somehow immune to international problems. It was because we clearly have stronger domestic conditions in place already as a result of current policy settings (not to mention higher inflation than most countries), and hence have not had the same sense of urgency in reducing interest rates that several others clearly did. We are, however, very conscious of the risks the Australian economy faces. Obviously, the first one is that the world economy fails to recover and that, in time, this feeds through to a protracted weakening in the Australian economy. The main direct channel through which this could occur would be a further weakening in exports. At the same time, we have seen that because our economy is healthy relative to others, and hence our interest rates are not as low as others, foreign investors have found Australian dollar-denominated assets attractive to acquire. Thus, a second channel could be through an excessive appreciation of the Australian dollar. Not that I think what has happened to date could be in any way labelled excessive. The trade-weighted exchange rate has returned to its post-float average, while the rate against the US dollar is still well below the post-float average. On the purely domestic front, the main risk is associated with the rapid growth of household credit. Not only does it seem excessive in terms of purely domestic needs, it is far higher than in any other comparable country. Most of the credit has been directed towards bidding up the price of housing and, in some parts of the housing market, the motivation has been dominated by the pursuit of speculative gain. Will this continue? I think there is now some evidence that in the most speculative hot spots, a degree of common sense is returning. Investor interest in inner-city apartments is well down, and a number of proposed projects have been shelved. In addition, estimates of vacancy rates are being revised upwards and rents are falling. If this interpretation is correct, it should in time be reflected in the normal statistical collections on credit and prices. But these statistics inevitably contain quite long lags, so they will be the last indicators to turn down. When we put the two sets of risks together, there are several possible outcomes. A weakening world outlook and an abating of domestic credit and asset market pressures would provide a reasonably clear prognosis for monetary policy. In the other direction, so too would a combination of a clear strengthening in the world economy and continued domestic buoyancy. A third possible combination, and the most favourable one for Australia, would be a firming world economy and easing in domestic pressures, resulting in a more balanced growth outcome for the Australian economy. But the combination that would be most damaging to the Australian economy would be if the household sector were to continue putting itself into a more exposed position at the rate it has over the past few years, while at the same time a further weakening of the world economy was starting to feed through to activity and incomes. That would be a recipe for ensuring that, when the house price correction came, as it inevitably would if the world economy was weak enough, it would be bigger and more disruptive than otherwise. I am not saying that this is the most likely outcome, only that it is a risk we have to take into account. It is this risk that adds an extra degree of complexity to the making of monetary 
 4 BIS Review 26/2003 policy in Australia, and gives some context to my earlier remarks about there having been less urgency in Australia than elsewhere to respond to the weakening world economy. In conclusion, the international environment has not yet improved in the way we had hoped, and the changing fortunes of the US dollar throw an additional complication into the mix. To date, the domestic economy has weathered the unfavourable international environment very well. Nonetheless, growth will be further adversely affected in the period ahead if the international situation does not improve. If this were to occur, it would change the balance of forces that has been keeping interest rates steady over the past year. 
 BIS Review 26/2003 1 European Central Bank: Press conference - introductory statement Introductory statement by Mr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank and Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the press conference held in Frankfurt, 5 June 2003. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Following a comprehensive economic and monetary analysis, we have concluded that the outlook for price stability over the medium term has improved significantly since our last decision to lower interest rates in March. As a result, we have decided to reduce our key interest rates by 50 basis points. This decision is in line with our monetary policy strategy, including the aim of maintaining inflation rates below but close to 2% over the medium term. At the same time, this interest rate reduction takes into account the downside risks to economic growth. The Governing Council will continue to monitor carefully all factors which are relevant to its assessment. Let me explain our assessment in detail. In the context of our economic analysis, the latest data releases on real GDP growth have confirmed that economic activity in the euro area remained subdued in the first quarter of this year. This outcome also reflects the negative impact of the Iraq crisis on both the global economy and the euro area. However, the survey evidence for April and May does not suggest an immediate improvement after the resolution of this conflict and is at best mixed. Accordingly, economic growth in the first half of 2003 is likely to be very weak, and expectations for annual average economic growth for this year and for 2004 have had to be scaled down. Nevertheless, we still expect a gradual strengthening of real GDP growth in the course of 2003, which should gather more pace next year. All available forecasts as well as recent financial market reactions seem to reflect a similar assessment. The main factors supporting this outlook are both external and domestic in nature. On the external side, the expected upturn in extra-euro area demand should compensate for the dampening effect of the appreciation of the euro. Evidently, the significant and rapid appreciation of the euro over recent months will dampen external price competitiveness. However, the current level of the euro's real effective exchange rate, and thereby the competitive position of euro area exporters, is very close to longer-term averages. Thus, when put into perspective, current euro exchange rate levels are in line with economic fundamentals and with our interest in a strong and stable euro. On the domestic side, private consumption growth should recover further from the second half of 2003 onwards. This would reflect the growth in real disposable income supported by positive terms of trade effects and lower inflation rates. Moreover, there are no significant imbalances in the household sector as a whole that would hinder such a recovery. At the same time, the contribution of investment to growth is likely to remain more modest, although an improvement in the global economic environment and the historically low level of interest rates should contribute to an upswing.  The Governing Council is conscious of the continuing downside risks to economic growth. Notably, risks stem from the past accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances outside the euro area, and there are ongoing concerns with regard to the SARS virus. In addition, some uncertainty remains as to the extent of the adjustment still needed in the euro area corporate sector to enhance productivity and profitability. This could also have an impact on employment growth and thus private consumption. Given this environment, the outlook for price developments has become more favourable. Following Eurostat's flash estimate of the inflation rate for May of 1.9%, annual inflation rates are expected to hover broadly around this level for the remainder of this year and to fall significantly in 2004. This assessment is based on the assumption of favourable import prices, reflecting both generally stable oil price developments and the higher exchange rate, as well as lower domestic price pressure in the context of a moderate economic recovery. In particular, wage growth is expected to remain broadly stable. Coupled with productivity gains, this should therefore result in a moderation of unit labour costs. 
 2 BIS Review 26/2003 In the context of our monetary analysis, we saw persistent strong growth in the broad monetary aggregate M3. Consequently, the euro area economy has continued to accumulate liquidity significantly above the amount needed to sustain non-inflationary growth. There are, however, several considerations which counterbalance concerns that this ample liquidity will lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. In particular, monetary developments continue to be fostered by portfolio shifts, reflecting a sustained preference on the part of investors for liquid and secure assets. This is confirmed by evidence from both the components and counterparts of M3. Indeed, loans to the private sector increased at a much more moderate pace than M3. Moreover, higher monetary growth was accompanied by a much lower net acquisition of foreign equity by non-MFI euro area residents, also implying portfolio reallocations away from riskier assets. Consequently, the portfolio shifts that have affected M3 growth over the past two years should unwind over time. Finally, the perspective that economic activity will remain moderate reduces the likelihood of excess liquidity giving rise to increased spending. Nevertheless, one has to bear in mind that monetary growth is also supported by the low level of interest rates. Therefore, monetary developments need to be closely monitored with respect to their implications for price stability over the medium to long term. Summing up our economic analysis, it currently appears that inflation rates should decline to below 2% over the medium term, following recent movements in the exchange rate of the euro and given the sluggish growth performance of the euro area. Our monetary analysis indicates that the strong expansion of M3 should not for the time being adversely affect this outlook. Hence, cross-checking the information from the two pillars leads us to conclude that the outlook for price stability over the medium term has become more favourable. Let me at this point comment on the debate about the hypothetical risk of deflation. As far as the euro area is concerned, it should be recalled that inflation has been hovering around 2% for quite some time and that there are currently no forecasts indicating any deflationary risks. The ECB's monetary policy aims at inflation of below but close to 2% over the medium term. In this respect, inflation expectations should remain well anchored at this level, irrespective of shorter-term developments in prices. At the regional level, a period of relatively low price increases or even price level declines will improve a region's competitiveness within the currency area. Within a monetary union, deflation is not a meaningful concept when applied to individual regions. At this juncture, it may be particularly warranted to stress that monetary policy cannot by itself generate lasting and sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. This can only be achieved by appropriate structural measures that address fundamental weaknesses and tackle urgent adjustment requirements. In this respect, fiscal policies have a great potential for fostering confidence and thereby supporting activity, even in the short run. Establishing a well designed medium-term consolidation strategy in those countries currently struggling with increasing fiscal imbalances would make a major contribution in this direction. This would imply comprehensive and growth-friendly measures including, in particular, a courageous reform of the structure and level of public expenditure. Curbing spending growth would eventually also create further room for manoeuvre to address future pressure arising from pension systems and scope for future tax cuts. Procedurally, it is crucial to underpin the fiscal policy framework with a decisive and consistent implementation of the rules of the Treaty and of the Stability and Growth Pact, and rigorous monitoring and peer pressure amongst Member States. By the same measure, bold structural reforms in the labour and product markets would not only increase the euro area's growth potential and enhance its ability to better withstand external shocks, but it would also eliminate a great deal of the uncertainty currently overshadowing long-term planning and perspectives. This, in turn, would also have positive effects over the shorter term. In particular, renewed momentum in the process of structural reform would foster consumer and investor confidence and thereby greatly facilitate spending and investment decisions in the euro area. We are now at your disposal for questions.

LTD., London, 3 June 2003. *      *      * The creation of economic and monetary union and the introduction of the euro meant that we in continental Europe have achieved the highest degree of monetary policy integration. For the inhabitants of a country which was not one of the founding states of the European Economic Community and which has a great historical past of its own, this process, this political “Euro Project”, may perhaps be difficult to appreciate.   However, EMU is only the latest development in European monetary and exchange rate cooperation, which, in turn, is part of a much broader process initiated in Europe 50 years ago. The euro cannot be fully understood unless there is an appreciation of this process. Only with this in mind can we begin to grasp how countries with different languages and traditions, which have enjoyed amicable relations during various periods in history but which have also fought against each other in many cruel wars, could eventually take the momentous decision to entrust monetary policy to a supranational decision-making body: the Governing Council of the Eurosystem. It is no exaggeration to state that with the creation of the single market and its completion marked by the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins in 2002, we have launched the most comprehensive and challenging economic reform project in the history of continental Europe. This has been a particularly clear demonstration of European policymakers’ ability to take decisive action. In less than a decade EMU has evolved from a remote and unlikely possibility to reality. Apart from all the difficulties and challenges we are facing at present with weak growth, high unemployment and increasing budget deficits no one outside continental Europe should underestimate the magnitude of what has been achieved in monetary union to date.  The Europe of today should not be confused with Europe 10 or 15 years ago. We have liberalized and deregulated markets. However, more needs to be done. The convergence process which permitted the creation of EMU has brought about fundamental changes which are irreversible. Admittedly, economic performance in continental Europe is weak at present. However, the European economy is more resilient to economic shocks than ever before. The process of European integration has decreased the likelihood of asymmetrical shocks. In particular, unwarranted monetary and exchange rate policies can no longer cause disturbances at the national level. What is more, the integration process has created a highly integrated economic area without a tendency for protectionist measures. What was expected of monetary union? What has been achieved five years after the establishment of the ECB and four and a half years into the euro era? Initial expectations varied. Some were positive and others negative. In creating a single currency, the politicians fundamentally set out to make the process of European integration irreversible. Economic and monetary union was expected: • to complete the single market and to create an European area of monetary and financial stability (stability union); • to act as a catalyst for further political integration and economic structural reforms; and • at least for some (non-german) politicians: to counterbalance the currency dominance of the US dollar by means of the euro. The expectations of the sceptics can be summed up as follows: • the euro area is not an optimal currency area; a “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy is not appropriate; • EMU is premature as there is insufficient convergence;  • without political union, EMU will fail.  
 2 BIS Review 25/2003 I am not going to comment on all these arguments. To be frank: we all know that the benefits of EMU will materialize over time. In historical terms 4 years is an extremely short period of time. But allow me to assess what has actually taken place since June 1998. The ECB and the third stage of economic and monetary union were launched during difficult times.  Even after having achieved a sufficiently high degree of convergence by the start of the third stage, the creation of the new and still diverse euro area in 1999 generated uncertainties about possible structural changes to existing economic relationships, including changes in the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy decisions. The Eurosystem’s monetary policy has thus been faced with challenges which differ from those confronting other central banks. In the first five years of its existence, the ECB’s main challenges have been  • to gain credibility and • to build up confidence in a new environment and under a totally new policy regime • with a centralised monetary policy and  • decentralised but closely coordinated economic and budgetary policies carried out by states which retain to a large extent their sovereignty. Another challenge was to determine, adopt and implement an appropriate monetary policy strategy and to define the term “to maintain price stability in the medium term”. This was to be achieved by a two-pillar approach which • gives a prominent role to money growth and • establishes a broad range of indicators, signalling effects on future price developments. The recent review of the ECB’s strategy confirmed the appropriateness of this approach. No substantial change is planned, merely some clarification for communication reasons. The ECB and its strategy have been heavily criticised, in particular by Anglo-Saxon economists and in the Anglo-Saxon media. Without going into detail, I should like to make the following remarks: 1. My profound conviction is that the ECB has a modern mandate and an appropriate strategy. It must be borne in mind that what is meant is a symmetric definition of price stability. 2. Both the mandate and the strategy are based on the continental European conviction that price stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make to improving economic prospects and raising living standards.  3. The medium-term orientation avoids introducing additional, unnecessary volatility into the economy and makes it clear that monetary policy does not have the instruments to fine-tune the business cycle. Activist policies directed at exploiting short-term trade-offs between prices and economic activity risk contributing to instability over longer horizons. 4. The ECB is pursuing a strategy of its own which cannot be compared with other strategies. The recent experience of stock market and housing market bubbles has demonstrated again that money matters. Monetary growth will remain an important element in the ECB’s economic analyses. I know that many economists ignore the role of money supply. However, the underlying relationships between the monetary aggregates and inflation persist.  The establishment of the ECB and the ESCB has been a success. From the outset there have been no tensions or serious problems in implementing the single monetary policy.  The cash changeover from the national currencies to the euro at the start of 2002 went smoothly and was a historically unique logistical achievement. Moreover, the ECB has been broadly successful in fulfilling its mandate. Price stability has been largely achieved. What has not yet been achieved and what are the current problems? First of all, neither the unduly positive nor the unduly negative expectations have been borne out. 
 BIS Review 25/2003 3 Those who saw EMU as the driving force behind political integration have been disappointed. This already looked likely in 1999 and has been confirmed in the past nine months; political integration has not moved forward even after the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice. In fact, the opposite has happened; considerable damage has been done to the image of a common European foreign and security policy.  It was clear to those who are familiar with European processes that there is no automatic spin-off from one integration move to the next. Political ambition and political leadership are needed but are sadly lacking – with the result that national interests have moved back to the fore.  Much the same can be said of economic policy coordination in the EU and the Stability and Growth Pact.  It is disappointing to find that national interests are causing economic policy coordination to work less well than it might. Peer pressure – which made itself felt up to 2000, even when implementing the Stability and Growth Pact – has become significantly weaker. The instruments and procedures of economic policy coordination have become a more bureaucratic exercise. The responsibility that policy has of ensuring the “smooth functioning” of EMU is hardly being exercised. The solidarity and discipline needed with regard to the single currency is lacking. There is little respect for the fact that, in a monetary union, parliamentary sovereignty and national governmental powers are de facto limited. In a monetary union, common rules must be applied and observed. The budgetary policy rules of the Stability and Growth Pact are a great achievement for Europe. They must be observed. Unfortunately, in 1996-97 Germany proved unable to enforce the requirement of no political influence being exerted in the procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact. The rules would have cut more weight in better economic times and today’s dilemma would probably have been avoided.  The euro has not yet acted as a catalyst for structural reforms either. The expectation that enhanced transparency and competition would make adjustments inevitable has been frustrated by an unexpected development: monetary union seems to shield the member states against having to undertake structural reform. There are no longer any nominal exchange rate changes which make adjustments necessary. However, what is happening is that the adjustments are merely being postponed for a time. Although economic and monetary union did away with nominal exchange rates, real exchange rate adjustments are still being made, this being related to the different rates of inflation within the euro area. Inflation differences in some cases have increased since the start of EMU. That was not expected to happen. However, inflation rates and differentials in Europe are generally much lower than in the first half of the 1990s. In most countries higher inflation rates have gone hand in hand with stronger growth. The low inflation rate in Germany mirrors its poor economic performance. Diverging inflation rates in a monetary union mean different real interest rates. However, in a monetary union, monetary policy can only be geared to the situation in the euro area as a whole and not to individual regions or economic sectors. When it joins EMU, a country has to be aware of this fact and to accept this rule. However, the degree of dispersion in inflation is not alarming and it is not notably higher or different from that seen in a long-established monetary union, such as the USA. This brings me to another issue currently under discussion in Europe: deflation.  The inflation rate in Germany is currently the lowest in the euro area. With the German economy in stagnation for the third consecutive year, the IMF staff recently published a paper which rang alarm bells as it stated that many indicators point to deflationary forces being at work in Germany. However, the IMF talks about “mild deflation”, not comparable with the deflationary downward spiral in Japan. The debate suffers from confusion about the meaning of the term “deflation”. I think this word has to be used with extreme caution. Properly defined, deflation describes prolonged periods of a declining price level in conjunction with an economic slump. What we have seen so far in Germany is an ongoing process of disinflation. However, the risk of “mild” deflation occurring in Germany cannot be completely ruled out and that risk is at least higher than in other euro-area economies. However, a few relevant points need to be made. • The expected decline in CPI inflation is being driven mainly by energy prices and the appreciation of the euro. 
 4 BIS Review 25/2003 • There is no indication of any restraint on private consumption induced by negative price expectations. Price expectations are positive. The decline in consumption expenditure is caused by negative prospects of lower disposable income – higher taxes and increasing costs of the social security system are expected – and employment risks. • According to our empirical studies, the current weak credit growth in Germany is not due to a general credit crunch but mainly to low demand for credit. • Furthermore, the liquidity situation in Germany as well as in the euro area as a whole is favourable. However, concerns remain about the prospects of continued stagnation at stable prices. To bring what I have to say this evening to a close, I should like to make a couple of remarks about the issues lying ahead of us in EMU. As I said earlier: with the Maastricht Treaty european leaders have demonstrated their ability to take decisive action. It's time for Europe to deepen the integration process further. 1. We need to overcome the disappointing weak economic performance. To be clear: the economic problems in continental Europe cannot be reduced to monetary policy issues. What is needed is structural reform in the member states, including pension reform, health insurance and labour market reform. Reforms are needed even in times of crisis. Not to reform means to continue to pay a high price for renouncing higher growth and employment. In combination with more flexible markets with more dynamism and more adaptability the benefits of EMU will materialize in the medium to longer term. 2. Putting fiscal positions back on to a sound track and sticking to the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact will help to restore confidence. The credibility of consolidation measures is crucial. Fiscal adjustment should be seen to lead to a permanent increase in future disposable income. Moreover, if appropriately designed, consolidation can raise output and employment in the medium term. 3. The ECB has done an excellent job in a difficult environment, especially when one considers that it started its activities in uncharted territory. In the more heterogeneous euro area of the future, the ECB’s task of providing stable money will become even harder. 4. The integration and adjustment fatigue which followed the introduction of the euro has to be overcome. The same is true for prevailing national interests in the EU. This becomes even more important against the background of the enlargement of the EU. More political ambition and political leadership in Europe are crucial. 
 BIS Review 25/2003 1 Ben S Bernanke: Some thoughts on monetary policy in Japan Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Japan Society of Monetary Economics, Tokyo, 31 May 2003. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System’s website. *      *      * I am delighted to address this meeting of the Japan Society of Monetary Economics. I would particularly like to thank Professor Shimizu both for inviting me and for helping to arrange a series of meetings with officials at the Bank of Japan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Financial Services Agency. Those meetings have given me a first-hand look at the difficult challenges that the current economic situation poses for Japan's leaders and for the Japanese people.  The economic situation here is indeed enormously complex. It involves not only structural, monetary, and fiscal problems but also underlying political and social forces, which have at times limited the flexibility of policy. The sometimes frustratingly slow pace of change in Japan is all the more reason, however, for this nation's economists to speak out and present clear, persuasive arguments that will help guide the policy debate and urge leaders to effective action. At stake is not only the economic health of your country but also, to a significant degree, the prosperity of the rest of the world. From my side of the ocean, it seems that many people are looking to the United States to take the responsibility for leading the world into economic recovery. Clearly, however, faster growth in Japan and other major industrial countries would support a stronger, more balanced, and more durable recovery than one driven by U.S. growth alone.  Although changes in macroeconomic policy in Japan during the past decade have generally been slow and deliberate, there has also been some willingness to experiment, not least by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). For this reason, the recent appointment of a new leadership team at the BOJ has stimulated considerable interest and expectation around the world. Although Governor Fukui and his colleagues have so far not made radical breaks with previous BOJ policies, there is reason to hope that they will be open to fresh ideas and approaches.  In that spirit, my remarks today will be focused on opportunities for monetary policy innovation in Japan, including specifically the possibility of more-active monetary-fiscal cooperation to end deflation. In focusing primarily on macroeconomic policies and the deflation problem, however, I do not wish to imply that more microeconomic measures - such as bank restructuring and recapitalization, development of more liquid capital markets, revitalization of the distressed corporate sector, and broader structural reform - are not essential and urgent. Indeed, all these elements are crucial if Japan's economy is to return to a more satisfactory rate of growth. However, I do think that ending deflation and carrying out banking, financial, corporate, and structural reforms can and should be pursued on parallel tracks, with progress being made wherever possible. Indeed, a definitive end to the deflation in consumer prices - by restoring confidence and stimulating spending - would do much to help moderate the unemployment and financial distress that might otherwise arise as the results of aggressive programs of reform and restructuring.  I preface the body of my remarks with two important caveats. First, the opinions I give today are strictly my own and should not be attributed to my colleagues on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve or on the Federal Open Market Committee; nor do they reflect any official position of the United States government. Second, the remarks that follow were prepared before my visit to Japan and therefore do not reflect the discussions that I held this week with Japanese officials. Obviously, then, no inference should be made about those meetings from the comments to follow.1  Today I would like to consider three related issues that bear on contemporary monetary policy in Japan. First, I will discuss the option of asking the Bank of Japan to announce a quantitative objective for prices, as well as how such an objective might best be structured. Rather than proposing the more familiar inflation target, I will suggest that the BOJ consider adopting a price-level target, which would imply a period of reflation to offset the effects on prices of the recent period of deflation. Second, I                                                       1  A number of Board staff provided useful comments and assistance for this talk. Special thanks are due to Linda Kole and Dave Small for their help. 
 2 BIS Review 25/2003 would like to consider an important institutional issue, which is the relationship between the condition of the Bank of Japan's balance sheet and its ability to undertake more aggressive monetary policies. Although, in principle, balance-sheet considerations should not seriously constrain central bank policies, in practice they do. However, as I will discuss, relatively simple measures that would eliminate this constraint are available. Finally, and most important, I will consider one possible strategy for ending the deflation in Japan: explicit, though temporary, cooperation between the monetary and the fiscal authorities.  What objective for Japanese monetary policy? Before setting off on a trip, one should know one's destination. In that spirit, a discussion of Japanese monetary policy should begin with some discussion of the policy objective. I leave until later how the objective can be achieved.  The Bank of Japan Law, passed in 1998, sets price stability as a primary objective for the central bank. As with our own Federal Reserve Act, price stability is not, however, precisely defined in the Law. Currently, the BOJ has promised that the zero-interest-rate policy will be maintained until deflation is brought to an end, a policy that might be deemed consistent with the price stability objective.  Two objections to this conclusion might be raised, however. First, the BOJ's statement seems to imply that the current level of policy stimulus might start to be withdrawn as soon as measured inflation returns to zero; in particular, no explicit commitment has been made to maintain inflation at zero, much less at some positive rate, in the longer run. But the presence of measurement bias in Japanese price indexes suggest that a measured inflation rate of at least one percent is likely required in order to achieve true price stability in the long run. Moreover, inflation above zero will be needed if real interest rates in Japan are to be negative for a period, as many observers think is necessary for full recovery. In short, it would be helpful if the zero-interest-rate policy were more explicit about what happens after the deflationary period ends.  Second, over the past five years, since the onset of the current deflationary episode - and, incidentally, since the passage of the new Bank of Japan Law - the price level has trended down, registering a cumulative decline (depending on the price index) of between 4 and 9 percent. For example, over this period the GDP deflator has dropped nearly 9 percent, the private consumption deflator has fallen 5-1/2 percent, and wages and salaries are down 4-1/2 percent. One might argue that the legal objective of price stability should require not only a commitment to stabilize prices in the future but also a policy of actively reflating the economy, in order to restore the price level that prevailed prior to the prolonged period of deflation.  As you may know, I have advocated explicit inflation targets, or at least a quantitative definition of price stability, for other leading central banks, including the Federal Reserve. A quantitative inflation target or range has been shown in many countries to be a valuable tool for communication. By clarifying the objectives of the central bank, an explicit inflation target can help to focus and anchor inflation expectations, reduce uncertainty in financial markets, and add structure to the policy framework. For Japan, given the recent history of costly deflation, however, an inflation target may not go far enough. A better strategy for Japanese monetary policy might be a publicly announced, gradually rising price-level target.  What I have in mind is that the Bank of Japan would announce its intention to restore the price level (as measured by some standard index of prices, such as the consumer price index excluding fresh food) to the value it would have reached if, instead of the deflation of the past five years, a moderate inflation of, say, 1 percent per year had occurred. (I choose 1 percent to allow for the measurement bias issue noted above, and because a slightly positive average rate of inflation reduces the risk of future episodes of sustained deflation.) Note that the proposed price-level target is a moving target, equal in the year 2003 to a value approximately 5 percent above the actual price level in 1998 and rising 1 percent per year thereafter.2 Because deflation implies falling prices while the target price-level rises, the failure to end deflation in a given year has the effect of increasing what I have called the                                                       2  Of course, the choice of 1998 as the benchmark year is somewhat arbitrary. It seems however a good compromise choice between the more aggressive tack of trying to make up for the extensive unanticipated disinflation that occurred in the half decade prior to 1998 and the strategy of ignoring past deflation altogether and using 2003 as the base year. 
 BIS Review 25/2003 3 price-level gap (Bernanke, 2000). The price-level gap is the difference between the actual price level and the price level that would have obtained if deflation had been avoided and the price stability objective achieved in the first place.  A successful effort to eliminate the price-level gap would proceed, roughly, in two stages. During the first stage, the inflation rate would exceed the long-term desired inflation rate, as the price-level gap was eliminated and the effects of previous deflation undone. Call this the reflationary phase of policy. Second, once the price-level target was reached, or nearly so, the objective for policy would become a conventional inflation target or a price-level target that increases over time at the average desired rate of inflation.3  Although restoration of the pre-deflation price level by means of a price-level target might be a reasonable interpretation of the BOJ's price stability objective, I would not want to push the purely legal argument too far. For example, based on a mandate for price stability, I would not ask either the BOJ or the Federal Reserve to restore the price level prevailing in their respective nations in 1950! Rather, I think the BOJ should consider a policy of reflation before re-stabilizing at a low inflation rate primarily because of the economic benefits of such a policy. One benefit of reflation would be to ease some of the intense pressure on debtors and on the financial system more generally. Since the early 1990s, borrowers in Japan have repeatedly found themselves squeezed by disinflation or deflation, which has required them to pay their debts in yen of greater value than they had expected. Borrower distress has affected the functioning of the whole economy, for example by weakening the banking system and depressing investment spending. Of course, declining asset values and the structural problems of Japanese firms have contributed greatly to debtors' problems as well, but reflation would, nevertheless, provide some relief. A period of reflation would also likely provide a boost to profits and help to break the deflationary psychology among the public, which would be positive factors for asset prices as well. Reflation - that is, a period of inflation above the long-run preferred rate in order to restore the earlier price level - proved highly beneficial following the deflations of the 1930s in both Japan and the United States. Finance Minister Korekiyo Takahashi brilliantly rescued Japan from the Great Depression through reflationary policies in the early 1930s, while President Franklin D. Roosevelt's reflationary monetary and banking policies did the same for the United States in 1933 and subsequent years. In both cases, the turnaround was amazingly rapid. In the United States, for example, prices fell at a 10.3 percent rate in 1932 but rose 0.8 percent in 1933 and more briskly thereafter. Moreover, during the year that followed Roosevelt's inauguration in March 1933, the U.S. stock market rallied by 77 percent.  Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) have advanced a second argument for a price-level target for Japan in an important recent paper on monetary policy at the zero bound. These authors point out (as have many others) that, when nominal interest rates are at or near zero, the central bank can lower the real rate of interest only by creating expectations of inflation on the part of the public. Eggertsson and Woodford argue that a publicly announced price-level target of the type just described is more conducive to raising near-term inflation expectations than is an inflation target.4  One way to understand their argument is to imagine that the public expects the leaders of the central bank to take more aggressive actions, the further they are from their announced objective. Now suppose that, in an economy experiencing a stable deflation, the central bank leadership announces a fixed inflation target but then makes no progress toward that target during a given period. Then in the next period, the central bank is in the same position as previously, in terms of its distance from its objective; hence, by hypothesis, the central bank has no incentive to increase its effort to meet the announced target, and the public has no reason to expect it to do so. In this respect the inflation target is too "forgiving" an objective; failure is not penalized, nor is greater effort demanded. In contrast, under a price-level-targeting scheme, continuing deflation combined with an upward-sloping path for the price-level target causes the size of the price-level gap to increase over time.  Thus, failure by the central bank to meet its target in a given period leads to expectations of (and public demands for) increased effort in subsequent periods - greater quantities of assets purchased on                                                       3  Some differences between inflation targeting and price-level targeting are interesting but they need not detain us here. See Cecchetti and Kim (2003) for a comparison. In my view, most contemporary inflation-targeting regimes actually practice a combination of inflation targeting and price-level targeting (or price-path targeting), in that overshoots or undershoots of inflation are usually partly, but not entirely, subsequently reversed. 4  Wolman (1998) provides an earlier analysis with a similar conclusion. 
 4 BIS Review 25/2003 the open market, for example. So even if the central bank is reluctant to provide a time frame for meeting its objective, the structure of the price-level objective provides a means for the bank to commit to increasing its anti-deflationary efforts when its earlier efforts prove unsuccessful. As Eggertsson and Woodford show, the expectation that an increasing price level gap will give rise to intensified effort by the central bank should lead the public to believe that ultimately inflation will replace deflation, a belief that supports the central bank's own objectives by lowering the current real rate of interest.  A concern that one might have about price-level targeting, as opposed to more conventional inflation targeting, is that it requires a short-term inflation rate that is higher than the long-term inflation objective. Is there not some danger of inflation overshooting, so that a deflation problem is replaced with an inflation problem? No doubt this concern has some basis, and ultimately one has to make a judgment. However, on the other side of the scale, I would put the following points: first, the benefits to the real economy of a more rapid restoration of the pre-deflation price level and second, the fact that the publicly announced price-level targets would help the Bank of Japan manage public expectations and to draw the distinction between a one-time price-level correction and the BOJ's longer-run inflation objective. If this distinction can be made, the effect of the reflation program on inflation expectations and long-term nominal interest rates should be smaller than if all reflation is interpreted as a permanent increase in inflation.  A barrier to more aggressive policies: the BOJ's balance sheet Discussing the optimal objectives for Japanese monetary policy is all very well, but what of the argument, advanced by some officials, that the Bank of Japan lacks the tools to achieve these objectives? Without denying the many difficulties inherent in making monetary policy in the current environment in Japan, I believe that not all the possible methods for easing monetary policy in Japan have been fully exploited. One possible approach to ending deflation in Japan would be greater cooperation, for a limited time, between the monetary and the fiscal authorities. Specifically, the Bank of Japan should consider increasing still further its purchases of government debt, preferably in explicit conjunction with a program of tax cuts or other fiscal stimulus.  Before going into more detail about this possibility, however, I want to discuss a specific institutional factor that currently constrains - somewhat artificially, I would argue - the ability of the Bank of Japan to pursue more aggressive policies, including both so-called non-conventional and more-orthodox policies. This institutional constraint, often cited by BOJ officials, is the condition of the BOJ's balance sheet, and the fear, in particular, that a successful program of reflation might inflict capital losses on the BOJ and thereby weaken its institutional position.  Like other central banks, the Bank of Japan has a balance sheet, with assets, liabilities, and capital. Also like other central banks, the BOJ purchases interest-bearing assets with money that it creates and thus typically earns significant profits, or seignorage. Some of these profits are used to cover the expenses of the BOJ itself, subject to review by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The BOJ also has reserves for possible losses on securities and foreign exchange transactions and is permitted by the Article 53 of the Bank of Japan Law to retain 5 percent of the surplus from the settlement of profits and losses as a reserve fund. The portion of the surplus not retained by the Bank is paid to the national treasury.  From the point of view of conventional private-sector accounting - which, as I will discuss, is not necessarily the correct standard in this case - the BOJ's balance sheet has become noticeably riskier in recent years. For example, the BOJ's most recent financial statement showed that of the 68 percent of its assets held in the form of government securities, about two-thirds are long-term Japanese government bonds (JGBs). This represents a very substantial increase over customary levels in the BOJ's holdings of long-term government debt. Because yields on government bonds are currently so low, these holdings expose the BOJ's balance sheet to considerable interest-rate risk (although any losses would be partly offset by unrealized capital gains on earlier acquisitions of bonds). Indeed, ironically, if the Bank of Japan were to succeed in replacing deflation with a low but positive rate of inflation, its reward would likely be substantial capital losses in the value of its government bond holdings arising from the resulting increase in long-term nominal interest rates.  With such concerns in mind, BOJ officials have said that a strengthening of the Bank's capital base is needed to allow it to pursue more aggressive monetary policy easing. In fact, the BOJ recently requested that it be allowed to retain 15 percent (rather than 5 percent) of the surplus for the 2002 fiscal year that just ended to increase its capital, and the Ministry of Finance has indicated that it will 
 BIS Review 25/2003 5 approve the request. Even with this additional cushion, however, concerns on the part of the BOJ about its balance sheet are likely to remain.  The public debate over the BOJ's capital should not distract us from the underlying economics of the situation. In particular, the private shareholders notwithstanding, the Bank of Japan is not a private commercial bank. It cannot go bankrupt in the sense that a private firm can, and the usual reasons that a commercial bank holds capital - to reduce incentives for excessive risk-taking, for example - do not directly apply to the BOJ.5 Indeed, putting aside psychological and symbolic reasons, important as these may be in some circumstances, there appear to be only two conceivable effects of the BOJ's balance sheet position on its ability to conduct normal operations. First, if the BOJ's income were too low to support its current expenditure budget, the Bank might be forced to ask the MOF for supplemental funds, which the BOJ might fear would put its independence at risk. This consideration by itself should not necessarily make the BOJ less willing to undertake more aggressive monetary policies, however, because purchasing additional assets with non-zero yields, even if these assets are risky or illiquid, normally increases the Bank's current income. Second, an imaginable, though quite unlikely, possibility is that the Bank could suffer sufficient capital losses on its assets to make it unable to conduct open-market sales of securities on a scale large enough to meet its monetary policy objectives.  In short, one could make an economic case that the balance sheet of the central bank should be of marginal relevance at best to the determination of monetary policy. Rather than engage in what would probably be a heated and unproductive debate over the issue, however, I would propose instead that the Japanese government just fix the problem, thereby eliminating this concern from the BOJ's list of worries. There are many essentially costless ways to fix it. I am intrigued by a simple proposal that I understand has been suggested by the Japanese Business Federation, the Nippon Keidanren. Under this proposal the Ministry of Finance would convert the fixed interest rates of the Japanese government bonds held by the Bank of Japan into floating interest rates. This "bond conversion" - actually, a fixed-floating interest rate swap - would protect the capital position of the Bank of Japan from increases in long-term interest rates and remove much of the balance sheet risk associated with open-market operations in government securities. Moreover, the budgetary implications of this proposal would be essentially zero, since any increase in interest payments to the BOJ by the MOF arising from the bond conversion would be offset by an almost equal increase in the BOJ's payouts to the national treasury.6 The budgetary neutrality of the proposal is of course a consequence of the fact that, as a matter of arithmetic, any capital gains or losses in the value of government securities held by the BOJ are precisely offset by opposite changes in the net worth of the issuer of those securities, the government treasury.  Although the MOF could insulate, without budgetary cost, the BOJ's balance sheet from interest-rate risk on its holdings of government bonds, a similar program offered by the MOF to private-sector holders of bonds, such as commercial banks, would not be costless from the MOF's point of view, if inflation and interest rates were subsequently to rise.7 However, if the MOF entered into the proposed swap agreement with the BOJ, new purchases of government bonds from the private sector by the Bank of Japan would be costless to the national treasury. Thus, conditional on the swap arrangement being in force, open-market purchases of government bonds by the BOJ would combine an expansionary monetary policy with a reduction of interest-rate risk in the banking system at no budgetary cost.8 The simple step of immunizing the BOJ's balance sheet thus opens a number of interesting policy options.                                                        5 There does not appear to be any provision in the Bank of Japan Law that addresses whether the Bank can or cannot have negative net worth, or what would happen if it were to report negative net worth. 6  An alternative approach would be for the MOF to offer the fixed-floating swap to the BOJ only for its holdings of government bonds above some specified level. An advantage of this approach is that it would provide more current income to meet BOJ expenditure needs. 7 However, these losses would be offset to some degree if nominal GDP were to grow with inflation, raising tax revenues. As an historical note, the U.S. Treasury initiated a bond conversion program at the time of the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord in 1951, which allowed some private holders of long-term bonds as well as the Federal Reserve to avoid capital losses implied by the un-pegging of long-term nominal rates at that time. Because some private bondholders were assisted as well as the central bank, the budgetary cost to the government was not zero; most of the costs of protecting private long-term bondholders were absorbed by the Treasury. See, for example, Eichengreen and Garber (1991) for a discussion. 8  I assume here that the BOJ does not sterilize the effects of its purchases of bonds, that is, it allows current account balances to rise by the amount of its purchases. 
 6 BIS Review 25/2003 The bond conversion (or interest-rate swap) just described is all that would be needed to protect the BOJ's balance sheet against any side effects from operations in government bonds. Incidentally, the approach could be extended to insulate the BOJ's balance sheet against potentially adverse effects of other types of asset purchases that the government might want to encourage. For example, to facilitate expanded purchases of asset-backed commercial paper, the government might agree, on request of the BOJ, to exchange government debt of the same maturity for the commercial paper. The net effect would be that the fiscal authority would assume the credit risk flowing from the nonstandard monetary policy action, as seems appropriate.  What should the Bank of Japan give up in exchange for the Ministry of Finance's removing a significant amount of risk from the BOJ's balance sheet? One option would be for the Bank to use its increased ability to bear risk to undertake new policy actions that would entail accepting other types of risk onto its balance sheet. Today I will argue for a different approach and suggest that the Bank of Japan cooperate temporarily with the government to create an environment of combined monetary and fiscal ease to end deflation and help restart economic growth in Japan. To do this, the BOJ might have to scrap rules that it has set for itself - for example, its informal rule that the quantity of long-term government bonds on its balance sheet must be kept below the outstanding balance of banknotes issued.  Monetary and fiscal cooperation There is no unique solution to the problem of continuing declines in Japanese prices; a variety of policies are worth trying, alone or in combination. However, one fairly direct and practical approach is explicit (though temporary) cooperation between the monetary and the fiscal authorities. Let me try to explain why I think this direction is promising and may succeed where monetary and fiscal policies applied separately have not.  Demand on the part of both consumers and potential purchasers of new capital equipment in Japan remains quite depressed, and resources are not being fully utilized. Normally, the central bank would respond to such a situation by lowering the short-term nominal interest rate, but that rate is now effectively zero. Other strategies for the central bank acting alone exist, including buying alternative assets to try to lower term or liquidity premiums and attempting to influence expectations of future inflation through announcements or commitments to expand the monetary base. The Bank of Japan has taken some steps in these directions but has generally been reluctant to go as far as it might, in part because of the difficulty in determining the quantitative impact of such actions and in part because of the Bank's view that problems in the banking system have "jammed" the usual channels of monetary policy transmission. Ironically, this obvious reluctance on the part of the BOJ to sail into uncharted waters may have had the effect of muting the psychological impact of the nonstandard actions it has taken. Likewise the Bank of Japan has resisted calls to manage the value of the yen (see, for example, McCallum, 2000, or Svensson, 2001), citing its lack of authority to do so as well as the prospect of retaliation from trading partners.  The alternative approach to stimulating aggregate demand is fiscal policy - government spending increases or tax cuts. Here again the perception is that policy has been less than successful, although Posen (1998) - in a criticism reminiscent of those who have complained that the Bank of Japan should just "do more" - has argued that the problem is less that fiscal policy is ineffective than that it has not been used to the extent that one might gather from official plans and announcements. In Posen's view, Japan's debt problem is primarily the result of slow economic growth rather than active fiscal policies.  However, besides possibly inconsistent application of fiscal stimulus, another reason for weak fiscal effects in Japan may be the well-publicized size of the government debt. The severity of the government debt problem may be overstated in some respects - 95 percent of the outstanding debt is domestically held, for example, and 59 percent is held by public institutions, so that the Japanese people truly "owe the debt to themselves" - but that the government's annual deficit is now about 8 percent of GDP is nevertheless a serious concern. Moreover, an aging Japanese population will add to the government's budgetary burden in coming decades.  In addition to making policymakers more reluctant to use expansionary fiscal policies in the first place, Japan's large national debt may dilute the effect of fiscal policies in those instances when they are used. For example, people may be more inclined to save rather than spend tax cuts when they know that the cuts increase future government interest costs and thus raise future tax payments for themselves or their children. (It is striking that, despite low interest rates, about 20 percent of the Japanese central government budget, or about 16.8 trillion yen this year, is devoted to servicing the 
 BIS Review 25/2003 7 national debt.) In economics textbooks, the idea that people will save rather than spend tax cuts because of the implied increase in future tax obligations is known as the principle of Ricardian equivalence. In general, the evidence for Ricardian equivalence in real economies is mixed, but it seems most likely to apply in a situation like that prevailing today in Japan, in which people have been made highly aware of the potential burden of the national debt. The principle of Ricardian equivalence does not apply exactly to increases in government purchases (for example, road building) but it may apply there approximately. If, for example, people think that government spending projects are generally wasteful and add little to national wealth or productivity, then taxpayers may view increased government spending as simply increasing the burden of the government debt that they must bear. If, as a result, they react to increases in government spending by reducing their own expenditure, the net stimulative effect of fiscal actions will be reduced. In short, to strengthen the effects of fiscal policy, it would be helpful to break the link between expansionary fiscal actions today and increases in the taxes that people expect to pay tomorrow.  My thesis here is that cooperation between the monetary and fiscal authorities in Japan could help solve the problems that each policymaker faces on its own. Consider for example a tax cut for households and businesses that is explicitly coupled with incremental BOJ purchases of government debt - so that the tax cut is in effect financed by money creation. Moreover, assume that the Bank of Japan has made a commitment, by announcing a price-level target, to reflate the economy, so that much or all of the increase in the money stock is viewed as permanent.9  Under this plan, the BOJ's balance sheet is protected by the bond conversion program, and the government's concerns about its outstanding stock of debt are mitigated because increases in its debt are purchased by the BOJ rather than sold to the private sector. Moreover, consumers and businesses should be willing to spend rather than save the bulk of their tax cut: They have extra cash on hand, but - because the BOJ purchased government debt in the amount of the tax cut - no current or future debt service burden has been created to imply increased future taxes. Essentially, monetary and fiscal policies together have increased the nominal wealth of the household sector, which will increase nominal spending and hence prices. The health of the banking sector is irrelevant to this means of transmitting the expansionary effect of monetary policy, addressing the concern of BOJ officials about "broken" channels of monetary transmission. This approach also responds to the reservation of BOJ officials that the Bank "lacks the tools" to reach a price-level or inflation target.  Isn't it irresponsible to recommend a tax cut, given the poor state of Japanese public finances? To the contrary, from a fiscal perspective, the policy would almost certainly be stabilizing, in the sense of reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio. The BOJ's purchases would leave the nominal quantity of debt in the hands of the public unchanged, while nominal GDP would rise owing to increased nominal spending. Indeed, nothing would help reduce Japan's fiscal woes more than healthy growth in nominal GDP and hence in tax revenues.  Potential roles for monetary-fiscal cooperation are not limited to BOJ support of tax cuts. BOJ purchases of government debt could also support spending programs, to facilitate industrial restructuring, for example. The BOJ's purchases would mitigate the effect of the new spending on the burden of debt and future interest payments perceived by households, which should reduce the offset from decreased consumption. More generally, by replacing interest-bearing debt with money, BOJ purchases of government debt lower current deficits and interest burdens and thus the public's expectations of future tax obligations. Of course, one can never get something for nothing; from a public finance perspective, increased monetization of government debt simply amounts to replacing other forms of taxes with an inflation tax. But, in the context of deflation-ridden Japan, generating a little bit of positive inflation (and the associated increase in nominal spending) would help achieve the goals of promoting economic recovery and putting idle resources back to work, which in turn would boost tax revenue and improve the government's fiscal position.  Conclusion The Bank of Japan became fully independent only in 1998, and it has guarded its independence carefully, as is appropriate. Economically, however, it is important to recognize that the role of an                                                       9  The BOJ's announcement of a price-level target should be credible: It is feasible, and it is in the interest of the BOJ, the government, and the public. 
 8 BIS Review 25/2003 independent central bank is different in inflationary and deflationary environments. In the face of inflation, which is often associated with excessive monetization of government debt, the virtue of an independent central bank is its ability to say "no" to the government. With protracted deflation, however, excessive money creation is unlikely to be the problem, and a more cooperative stance on the part of the central bank may be called for. Under the current circumstances, greater cooperation for a time between the Bank of Japan and the fiscal authorities is in no way inconsistent with the independence of the central bank, any more than cooperation between two independent nations in pursuit of a common objective is inconsistent with the principle of national sovereignty.  I have argued today that a quid pro quo, in which the MOF acts to immunize the BOJ's balance sheet from interest-rate risk and the BOJ increases its purchases of government debt, is a good way to attack the ongoing deflation in Japan. I would like to close by reiterating a point I made earlier - that ending deflation in consumer prices is only part of what needs to be done to put Japan back on the path to full recovery. Banking and structural reform are crucial and need to be carried out as soon and as aggressively as possible. Although the importance of reforms cannot be disputed, however, I do not agree with those who have argued that deflation is only a minor part of the overall problem in Japan. Addressing the deflation problem would bring substantial real and psychological benefits to the Japanese economy, and ending deflation would make solving the other problems that Japan faces only that much easier. For the sake of the world's economy as well as Japan's, I hope that progress will soon be made on all of these fronts. 
BIS Review 25/2003 1 Svein Gjedrem: Financial stability, asset prices and monetary policy Address by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the Centre for Monetary Economics/Norwegian School of Management, 3 June 2003.  The address is based on previous speeches and newspaper articles. An assessment of some new aspects of economic developments is also presented. Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. The Charts in pdf can be found on the Norges Bank’s website. *      *      * Introduction Developments in equity and bond prices, house prices, credit and debt may have an impact on inflation and are important information for central banks when they set interest rates. Asset prices may also be indicators of future developments in output and demand. Sharp changes in asset prices have often occurred when there are considerable imbalances in the economy. There have been episodes where bubbles have accumulated in the form of sharp increases in asset prices in the equity and housing markets while inflation has been low. Higher asset prices and increased optimism often contribute to high debt growth. Increased access to credit pushes up asset prices further. There is therefore an interaction between developments in debt and asset prices. When the bubbles burst, the result may be an economic downturn and deflation. In this way, developments in asset prices may give rise to an unstable inflation environment. Developments of this kind may also threaten the stability of the financial system, cf. the banking crises in the Nordic countries around 1990. Today, I will discuss whether and how monetary policy should take the build-up of financial imbalances into account. I will also touch upon the driving forces in the foreign exchange market. The krone is affected by mechanisms similar to those found in other asset markets.  Finally, I will say a few words about current economic developments. Internationally, developments are weaker than expected. Interest rate cuts are expected in a number of countries. The fall in international interest rate levels has dampened the effects of our interest rate reductions on inflation. Growth in Norway is likely to be fairly weak now, and with an unchanged interest rate, inflation is likely to remain below target in the period ahead. The easing of monetary policy will therefore continue. Norges Bank's Executive Board will also carefully consider reducing the interest rate in larger steps. Price stability and financial stability Seeking to foster price stability and financial stability is often considered a natural task of central banks. In Norway, the Government has set an operational objective for monetary policy. This objective is low and stable inflation. Financial instability is often defined as the absence of financial stability.1 Financial instability is characterised by unduly wide fluctuations in prices for assets such as dwellings, commercial property and securities, or failure in the functioning of financial institutions or financial markets. Financial instability is characterised by disturbances in credit availability or the flow of capital. In most cases, this will have consequences for output, employment and inflation. Financial stability therefore fosters price stability.  In Norway, the authorities’ work on financial stability is divided between the Ministry of Finance, the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission and Norges Bank. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for establishing a framework which ensures that Norway has a financial industry that functions smoothly. The Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission is responsible for supervising the financial sector. Norges Bank shall foster robust and efficient payment systems and financial                                                       1  See for example Ferguson (2002): "Should Financial Stability Be an Explicit Central Bank Objective?". This article was presented at the IMF conference, Challenges to Central Banking from Globalized Financial Markets, on 17 September 2002. 
2 BIS Review 25/2003 markets, i.e. foster financial stability. This is in accordance with the Norges Bank Act and the Payment Systems Act. Primarily, we wish to avoid instability in the financial system. A number of instruments are available, including regulation of financial markets, oversight and shaping the financial infrastructure. Norges Bank’s instruments are primarily the interest rate, banks’ borrowing facilities, including requirements for collateral that can be accepted to secure such lending, and its oversight of the payment systems. We are also obligated to alert the Ministry of Finance when we assess the situation as cause for concern. The Financial Stability reports are an important tool. Norges Bank can also serve as the lender of last resort. This is reserved for very special situations where financial stability may be threatened. Without financial institutions and financial markets that function smoothly, the effects of interest rate changes on inflation and employment will be unstable and uncertain. Low and stable inflation provides households and enterprises with a clear indication of changes in relative prices. This makes it easier for economic agents to make the right decisions and contributes to price stability in financial and property markets. Low and stable inflation therefore provides the best foundation for financial stability. The two objectives normally underpin each other.  Previous financial crises in Norway From history, we know about a number of financial crises in Norway. During the time of the silver and gold standard prior to 1914, banking crises occurred relatively frequently and were mainly regional. This is an indication that banks at that time were small and locally anchored. Therefore, the crises did not spread through the banking system. Many Norwegian banks experienced liquidity and solvency problems in 1857 following the collapse of the US railroad industry, in 1864 in Oppland, in 1886 in Arendal and in Kristiania (now Oslo) in 1899-1905. The Norwegian author Alexander Kielland depicts the local financial bubble in Stavanger in the 1880s in his book Fortuna. There was a surge in credit growth and speculation in commercial bills that did not represent actual values. Speculation formed the basis for quick gains and it all ended in bankruptcies and banks that failed.  A dramatic scene in the book is the following: When the clock struck 1, Taraldsen hurried in - the old messenger from Norges Bank; he always trotted with arms flailing. He stopped at Marcussen’s desk and greeted him; an uncertain smile quivering on his old face as he asked: "It is - hmm - of course an oversight?" "What!" responded Marcussen drily. The smile disappeared rather quickly and in breathless surprise Taraldsen asked again: "Aren’t your bills of exchange to be redeemed today?" "No." "Mr. Marcussen! People say that you are a jocular man; but this -" "I’m not joking - damn it!" Old Taraldsen straightened up; everyone was hunched over their work; only young Rasmus’ eyes met his. The boy was white as a sheet; he began to understand. It also started to become clear for old Taraldsen; but immediately afterwards, he became very confused again; because he understood the entire scope of this; he had the entire town's bills of exchange in his head; and of course he had seen a lot of this kind of thing during his long life but all of those were trifles compared to what would happen now. His voice shook as he almost ceremoniously asked: "Will Carsten Løvdahl’s papers be protested?" "Yes," replied Marcussen without looking up. Old Taraldsen trotted out of the offices; but on the steps he met the messenger from Aktiebanken: "Is it true? - Taraldsen!" "Now the entire town is collapsing," answered the old man, throwing up his arms in despair." 
BIS Review 25/2003 3 Kielland’s description of a financial crisis and the consequences were realistic. There was speculation then and there is speculation today, but in other kinds of financial instruments than at that time.  The 1899 banking crisis in Kristiania was the most serious of the regional crises. The crisis was particular to Norway, following in the wake of the strong property boom and the subsequent crash in summer 1899.  The next two banking crises, in 1920-1928 and 1988-1992, were far more severe than the earlier crises. There were particular reasons for each of the last three crises, but they also have much in common: Asset prices rose quickly prior to crises.2 Each cyclical upswing had its speculation objects. Property prices and share prices for property companies rose to a very high level in the last half of the 1890s. Share prices, particularly in shipping and whaling, rose dramatically during the First World War, then fell markedly afterwards. In the 1980s, prices for dwellings and commercial property increased rapidly.  Households and enterprises increased their debt more than their nominal income in the periods of expansion before the crises. High debt made them more vulnerable to loss of income or increases in real interest rates. The debt burden increased less in the 1890s and during the First World War due to a strong increase in nominal income. Under the gold standard, however, periods of growth in nominal income were normally followed by periods with a fall in nominal income. The debt burden thereby increased when the economy declined.  During the three banking crises, many banks had an aggressive lending policy. Bank lending (in constant prices) increased sharply prior to the crises and decreased markedly afterwards. Deflation in the 1920s led to a real increase in lending and debt. Favourable financing terms for banks underpinned expansion during all three periods. In the second half of the 1890s and during the First World War, commercial banks expanded sharply by issuing new equity. Savings banks were not as expansive. One reason for this may be that savings banks were subject to a certain degree of supervision and regulation. There was little regulation of commercial banks until the interwar years. In all three crises, the banks that were most expansive were also the most severely affected in the subsequent crises. In the 1980s, strong lending growth was primarily made possible by foreign funding. When foreign funding dried up, when confidence in the Norwegian economy deteriorated, bank borrowing from Norges Bank increased sharply. In addition, collateral was not required – as it is now – as security for loans from Norges Bank. During the banking crisis that followed, the division of responsibility between the government authorities and Norges Bank was clarified. If solvency support proves to be necessary, the guarantee funds, and as a last resort the government, shall provide such support. The supply of extraordinary liquidity is one of the instruments available to Norges Bank, but it will only be used in special situations when financial stability may be threatened. We must exercise the role of provider of emergency liquidity in close cooperation with the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission and the Ministry of Finance.  In the 1980s, prices for dwellings and commercial property increased rapidly. A rapid and sharp increase in asset prices provided the basis for higher loans. This created the basis for surging, debt-financed consumption which in turn contributed to higher inflation. House prices began to fall in 1988 and equity prices started to drop in 1990. At that time, enterprises and households had a very high debt burden, and were therefore vulnerable to weaker economic developments. Many wished to reduce their debt as a result of the decline in wealth. Consumption and fixed investment were reduced. The need for financial consolidation added force to the downturn in the Norwegian economy at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. The crises in 1920-1928 and in 1988-1992 were far more severe than the crisis in 1899-1905. They led to a decline in output and employment and this contributed to wide fluctuations in the economy.  The crisis in 1899-1905 had an impact on fixed investment in particular. Fixed investment declined sharply during the crisis after having risen prior to the crisis. The same thing happened during the crisis of 1988-1992. Not all periods with a strong upswing end in a downturn. After the deregulation of the 1980s, the upswing was so strong, the financial imbalances were so large and the high level of inflation had gained such a firm foothold that a downturn was almost impossible to avoid.                                                        2  For a more detailed description of the Norwegian crises see Gerdrup (2003): Three episodes of financial fragility in Norway since the 1890s, a forthcoming article in BIS Working Papers. 
4 BIS Review 25/2003 Monetary policy and financial stability Norges Bank’s operational objective for monetary policy is inflation over time of 2½ per cent. This objective can normally be achieved by applying different interest rate paths. The choice of path may have an impact on developments in output and employment in the short term. It may also affect how quickly we achieve the inflation target. Choosing between the different strategies involves balancing fluctuations in output and employment against deviations from the inflation target in the short term. A rapid and pronounced change in the interest rate would be appropriate in cases where there is a risk that inflation may deviate considerably from the target over a longer period, or where heightening turbulence in financial markets or a cost-push shock resulting from wage negotiations indicate that confidence in monetary policy is in jeopardy. Financial market confidence in the inflation target provides Norges Bank with greater opportunities for promoting stability in the real economy, even more so as inflation targeting is incorporated as an anchor for wage determination. The impact of monetary policy occurs with a lag. The current inflation rate does not therefore provide sufficient information to determine the level at which interest rates should be set now. Our analyses indicate that a substantial share of the effects of an interest rate change will occur within two years. Two years is thus a reasonable time horizon for achieving the inflation target of 2½ per cent. Using this time horizon, we avoid substantial variations in output and employment. A shorter horizon than two years would result in wider swings in production.  Credit developments and developments in equity and property prices influence inflation. With an inflation targeting regime, we take these variables into account to a certain extent when setting interest rates. Equities and dwellings account for a substantial share of household wealth. Higher equity and house prices increase the value of this wealth. The increase in wealth can relatively rapidly result in rising consumption. Several studies indicate that an increase in the value of housing wealth is more likely to lead to higher consumption than a corresponding increase in the value of equity wealth. Higher prices for commercial buildings may be passed on in the form of higher prices for goods and services. Developments in asset prices can thus affect inflation more directly.  In Norway, a high proportion of households own their own dwelling. Even when we include securities funds and some insurance claims, Norwegian households’ housing wealth is far higher than their equity wealth. For Norwegian households, changes in house prices will therefore probably have a greater impact on consumption than changes in equity prices. In Norway, it became more common to own equities for all income and age groups in the 1990s. This was to a large extent reversed last year as a result of the fall in equity prices. We should nevertheless not rule out the possibility that fluctuations in equity prices in the future may have stronger effects on the real economy than we have witnessed so far. Developments in various asset prices may also influence investment. High equity prices may make it easier to gain access to capital to finance the acquisition of new machinery and buildings. A rise in property prices provides scope for raising larger loans against collateral in the asset. Possibilities for increased credit may contribute to higher demand for goods and services. The process may be self-reinforcing since part of the available credit can be used to purchase dwellings and other property. Similarly, bubbles in the stock market can result in overinvestment. When equity and property prices start to fall, companies are left with too much real capital and investment declines. This may lead to or amplify an economic downturn. There may be several factors that imply that particular emphasis should not be placed on financial imbalances in the conduct of monetary policy. First, it may take a long time before imbalances are triggered. The uncertainty surrounding developments so far ahead is considerable. In addition, it is often difficult to determine with a sufficient degree of certainty whether financial imbalances are developing. It is also difficult to determine the magnitude of the imbalances and how close they are to being triggered. An increase in interest rates will not necessarily curb the build-up of financial imbalances to a sufficient extent. It cannot be ruled out that in some cases very substantial interest rate changes will be required. The costs may then be high. History has demonstrated that the basis for downturns is laid during upturns. Financial crises are often characterised by an initial phase of excessive optimism, where risk assessments deteriorate, the willingness to incur debt increases and asset prices rise. When negative news appears and spreads, investments do not match expectations and the sentiment is reversed, asset prices fall. Many 
BIS Review 25/2003 5 experience problems in servicing their debt. The factors that contributed to the upturn may also amplify the downturn. As a rule, periods of expansion are accompanied by higher inflation. The objectives of price stability and financial stability then imply the same medicine: a higher interest rate. However, this will not always be the case. In Japan, equity and property prices surged in the 1980s, while inflation was low. In the US, household and corporate debt rose fairly sharply and equity prices trebled between 1994 and 1999, and inflation was moderate. Some observers3 have therefore posed the following question: has the functioning of the economy changed so that higher demand does not necessarily translate into higher inflation, but instead results in growing financial imbalances? If so, a conflict may arise between achieving the inflation target in the short term and financial stability. There are several reasons why financial bubbles can develop in periods of low inflation. First, a highly credible monetary policy results in low inflation expectations. Explicit or implicit long-term price and wage contracts will become more common. It will take longer for higher demand to translate into higher inflation. Cyclical changes will have less impact on inflation. Moreover, periods of higher productivity growth may lay the basis for high corporate earnings, heightened optimism and reduced risk awareness. At the same time, with strong productivity growth, inflation remains low. Banks that record low losses and solid results can increase lending without eroding their capital adequacy level. Debt-financed investments may lead to a faster rise in house and property prices. A third factor is that strong international competition may contribute to curbing inflation during a period of strong economic expansion. China, because of its access to an abundance of cheap labour and its substantial production capacity, has contributed to a fall in prices for many manufactured goods. In Norway, we have not experienced situations where there has been a conflict between the objectives of financial stability and price stability. Prior to the last banking crisis, household debt rose sharply and house prices increased, while at the same time inflation was high. When monetary policy was eased last year, a sharp rise in domestic costs, with the outlook pointing to higher inflation, was accompanied by high credit growth. House prices are now falling, which in the long run will probably contribute to curbing credit growth. Wage growth has been reduced and inflation is subdued. Even though high asset prices and strong credit growth build up in a period of low inflation, these imbalances may influence inflation in the somewhat longer run. In that event, a tightening of monetary policy may be consistent with the objective of maintaining low and stable inflation over time. This will also stabilise developments in production. In order to achieve this, economists have recommended that monetary policy should place emphasis on developments in credit growth and asset prices when extraordinary conditions so warrant. In some cases, this will mean that a somewhat longer horizon than normal is applied in order to achieve the inflation target. The advantage is that substantial deviations from the target would be avoided in the somewhat longer run. If imbalances have been allowed over time to become severe, however, situations may arise where the interest rate should be set lower than implied by the inflation target, in order to prevent financial instability from being triggered. In the Norges Bank Watch report of 25 September 2001, Norges Bank was encouraged to place greater emphasis on asset prices. A two-stage strategy was proposed. The first stage is the current flexible inflation targeting. The second stage consists of monitoring credit developments and asset prices and, in special cases, overruling the signals given by the first stage. This is in line with the reasoning above. Statements by the Monetary Policy Committee in the Bank of England last autumn are an example of the emphasis placed on risk factors for future economic developments. In the minutes of the meeting on 9-10 October 2002, the Committee pointed to the build-up of financial imbalances as a factor which implied that the interest rate should be kept unchanged rather than reducing it. Considerable work remains before the available indicators of financial imbalances can be regarded as satisfactory. High credit growth or sharp rises in asset prices alone do not necessarily pose a threat to financial stability.

6 BIS Review 25/2003 rise in asset prices and a high level of investment will almost always put pressures on the financial system.4 Earlier banking crises may provide some indication of where the critical levels are. The IMF has shown that bubbles that burst in the housing market lead to a financial crisis more often than stock market bubbles.5 The IMF also finds that the probability of bubbles bursting in the housing market is greater than is the case for stock markets. A decline in the housing market also has a greater impact on output and employment. Housing wealth has a greater impact on consumption than other assets. The contagion effects via the banking system are stronger because housing and property loans normally account for a substantial share of banks’ loans. A sharp rise in asset prices and debt build-up may pose a risk to economic stability. To minimise this risk, there may be situations when it is appropriate to apply a somewhat longer horizon than the normal two-year horizon for achieving the inflation target. A precondition for this is that financial market participants are confident that inflation will be low and stable over time. The current situation Today, private sector debt and house prices are at a historically high level. Banks’ loan losses will probably rise. However, our assessment is that the banking sector is reasonably well equipped to cope with the increase. For a long time, household debt in Norway has risen at a far higher rate than income growth. The debt burden has therefore risen rapidly and is high in a historical context. Partly as a result of the reduction in interest rates, interest expenses are moderate. High and growing debt means, however, that households are vulnerable to sharp increases in interest rates or a substantial rise in unemployment. Some groups of households are particularly at risk. The change in monetary policy from an exchange rate target to an inflation target has probably made it less likely that households will be exposed to a "dual shock" in the form of higher unemployment and higher interest rates, as was the case during the banking crisis. This may imply that households can bear a somewhat higher debt burden than was the case prior to the banking crisis. The level of household debt in Norway is also high by international standards, although not as high as in Denmark. However, if we look at debt in relation to wealth, the picture is very similar for all the Nordic countries. In Denmark, household financial wealth is high, while housing wealth is relatively high among households in Norway. The value of the housing stock may partly explain the level of debt. However, housing wealth does not provide a liquid buffer against payment problems. After a lengthy and sharp increase, house prices have edged down recently. From May last year to May this year, house prices fell by 1.1 per cent.6 The price level is nonetheless high in a historical context. Growth in corporate debt has been more moderate, but the debt burden is high. Debt growth among Norwegian borrowers can also be illustrated by the credit gap, an indicator developed by the BIS. The credit gap is derived from developments in the ratio of credit to nominal GDP and is defined as the deviation between actual developments in this variable and trend. The analyses show that a credit gap of more than 4 percentage points can predict almost 80 per cent of banking crises in a selection of countries. In some cases, the indicator also signals some banking crises that do not materialise. Accuracy improves when other indicators are included in addition to the credit gap. The credit gap for Norway was above the "critical" level prior to and during the crisis in the 1920s. This was first due to high debt growth and later to a fall in GDP. During the Second World War, private sector debt fell sharply, but was followed by a catch-up period. The next episode of a high credit gap was in the 1980s, prior to the last banking crisis. The gap is also high today.                                                       4  Borio, and Lowe (2002): "Asset prices, financial and monetary stability: exploring the nexus", BIS Working Papers No. 114. 5  IMF (2003): World Economic Outlook, April. 6  Source: Norwegian Association of Real Estate Agents, Association of Real Estate Agency Firms, FINN.no (Norwegian search database for classified advertising, including real estate, on the Internet) and ECON. 
BIS Review 25/2003 7 More sluggish developments in the Norwegian economy have contributed to a sharp rise in the number of bankruptcies over the past year. In spite of the pronounced reduction in interest rates in recent months, we must expect a large number of bankruptcies and somewhat higher bank losses in the period ahead as a result of continued rather weak economic growth in Norway. Gross non-performing loans to the business sector increased considerably through 2002. During the banking crisis, loans to commercial property companies accounted for a substantial share of banks’ loan losses. Losses on such loans are relatively small today. Lower rental and property prices and higher vacancy rates may suggest that losses in this sector will increase in the period ahead. Most banks, including the largest, have satisfactory financial strength and are fairly well equipped to cope with substantial losses. We therefore consider the outlook for financial stability to be satisfactory, even though loan losses are moving up. Debt growth and the level of household debt are high. However, we expect debt growth to slow in time, partly due to weaker economic developments and as an after-effect of the levelling-off of house prices. Consequently, developments in debt and house prices are no longer an obstacle to an easing of monetary policy. The exchange rate as an asset price An asset price of particular importance to economic developments is the exchange rate. It differs from other asset prices in a number of ways and it is to a lesser extent linked to financial stability. In the long term, changes in the exchange rate will essentially be based on underlying fundamentals. If inflation in Norway is persistently higher than that of our trading partners, the nominal krone exchange rate will tend to depreciate. In the very long term, the nominal exchange rate will therefore be determined by inflation differentials. There is a tendency for the real exchange rate to return to its long-term average. Changes in the real exchange rate in the short and medium term may also reflect, for example, differences in productivity growth across countries or developments in the terms of trade.  Bubbles may develop in the foreign exchange market in the same way as in markets for other assets. However, abrupt changes in the exchange rate are not necessarily a bubble. The exchange rate may move more in the short term than is necessary in the long term. One reason may be that the exchange rate must overshoot its long-term level because market participants weigh the interest rate differential against the possibility of a future depreciation of the krone. The relatively wide interest rate differential between Norway and other countries was an important driving force behind the appreciation of the krone from 2000 to 2002. Themes in the foreign exchange market vary over time. Analyses carried out by Norges Bank indicate that the interest rate differential has a greater impact on the exchange rate the more equity prices fall and the lower the expected variability is between the main currencies. The oil price increased considerably from the end of 2001. In isolation, this probably also contributed to making the Norwegian krone more attractive. Norway’s key rate, the sight deposit rate, has been among the highest in the OECD countries. The fewer countries there are with a wide interest rate differential, the greater the demand will be for NOK-denominated assets.  The exchange rate may serve as an automatic stabiliser. In periods of excessive activity in the economy, or expectations of excessive activity, the exchange rate may appreciate, even if the sight deposit rate does not change. Similarly, the exchange rate may depreciate if activity is low. With inflation targeting, we no longer have a specific objective for the krone exchange rate. The krone is floating. The exchange rate represents an important channel through which monetary policy functions. Changes in the exchange rate are desirable when they contribute to stabilising inflation. To what extent the exchange rate will depreciate as a result of a reduction in the sight deposit rate depends on several factors. The more the krone depreciates as a result of a reduction in interest rates, the less the sight deposit rate will have to be reduced when it is appropriate to relax monetary policy. A weaker currency contributes to higher economic activity and thereby higher inflation. In addition, consumer price inflation will increase because prices for imported consumer goods will be higher if the exchange rate depreciates. The response to a change in the exchange rate will depend on how the change is judged to influence inflation. This is consistent with the way we normally take other asset prices into account. 
8 BIS Review 25/2003 Conclusion In conclusion, I would like to comment briefly on current economic developments. Global economic growth appears to be weaker than previously projected. This is partly because the after-effects of the financial bubble that burst appear to be more substantial and more protracted than previously assumed. It is expected that a number of countries will reduce their interest rates again, and that the level of interest rates in other countries will remain low for some time. In Norway, price inflation is lower than implied by the inflation target and will remain low in the period ahead. The krone has remained strong, partly due to the fall in international interest rates, weakening the impact of our interest rate reductions.  Growth in the Norwegian economy is now likely to be weak. Although private consumption continues to show strong growth and oil investment is providing an impetus to the Norwegian business sector, labour market developments have been weaker than expected in our previous Inflation Report. Employment has fallen and unemployment is on the rise. House prices are falling and many commercial properties are vacant. It now appears that fiscal policy will have a more neutral impact on overall demand, and growth in public consumption and employment is no longer rising. Fiscal policy as drawn up in the Revised National Budget will therefore not contribute to locking in the strong krone. One encouraging development is that wage growth appears to have moderated more quickly than expected. This may partly be explained by the interim wage settlement this year, as in 1999. However, with greater awareness on the part of employers in the public sector and a low level of activity in some business sectors, the risk that wage growth will again pick up seems to have been reduced. Norges Bank has previously stated that a rapid and pronounced change in the interest rate would be appropriate if, for example, heightening turbulence in financial markets or a cost-push shock resulting from wage negotiations indicate that confidence in monetary policy is in jeopardy. Similarly, it would be appropriate to change the interest rate in larger steps if the outlook points to inflation that deviates substantially from the inflation target over a longer period. We have experienced a period of monetary policy easing. This period is not over. The next assessment of the interest rate will take place at Norges Bank’s Executive Board meeting on 25 June. Our next Inflation Report will be presented at the same time. 
 BIS Review 24/2003 1 Vladu(cid:154)ić Ljubi(cid:154)a: Recent developments in the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina  Speech by Mr Vladu(cid:154)ić Ljubi(cid:154)a, Vice Governor of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the 9th Meeting of the Governors’ Club in the Region of Black Sea, Balkans and Central Asia, Bucharest, 23 May 2003. *      *      * Thank you Mr. Chairman, Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish to pay my respect to you all on behalf of the CBBH. I will speak about several key development components which have represented current issues in the CBBH since the last meeting. Currency Board Arrangement In the period since its establishment to date, the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina has developed according to the Basic Principle of Monetary Policy, this being the Currency Board Arrangement. The Currency Board in BiH has been set up on very clear principles: (cid:150) stability of the local currency and its issue and withdrawal from circulation; (cid:150) fixed exchange rate with full coverage in free convertible foreign exchange funds; (cid:150) management of foreign exchange reserves in a safe and profitable way; (cid:150) setting up and maintaining payment and settlement systems; (cid:150) coordination of activities of banking supervision agencies; (cid:150) provision of the required reserve maintenance. By conducting such monetary policy, we have achieved the following results: (cid:150) confidence in the local currency; (cid:150) stable exchange rate; (cid:150) growth of foreign exchange reserves which have now stabilized at around EURO 1,1 billion, which is a four-month imports coverage; (cid:150) price stability; (cid:150) decrease of inflation, which is now slightly above zero; (cid:150) improvement of the country(cid:146)s payment foreign exchange position; (cid:150) stability of public sector. During the previous months, there has been a discussion in BiH whether we should keep such strict Currency Board rules. The International Conference was organized in April on the Role of the Currency Board in Monetary Policy - History and Practice. Some of the participants were representatives of East European countries which have their monetary policy based on Currency Board. The basic opinion expressed during this Conference was that Currency Board was successful in all these countries, but also that Currency Board in those countries was more flexible. As a result, the opinion expressed at this conference, and also that of the Central Bank and BiH authorities is that BiH should keep the Currency Board set up as presently, with the aim to provide global financial stability, searching additional possibilities to make the Currency Board serve development and to enable the Central Bank to participate more actively in the financial sector and to issue short-term securities. 
 2 BIS Review 24/2003 The additional reason is that the Currency Board Arrangement is important for BiH economy and it is a base for continuation of maintaining and improving financial stability, through which the development of other sectors of economy is influenced. Required reserves The required reserve is the only instrument of monetary policy available in BiH, within the Currency Board Arrangement. The purpose of the required reserve is to provide appropriate liquidity of the banking sector and accomplish the global financial stability in the country. One of the most significant changes in monetary policy which is related to required reserve will start as of 01 June. The goals to be achieved by the suggested measures are the following: (cid:150) efficiency and stability of monetary policy within the Currency Board arrangement. The aim is to give more flexibility to the CBBH so that it can react to prompt changes in the surrounding; (cid:150) harmonization aimed at adjusting the regulations on the required reserve to the European standards; and (cid:150) financial stability, meaning that global financial stability should be increased by means of banks’ required reserves. In order to achieve the mentioned goals, the CBBH has made four changes in the implementation of banks’ required reserves: 1. The base for required reserve is expanded to include also foreign exchange deposits, in addition to KM deposits. The defined required reserve in the previous period (10% on deposits and borrowed funds in KM) fulfilled its function and did not endanger the liquidity. However, as only local currency KM was included in the base for required reserve settlement, it resulted in unequal position of the local currency compared to deposits in foreign currency. 2. Cash held by banks in their vaults will no longer be eligible for maintenance of required reserves. It will be possible to meet the requirement only with deposits held by banks in the reserve accounts with the CBBH. 3. Now, the CBBH can determine the rate at any level within the scope of 0-20%. This change will provide more flexibility to our Governing Board. The required reserve rate has already been defined. From 01 June, it will be 5% on the expanded base, instead of the previous 10% on KM deposits. 4. The Central Bank has more flexibility to determine compensation to be paid to banks on reserve deposits. Results of monetary policy The successful monetary policy has influenced the improvement of situation in the banking sector. The consolidation of the global banking sector has taken place, as it follows: (cid:150) privatization of banks has been completed; (cid:150) minimum capital requirement was increased to KM 15 million; (cid:150) merger of banks; (cid:150) considerable increase of assets and capital; (cid:150) increase of credit potential; (cid:150) introduction of new products and services; (cid:150) deposit insurance; (cid:150) increase of the volume of payment transactions. 
 BIS Review 24/2003 3 The privatization of the banking sector is in its final stage. The share of the state capital in the banking sector is around 10%. Consolidation of banking sector is obvious. Out of 55 banks in 2000, 40 banks are currently operating in BiH. Share capital in 2002 amounted to KM 745 million and was higher by 19% compared to 2001. The balance sheet assets of banks reached KM 5.535 million in the end of 2002, and compared to the end of 2001, they were higher by 22% or by KM 995 million. Within the structure of assets, the most important is the share of loans amounting to 55%. In the total liabilities, deposits take 75%, and capital takes 15%. Financial sector in BiH is estimated to have accomplished satisfactory results and that the situation in this sector is much healthier than in the previous period. New initiatives Initiative has been started in BiH for the establishment of capital market, as one of the segments of the total financial system. In this respect, guidelines for work have been set up. Accordingly, Capital Market Council has been recently established and its work scope defined. The Council will have an advisory role and discuss the issues related to securities and capital market, guided by the international standards and principles in this field. Finally, the independent monetary policy in BiH, legislation and supervision of the banking sector represent a good base for further improvements in this field and the base for preparations for joining the European Union. Adherence to the international standards, principles of the Basle Committee and the norms of the European Union are necessary for further progress and strengthening of financial stability. Thank you for your attention. 
 BIS Review 24/2003 1 Mark W Olson: Assessing prospects for economic growth in the United States  Speech by Mr Mark W Olson, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Chambers of Commerce of Bloomington, Eden Prairie and Edina Bloomington, Minnesota, 22 May 2003. *      *      * Thank you for the invitation to be with you today. I would like to focus my remarks largely on what I think will, over time, lead the U.S. economy back to a path of solid economic expansion. In particular, I want to explain to you why I believe that, although the economy still faces substantial risks and although the timing and the extent of a pickup in activity remain uncertain, the stage has been set for an improvement in the economic climate. To lay the groundwork for that discussion and to put the current situation into perspective, I will briefly step back and touch on some recent economic history. I should note that my comments today reflect my own opinions and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee.  As you know, the latter half of the 1990s was a time of remarkable economic performance. Businesses added workers and expanded output at a rapid clip. The unemployment rate fell from over 7-1/2 percent in the middle of 1992 to just under 4 percent by the end of 2000. In Minnesota, the unemployment rate fell from 5.2 percent to 3.4 percent over the same period. The stock market soared, and - remarkably enough - core inflation moderated. Much of this performance was fueled by an investment boom that also contributed importantly to rapid growth in labor productivity. To be sure, some of the acceleration in productivity over that period was cyclical in nature; but more critical for our longer-run economic performance is that at least a portion of the pickup now appears sustainable.  By late 2000, the boom had come to an end. The stock market began to retreat in early 2000, and by the end of the year, analysts were revising down their expectations for future earnings. Many businesses were cutting back sharply on capital investment - particularly in high-tech equipment - as demand and profits weakened and many companies, such as those in the telecommunications industry, found that they had overspent on equipment during the boom.  The downturn in the economy, which began in 2000, had two distinct characteristics. First, and thankfully, it turned out to be one of the shallowest in our economic history. Second, it was one of the few business-led recessions in the United States since the end of the Second World War. Most recessions since then have been brought on by sharp cutbacks in spending by households, with housing and consumer durables among the most sensitive sectors.  The recent experience was clearly different. Consumer spending and residential investment were both relatively well maintained throughout 2001, even as firms cut employment and stock market losses eroded household wealth. Despite only modest increases in nominal wages and salaries, households’ real disposable income was supported by tax cuts and lower inflation. In addition, low interest rates helped promote spending. As you know, consumers took advantage of falling mortgage rates to buy new homes, to refinance their existing mortgage debt, and to tap into their increasing home equity to pay off more expensive debt or to finance spending on other things. As a result, the contraction in real GDP during the first three quarters of 2001 turned out to be quite shallow despite the disruptive economic fallout from the horrific events of September 11.  By early last summer, economic recovery appeared to be under way. Real GDP increased at an annual rate of roughly 3-1/2 percent over the first three quarters of the year. Businesses seemed to have brought their inventories into better alignment with sales, and employment began to rise again, though the gains were too small to make a dent in the unemployment rate. A particularly encouraging development, given the nature of the downturn, was that the contraction in business investment appeared to be slowing while household spending, still supported by low interest rates and gains in real disposable income, continued to trend up.  Although the government statistics were looking a bit better, signs appeared over the summer that the economy’s resilience would be tested by several new shocks. As a banker who experienced several previous economic downturns, I know that whatever weaknesses exist in our economy become problematic at the low point of the economic cycle. At such times, we typically see loan losses and evidence of weak business models. What emerged in early 2002 was not what I had expected. The Enron and WorldCom scandals raised serious concerns about the adequacy of the corporate 
 2 BIS Review 24/2003 governance system and tended to cloud the outlook for business expansion. Abroad, mounting tensions with Iraq were beginning to take their toll on consumer and business confidence. The stock market moved down again, conditions eroded in corporate debt markets, and risk spreads widened. As we moved into the fall, industrial production faltered, and business investment posted only modest and uneven gains. By the final quarter of 2002, real GDP growth had slowed to a pace of 1-1/2 percent, and heightened caution in the business sector showed through to renewed layoffs and a sharp cutback in inventory investment.  That brief review brings us to this year, which began with a few bright spots: Concerns about corporate governance were apparently receding, employment and industrial production moved up solidly in January, and the unemployment rate edged down a bit. Unfortunately, these improvements were short-lived. In late February and early March, as the confrontation with Iraq heated up, uncertainty was pervasive. No one knew if or when the war would start, or end. The possibilities that chemical or biological weapons might be used, that the war might spread, or that terrorists might again attack on U.S. soil seemed to be quite real. There was a risk that Iraq’s oil fields might be damaged. The ranges of possible outcomes and of their economic consequences were extremely wide.  The uncertainty hit consumer confidence hard. The University of Michigan’s survey of consumer attitudes reported that, by the middle of March, confidence had fallen to its lowest level since the early 1990s and was below what we would have expected given the state of the economy. The oil, equity, and financial markets all showed signs of strain. Oil prices rose to nearly $40 per barrel in early March, though civil strife in Venezuela undoubtedly played a role in the increase. Broad stock market indexes moved down about 10 percent in the two months leading up to the war, and the equity risk premium widened. Measures of implied volatility in stocks edged up. All in all, the economy’s performance in the first quarter of 2003 ended up little better than it was in the fourth quarter of 2002. Real GDP again rose at an annual rate of about 1-1/2 percent as both households and businesses reined in spending. Our overall economic performance would have been even weaker had housing markets not remained vibrant.  Fortunately, the range of plausible outcomes narrowed significantly even before the official conclusion of hostilities with Iraq. As the onset of the war became imminent, financial markets rallied. Oil prices fell sharply during the week that ended with coalition missile attacks on Baghdad.  Two months have passed since the war began, and we do not yet have a clear understanding of how strongly the economy is emerging from this most recent shock. The most positive signs are responses from energy and equity markets. The price of crude oil has returned to levels that prevailed at the end of last year, and both households and businesses should welcome the lower energy bills. Equity values, with additional support from generally favorable earnings reports, are up substantially. Spreads have narrowed significantly, continuing the downward trend that began last fall. Other positive signs include further reductions in mortgage interest rates and the rebound in consumer confidence. All told, these indicators point to a noticeable reduction in the economic tensions that built up earlier this year.  Though markets can respond instantly to positive news, business investment decisions adjust more slowly, and that distinction is evident in current production and employment data. Businesses cut another 80,000 jobs in April, the jobless rate moved up to 6 percent, and new claims for unemployment insurance in recent weeks remain at levels associated with little net change in jobs. (In Minnesota, the jobless rate moved up to 4.4 percent in March, and about 28,000 workers filed claims for unemployment compensation in April.) Industrial production fell 1/2 percent in both March and April, and capacity utilization is under 75 percent. Retail sales have been, on balance, lackluster in recent months.  Turning briefly to inflation, last week’s report on the consumer price index showed, as expected, that consumer energy prices had begun to retreat noticeably last month, reversing about one-third of the run-up over the first three months of the year. In April, prices of core goods and services - that is, consumer prices excluding food and energy - were unchanged for a second month. As a result, the core CPI was up just 1-1/2 percent from last April.  On balance, these indicators suggest that the economy will probably remain soft in the near future and that inflation will remain low. Nonetheless, I continue to believe that the pieces are in place for future robust growth.  Looking back over the past three years, I am struck by how much the U.S. economy has had to contend with. For much of the period since mid-2001, large negative wealth effects from the falling stock market, the shakeout in the high-tech sector, and the slowdown in economic activity abroad 
 BIS Review 24/2003 3 have combined to restrain economic activity. Outside shocks, such as September 11, corporate scandals, and the war with Iraq, provided additional drag to renewed expansion. The economy, however, proved to be remarkably resilient.  Looking forward, one must ask, what will lead to economic growth? The best way to start answering that question is to look at the fundamental forces shaping economic activity. In that regard, a first consideration is that financial conditions should prove conducive to stronger economic growth over the next year or so. Monetary policy is very accommodative. The nominal federal funds rate is currently 1-1/4 percent, a level that, using standard measures of core consumer price inflation, implies a real funds rate that is at or below zero, as compared with the real rate’s long-run average of about 2-3/4 percent. With corporate risk spreads having narrowed considerably, borrowing terms are now quite favorable. Business financing needs have been very limited recently, and demand for credit has been weak. But the financial sector is well capitalized and under little stress, and lenders should be well positioned to fund a pickup in business demand for credit. In addition, as I noted earlier, equity prices have moved up again.  Fiscal policy, like monetary policy, has been providing fundamental stimulus to economic growth over the past two years, through both tax cuts and higher outlays for defense. The tax proposals currently under consideration by the Congress could add to that stimulus, either by accelerating some of the tax cuts enacted previously or by excluding some portion of dividends from taxable income.  A third factor underpinning longer-run prospects for growth is the sustained strong uptrend in labor productivity. Labor productivity rose 2 percent in 2001, a remarkable showing for a recession year, and it was up an additional 4 percent in 2002. Productivity appears to have a strong underlying trend, which could support overall income growth even if the weakness in the labor market continues for a while longer.  In assessing how these factors will play out over time, I find it useful to consider separately how they translate into a pickup in demand among households and among businesses. From the perspective of households, the combination of lower energy prices and tax cuts should help bolster real disposable income in the near term. In addition, the drag on household spending from the earlier declines in stock market wealth should gradually diminish, especially if the stock market holds on to its recent gains. Low interest rates should allow consumers to continue to finance their purchases relatively cheaply, whether through home equity loans or through more standard instruments.  The outlook for the business sector is perhaps a more critical consideration. Here, too, the fundamentals look favorable. In the near term, lower oil prices should reduce the costs of production for many businesses and free funds for other uses. Also, with interest rates low, the incentives for capital expenditure in the tax code in place until late 2004, and prices for high-tech goods still falling, the cost of capital should remain low. Over the longer run, the continuing rapid pace of technological innovation implies that there are many potential investments that offer attractive returns. In the uncertain business environment that has prevailed for some time, many businesses have probably been making do with their existing equipment, stretching out their normal replacement cycles, especially for rapidly depreciating high-tech equipment. Overall, though shifts in business attitudes are difficult to measure, I believe that markets reward businesses that outperform their competitors and that, as demand picks up, companies will respond to opportunities to incorporate technological advances in production, communication, and organization. Because of the uncertainties that have been restraining investment, predicting exactly when firms will act is difficult; but I do believe that they will act.  As you can see, I remain generally optimistic about the longer-run prospects for the U.S. economy. However, I want to mention some significant questions about the outlook. Perhaps the most significant is whether the slump in capital spending will be more prolonged than expected. Such a slump could occur if firms remain so uncertain about the outlook for a pickup in sales that they continue to shelve plans for upgrading or expanding their businesses. Given the very low levels of capacity utilization both in our factories and in service-providing industries such as telecom and air transportation and the high vacancy rates in many office buildings, this risk is not trivial. For example, here in the Twin Cities metro area, one-fifth of available office space sat empty at the end of last year.  Another question that is frequently asked is whether financial stress in the household sector might restrain growth. Specifically, some argue that the high level of consumer debt might mean that households will be unable to increase spending substantially for some time to come. To be sure, the debt service burden is quite high by historical standards, and personal bankruptcies moved up in 2001 and 2002. However, households have been converting their more expensive, non-tax-deductible debt 
 4 BIS Review 24/2003 into mortgage debt, which has helped keep the debt service burden fairly stable during the past few years. What is more, banks are not experiencing broad weakness in their consumer loan portfolios as most of the increase in delinquencies has been in a narrow spectrum of households. On the whole, looking at the available evidence, I tend to give less weight to the questions concerning the financial situation of households than I do to the risks of continued uncertainty in the business sector.  A third question bearing on the outlook for the U.S. economy regards prospects for a pickup in activity among our major trading partners. Concerns about the strength of the global economy remain, and the emergence of SARS poses a threat to the economic prospects of several emerging-market economies in Asia. To date, however, we have no evidence that the new disease has affected U.S. economic activity. Nonetheless, continued slow growth abroad could have a damping effect on our recovery here.  To summarize, the recent news from oil and financial markets and about consumer confidence clearly suggests that the reduction in risks associated with the situation in Iraq has had a number of favorable effects. At the same time, the available indicators of production and employment suggest that the pace of economic activity may remain slow for a while longer, likely restrained by lingering uncertainty about the timing of economic recovery. Looking ahead, however, it seems likely that, at some point the combined effects of a fundamentally solid financial sector, sustained consumer spending power, and improving consumer confidence will demonstrate sufficient demand potential to stimulate increased levels of capital investment.  
 BIS Review 24/2003 1 Joseph O Sanusi: Management of Nigeria(cid:146)s domestic debt Keynote address by Dr Joseph O Sanusi, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, at the 7th Monetary Policy Forum organised by the Central Bank of Nigeria at the CBN Conference Hall, Abuja, 22 May 2003. *      *      * Distinguished Senators, Honourable Members of the House of Representatives, Distinguished Invited Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is my honour and privilege to welcome you to the 7th edition of the CBN Monetary Policy Forum. The theme of today(cid:146)s Forum (cid:147)Management of Nigeria(cid:146)s Domestic Debt(cid:148) has been chosen in view of the increasing concern over the rapid growth of Nigeria(cid:146)s public debt and its implications for economic stability.  An escalating debt profile presents serious obstacles to a nation(cid:146)s path to economic growth and development. The cost of servicing public debt (domestic and external) may expand beyond the capacity of the economy to cope, thereby impacting negatively on the ability to achieve the desired fiscal and monetary policy objectives. Furthermore, a rising debt burden may constrain the ability of government to undertake more productive investment programmes in infrastructure, education and public health. To avoid such a situation, it is imperative that the quantum and structure of the nation(cid:146)s debt be carefully managed in a manner that is consistent with the country(cid:146)s growth and development aspirations. To appreciate the dimension of Nigeria(cid:146)s domestic debt burden, it would be pertinent to undertake a brief review of its development. First, Nigeria(cid:146)s domestic debt stock stood at N23.5 million or 1.0 per cent of GDP in 1960 and subsequently, increased rapidly to N8,231.5 million or 16.2 per cent of GDP in 1980, reaching N1,160.0 billion or 83.6 per cent of GDP as at end-December, 2002. The sharp increase in domestic debt stock, over the years, was attributable largely to the failure to embark on necessary adjustment, particularly at the time of declining revenue, that resulted in growing fiscal deficits and further domestic debt accumulation. Secondly, the bulk of the debt has been in short-term treasury securities with maturities of less than one year. Thirdly, the banking system, mainly the CBN remains the dominant holder of Federal Government Securities. Ladies and Gentlemen, it bears repeating that one major problem that has hindered the attainment of macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth has been the excessive reliance by the Federal Government on borrowing from the banking system, particularly the CBN, to finance its large and unsustainable fiscal deficits. As you are all aware, such borrowing from the CBN amounts to the injection of high-powered money into the system, which has serious adverse implications on price and exchange rate stability. Similarly, it crowds out the private sector from the credit market, thereby stalling investment and output growth. Empirical evidence has shown that fiscal adjustment is critical to successful stabilization effort in countries facing domestic debt overhang. It should be noted, however, that deficit budgeting, per se, is not the critical issue of concern. Rather, it is the size, source of financing and quality of expenditure. Over the years, the FGN has relied largely on the money market and less on the capital market, thus creating a mismatch between short-term funds and investment in capital projects. This points to the need to reactivate the dormant bonds market to attract household and institutional savings. In addition, the borrowed money must be prudently utilized in the execution of productive projects in order to enhance the capacity for repayment of both the principal and interest elements as they fall due. An effective debt management requires that borrowed resources must be productively utilized such that the economic and social rate of return is higher than the future servicing cost of the loan. A debt problem would naturally ensue when the resources that should have been deployed for the execution of productive projects are employed in the financing of current or past consumption. This raises two issues for discussion. First, there is need to evaluate the economic and social rate of return of all government projects. Second, there is need to resolve the question of inter-generational equity which will arise when the present generation incurs debt that is left for the next generation to settle. 
 2 BIS Review 24/2003 Distinguished participants, until the creation of the Debt Management Office (DMO) in August 2000, the management of Nigeria(cid:146)s public debt statutorily rested with the Central Bank of Nigeria. Up until now, the law establishing the CBN entrusts it with the issue and management of Federal Government(cid:146)s debt instruments. The Bank is also empowered to grant temporary advances to the Federal Government (Ways and Means Advances) in respect of temporary deficiency in budget revenue, subject to a limit and full repayment by the end of that year. It is pertinent to note here that the discharge of these domestic debt management responsibilities by the CBN could be, and often had been, in conflict with monetary policy objectives. The establishment of the Debt Management Office should therefore be seen as a positive development that will enhance the efficiency of not only domestic debt management but also the effectiveness of monetary policy.  Indeed, in spite of the Bank(cid:146)s best endeavours in the prudent management of government(cid:146)s domestic debt, not much has been achieved by way of rationalizing public expenditure and trimming the size of domestic public debt stock. Some of the outstanding problems that call for urgent solutions include:  (cid:1)(cid:2)How to ensure that borrowed resources are productively utilised, such that economic and social rate of return is higher than the future servicing cost. (cid:1)(cid:2)The restructuring of the existing public debt in favour of long-term in a way to compel better quality evaluation of the loans. (cid:1)(cid:2)How the capital market can play an increasing role in the funding of the federal government fiscal operations. (cid:1)(cid:2)The problem of intergenerational equity argument arising from debt over-hang. (cid:1)(cid:2)How to reduce CBN funding of Government and bring it in line with the Government(cid:146)s obligation under the West African Monetary Zone Protocol. Acceptable progress has, however, been made in this regard during the last two years. Against this background, this Forum has been organised to proffer practical solutions on how to tackle the problem of the burgeoning domestic debt of the Federal Government. Participants are therefore challenged to come up with a credible framework that would prepare the road map, which will guide the Nigerian government in resolving this problem.   To this end, Ladies and Gentlemen, we have assembled today scholars, seasoned professionals and other key stakeholders in the economy to lead the discussions. I therefore urge all the participants at this forum to discuss freely and frankly in order to come up with useful ideas that will crystallize into an enduring solution to the country(cid:146)s debt problem.  Once more, I welcome you to this forum and wish you fruitful deliberations. 
 BIS Review 29/2003 1 Andrew Large: Convergence in insurance and banking - some financial stability issues Speech by Sir Andrew Large, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at a conference in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, London, 12 June 2003. *      *      * Introduction In getting together my remarks, I found myself wondering why you asked me, a central banker and former investment banker, to address this illustrious gathering of the insurance industry. What is it that makes central banks so interested in insurance? Central banks typically have two major preoccupations. Monetary stability and financial stability. Clearly those of us with an eye on the macro economic drivers which impact monetary stability cannot fail to have taken an interest in the volatility of equity markets. And that volatility has real implications for the life assurance world. Secondly, the way catastrophe and other cover can be extended in a world where terrorism is a fact of life has its own significance for the workings of the real economy. But it(cid:146)s from the point of view of financial stability that I(cid:146)d particularly like to develop some thoughts this morning. After all financial stability is about identifying and countering risks and threats which could ultimately impact confidence in the banking or wider financial system. And that gets to both the nature of interactions between insurance and banking on the one hand and to the environment in which we all operate - the areas of accounting, regulation, payment and settlement and law, the broad infrastructure if you will - on the other. In simpler days, it hadn(cid:146)t occurred to most people that the world of insurance could be relevant to the issue of overall financial stability. The worlds of insurance and banking were relatively distant from each other as were the worlds of securities and banking. Separate silos, if you will. But today insurance companies are an important factor in mitigating risks which earlier would have been contained within the banking world. I(cid:146)m talking about risks like debtor default. And now, there is increasing overlap and interaction with banks and capital markets. A personal anecdote might help to make that point; and also highlight my view that the breaking down of the silos is a pretty recent phenomenon. I well remember a time in the 1970s. As an investment banker, I used to handle capital market deals in the early days of the eurobond market. I began to observe that, even though I couldn(cid:146)t articulate what was going on with precision, there were areas of the insurance industry which seemed to be taking similar types of risk as banks, but charging a wholly different price. I remember talking to my friends in the insurance broking industry about it. One or two of them are here in the audience! First of all, was it true? Secondly, if it was, why? And thirdly, if indeed there was an arbitrage opportunity then how could we unlock its value? I remember feelings of frustration. Somehow we couldn(cid:146)t quite see how to reconcile some of the essential differences, including regulatory and accounting distinctions. To say nothing of the language or jargon used in the two sectors. Well, the rapid growth of the derivatives industry during the late 1980s changed all that! All sorts of new instruments for exploiting arbitrage opportunities like the one I described came into being. The different aspects of risk were unpicked and recombined. Those developments depended partly on new information technology. And, together with securitisation the functional divide was crossed. That evolution provided colossal commercial opportunities and enhanced general economic value. I recall this because it(cid:146)s a good example of how technical advances, some rocket science and market forces have changed the fortunes and capabilities of two great industries. And today, even though we don(cid:146)t have full integration we certainly have greatly increased interdependence and linkages. Just take the involvement of the insurance industry in credit risk transfer as an example. And just as with a lot of interdependencies you get network effects with undoubted economic benefits on the one hand, but potential vulnerabilities on the other. Maybe I can start by making a few observations on the vulnerabilities - increased risk to firms or the overall financial system - that were less significant until the interconnections appeared. The starting point here will be to try to understand the nature of these vulnerabilities better, and their potential impact on the financial system. 
 2 BIS Review 29/2003 Vulnerabilities: comparing banking and insurance My first observation relates to the different (cid:147)customs and practice(cid:148) of the two industries. In the banking world, obligations have historically tended to be for amounts which are clearly specified - either in money terms or according to some agreed formula - in advance. The event triggering delivery of the obligation is unambiguous. Often it(cid:146)s simply expiry of a set time period; and the timetable for payment once the obligation becomes due is fixed (and typically short). In the non-life part of the insurance world, on the other hand the amount to be paid is often a matter of interpretation of the contract. There might be greater scope for debate about whether the triggering event has actually occurred or whether any associated conditions have been met - even whether payment is due. And any payment due may not be made, at least in full until negotiations on these points have been completed. The fact that well-established channels may exist to resolve any disputes - including if necessary the courts - doesn(cid:146)t get around the fact that uncertainty regarding the timing and quantum of payment is injected into the process. Bankers find it hard to reconcile these realities of the insurance world with the way they manage risk and undertake their business. Clearly, this fundamental difference in approach can raise issues for those of us with an eye on financial stability. Specifically, these different characteristics can give rise to cash flow and liquidity implications which, for bankers and others in the financial markets, are potentially highly disruptive. It(cid:146)s fair to say that confidence in the banking world, which enables the system to function relies on obligations being met as they fall due. As the volume and complexity of inter-linked contracts in the system increases the need for certainty on this point also increases. Higher volumes and greater complexity also increase the interest of financial authorities who have responsibility for stability of the financial system. To be more specific, a potential problem can arise if, at any point in the chain expected payments do not materialise. Despite the progress which has been made there is still some caution on the part of banking regulators towards recognising the risk mitigation provided by insurance contracts. A recent example is the debate over recognition of insurance cover for operational risk under the new Basel II capital adequacy regime. That general point is illustrated by the post-Enron case involving JP Morgan Chase and various insurance companies. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the case the very fact that it became necessary illustrates the potential for uncertainty in relation to contracts at the boundary between banking and insurance. Furthermore the JP Morgan Chase case was ultimately settled out of court. So it might not have taken us much further forward in terms of clear guidance or greater legal certainty. I(cid:146)m sure you will be revisiting these issues tomorrow afternoon, in your session covering legal systems. So, I won(cid:146)t labour my point much further. But there is a vulnerability here which I think we would do well to try to understand better. We(cid:146)ve got to enhance confidence that contracts straddling the two sectors can be relied upon to produce expected outcomes in a timely way and even in adverse conditions. Risk transfer My second observation relates to risk transfer more specifically. Alan Greenspan made the observation that the successes of the banking system in diversifying risk have increased its ability to withstand significant shocks in recent years, including the Asia crisis, Russia, LTCM, 9/11 to say nothing of Enron, the IT boom and bust, and the telecom write offs. A lot of people agree with him. So the development of markets for the transfer of credit risk is of real value. It allows institutions that are best placed to originate a loan to do so, without necessarily requiring them to continue to bear the risk. Having a market to transfer risk allows institutions to diversify their exposures across different sectors and regions. And of course it generates price information that would not otherwise be available. That means credit exposures can be marked to market in a way that had not previously been possible. But it raises other questions. The transferors may have proper insight into the nature of the risks. But to whom have the risks been transferred? Are the transferees actually aware of the risks they have taken on? And are they in the best position to monitor these risks as they evolve? How do they acquire day to day knowledge about the quality of those risks? Going further, what might they do when they find out? 
 BIS Review 29/2003 3 Some of the concerns being expressed by private and public sector commentators in these areas are, in my view, important and worthy of further examination. Those concerns I(cid:146)m talking about include: a lack of aggregate data on derivative positions; lack of transparency in accounting for them; and the potential for unexpected concentrations of risk to build up. Although in principle this redistribution of risk should be benign we simply do not have the information at present to judge what the actual impact has been. But why is all this relevant to insurance? It(cid:146)s certainly true that in a lot of cases originating banks have laid risks off to other banks. There are many possible reasons for this: for diversification or to avoid concentration; opportunities to earn fees; regulatory arbitrage; and different views on pricing and spreads. But it is also well known too that risks have been transferred from banks to various areas of the insurance world. That includes reinsurance, where the degree to which such risk has now been concentrated is difficult to assess. Moreover, these transfers have taken place, not only through OTC contracts, but also through securitised debt instruments, of various credit quality. In my view, this opacity is not conducive to long-term confidence in the strength of the industry. And, it certainly doesn(cid:146)t contribute to overall systemic robustness. So this is the second area where gaining better understanding of the potential vulnerabilities before we face adverse outcomes could be of real value. Supervision and regulation Obviously, it(cid:146)s pretty easy to make lists of risks and potential vulnerabilities. Central bankers are meant to be especially good at it! But I(cid:146)ve already referred to the significant benefits of risk transfer. They include wider distribution of risk, and potentially at lower cost to buyers of protection from those risks. That(cid:146)s got to be of real value. The question is: can these gains be achieved efficiently whilst at the same time mitigating the risks? My suggestion here relates to the environment in which the industries operate: the general infrastructure I talked about earlier. If we want to get the full benefits of risk transfer, but with the vulnerabilities contained at acceptable levels then it(cid:146)s worth reflecting on the value of co-ordinating some major elements of that environment: supervision, regulation and accounting, as they relate to the worlds of banking and insurance. I can(cid:146)t help feeling that a genuine effort and real engagement in this area will help develop a better understanding of where risk really resides. In turn, that would mean greater predictability, enhanced confidence and better business opportunities. I(cid:146)d like to give you a few examples. For a long time, the functional areas of banking and insurance were silos. So were the regulations and indeed the regulators! After all, they mirrored the different business realities I have just described. Here in the UK, the creation of the FSA to oversee both of the areas - and other parts of the financial system as well - is a huge step forward. It helps in developing a regulatory framework which meets business realities on the one hand and public policy requirements on the other. Whatever the complexities it may generate, I believe we are already seeing great benefit. And similar developments are taking place in other countries as well. Now although the integrated structure of regulatory authorities is making significant progress in some countries, the nature of the regulations themselves are converging only slowly. There is as yet no real equivalent to the Basel Accord in the insurance area: no common prudential template for insurance supervisors exists yet internationally. That said, I fully recognise and applaud the work of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors in setting out best practice and promoting co-operation between supervisors. That(cid:146)s a very helpful base for further work in future. We have to wish them well. But, the current position is that approaches to insurance regulation can vary widely from country to country. On top of that, there is sometimes fragmentation of markets and regulatory responsibilities, notably in the US. Unfortunately that complicates progress towards international agreement. Maybe even more so than what the brave souls in banking supervision who negotiated Basel II experienced! Of course, progress is being made. In the UK, work is concentrating on the development of a risk-based solvency regime as a counterpart to capital adequacy in the banking arena. This is part of the FSA(cid:146)s Tiner project to overhaul the regulatory environment for insurers. At the EU level the first stage of a review of solvency requirements for insurers has now been completed. Designers of the next stage are now looking to the approach taken for banks under the Basel Accord, focusing on the three pillars to develop further EU solvency standards. 
 4 BIS Review 29/2003 It(cid:146)s worth looking a bit at the three pillar approach itself. For those of you unfamiliar with the banking jargon this approach involves combining requirements for minimum capital (the first pillar) with a supervisory review of each institution(cid:146)s profile and internal processes (the second pillar). The third pillar involves market discipline where effective disclosure should allow a better understanding of the risks being taken on by different institutions. That allows the market itself rather than armies of regulators to do some of the work. The same set of principles should be equally relevant for insurance. But, we(cid:146)ve got to recognise that the scale of change required is truly formidable! That(cid:146)s especially true since disclosure leads us inexorably to accounting. After all meaningful disclosure requires a common approach to recording the value of insurance contracts. Otherwise you couldn(cid:146)t achieve standardised capital requirements; and greater transparency is of limited value unless comparisons can be made. So the work being undertaken by the International Accounting Standards Board on a disclosure standard for insurance will be absolutely crucial in this respect. Conclusion My observations about the value of convergence in what I have called the (cid:145)infrastructure environment(cid:146), come down to these areas of focus: First, convergence will enable better understanding of the reality, or absence, of systemic risk. In particular I(cid:146)m talking about the potential for transmission of shocks between the insurance industry and the banking system. Second, it will discourage arbitrage that is based on technical accounting and regulatory factors. Instead, convergence will enable the market to focus on arbitrage which reflects the substantive evaluation of risks where real economic value may reside. And third, the added transparency of interfaces between the two industries will enhance confidence in the risk transfer arena. That will help dissipate the sort of unease which I sense around the place at the moment. The data deficiencies we confront today where the actual location of risk is so opaque is to my mind a major challenge. Better transparency will surely help to avoid adverse consequences of shocks which are inevitable from time to time. The infrastructure environment has to be robust enough to withstand these shocks. Of course there are challenges. For example: in avoiding over-engineering and over-prescription in regulation and accounting standards, and sticking more to a principles-based approach. Those principles have got to be based on best practice in the markets on the one hand, and the public policy needs on the other. Here, I(cid:146)m including adequate systemic security. My thesis would be that the very effort necessary to define those principles and the necessary engagement between leaders of the industry on the one hand and public authorities on the other will reward us with a system where all parties can operate and contribute with confidence. 
 BIS Review 29/2003 1 Willem F Duisenberg: The first lustrum of the ECB Speech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the International Frankfurt Banking Evening, Frankfurt, 16 June 2003. *      *      * Introduction It gives me great pleasure to address such a distinguished audience today; even more so as it is not the first time I am speaking at the International Frankfurt Banking Evening. On 1 June of this year, the ECB celebrated its fifth anniversary. Hence, In my speech today, I will focus on two topics. First, I will discuss some lessons from our experience of monetary policy in the euro area during the first five years of the ECB. Second, I will look ahead and elaborate on ongoing developments in the context to the Convention on the Future of Europe, which aims to lay the foundations for a Constitutional Treaty for the European Union. ECB monetary policy-making in perspective Starting with our experience of monetary policy, and, of course, speaking as an impartial observer, I can say that I am very satisfied with how the Governing Council of the ECB has functioned over the last five years in fairly difficult circumstances. Indeed, a lot has happened and it must be said that the first lustrum of the ECB was a fair (cid:147)baptism of fire(cid:148). I am not going to bore you with a recap of the monetary policy decisions we have taken, or the reasons behind each of them, but will instead concentrate on seven or so features which, to my mind, can be considered as the main issues when reviewing our monetary policy experience. Let me begin by making a few remarks on our focus on price stability. This focus is enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and is our mandate. It is so with very good reason. Long gone are the days when monetary policy was thought to face a long-term trade-off between inflation and economic growth. It is now globally acknowledged that maintaining a low and stable rate of inflation is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to economic welfare. The ECB has pursued its mandate of maintaining price stability with vigour and determination. The public has understood this. Inflation expectations, as measured by survey data or by financial market indicators, have always remained consistent with our definition of price stability. This is all the more remarkable as the ECB had no track record at the beginning while it was faced with the euro area economy being hit by repeated upward price shocks. As a result of all these shocks, HICP inflation has been above - and sometimes significantly above - 2% for quite some time. But inflation always bounced back following these shocks and today the outlook for price stability is once again favourable. A second related point I would like to mention is the medium-term orientation of our policy. As a central bank, we only affect prices with long lags and we cannot steer trends in prices with high precision. Our focus on the medium term helps to avoid overly ambitious attempts to fine-tune inflation developments. You might ask what (cid:147)medium term(cid:148) means exactly. It is certainly not a fixed time horizon, as some have argued. Experience in recent years has taught us that flexibility in this respect is very important. From this point of view, the ECB(cid:146)s monetary policy strategy is different from pure forms of inflation targeting. This leads me to my third issue, which is that one cannot simply rely on a single inflation forecast to conduct monetary policy successfully. Experience suggests that it can be very misleading to summarise the assessment of medium-term inflationary pressures in one single figure, even when a measure of statistical error is attached to it. Unfortunately, monetary policy is not so simple and the repeated significant forecast errors by all major institutions over the last few years provide evidence of this. Indeed, I agree with Alan Greenspan who once said that central bankers should be less reluctant to admit that they sometimes do not know. Instead of relying on a single forecast, our monetary policy strategy emphasises this fundamental uncertainty. Our strategy builds on several forecasts and indicators and includes a cross-check of the information from the economic analysis, which is relevant from the short to medium-term perspective 
 2 BIS Review 29/2003 for inflation, with that from the monetary analysis, which is important for the medium to long-term outlook. In this respect, the fourth point that I would like to discuss today is that over the last few years we have seen that monetary analysis is not only an important, but also a complex business. I have no doubt that inflation is a monetary phenomenon over the long term and that we are right in attributing a prominent role to monitoring monetary developments in our monetary policy strategy. A fifth point I would like to make is that it was difficult to gauge the effects of global interdependencies when we began to conduct the single monetary policy. What we have learnt, in particular, is that global linkages go well beyond the international trade channel, which was traditionally considered to be the main, if not the only channel through which economic shocks were transmitted. Moreover, more shocks - such as those associated with the introduction of new technologies and those of a political nature - have increasingly become global in nature. Related to this - and this is my sixth point - we have learnt that sharp asset price fluctuations may be very important for shaping economic trends. In recent years we have witnessed extraordinary developments in capital markets. Initially, exceptional optimism about potential output growth and talks of a (cid:147)new economy(cid:148) drove stock prices to sky-high levels. The (cid:147)new economy(cid:148) euphoria was sowing the seeds of less positive developments even before it actually burst. It seems to have been accompanied by a rising short-termism of corporate managers, which in turn was accompanied by corporate malpractice and also pushed firms to over-invest, especially in the IT and telecommunications sector. The subsequent large fall in equity prices and the revelation of corporate malpractice had a series of negative consequences, including an increase in leverage ratios of non-financial corporations, a decline in the value of collateral, increases in risk premia, and certain firms experiencing difficulties in obtaining external finance. All of this may still be part of the reason for the weak consumption and investment activity, and thus the slow pace of economic growth in the euro area that we are now observing. To cut a long story short: monetary policy obviously has to take into account the public and financial market sentiment in assessing the risks to price stability over the medium term. Central banks must monitor financial market developments very closely in order to figure out what the consequences are for the outlook for price stability over the medium term, but they must not target asset prices. Finally, and this is my last point on monetary policy, I would like to stress that effective communication is an all-important requirement for successful monetary policy. However, as we have learnt over the last five years, it is no easy business. I am sure you will appreciate that communication is particularly difficult in the context of the euro area, with so many different traditions and languages. Over time, we have seen a significant improvement in public understanding of our communication of our monetary policy strategy and our monetary policy decisions. Evidence of this is that our monetary policy decisions have been very predictable, as reflected in money market indicators, which I rate as a highly positive development. Indeed, we want to be, and we have to be, well understood in order to be effective in our policy. And, as you were able to see from our recent clarification of the ECB(cid:146)s strategy, we continue to strive for even more effective communication. The future of the ECB Let me now turn to the Convention on the Future of Europe and the future institutional status of the ECB. Celebrating the fifth anniversary is, of course, a good opportunity for us to look ahead. Where will the ECB be in five years time? What kind of challenges will it face? What kind of environment will it be confronted with? Today we are very much aware that the constitutional construction of the European Union is in a process of evolution. The Convention has more or less wrapped up its deliberations and its President, ValØry Giscard d(cid:146)Estaing, will present the draft of a new (cid:147)Treaty establishing the Constitution(cid:148) to the leaders of the Member States in a few days time. As the central bank of the European Union, the ECB has followed the work of the Convention with great interest over the past one and a half years. The ECB welcomes all efforts to further the construction of a united Europe. A European Union with effective, functioning and transparent structures and processes, capable of meeting the expectations of its citizens, and equipped to assume international responsibility commensurate with its size and importance, would complement and further 
 BIS Review 29/2003 3 bolster the success of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Throughout the five years of its existence, the ECB has stated that a strong euro is good for a strong Europe. I would now like to add that a strong Europe is good for a strong euro. If the European Union is re-writing its rulebook by giving itself a Constitution, does this mean profound changes to the provisions relating to the ECB and to monetary union in general? Throughout the process of drafting the Constitution, the ECB has consistently advocated that the economic constitution of the EU - the basic set of rules and provisions for EMU as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty - is sound both in terms of the objectives set and the allocation of responsibilities between different actors and levels of government. The Convention appears to have followed a similar reasoning, as it appears that the future Constitution will take over the provisions relating to EMU in an essentially unchanged form. The single monetary policy is, by its very nature, indivisible and is thus centralised; hence it remains an exclusive competence of the Union. The task of conducting monetary policy, as well as all other central banking tasks, has been assigned to an independent central bank with a clear primary objective of maintaining price stability. In addition to the ECB, the ESCB is also mentioned in the first part of the Constitution, thus acknowledging the federal nature of the monetary authority of the European Union and its sui generis character. Finally, the more specific provisions concerning monetary policy in the current Treaty as well as the Statute of the ECB and the ESCB will remain unchanged and form part of the constitutional texts of the Union. By contrast, budgetary and other economic policies will remain under national competence in the future Constitution, in recognition of the fact that the vast majority of (cid:147)public goods(cid:148), such as defence, for which revenues are raised and subsequently dispensed, are still provided at the national level. That said, the draft Constitution also prescribes a close co-ordination of economic policies within the Union. I very much welcome the fact that the fundamental features of the current set-up of EMU have been preserved. After all, the stability of the institutional architecture is a crucial element of the credibility of the single monetary policy and the public(cid:146)s confidence in our currency. Concluding remarks Clearly it is now up to the governments of the Member States to move forward in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and give the final form to the text prepared by the Convention. If I, as a central banker, am allowed to present my assessment, I would argue that the Convention has done a very good job of incorporating the substance of the EMU chapter into the new Constitution, while also introducing clarifications, additions and updates in the current texts where necessary and appropriate. What I do miss is that the Convention has not taken over our suggestion to incorporate somewhere in the text the notion of Eurosystem, which stands for the core concept of our central banking system, i.e. the ECB and the national central banks of the member states that have adopted the euro. The Eurosystem is not mentioned in the Treaty as it stands, nor in the draft-Constitution. Conclusion: we still have some work to do....!!! Thank you for your attention. 
 BIS Review 29/2003 1 Toshihiko Fukui: Europe’s single currency and Japan’s contributions to Asian development Speech by Mr Toshihiko Fukui, Governor of the Bank of Japan, on the occasion of dinner in the French Embassy, Tokyo, 11 June 2003. *      *      * I. Fighting deflation I am very happy to be invited to speak at this Euro 50 banquet. My relationship with Europe dates back to thirty years ago. At that time, I was working for the Bank of Japan(cid:146)s Paris office. I vividly remember those days, especially when I took a walk in the streets of Paris, painted with so much history, culture and esprit, and when I took a rest reading books in the relaxing atmosphere Æ la Place des Vosges. Actually, I asked Ambassador Montferrant to look at a photograph I had taken there when he visited me recently in my office. I was appointed Governor of the Bank of Japan three months ago. On the same day with my assuming office, the war in Iraq started. As I will explain in more detail later, I am thinking that the globalization could be really fruitful, only if, on its process, we are able to overcome conflicts between different values and jointly to create new values. The outbreak of the war, however, seemed to expose the flip side of this process. Moreover, it increased uncertainty in the world economy, and therefore I had to prepare myself for a rocky start in taking up my new duties. Good news as you see, the Iraqi War came to an end quickly and the accompanying uncertainty is now waning, but the situation remains to be difficult. The governments and central banks all over the world are far from being reassured that the economy will return rapidly to sustained economic growth. We at the Bank of Japan are waging a tough war against deflation. Indeed, it is at the top of our policy agenda. I have spent a total of about 40 years working in the central bank and for virtually all of that period the emphasis has been placed on how to prevent inflation. However, both globalization and the advances in IT have intensified the global trend towards disinflation and created a new awareness among central banks that they must deal symmetrically with both inflation and deflation. We at the Bank of Japan stand on the front line of the war against deflation. However, we have used up the greatest weapon in a central bank(cid:146)s arsenal, that is interest rates, which have all declined to virtually zero in our short-term markets. Thus, in the spring of 2001 we stepped into new territory, where no central bank has ever ventured, namely (cid:147)quantitative easing(cid:148). Here, there are two important points. The first is to set quantitative targets in the form of outstanding balance of current account deposit with the Bank and then to aggressively supply abundant liquidity into financial markets. The second is to make a commitment to maintain such an accommodative policy stance until the Consumer Price Index registers a year on year increase of zero percent or above on a sustainable basis. The fundamental aim of this point is to lower long-term interest rates across the board by borrowing future monetary easing through the commitment. Furthermore, we are now exploring ways to improve the transmission mechanism of monetary policy so that the beneficial effects of quantitative easing can more smoothly penetrate every corner of the economy. Obviously, the war against deflation will not be won with monetary policy alone. All economic agents must review the legacies of past high growth period and make every effort to enlarge the capacity to create value added. It has become clear to us that we will only find a way out of deflation when the efforts of the private sector, the government, and the Bank of Japan generate synergies in this endeavor. II. Interest in Europe I fear my introductory remarks might have been getting too long, so I will move on. In October 1970, shortly after I arrived in Paris, the Werner Report came out, officially advocating economic and monetary union in Europe. Frankly speaking, as an outsider, I considered the grand idea of the economic and monetary union, however grand it would be, to be no more than an (cid:147)adventurous experiment(cid:148). No one could tell where it would go. Therefore, I was profoundly moved to witness the introduction of the Euro in January 1999 
 2 BIS Review 29/2003 and the conversion of all cash to Euro last year. The EMU was not just another (cid:147)experiment(cid:148). The people of Europe gathered their wisdom and courageously marched forward to turn a dream into reality. In this regard, we must remember in particular the efforts that were made to overcome the (cid:147)Euro pessimism(cid:148) of the late seventies and early eighties. To me, the single currency symbolizes many things. The first is the great potentiality that Europe has in terms of (cid:147)creating history(cid:148). I have nothing but respect for the strong leadership and the persistent efforts that were exerted to complete this job, a job requiring 50 or 100 years to accomplish. Second is the strong desire for peace that has been underlying the spirit of solidarity ever since the European Coal and Steel Community. Having suffered through repeated, terrible wars, the people of Europe have a strong resolution never to go to war again. Third is the emphasis on (cid:147)social discipline(cid:148) that underpins the solidarity of Europe. I think this is particularly well embodied in the Stability and Growth Pact and the efforts to ensure independence of the ECB. I am also much interested in the future of the enlarged EU. Recently, the (cid:147)Convention on the Future of Europe(cid:148) chaired by former French President Valery Giscard d(cid:146)Estaing, advocated the drafting of a (cid:147)European Constitution,(cid:148) the creation of a (cid:147)European presidency,(cid:148) and a reduction in the number of seats on the European Commission. Although this recommendation adds weight towards political union, I also find it extremely significant in light of the awareness that our age must (cid:147)overcome conflicts of values(cid:148). And on the economic front, I look forward to seeing how the people of Europe will lead the EU(cid:146)s integrated market into an ever larger entity in a form that is always open to the outside and in harmony with globalization. III. Japanese contributions to the further development of Asia Compared to Europe(cid:146)s long history in working towards regional integration, cooperation and coordination in Asia are still at their early stage, and a clear vision for the future has yet to emerge. In this we are different from the Americas, too, which have set a course towards the achievement of the Free Trade Area of the Americas. Asia is characterized by its diversity. We have a large number of ethnic groups, languages, religions, and cultures, and there are considerable differences in our stage of economic development. Asia has a long way to go before it could ever be considered as an (cid:147)optimum currency area(cid:148). But diversity is also Asia(cid:146)s strength. Economies with their own comparative advantages can and do create layers of linkages through trade and direct investment, which produce a dynamism of growth. And this has enabled Asia to emerge as one of the world(cid:146)s growth centers. China has achieved remarkable economic growth over the past several years, and it has given new momentum to dynamic international divisions of labor and global economic growth. China has such an enormous production capacity that other countries sometimes perceive it as a (cid:147)threat,(cid:148) but, at the same time, it should be noted that the Chinese big domestic markets are increasingly providing demand and business opportunities to the neighboring countries. From this point of view, the sustainability of Chinese economic growth has become an indispensable factor for autonomous expansion of the Asian economy as a whole, particularly the East Asian economy. At present, with the exception of worries about SARS, conditions in Asia look relatively good. Economies in the East Asian region have been growing at an increasingly rapid pace. For example, the ratio of intra-regional trade to nominal GDP for the nine East Asian economies has more than doubled from 8% in the late eighties to 17% today. This ratio is roughly the same as that of the EU. At the beginning of my remarks I said that globalization was a process through which we overcome conflicting values and jointly create new values. The dynamism of Asia seems to embody this. That is, Asia is a place where different values come into contact with each other and create new knowledge in the process. Against this background, Japan is making progress steadily in its structural reforms, aiming at reaching the final goal that it will become a home of high value added, a hub for gathering, creating and transmitting information that will contribute to further development of Asia as a whole. Here, let me discuss again the central bank job. In 1991, Asian central banks established EMEAP (Executives(cid:146) Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks), which serves as a forum for the regular exchange of information and views among them. Over the weekend, I attended my first EMEAP 
 BIS Review 29/2003 3 governors(cid:146) meeting, and what I took away from that meeting was the increasing complexity of the challenges that face central banks in East Asia, challenges that cannot be solved with domestic remedies alone. Along with this, I also perceived a growing momentum for central banks to pool their wisdom and act together to solve these challenges. These efforts are beginning to bear fruit. At the beginning of this month, EMEAP announced the project of the Asian Bond Fund which will invest part of the foreign reserves held by East Asian central banks in Asian bonds, thereby serving as a catalyst to greater activity on fixed income markets in the region. The Bank of Japan supports this initiative and will actively participate in the fund. Both dialogue and cooperation among East Asian central banks have only just begun. It is too early to tell whether this dialogue and cooperation will eventually lead to regional integration. Even if it does, the orientation of that integration is unlikely to be the same as Europe(cid:146)s in view of the historical and economic differences between the two regions. However, if we take an optimistic look at the future, our steady efforts may result in the formation of an open, flexible and surprisingly well-organized regional economic zone within the context of (cid:147)future globalization of complexity(cid:148). 
 BIS Review 29/2003 1 The Rt Hon Sir Edward George: A broadbrush review of the UK economy Speech by The Rt Hon Sir Edward George, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Lord Mayor(cid:146)s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, Mansion House, London, 18 June 2003. *      *      * My Lord Mayor, Mr Chancellor, My Lords, Aldermen, Mr Recorder, Sheriffs, Ladies and Gentlemen - dear friends and colleagues. How many of you here this evening have ever run the London Marathon - perhaps we could have a show of hands? Well of course I have (cid:133)(cid:133). never, ever contemplated doing so for a moment. But someone who did complete it once described to me the surge of adrenaline he experienced with just a mile to go, followed shortly afterwards by near-exhaustion, until he finally collapsed over the finishing line! I think I(cid:146)m now beginning to understand what he meant. If I have my arithmetic right - and that(cid:146)s a big (cid:147)if(cid:148) - I was recently beaten all ends up at maths games by group of primary school children from Tower Hamlets - but if I(cid:146)m right, after 41 years in the Bank, this is my 27th successive attendance at this great annual Bankers and Merchants dinner and, you(cid:146)ll be relieved to hear, the 10th and last time that I will have the honour of addressing you in my capacity as Governor. And I should like to take this opportunity above all to thank all of you - and the various organisations that you represent - for the tremendous support that you have given to me and to the Bank over so many years. I must begin, Gordon, by thanking you. In fact I(cid:146)ve been immensely fortunate to have first Ken Clarke and then you, Gordon, in charge at the Treasury during my time as Governor. You shared the conviction that overall macro-economic stability - reflected in consistently low inflation - is a necessary condition for sustainable growth. That(cid:146)s a conviction that is deeply embedded in my soul as a lifelong central banker - if indeed as a central banker I(cid:146)m allowed to admit to having a soul! You inherited from Ken an inflation target in the form of a cap and a degree of transparency - and public accountability - that we(cid:146)d never had before. And, in your own, very first - and inspired - decision as Chancellor, you advanced that approach radically further. You - rightly - kept the political responsibility for setting the inflation target - opting crucially for a symmetrical point target. But you devolved the technical responsibility for meeting that target to your new creation - the MPC - to which you appointed independent, external, experts in fields which are relevant to monetary policy to work with our team at the Bank. And you reinforced the procedures for transparency and accountability. In terms of the overall macro-economy this framework has served us well. Annual inflation - on the present RPIX target measure - perhaps fortuitously - I don(cid:146)t really mind - averaged exactly 2.5% over the past 10 years. But more than just consistently low inflation, we have also enjoyed continuous quarter by quarter GDP growth, over the 10 years to the first quarter, at an average four-quarterly rate of 2.9% - which is well above its earlier trend. And the rate of employment has recently been around its all-time high, with the number of people claiming unemployment benefit at around a 25 year low - and that(cid:146)s true for the UK as a whole and in almost every region. Of course it hasn(cid:146)t all been plain sailing. We(cid:146)ve had to cope with a painful imbalance within the economy over the past few years as a result of successive storms emanating from overseas. And it has been truly painful for the externally-exposed sectors of our economy. To stay on course while those storms persisted we(cid:146)ve had to compensate for the external weakness by accepting - indeed positively encouraging through monetary policy - domestic consumer demand growth at a rate that we knew could not be sustained indefinitely. We have been helped more recently - and it(cid:146)s not often you(cid:146)ll hear a central banker say this - by a timely increase in public spending, consistent with your own rules designed to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability. Without that we(cid:146)d have been even more dependent upon the consumer. A year ago there were grounds for hoping that the external storms were beginning to abate, but those hopes were deferred - by the after-effects of corporate governance and accounting failures in the US and by uncertainty associated with the war in Iraq. There nevertheless remain reasonable grounds for 
 2 BIS Review 29/2003 thinking that the external environment will now gradually improve as we move through the second half of this year into next, and that this will help to offset the gradual moderation we are beginning to see in the growth of consumer spending. That would open the way to continued relatively steady and better balanced growth - at or above trend, with inflation remaining close to target. But there are certainly short-term risks on either side, and given those risks - including the risk of slow growth in the Eurozone, particularly in Germany - I agree with your assessment that the economic case for euro-entry has not yet been made. More generally on that subject, I very much welcome the Treasury(cid:146)s exhausting - I mean exhaustive - broader assessment of the longer-term pros and cons which I hope, when people have had time to digest it properly, will result in a better balanced - less polarised - debate on the economics of the euro question. I confess that I had hoped that we would by now be further along the narrow channel I have described on past occasions between the Charybdis of external weakness and Scylla of unsustainable consumer demand. And I(cid:146)m sorry in this respect to be jumping ship at this particular point. But I(cid:146)m convinced that calmer waters lie not too far ahead. And I(cid:146)ve every confidence that Mervyn King - who has in effect been our Chief Navigating Officer for much of the past decade, and who will take over as skipper at the end of the month, with an outstanding MPC and Bank crew to support him - will find the way through. I certainly wish them safe passage! My Lord Mayor, if the harsh international climate made life difficult for us on the macro-economic front, the associated, sustained, fall, in global equity markets in particular, made it an unusually tough time for many financial institutions here in the City. Happily, here too, there are more recent signs of improvement. Perhaps the truly remarkable thing about that is that the financial system as a whole withstood the pressures as well as it did. But over a longer time horizon the City(cid:146)s financial institutions have responded remarkably well to sustained market pressure for change, and we have been outstandingly successful in fulfilling the City(cid:146)s vital economic, and social, function of promoting growth and employment both in this country and across the globe. One can think of lots of reasons for that success - I pick out two in particular. First, we have managed over time to maintain a reasonable balance between creative market dynamics on the one hand and official intervention and regulation on the other. It is well understood that markets must be (cid:147)fair(cid:148) as well as (cid:147)free(cid:148) to do their job effectively - and that we have to have rules that reflect public policy concerns. But it is equally understood that, carried too far, prescriptive intervention can stifle competition and the market appetite for risk. In getting the balance right, market participants can do a lot for themselves. My impression certainly is that there is a growing recognition that high standards of professional competence and integrity are vital to a firm(cid:146)s reputation and commercial success, or even its survival - and that helps to limit recourse to intervention. But it(cid:146)s also true that we have a critically important, longstanding, tradition in this country that, where there is a perceived need for intervention, the relevant authorities consult extensively with the markets which helps to avoid unintended consequences and to ensure a measured and properly targeted approach. It(cid:146)s a tradition which others would do well to adopt. My second explanation for the City(cid:146)s success in financial services is non-discrimination. Provided they meet the standards of professional competence and integrity we expect in London, it makes no sense at all - in fact it would be self-inflicted injury - to distinguish between the firms or individuals who work here, on grounds of nationality or ethnic or religious background - or, in the case of individuals, on grounds of gender, which is a point, my Lord Mayor, which I know that you have made forcefully from the beginning of your term in office. I think we(cid:146)ve made real progress on this front. Non-nationals for example, play an important part not just in our commercial life but in the governance of our market institutions. And I very much welcomed the initiative by the Foreign Bankers(cid:146) Association to establish the Guild of International Bankers, which itself followed the opening up, to non-nationals, of the City Freedom. It is economic activity - not nationality - that generates employment and income - and even, Chancellor, tax revenue - and that(cid:146)s something, too, which is now better understood than in many other jurisdictions. It is crucial that these approaches continue - as I have no doubt they will - into the future - whatever that might hold. I have also been impressed, my Lord Mayor, by the increasing commitment among City firms - including many firms from overseas - not just to professional, but also to social responsibility. And in this context I have been greatly encouraged by the widespread and very positive response to the 
 BIS Review 29/2003 3 Heart of the City campaign launched nearly three years ago to encourage and extend City corporate community involvement. I hope that that, too, will continue. So I take the opportunity this evening to express my thanks to all of you represented here who have worked with us at the Bank over the years in so many different ways, through good times and bad, to secure the City(cid:146)s position as the pre-eminent global financial market place. And that, of course, my Lord Mayor includes the holders of your high office over so many years - and it includes the City Corporation. We at the Bank have enjoyed tremendous moral and practical - not to mention gastronomical - support in all our efforts to promote the reputation and prosperity of the City, and I hope that you may feel that we have been equally supportive of initiatives that you have taken to the same end. From my perspective it(cid:146)s been a very warm and constructive relationship which I have no doubt will continue. You, Gavyn, have certainly contributed to that relationship during your period in office and I am grateful to you for that. But more than that you have maintained the finest traditions of the Mayoralty in the lead that you have given to the City. You have taken on an exhausting - and in this case I really mean exhausting - program - both at home and around the world in promotion of our interests and you have still found time, with the Lady Mayoress, to entertain us right royally this evening. We are all most grateful to you. So to you all - as I make the transition from Who(cid:146)s Who? To Who(cid:146)s He? - I say thank you and farewell until we meet again - as I very much hope we will if ever Vanessa and I manage to tear ourselves away from Cornwall. I invite you all to rise and to join me in a toast of good health and prosperity to (cid:147)The Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress(cid:148). 
 BIS Review 28/2003 1 Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala: Asian Bond Fund Speech by Mr Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at Euro 50 Group Roundtable, Tokyo, 12 June 2003. *      *      * Mr. Chairman, On the issue of Asian Monetary Cooperation, Thailand is certainly of less importance than Japan; therefore I have to apologize for speaking before Director-General Watanabe. Since it is late in the day and time is short, I will try to make it interesting by going directly to the Question and Answer session. However, I will be the only one asking the questions, and giving the answers. But I will restrict myself to only five. The first question: There are a lot of initiatives on financial matters going on in Asia. Does it mean that we are aiming for a monetary union of sort in Asia soon, or something leading up to a single Asian currency? I cannot speak for other Asian countries, and I do not know whether something is being planned for the more advanced countries, like Japan and Korea, or not. However, looking through the eyes of someone in Thailand, which is part of ASEAN, the final goal of monetary union, should it exist, is still around many corners. In my opinion, the level of economic integration in Asia is still much looser than Europe at their early stage of integration. You may point to the rapidly expanding inter-regional trade in Asia. But if one looks closely, one will find that a good portion of this are raw materials, parts, and components produced in one country and sold to another for further processing or assembly for sale to a third country within or outside Asia. The production of goods for final consumption in Asia is still low, with the exception of Japanese and Korean brands. And while China’s imports from ASEAN have increased substantially in the past few years, their consumption is still mainly in food products, raw materials and low value added products. For luxury goods, their being brand-conscious, ASEAN products have not been able to compete well. This will change over time when Asian products gain more differentiation and sophistication. For example, at the moment, Thai palm oil is no different from Malaysian. There can be no mutual trade. But when it becomes part of the national cuisines, trade and exchange could occur. The more value is added, the more Asia will trade with each other for eventual consumption. But for the moment, the emphasis is more on cooperation than integration. So the second question: If this is so, why are there various monetary initiatives going on in Asia? The way I see it is that even though the level of economic integration is presently still not fully advanced, the financial linkage and contagion affect is very high. Part of this may have to do with the fact that Asian countries lend a good deal of money to each other. Should disturbances occur in a creditor country, their banks may tend to rein in their reaches to preserve liquidity thus worsen the affect on the borrower country. Another reason may be that lenders outside Asia tend to look at Asia as a block, not differentiating one country from another much. Therefore, in order to lessen the risk of crisis and contagion, we have to find ways for the Asian countries to prevent crisis or deal better with imbalances. This means dealing better with capital flows, or rather the sudden reversal of capital flows. Now comes the third question: Which initiative can be most effective in dealing with capital flows? The Asian governments have cooperated in certain schemes. The Chiang Mai Initiative whereby Asian countries sign swap agreements with each other to provide temporary financing to each other in emergencies. Even though the combined amounts exceed $31.5 billion, it is still small compared to the volume of foreign exchange trade in the world. We also have a system of mutual surveillance, but Asian culture sometimes does not go for direct confrontation to such particular issues. The best safeguard, in my opinion, is therefore to have stronger structures in Asian countries to deal with financial shocks. This is why I attach much hope in the Asian Bond Markets Initiative being proposed. 
 2 BIS Review 28/2003 This leads me to the fourth question: What is the Asian Bond Markets Initiative? What does it involve? The Asian Bond Markets Initiative can be viewed at 2 levels. The first is the international level. The Asian names have been issuing bonds in the international market for quite some time, in major currencies – mostly US dollar. This market is already well developed. Some people may say that nothing needs be done further by Asian governments at this level. The market will do it. However, efforts are being made by Ministry of Finance officials to introduce new products – perhaps by securitization, by combining Asian names or a few Asian currencies, hoping to come up with an attractive product. They hope to bring new benefits to bond investors, but it will be up to the market to determine whether the ideas bear fruit. The second level is, however, more important. This is the local level – the local bond markets in each Asian country – in their local currencies. The importance of these markets can only be seen clearly in the events of the 1997 Asian Crisis. The first problem was that of capital outflow. Even though foreign borrowings of many industrial companies in Thailand were long term. But a lot of the loan contracts had default clauses imbedded within. This allows the foreign creditors to recall the loans early when certain events occur. One example is the clause requiring borrowers to maintain debt to equity ratios above certain thresholds. If the borrower makes a loss, it will eat into the debt to equity ratio. When that happens, the borrower has to increase capital, or face a default. However, when the country faces a nationwide economic crisis, a lot of companies would tend to suffer losses at the same time. And they cannot all together tap additional equity in such an environment. This pushed them into defaults. A lot of what seemed, before the crisis, to be long-term foreign borrowings, therefore, suddenly became callable almost overnight. The second problem is that of currency mismatch. Unlike the major countries, the emerging markets in Asia cannot borrow from the international market in our own currencies. In the case of Thailand, when our currency was floated in 1997, it depreciated more than 65 per cent before backing up to the 40’s. Many companies that had US dollar debts were forced to convert to Thai baht along the way, suffering massive exchange losses as a result. It was an important factor, among others, causing the NPL ratio to go so high, peaking at 45 per cent. In future, if the local bond market could be developed, and made attractive to foreign investors, there could be the option of foreign investors taking the foreign exchange risk instead of the borrowers. Liquidity risks will also be less. If foreign investors want out, they can sell the bonds. Prices will fall. But the borrowers who already had the money would not be affected by the sale in the secondary market. The third risk was that of an interbank market breakdown. At the height of the crisis, foreign banks just stopped lending to local banks. Large local banks, in turn, stopped lending to the smaller banks. Banks stopped lending to finance companies. The interbank market simply ceased to function for fear of default. In such a situation, the central bank had no way to act as lender of last resort. It could buy in government bonds, but the banks with bonds to sell are not the ones with liquidity need. Money did not go round. In such a situation, if instead the market for corporate bonds had existed, financial institutions would have had some corporate bonds in hand - instead of just boxes of loan contracts. They could have sold the bonds. They might incur some losses. But at least they can look after themselves in the midst of crisis - regardless of the perception about their credit. The local bond markets in emerging Asia, therefore, is an important safeguard that can help prevent a crisis. And since we want the Asian countries to become more and more closely linked, lack of crisis is certainly good news. The bond market is a much better channel for capital flow than the bank channel. If capital comes in through the banks, foreign lenders may lend too much. They may bet on the eventual government bail out. On the other hand, if it comes through the bond market and if it is transparent and well-managed, resource allocation could be improved. However, for the local bond markets to be attractive to foreign investors, one has to accomplish many things. Harmonization of standards and codes to international best practice must be done. Hedging markets must be available for both currency risk and interest rate risk, and this may mean a rethink on capital controls. Perhaps a gradual step-by-step relaxation in needed. 
 BIS Review 28/2003 3 Transparency is also required both in price discovery and the management of both the macroeconomy and the individual corporates. The legal system must respect creditors’ rights, and for investment products to be available for sale across Asian countries, a uniform single passport of consumer production by the SEC’s must be made. Now comes the final question. What is the purpose of the Asian Bond Fund? You may recall that the Asian Bond Fund was announced on 2 June 2003 at US $1 billion by 11 central banks in East Asia and Pacific countries. Initially it will invest in sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds issued by Asian governments in the international markets. This by itself already sparked a keen interest in Asian bonds. I know of at least one Asian central bank that had not invested in Asian bonds before, other than in JGB’s, but has now started buying directly in addition to investment in the Asian Bond Fund. Thailand is now looking at doing this also. I am sure there will be more central banks both in Asia and outside looking at Asian bonds at the international level because of this initiative. But in the nest step, the Asian Bond Fund will extend the investment into the various local bond markets in local currencies. The Fund will be calling on Asian countries. It will be ready to invest, but only if the market builds up the right conditions, and removes all the impediments. And you know that until the last impediment is removed, the market will not be attractive to foreign investors. And since these impediments often extend across many government departments and functions, as well as the judicial system, so only the strongest political commitment can remove all of them. So will the political commitment come forward? With money waiting at the door, and with peer pressure and available assistance within Asia, I think there is a good chance that it will. Someone asked me earlier how much of the Asian international reserves will have to go into these Asian Bond Funds. Well, I hope not a lot. It is not the job of the authorities to replace the market. What the authorities try to do is simply to act as a catalyst. In the long run, private money in Asia should find its own way to invest in Asia, whether it is savings from insurance companies in Japan, mutual funds in Hong Kong or pension funds in Singapore investing in corporate bonds all over Asia. Will there be enough opportunity for investing in Asia? Certainly! Many Asian countries still have very young populations. Half of Thais are under the age of 30. Demand for construction, household products and infrastructure will be strong for many decades. There is ample opportunity for Asian savings to find Asian investments. 
 BIS Review 28/2003 1 Susan S Bies: Managing business risks  Speech by Ms Susan S Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Oregon Bankers Association, Independent Community Banks of Oregon, and Idaho Bankers Association; Sunriver, Oregon, 16 June 2003. *      *      * Thank you for inviting me to participate in the joint annual convention of the Oregon Bankers Association, the Independent Community Banks of Oregon and the Idaho Bankers Association. One of my responsibilities as a governor on the Federal Reserve Board is to chair the Board's Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Affairs. In that role I apply my knowledge of banking to the continuing task of adapting the Federal Reserve's supervision process to meet the needs of the evolving financial services industry. Today I want to explore some issues of joint interest to us, as bankers and supervisors, and to think about how we can better manage the risks inherent in banks.  First I'll focus on some of issues arising from events at public companies and banks in the past eighteen months that have shown weaknesses in risk management practices. And then I'll talk about how operational risk management is evolving into a discipline that can strengthen the corporate governance process at banks.  Bank earnings and performance Banks in the United States have experienced two consecutive years of record earnings, despite the recession and slow recovery, losses due to exposures to bankruptcies arising from corporate fraud, and record low interest rates. In 2002, the return on assets rose 16 basis points, to 1.33 percent, the highest level in three decades. The improvements in earnings and ROA are even more remarkable in that they occurred while banks were strengthening their capital ratios. Thus, banks' performance was driven by increased net interest margins, lower relative costs and comparatively constant loan loss provisions.  The ability of bankers to achieve record earnings during a recession and the early part of the recovery reflects the improvement in risk management that occurred in the 1990s. This is especially true in relation to credit and asset/liability risks. Operational risks are a different matter: Banks have had to deal with losses arising from operational issues, as a few well-publicized events have shown.  Operational risk "Operational risk" is a relatively new term that has no unique definition. In the mid-1990s the concept began to receive attention at banks and nonfinancial firms as enterprise-risk management began to evolve. For purposes of my talk today, I am going to refer to operational risk as any risk that arises from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems or from external events. Examples of operational risk include employee fraud, customer lawsuits, failed information system conversions, and mis-sent wires.  Operational risk has always been part of banking. But the greater variety of products and services that banks provide, the evolution of business processes, and changes in the ethical environment in which we live have all contributed to more observable exposures to this type of risk. An example of this is the growing use of automated loan underwriting systems.  When individual loan officers are responsible for making lending decisions within established credit guidelines, unexpected losses tend to be concentrated. That is, if a particular loan officer is a weak underwriter, only the portion of the loan portfolio generated by that individual shows higher delinquencies and charge-offs. Management could address this risk in many ways, including by providing additional training for that loan officer and by increasing loan-review activities.  Today, many lending decisions are made by automated systems. If the model used for underwriting has a weakness, a systemic asset-quality problem can arise. That is, higher delinquencies are no 
 2 BIS Review 28/2003 longer isolated in a small portion of the portfolio managed by one loan officer. Instead, significant losses can occur simultaneously across the bank's loan portfolio. Avoiding the problems of "model risk" requires more-rigorous oversight of internal controls. The model should be back-tested to verify that the factors it uses deliver the level of losses that was assumed when the loans were made and priced. Avoiding model risk also requires greater data integrity in loan application and underwriting systems, as data errors can also contribute to unintended results.  Many banks today use credit-scoring models to help in mortgage and consumer credit originations. Although most of these models have been shown to be effective in the past few years they have been in use, they have not been tested through a serious consumer-led recession. In the last recession, the weaknesses in asset quality were - and have been since - on the commercial loan side rather than the consumer side. During the period, consumer disposable income continued to grow. The test of the models will come when we hit a period of significantly higher unemployment or falling incomes. Then we'll be able to see if the credit models have reliably predicted the credit losses.  Reputational risk Another area of risk that has received attention because of recent events is reputational risk. Bankers know that a critical element of success is customer and investor perceptions of the organization's integrity. When customers select an organization to manage their wealth and financial transactions, they have a few essential expectations - that their privacy will be protected, their transactions will be conducted in a timely manner, the advice they are given will be reliable, and their assets will be invested appropriately and consistently with their financial goals and appetite for risk.  Events of the past eighteen months have shown that customers and investors react quickly when a reputation is tainted. Many of these events reflect operational risk breakdowns. The case of Arthur Andersen has several lessons for bankers, and I want to focus on the reputational risk aspects.  A key component of many banks' strategies is the use of relationship managers. Bankers believe that a single point of contact will help a customer identify the range of the bank's services, will provide a consistent level of service quality, and will increase the cross-selling of services. As a result, customer retention will increase and profitability will improve.  Arthur Andersen had a similar relationship-management strategy. The breakdown occurred because engagement partners who served as relationship managers had the final word on signing-off on accounting policy. Because the engagement partner was compensated on the basis of total revenues paid by the client, the partner had a natural conflict between trying to increase his or her compensation and holding firmly to recognized accounting standards. Further, it appears that Andersen did not have an effective quality-assurance process so that executive management would know when a particular partner was compromising accounting standards to meet his or her own compensation goals. Since the reputation of an independent auditing firm rests on its perceived integrity in ensuring that all its clients meet generally accepted accounting standards, the core value of the enterprise was compromised.  As bankers offer more products via a relationship-management model, they should heed the lessons of the Arthur Andersen incident: Make sure operational controls are in place to monitor the conflicts that the account officer is facing. Controls are especially necessary in the area of credit oversight. Rarely can enough fee income be generated to offset credit losses. An effective risk-management process can help identify areas of conflict that emerge as new products and management processes are adopted. Risk assessments initiated early in the planning process can give the bank time to get mitigating controls and monitors in place and conduct an internal audit validation of the quality of those controls, before product launch. Thus, risk management functions can be effective tools for bankers to help limit surprises that affect their reputation in the marketplace.  Accounting Over the past year and a half, some organizations have had to restate financial results because of inappropriate accounting. Both corporate financial officers and outside auditors failed to effectively evaluate the sophisticated nature of the underlying transactions and arrive at the appropriate accounting policy. At a few banks, the evaluations were ineffective for special-purpose entities and derivatives. You have all read accounts of these incidents, and I will not dwell on them.  
 BIS Review 28/2003 3 Rather, I want to illustrate operational risk in relation to a basic accounting concept by discussing another area of weakness that bank regulators determined needed attention - accounting for subprime credit card activity. The accounting concept is not new or esoteric. Rather, the nature of the subprime credit card business, compared with that of the prime card business, is to rely much more on fee income than on interest income for revenue. For subprime accounts, rapid growth of the account base can mask underlying revenue trends. Some financial institutions did not have management information that allowed them to track the percentage of delinquent accounts that were not paying late fees and other charges that had been billed.  In such situations, the accounting is very straightforward. Even if you have billed a customer for services, if you do not think you are going to collect the fee, you should not recognize the revenue and should set up a reserve for bad debt. Some financial institutions with a large subprime client base did not have adequate accounting systems to disclose that a significant amount in fees was not being collected. By recording revenue on the basis of billed fees, these institutions were overstating income. New guidance issued jointly by the bank regulators clarifies these accounting standards.  Further, at some subprime banks, management information did not reflect the level of charge-offs of fees and advances as accounts aged. By relying on charge-off reports for the portfolio as a whole, portfolio growth was masking the increasing amount of loan losses. This is a good example of how changes in the customer mix and profit drivers of an existing product can lead to unintended loss exposures if management information and accounting do not reflect the economics and risks of the product when it is altered.  FDICIA: Internal controls Other areas of operational risk have come to light as a result of the events and debate surrounding the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. I want to talk about a couple of these areas - internal control assessments and the role of outside auditors.  Since 1991, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) has required that the chief executive officer (CEO) and the chief financial officer (CFO) of all Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registrants report on the quality of internal controls. One of the observations that regulators made this past year was that at some banks that had breaks in internal controls, the process of reporting on internal controls had become a "paper pushing" exercise rather than a robust part of the corporate governance process. The related lesson is that compliance with a similar requirement in Sarbanes-Oxley will require monitoring by bank regulators to make certain the goal of strengthening accountability and governance is achieved.  Recently, the Federal Reserve and the other bank regulators made known our expectations about the application of Sarbanes-Oxley to small, non-SEC registrant banks. Although we are not requiring that these banks report on internal controls for either FDICIA or Sarbanes-Oxley purposes, recent losses at banks and notable corporate scandals demonstrate that sound governance and internal control practices are important for all banks. Depending on the size, riskiness, and complexity of any bank's business mix, elements of the internal control framework developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) can provide a process to help identify and monitor areas in which controls should be strengthened. I will describe some ways in which aspects of these processes can assist corporate governance at some community banks.  FDICIA came after the savings and loan failures and a series of corporate governance scandals in the 1980s. In the late 1980s, the COSO issued guidance on best practice in the area of internal controls, and FDICIA adopted this framework. The management report on internal controls that banks issue should be prepared in a manner similar to the COSO framework. FDICIA requires that once a year, managers step back and look at the risks inherent in the businesses and processes they manage, and then determine what level of risk exposure is appropriate given the profit and strategic goals of the organization. Once the risk limit is set, managers should evaluate the mitigating controls and monitoring processes to see if they are effective in achieving the designated level of risk. Managers should also look at the organization's business plan to see how risk exposures are expected to change and to determine whether new controls, or changes in existing controls, are needed to manage that level of risk. Finally, managers should prepare action plans for building or modifying existing controls to effectively manage risk.  As each manager completes their report on internal controls, the report should go up the chain of command to their boss, who then repeats the process for all of their managed areas. When the report 
 4 BIS Review 28/2003 gets to the top of the organization, the CEO and CFO issue the final management report on internal controls to bank regulators. Further, the external auditor is to review the report and attest to its validity.  At the Fed, we have been looking at the reports produced by banks at which internal control breakdowns led to significant losses. We have found instances in which failures of internal controls that were known to management were not mentioned in the management report. These failures include basic types of internal control breakdowns, such as failure to reconcile accounts in a timely fashion or failure to segregate duties in critical transaction-processing or accounting functions. In some of these cases, the external auditor did not identify the known failure in the attestations. We are working with banks to make sure this basic control process has substance in the future.  Management reports on internal controls can also help bank boards of directors and audit committees gain a better understanding of the nature of the risks and the quality of the controls in place. Audit committees should not just hear that the outside auditors have "signed off" on the FDICIA report. Rather, the report itself can be the basis for an effective discussion of internal controls among managers, internal auditors, external auditors, and the audit committee. Audit committee members can use these reports to discuss how risks are changing and what the priorities for strengthening controls should be. Audit committees can also use the reports to bring to their attention recurring concerns - control weaknesses that managers continue to fail to address in a timely manner.  Having seen weaknesses in the quality of external auditors' review of financial reporting and internal controls, the bank regulators have issued an exposure draft to define a policy under which an auditor can be debarred from serving as an auditor of a bank. Bank regulators have had this authority since FDICIA but have not chosen to use it in the past. Regulators have relied on the quality assurance process of public accounting firms and the peer review process of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) to monitor the quality of auditors.  But as you all are aware, the events of the past year have clearly shown that these self-regulatory controls have not always been effective. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act established the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which will be the regulator charged with monitoring the quality of audit work. Since bank regulators rely heavily on the work of external auditors, we are proposing that bank regulators also lay out the expectations for the quality of audit work and the conditions under which an individual or firm would be debarred from audit work at a bank. We expect to work closely with the Oversight Board, as it gets fully up and running, to improve the quality assurance for audit services.  As bankers, you should make certain that you are receiving value for audit services. As you hire your independent accountant, or if you outsource internal auditing, look for an auditor who regularly works for another financial institution or is part of a larger organization that is aware of and concerned about emerging risks and best practice controls. Such a firm will provide resources to ensure that corporate governance and controls are appropriate for your organization and that internal controls evolve to keep pace with changing business practices.  Conclusion Banks are becoming more differentiated as they choose to serve different customer mixes, focus on specialized activities, or rely on new delivery channels. Thus, it is important that you make risk management part of your strategic planning process.  Corporate governance and audit failures over recent months demonstrate how quickly trust can be lost. Reputation and integrity are vital to building and maintaining good relations with bank customers, employees, investors and communities. Good governance and continued attention to internal controls are responsibilities that boards of directors and management cannot afford to neglect.  With the improvements in credit and asset/liability management, failures in operational controls and corporate governance will continue to be a larger source of losses for banks in the future. Thus, all bankers need to formally add the evaluation and mitigation of operational risk to their corporate governance processes. 
BIS Review 28/2003 1 Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Basel II - discussion of complex issues Testimony by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, 18 June 2003. *      *      * Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, members of the Committee, it is a pleasure to appear before you this morning on behalf of the Board of Governors to discuss Basel II, the evolving new capital accord for internationally active banking organizations. After five years of discussion, the proposal is entering its final stage of public comment and review, although there still remain additional steps to the process.  Why is a new capital standard necessary? The banking supervisors in this country believe that Basel I, the current capital regime adopted in 1988, must be replaced for the largest, most complex banks for three major reasons: (1) Basel I has serious shortcomings as it applies to these large entities, (2) the art of risk management has evolved at the largest banks, and (3) the banking system has become increasingly concentrated.  Shortcomings in Basel I Basel I was a major step forward in capital regulation. Indeed, for most banks in this country Basel I, as we in the United States have augmented it, is now - and for the foreseeable future will be - more than adequate as a capital framework. However, for the small number of large, complex, internationally active banking organizations, Basel I has serious shortcomings which are becoming more evident with time. Developing a replacement to apply to these banking organizations is imperative.  Basel I is too simplistic to address the activities of our most complex banking institutions. The framework has only four risk categories, and most loans receive the same regulatory capital charge even though loans made by banks encompass the whole spectrum of credit quality. The limited differentiation among the degrees of risk means that the calculated capital ratios are too often uninformative and might well provide misleading information for banks with risky or problem credits or, for that matter, with portfolios dominated by very safe loans.  Moreover, the limited number of risk categories creates incentives for banks to game the system through capital arbitrage. Capital arbitrage is the avoidance of certain minimum capital charges through the sale or securitization of bank assets for which the capital requirement that the market would impose is less than the current regulatory capital charge. For example, credit card loans and residential mortgages are securitized in volume, rather than held on banks' balance sheets, because the market requires less capital, in the form of bank credit enhancements, than Basel I requires in capital charges. This behavior by banks is perfectly understandable, even desirable in terms of economic efficiency. But it means that banks that engage in such arbitrage retain the higher-risk assets for which the regulatory capital charge - calibrated to assets of average quality - is on average too low.  To be sure, through the examination process supervisors are still able to evaluate the true risk position of the bank, but the regulatory minimum capital ratios of the larger banks are becoming less and less meaningful, a trend that will only accelerate. Not only are creditors, counterparties, and investors less able to evaluate the capital strength of individual banks from what are supposed to be risk-based capital ratios, but regulations and statutory requirements tied to capital ratios have less meaning as well. Basel I capital ratios neither adequately reflect risk nor measure bank strength at the larger banks.  The evolving state of the art  Risk measurement and management have improved significantly beyond the state of the art of fifteen years ago, when Basel I was developed. Banks themselves have created some of the new techniques to improve their risk management and internal economic capital measures in order to be more 
2 BIS Review 28/2003 effective competitors and to control and manage their credit losses. But clearly banks can go considerably further. One objective of Basel II is to speed adoption of these new techniques and to promote the further evolution of risk measurement and management by harnessing them to the regulatory process.  Increased heterogeneity and concentration in banking Market pressures have led to consolidation in banking around the world. Our own banking system has not been immune; it, too, has become increasingly concentrated with a small number of very large banks operating across a wide range of product and geographic markets. The operations of these large banks are tremendously complex and sophisticated, and they have markedly different product mixes. At the same time, significant weakness in one of these entities has the potential for severely adverse macroeconomic consequences. Although their insured liabilities have been declining over time as a share of their total funding, these organizations, with their scale and role in payment and settlement systems and in derivatives markets, have presented the authorities with an increasing moral hazard. It is imperative that the regulatory framework should encourage these banks to adopt the best possible risk-measurement and management techniques while allowing for the considerable differences in their business strategies. Basel II presents an opportunity for supervisors to encourage these and other large banks to push their management frontier forward.  Basel II The proposed substitute for the current capital accord, Basel II, is more complex than its predecessor for very good reasons. First, the assessment of risk in an environment of a growing number of instruments and strategies with subtle differences in risk-reward characteristics is inevitably complicated.  Second, the Basel II reform has several objectives: U.S. supervisors are trying to improve risk measurement and management both domestically and internationally; to link to the extent that we can the amount of required capital to the amount of risk taken; to further focus the supervisor-bank dialogue on the measurement and management of risk and the risk-capital nexus; and to make all of this transparent to the counterparties that ultimately fund - and hence share - these risk positions.  To achieve all these objectives, the framework for Basel II contains three elements, called Pillars 1, 2, and 3. The most important pillar, Pillar 1, consists of minimum capital requirements - that is, the rules by which a bank calculates its capital ratio and by which its supervisor assesses whether it is in compliance with the minimum capital threshold. As under Basel I, a bank's risk-based capital ratio under Basel II would have a numerator representing the capital available to the bank and a denominator that would be a measure of the risks faced by the bank, referred to as "risk-weighted assets". The definition of regulatory capital in the form of equity, reserves, and subordinated debt and the minimum required ratio, eight percent, are not changing. What would be different is the definition of risk-weighted assets, that is, the methods used to measure the "riskiness" of the loans and investments held by the bank. It is this modified definition of risk-weighted assets, its greater risk-sensitivity, that is the hallmark of Basel II. The modified definition of risk-weighted assets would also include an explicit, rather than implicit, treatment of "operational risk."  Pillar 2 addresses supervisory oversight; it encompasses the concept that well-managed banks should seek to go beyond simple compliance with minimum capital requirements and perform for themselves a comprehensive assessment of whether they have sufficient capital to support their risks. In addition, on the basis of their knowledge of industry practices at a range of institutions, supervisors should provide constructive feedback to bank management on these internal assessments.  Finally, Pillar 3 seeks to complement these activities with stronger market discipline by requiring banks publicly to disclose key measures related to their risk and capital positions. The concept of these three mutually reinforcing pillars has been central to the Basel II effort.  Scope of application in the United States The U.S. supervisory agencies will propose that most banking organizations in this country remain under the existing Basel I-type capital rules and would continue to have no explicit capital charge for operational risk. Earlier I emphasized that Basel I had outlived its usefulness for the larger banking 
BIS Review 28/2003 3 organizations. How then did we conclude that most of our banks should remain under rules based on the old accord?  Banks remaining under current capital rules To begin with, most of our banks have relatively straightforward balance sheets and do not yet need the full panoply of sophisticated risk-management techniques required under the advanced versions of Basel II. In addition, for various reasons, most of our banks now hold considerable capital in excess of regulatory minimums: More than 93 percent have risk-weighted capital ratios in excess of 10 percent - an attained ratio that is 25 percent above the current regulatory minimum. No additional capital would likely have to be held if these institutions were required to adopt Basel II.  Moreover, U.S. banks have long been subject to comprehensive and thorough supervision that is much less common in most other countries planning to implement Basel II. Indeed, U.S. supervisors will continue to be interested in reviewing and understanding the risk-measurement and management processes of all banks. Our banks also disclose considerable information through regulatory reports and under accounting rules and requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission; they already provide significant disclosure - consistent with Pillar 3 of Basel II.  Thus, when we balanced the costs of imposing a new capital regime on thousands of our banks against the benefits - slightly more risk sensitivity of capital requirements under, say, the standardized version of Basel II for credit risk, and somewhat more disclosure - it did not seem worthwhile to require most of our banks to take that step. Countries with an institutional structure different from ours might clearly find universal application of Basel II to benefit their banking system, but we do not think that imposing Basel II on most of our banks is either necessary or practical.  Banks moving to Basel II We have an entirely different view for our largest and most complicated banking organizations, especially those with significant operations abroad. Among the important objectives of both Basel I and the proposed Basel II is to promote competitive consistency of capital requirements for banks that compete directly in global markets.  Another important objective has been to encourage the largest banking organizations of the world to continue to incorporate into their operations the most sophisticated techniques for the measurement and management of risk. As I have noted, these entities use financial instruments and procedures that are not adequately captured by the Basel I paradigm. They have already begun to use - or have the capability to adopt - the techniques of modern finance to measure and manage their exposures; and because substantial difficulty at one of the largest banking organizations could have significant effects on global financial markets, all of the largest banks should be using these procedures. In our view, prudential supervisors and central bankers would be remiss if we did not address the evolving complexity of our largest banks and ensure that modern techniques were being used to manage their risks. The U.S. supervisors have concluded that the advanced versions of Basel II - the Advanced Internal Ratings Based (A-IRB) approach for measuring credit risk and the Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA) for measuring operational risk - are best suited to achieve this last objective.  Under the A-IRB approach, a banking organization would have to estimate, for each credit exposure, the probability that the borrower will default, the likely size of the loss that will be incurred in the event of default: and - where the lender has an undrawn line of credit or loan commitment to the borrower - an estimate of what the amount borrowed is likely to be at the time a default occurs. These three key inputs - probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) - are inputs that would be used in formulas provided by supervisors to determine the minimum required capital for a given portfolio of exposure. While the organization would estimate these key inputs, the estimates would have to be rigorously based on empirical information, using procedures and controls validated by its supervisor, and the results would have to accurately measure risk.  Those banks that are required, or choose, to adopt the A-IRB approach to measuring credit risk, would also be required to hold capital for operational risk, using a procedure known as the Advanced Management Approach (AMA) to establish the size of that charge. Under the AMA, banks themselves would bear the primary responsibility for developing their own methodology for assessing their own operational risk capital requirement. To be sure, supervisors would require that the procedures used are comprehensive, systematic, and consistent with certain broad outlines, and must review and validate each bank's process. In this way, a bank's "op risk" capital charge would reflect its own 
4 BIS Review 28/2003 environment and controls. Importantly, the size of the charge could be reduced by actions that the bank takes to mitigate operational risk. This provides an important incentive for the bank to take actions to limit their potential losses from operational problems.  Determining Basel II banks To promote a more level global playing field, the banking agencies in the United States will be proposing in the forthcoming Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) that those U.S. banking organizations with foreign exposure above a specified amount would be in the core set of banks that would be required to adopt the advanced versions of Basel II. To improve risk management at those organizations whose disruption would have the largest effect on the global economy, we would also require the same of banks whose scale exceeds a specified amount. That is, banks meeting either the foreign exposure criterion or the asset size criterion would be required to adopt the advanced versions of Basel II, although most banks meeting one criterion also meet the other.  Ten U.S. banks meet the proposed criteria to be core banks and thus would be required, under our proposal, to adopt A-IRB and AMA to measure their credit and operational risks, respectively. As they grow, other banks could very well meet the criteria and thus shift into the core group in the years ahead. We would also permit any bank that meets the infrastructure requirements of A-IRB and AMA - the ability to quantify and develop the necessary risk parameters on credit exposures and develop measurement systems for operational risk exposures - to choose Basel II. Banks that choose to use A-IRB and AMA would need to consider several factors, including the benefits of Basel II relative to its costs, the nature of their operations, the capital impact, and the message they want to send their counterparties about their risk-management techniques. We anticipate that after conducting such a review, about ten or so large banks now outside the core group would choose to adopt Basel II in the near term. Thus we expect about twenty banks to adopt the advanced version of Basel II before or shortly after the initial implementation date.  Over time, other large banks, perhaps responding to market pressure and facing declining costs and wider understanding of the technology, may also choose this capital regime, but we do not think that the cost-benefit assessment would induce smaller banks to do so for a very long time. Our discussions with the rating agencies confirm they do not expect that regional banks would find adoption of Basel II to be cost effective in the initial implementation period. Preliminary surveys of the views of bank equity security analysts indicate that they are more focused on the disclosure aspects of Basel II rather than on the scope of application. To be clear, supervisors have no intention of pressuring any of the banks outside the core group to adopt Basel II.  The ten core banks that would be required to adopt Basel II, together with the approximately ten self-selecting banks that we anticipate would adopt it before or shortly after the initial implementation date, today account for 99 percent of the foreign assets and two-thirds of all the assets of domestic U.S. banking organizations, a rate of coverage demonstrating the importance of these entities to the U.S. and global banking and financial markets. These data also underscore our commitment to international competitive equity and the adoption of best-practice policies at the organizations critical to our financial stability while minimizing cost and disruption at our purely domestic, less-complicated organizations.  Issues Bankers have identified three key areas of concern: cost, competitive equity, and Pillar 1 treatment of operational risk.  Cost Implementing A-IRB and AMA in this country is going to be expensive for the small number of banks for which it will be required, for other banks choosing it, and for the supervisors. For the banks, the greatest expense would be establishing the mechanisms necessary for a bank to evaluate and control its risk exposures more formally. The A-IRB approach would not eliminate losses: Banks are in the business of taking risk, and where there are risks, there will be losses. But we believe that the better risk-management that is required for the A-IRB and AMA would better align risk and return and thereby provide benefits to bank stakeholders and the economy. And, more risk-sensitive capital requirements would assist in ensuring that banks would have sufficient capital to absorb losses when they do occur. The cost-benefit ratio looks right to the supervisors.  
BIS Review 28/2003 5 This ratio is further enhanced because attributing to Basel II all the costs associated with the adoption of modern, formal risk-management systems is a logical fallacy. The large banks that would be required, or that would choose, to adopt A-IRB and AMA must compete for funding in a global marketplace and thus already have adopted many of these processes and would continue to develop them even without Basel II. The new accord may well appropriately speed up the adoption process, but overall, the costs of adopting these processes are being forced on these banks not by Basel II but by the requirements of doing business in an increasingly complex financial environment. In any event, the ANPR will include questions designed to quantify the cost of implementing Basel II.  Competitive Equity A second key concern is competitive equity. Some are concerned that the U.S. supervisors would be more stringent in their application of Basel II rules than other countries and would thereby place U.S. banks at a competitive disadvantage. To address this concern, the Basel agreement establishes an Accord Implementation Group (AIG), made up of senior supervisors from each Basel member country, which has already begun to meet. It is the AIG's task to work out common standards and procedures and act as a forum in which conflicts can be addressed. No doubt some differences in application would be unavoidable across banking systems with different institutional and supervisory structures, but all of the supervisors, and certainly the Federal Reserve, would remain alert to this issue and work to minimize it. I also emphasize that, as is the case today, U.S. bank subsidiaries of foreign banks would be operating under U.S. rules, just as foreign bank subsidiaries of U.S. banks would be operating under host-country rules.  Another issue relates to the concern among U. S. Basel II banks of the potential competitive edge that might be given to any bank that would have its capital requirements lowered by more than that of another Basel II bank. The essence of Basel II is that it is designed to link the capital requirement to the risk of the exposures of each individual bank. A bank that holds mainly lower-risk assets, such as high-quality residential mortgages, would have no advantage over a rival that held mainly lower-quality, and therefore riskier, commercial loans just because the former had lower required capital charges. The capital requirements should be a function of risk taken, and, under Basel II, if the two banks had very similar loans, they both should have a very similar required capital charge. For this reason, competitive equity among Basel II banks in this country should not be a genuine issue because capital should reflect risk taken. Under the current capital regime, banks with different risk profiles have the same capital requirements, creating now a competitive inequity for the banks that have chosen lower risk profiles.  The most frequently voiced concern about possible competitive imbalance reflects the "bifurcated" rules implicit in the U.S. supervisors' proposed scope of application: that is, requiring Basel II through A-IRB and AMA for a small number of large banks while requiring the current capital rules for all other U.S. banks. The stated concern of some observers is that the banks that remained under the current capital rules, with capital charges that are not as risk sensitive, would be at a competitive disadvantage compared to Basel II banks that would get lower capital charges on less-risky assets. The same credit exposure might have a lower regulatory minimum capital charge at a Basel II bank than at a Basel I bank. Of course, Basel II banks would have higher capital charges on higher-risk assets and the cost of adopting a new infrastructure, neither of which Basel I banks would have. And any bank that might feel threatened could adopt Basel II if they would make the investment required to reach the qualifying criteria.  But a concern remains about competitive equity in our proposed scope of application, one that could present some difficult trade-offs if the competitive issue is real and significant. On the one hand is the pressing need to reform the capital system for the largest banks and the practical arguments for retaining the present system for most U.S. banks. Against that is the concern that there might be an unintended consequence of disadvantaging those banks that would remain on the current capital regime.  We take the latter concern seriously and will be exploring it through the ANPR. But, without prejudging the issue, there are reasons to believe that little if any competitive disadvantage would be brought to those banks remaining under the current capital regime.  The basic question is the role of minimum regulatory capital requirements in the determination of the price and availability of credit. Economic analysis suggests that regulatory capital should be considerably less important than the capital allocations that banks make internally within their organization, so-called economic capital. Our understanding of bank pricing is that it starts with 
6 BIS Review 28/2003 economic capital and the explicit recognition of the riskiness of the credit and is then adjusted on the basis of market conditions and local competition from bank and nonbank sources. In some markets, some banks will be relatively passive price takers. In either case, regulatory capital is mostly irrelevant in the pricing decision, and therefore unlikely to cause competitive disparities.  Moreover, most banks, and especially the smaller ones, hold capital far in excess of regulatory minimums for various reasons. Thus, changes in their own or their rivals' minimum regulatory capital generally would not have much effect on the level of capital they choose to hold and would therefore not necessarily affect internal capital allocations for pricing purposes.  In addition, the banks that most frequently express a fear of being disadvantaged by a bifurcated regulatory regime have for years faced capital arbitrage from larger rivals who were able to reduce their capital charges by securitizing loans for which the regulatory charge was too high relative to the market or economic capital charge. The more risk-sensitive A-IRB in fact would reduce the regulatory capital charge in just those areas where capital requirements are too high under the current regime. In those areas, capital arbitrage has already reduced the regulatory capital charge. The A-IRB would provide, in effect, risk-sensitive capital charges for lower-risk assets that are similar to what the larger banks have for years already obtained through capital arbitrage. In short, competitive realities between banks might not change in many markets in which minimum regulatory capital charges would become more explicitly risk sensitive.  Concerns have also been raised about the effect of Basel II capital requirements on the competitive relationships between depository institutions and their nondepository rivals. Of course, the argument that economic capital is the driving force in pricing applies in this case, too. Its role is only reinforced by the fact that the cost of capital and funding is less at insured depositories than at their nondepository rivals because of the safety net. Insured deposits and access to the Federal Reserve discount window (and Federal Home Loan Bank advances) let insured depositories operate with far less capital or collateralization than the market would otherwise require of them and far less than it does require of nondepository rivals. Again, Basel II would not change those market realities.  Let me repeat that I do not mean to dismiss competitive equity concerns. Indeed, I hope that the comments on the ANPR bring forth insights and analyses that respond directly to the issues, particularly the observations I have just made. But, I must say, we need to see reasoned analysis and not assertions.  Operational risk The third key area of concern is the proposed Pillar 1 treatment of operational risk. Operational risk refers to losses from failures of systems, controls, or people and will, for the first time, be explicitly subject to capital charges under the Basel II proposal. Neither operational risk nor capital to offset it are new concepts. Supervisors have been expecting banks to manage operational risk for some time, and banks have been holding capital against it. Under Basel I both operational and credit risks have been implicitly covered in one measure of risk and one capital charge. But Basel II, by designing a risk-based system for credit and operational risk, separates the two risks and would require capital to be held for each separately.  Operational disruptions have caused banks to suffer huge losses and, in some cases, failure here and abroad. At times they have dominated the business news and even the front pages. Appendix 1 to this statement lists the ten largest such events of recent years. In an increasingly technology-driven banking system, operational risks have become an even larger share of total risk; at some banks they are the dominant risk. To avoid addressing them would be imprudent and would leave a considerable gap in our regulatory system.  A capital charge to cover operational risk would no more eliminate operational risk than a capital charge for credit risk eliminates credit risk. For both risks, capital is a measure of a bank's ability to absorb losses and survive without endangering the banking and financial system. The AMA for determining capital charges on operational risk is a principles-based approach that would obligate banks to evaluate their own operational risks in a structured but flexible way. Importantly, a bank could reduce its operational-risk charge by adopting procedures, systems, and controls that reduce its risk or by shifting the risk to others through measures such as insurance. This approach parallels that for credit risk, in which capital charges can be reduced by shifting to less-risky exposures or by making use of risk-mitigation techniques such as collateral or guarantees.  
BIS Review 28/2003 7 Some banks for which operational risk is the dominant risk oppose an explicit capital charge on operational risk. Some of these organizations tend to have little credit exposure and hence very small required capital under the current regime, but would have significant required capital charges should operational risk be explicitly treated under Pillar 1 of Basel II. Such banks, and also some whose principal risks are credit-related, would prefer that operational risk be handled case by case through the supervisory review of buffer capital under Pillar 2 of the Basel proposal rather than be subject to an explicit regulatory capital charge under Pillar 1. The Federal Reserve believes that would be a mistake because it would greatly reduce the transparency of risk and capital that is such an important part of Basel II and would make it very difficult to treat risks comparably across banks because Pillar 2 is judgmentally based.  Most of the banks to which Basel II would apply in the United States are well along in developing their AMA-based capital charge and believe that the process has already induced them to adopt risk-reducing innovations. Presentations at a conference held late last month illustrated the significant advances in operational-risk quantification being made by most internationally active banks. The presentations were made by representatives from most of the major banks in Europe, Asia, and North America, and many presenters enthusiastically supported the use of AMA-type techniques to incorporate operational risk in their formal modeling of economic capital. Many banks also acknowledged the important role played by the Basel process in encouraging them to develop improved operational risk management.1  Overall capital and an evolving Basel II Before I move on to other issues, I would like to address the concern that the combination of credit and operational risk capital charges for those U.S. banks that are under Basel II would decline too much for prudent supervisory purposes. Speaking for the Federal Reserve Board, let me underline that we could not support a final Basel II that we felt caused capital to decline to unsafe and unsound levels at the largest banks. That is why we anticipate that the U.S. authorities would conduct a Quantitative Impact Study (QIS) in 2004 to supplement the one conducted late last year; I anticipate at least one or two more before final implementation. It is also why CP3 calls for one year of parallel (Basel I and II) capital calculation and a two-year phase-in with capital floors set at 90 and 80 percent, respectively, of the Basel I levels before full Basel II implementation. At any of those stages, if the evidence suggested that capital were declining too much the Federal Reserve Board would insist that Basel II be adjusted or recalibrated, regardless of the difficulties with bankers here and abroad or with supervisors in other countries. This is the stated position of the Board and our supervisors and has not changed during the process.  Of course, capital ratios are not the sole consideration. The improved risk measurement and management, and its integration into the supervisory system, under Basel II, are also critical to ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking system. When coupled with the special U.S. features, such as prompt corrective action, minimum leverage ratios, statutory provisions that make capital a prerequisite to exercising additional powers, and market demands for buffer capital, some modest reduction in the minimum regulatory capital for sound, well managed banks could be tolerable. And, I note that banks with lower risk profiles, as a matter of sound public policy, should have lower capital than banks with higher risk profiles. Greater dispersion in required capital ratios, if reflective of underlying risk, is an objective, not a problem to be overcome.  I should also underline that Basel II is designed to adapt to changing technology and procedures. I fully expect that in the years ahead banks and supervisors will develop better ways of estimating risk parameters as well as better functions that convert those parameters to capital requirements. When they do, these changes could be substituted directly into the Basel II framework, portfolio by portfolio if necessary. Basel II would not lock risk management into any particular structure; rather Basel II could evolve as best practice evolves and, as it were, be evergreen.                                                        1  Papers from that conference are available at http://www.newyorkfed.org/pihome/news/speeches/2003/con052903.html 
8 BIS Review 28/2003 The Schedule and Transparency I would like to say a few words about the schedule. In a few weeks, the agencies will be publishing their joint ANPR for a ninety-day comment period, and will also issue early drafts of related supervisory guidance so that banks can have a fuller understanding of supervisory expectations and more carefully begin their planning process. The comments on the domestic rulemaking as well as on CP3 will be critical in developing the negotiating position of the U.S. agencies, and highlighting the need for any potential modifications in the proposal. The U.S. agencies are committed to careful and considered review of the comments received.  When the comments on CP3 and the ANPR have been received, the agencies will review them and meet to discuss whether changes are required in the Basel II proposal. In November, we are scheduled to meet in Basel to negotiate our remaining differences. I fear this part of the schedule may be too tight because it may not provide U.S. negotiators with sufficient time to digest the comments on the ANPR and develop a national position to present to our negotiating partners. There may well be some slippage from the November target, but this slippage in the schedule is unlikely to be very great.  In any event, implementation in this country of the final agreement on Basel II would require a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) in 2004 and a review of comments followed by a final rule before the end of 2004. On a parallel track, core banks and potential opt-in banks in the United States will be having preliminary discussions with their relevant supervisors in 2003 and 2004 to develop a work plan and schedule. As I noted, we intend to conduct more Quantitative Impact Studies, starting in 2004, so we can be more certain of the impact of the proposed changes on individual banks and the banking system. As it stands now, core and opt-in banks will be asked by the fall of 2004 to develop an action plan leading up to final implementation. Implementation by the end of 2006 would be desirable, but each bank's plan will be based on a joint assessment by the individual bank and its relevant supervisors of a realistic schedule; for some banks the adoption date may be beyond the end of 2006 because of the complexity of the required changes in systems. It is our preference to have an institution "do it right" rather than "do it quickly". We do not plan to force any bank into a regime for which it is not ready, but supervisors do expect a formal plan and a reasonable implementation date. At any time during that period, we can slow down the schedule or revise the rules if there is a good reason to do so.  The development of Basel II has been highly transparent from the beginning and will remain so. All of the consultative papers over the past five years have been supported by a large number of public papers and documents to provide background on the concepts, framework, and options. After each previous consultative paper, extensive public comment has been followed by significant refinement and improvement of the proposal.  During the past five years, a number of meetings with bankers have been held in Basel and in other nations, including the United States. Over the past eighteen months, I have chaired a series of meetings with bankers, often jointly with Comptroller Hawke. More than 20 U.S. banks late last year joined 365 others around the world in the third Quantitative Impact Survey (QIS3), which was intended to estimate the effects of Basel II on their operations. The banking agencies last month held three regional meetings with the bankers that would not be required to adopt Basel II but might have an interest in choosing to adopt the A-IRB approach and the AMA. Our purpose was to ensure that these banks understand the proposal and the options it provides them.2 As I noted, in about one month the banking agencies in this country hope to release an ANPR that will outline and seek comment on specific proposals for the application of Basel II in this country. In the past week or so we have also released two White Papers to help commenters frame their views on commercial real estate and the capital implications of recognizing certain guarantees. These, too, are available at our web site.  This dialogue with bankers has had a substantive impact on the Basel II proposal. I have attached to my statement a comparison of some of the major provisions of Basel II as proposed in each of the three consultative documents published by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (appendix 2). As you can see, commenters have significantly influenced the shape and detail of the proposal. For example, comments about the earlier proposed crude formulas for addressing operational risk led to a change in the way capital for operational risk may be calculated; banks' may now use their own methods for assessing this form of risk, as long as these methods are sufficiently comprehensive and                                                       2  The documents used in these presentations are available at the Board's web site, http://www.federalreserve.gov/banknreg.htm ("Documents Relating to US Implementation of Basel II"). 
BIS Review 28/2003 9 systematic and meet a set of principles-based qualifying criteria. That is the AMA. The mechanism for establishing capital for credit risk has also evolved significantly since the first consultative paper on the basis of industry comments and suggestions; as a result, a large number of exposure types are now treated separately. Similarly, disclosure rules have been simplified and streamlined in response to industry concerns.  At this stage of the proposal, comments that are based on evidence and analysis are most likely to be effective. Perhaps an example of the importance of supporting evidence in causing a change in positions might be useful. As some members of this committee may know, the Federal Reserve had concluded earlier, on the basis of both supervisory judgment and the available evidence, that the risk associated with commercial real estate loans on certain existing or completed property required a capital charge higher than the capital charge on other commercial real estate and on commercial and industrial loans. In recent weeks, however, our analysis of additional data suggested that the evidence was contradictory. With such inconsistent empirical evidence, we concluded that, despite our supervisory judgment on the potential risk of these exposures, we could not support requiring a higher minimum capital charge on commercial real estate loans on any existing or completed property, and we will not do so.  In the same vein, we also remain open minded about proposals that simplify the proposal but attain its objective. Both the modifications of the proposals in CP3 and the changes in U.S. supervisory views, as evidenced by the commercial real estate proposal, testify to the willingness of the agencies, even at this late stage of the process, to entertain new ideas and to change previous views when warranted.  Summary The existing capital regime must be replaced for the large, internationally active banks whose operations have outgrown the simple paradigm of Basel I and whose scale requires improved risk-management and supervisory techniques to minimize the risk of disruptions to world financial markets. Fortunately, the state of the art of risk measurement and risk management has improved dramatically since the first capital accord was adopted, and the new techniques are the basis for the proposed new accord. In my judgment, we have no alternative but to adopt, as soon as practical, these approaches for the supervision of our larger banks.  The Basel II framework is the product of extensive multiyear dialogues with the banking industry regarding evolving best practice risk-management techniques in every significant area of banking activity. Accordingly, by aligning supervision and regulation with these techniques, it provides a great step forward in protecting our financial system and that of other nations to the benefit of our citizens. Basel II will provide strong incentives for banks to continue improving their internal risk-management capabilities as well as the tools for supervisors to focus on emerging problems and issues more rapidly than ever before.  I am pleased to appear before you today to report on this effort as it nears completion. Open discussion of complex issues has been at the heart of the Basel II development process from the outset and will continue to characterize it as Basel II evolves further.

 BIS Review 27/2003 1 E E Ngalande: The importance of financial system modernisation in Africa Keynote address by Dr E E Ngalande, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi, at the Perago User Group Conference, Johannesburg, 24-25 April 2003. *      *      * Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen: Thank you for the invitation to speak, and thank you all for being here. I have been asked to share some thoughts on the importance of financial system modernisation, with specific reference to Africa and in particular the SADC region. Being a central banker, I am confronted with reaching macroeconomic objectives such as price stability, economic growth, balance of payments equilibrium and financial stability. A mammoth task indeed, and living in Africa, one that proves to be extremely challenging at the best of times. Most countries in Africa are confronted with pressing socio-economic problems such as poverty, unemployment, lack of education, lack of housing, and famine, to name but a few. One is constantly tempted to try and address these symptoms, but is faced with the reality that, in the long run, these problems can only be solved by addressing the causes thereof. It is widely acknowledged that sound financial infrastructure is a prerequisite for a sound financial system, which is in turn a key factor in increasing the economic growth potential of a country, and of a region. Given the rapid rate of globalisation and the dynamic nature thereof, there is tremendous pressure on a country to modernise its financial system in compliance with global trends, standards and best practices, and to avoid being left behind in the dynamic drive to faster, better and safer financial transactions. Today I hope to affirm the causal link between a sound and modern financial system and macroeconomic objectives, not only in my country, but also in the whole SADC region. I am going to focus on the role of the central bank in this regard, both as payment service provider and overseer of the financial system as a whole. Finally, I would like to use this opportunity to take stock of where the countries in SADC stand in the whole modernisation process and to share my views on a possible way forward from here.  From the outset, however, I wish to clarify what I understand under the term (cid:145)financial system(cid:146). It is often interpreted as physical infrastructure such as clearing and settlement systems, but is in fact a much wider concept which encompasses the different financial markets, the legal and regulatory framework, role players, business processes, systems and technology required to provide, support and manage the financial system in a country. Why is it important to build financial infrastructure? A sound and robust financial system is a key contributing factor to financial stability in a country. Although a definite causal link exists between real economic stability and financial stability, sound and robust financial systems play an important role in reducing the risk that distortions in the real economy will develop into a financial crisis and could even minimise the adverse effects of such a crisis in the event of it occurring. A sound and robust financial system is essential for mobilising capital that is necessary for sustainable economic growth. The major objectives of macroeconomic policy in a country are the level of employment, price stability, GDP-growth as a measure of economic growth and equilibrium on the balance of payments, especially in open economies such as those in the SADC region. Domestic financial system weaknesses have potential repercussions on exchange rate stability and the balance of payments. An unsound domestic banking system will be less capable of providing an efficient foreign exchange market and will complicate monetary policy decision making by distorting the link between interest rates, economic activity and inflation. This will by implication make monetary targeting more vulnerable to policy errors. Underdeveloped or developing economies are dependant on investment and uncertainty about the soundness of the national payment system in a country may 
 2 BIS Review 27/2003 trigger capital flight or deter foreign investors, thereby putting pressure on the balance of payments and deepening economic recessions. This is likely to, in turn, have an adverse knock-on effect on the level of employment and the general inflation level. Furthermore, a country that does not conform to international standards and best practices with regard to its financial system, risks isolation from the international economic community. Globalisation is a global trend toward the freer flow of trade and investment across borders, resulting in the integration of the international economy. In a globalised world, no country can afford being isolated, as there is no room in a globalised world for an economy isolated from world trade and foreign investment. Globalisation also brings many benefits such as access to foreign capital, global export markets and advanced technology much needed in underdeveloped and developing countries. These benefits have positive social and economic consequences such as faster economic growth, which, in turn, alleviates poverty, leads to higher labour and environmental standards and facilitate democratisation. Countries that resist globalisation, risk being marginalized. In order to become a role player in regional and international trade, countries have to ensure that their financial system is stable, as measured by international standards. From a regional perspective, problems in a domestic financial system often spill over to neighbouring countries, especially if the countries in the region are involved in close economic co-operation, which is one of the primary objectives of the Southern African Development Community. It is therefore important that the region as a whole should ensure that their financial systems comply with international best standards, as this would play a large role in facilitating regional integration. Regional integration, as we know, holds a number of advantages for participating countries. Firstly, the region benefits from the resultant expansion of trade between member states which will be supported by a simultaneous integration of the financial sector. Closer trading links between countries in a region also strengthens their capacity to participate in world trade, allowing countries to become more competitive outside the trading block. Cross-border payments and settlements will be facilitated by the removal of unnecessary financial obstructions and constraints. Secondly, the elimination of geographic constraints will facilitate the extension of services and the movement of people across borders and finally, optimum use will be made of scarce resources. The co-ordination and sharing of limited resources such as skills, technological infrastructure and financial systems will contribute to a higher rate of economic development for the region as a whole. It is also important from an international perspective, where increasing emphasis is being placed on the financial sector in the global economy, that SADC economies meet international expectations as far as possible in such areas as payment, clearing and settlement systems, banking supervision and monetary policy. The role of the central bank The central bank(cid:146)s core responsibilities in an economy are the maintenance of monetary stability, ensuring financial system stability and the promotion of the efficiency and effectiveness of the financial system. The maintenance of monetary stability; This role of the central bank involves the formulation and implementation of monetary policy objectives with the overall objective of achieving low inflation and protecting the value of a country(cid:146)s currency. A strong relationship exists between monetary and broader financial stability in that financial stability is a prerequisite for the effectiveness of monetary policy, and therefore the monetary stability in a country. The maintenance of financial system stability. The central bank performs a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth and efficient functioning of markets and infrastructure such as the payment system in a country. This role of the Bank is multidimensional and includes the following: (cid:1)(cid:2)The provision of physical infrastructure, for example real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems; (cid:1)(cid:2)The operation of such infrastructure; (cid:1)(cid:2)Mitigating systemic risk by providing the liquidity needed to oil the wheels of the financial system; 
 BIS Review 27/2003 3 (cid:1)(cid:2)Oversight of infrastructures such as the national payment system as well as financial markets in order to ensure the smooth and efficient functioning thereof; and (cid:1)(cid:2)Supervising the financial system on an ongoing basis. The central bank acts as the guardian of financial stability, which is necessary to efficiently allocate resources and absorb liquidity shocks. The Bank has to continuously and comprehensively monitor potential threats to financial stability. This is necessary for prevention of crises, but in the event that they do occur, also for swift crisis resolution. The central bank should consider regulatory and/or operational intervention in cases where financial stability is threatened. The promotion of the efficiency and effectiveness of the financial system. The central bank is concerned with the robustness of the financial system both on a national and global level as disruptions in settlement in securities markets have the potential to spread to payment systems and to the financial sector in general. The central bank has to ensure compliance with international best practices and standards as laid down by institutions such as the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund. Standards such as the BIS Core principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems and the Group of Thirty Recommendations Regarding Securities Clearance and Settlement are the result of collaboration and shared experiences between the major financial institutions in the world and provide a blueprint that a country should consider to become a global player and be internationally competitive. The role of the central bank in this regard can thus be summarised as: (cid:1)(cid:2)Ensuring that policies relating to the efficiency and safety of payment systems are designed to comply with the aforementioned international standards, bearing in mind that the implementation of such standards should be done with the appropriate degree of flexibility to adequately cater for the individual circumstances of each country; (cid:1)(cid:2)Monitoring, but also participating actively in the development of standards relating to payment systems and cooperating with stakeholders in improving such standards; and (cid:1)(cid:2)Fostering and developing public policy that supports the financial system in a country. This would include addressing legal and regulatory impediments to the effective and efficient functioning of the financial system. Key features of a sound and robust financial system1 A sound financial system is one that remains stable and efficient in the wake of shocks such as interest rate hikes, severe exchange rate fluctuations, financial crises in other systems, but also non-economic events such as terrorist attacks. Robust financial systems are characterised by three basic characteristics: flexibility, resilience and internal stability. A financial system is flexible in that it continues to function efficiently under a full range of economic circumstances. This implies that the system is adaptable to market developments and the dynamic forces of demand and supply and is able to adequately perform its role in mobilising savings, diversifying risks and allocating resources. The system is also not rigid and can adapt to support the functioning of financial markets. The system is resilient in that it remains capable of allocating resources efficiently, timeously and with certainty, even in times of financial crises or external shocks. Technological and infrastructure vulnerabilities in the financial system have also been adequately addressed. The system therefore possesses the necessary redundancy, recovery and resumption capabilities required to prevent, mitigate and manage disasters. The financial system is also internally stable in the sense that the system itself is not a source of economic shocks. The system has a high degree of predictability and integrity, and has sufficient internal controls in place to mitigate operational risk.                                                       1  From a report of the Working Party on Financial Stability in Emerging Market Economies, (cid:147)Financial Stability in Emerging Market Economies. A strategy for the for the formulation, adoption and implementation of sound principles and practices to strengthen financial systems.(cid:148) Bank for International Settlements. Basle, April 1997.  
 4 BIS Review 27/2003 From a macroeconomic point of view, central banks should focus on policies that promote financial stability, that is those that are aimed at containing fluctuations in aggregate economic activity as far as possible, promote sustainable growth and avoid economic uncertainty.  From a structural point of view, policies should ensure that relative prices are in line with economic fundamentals and that structural conditions promote the efficient and sustainable allocation of real and financial resources. Such policies include tax policies and policies pertaining to the allocation of productive factors. The key elements of a sound and robust financial system can be divided into three categories, namely the infrastructure building blocks that support effective market functioning, institutional governance and regulation and supervision. Infrastructure building blocks that support effective market functioning include the following: (cid:1)(cid:2)A legal and judicial framework which provides legal certainty in financial matters; (cid:1)(cid:2)Accounting systems capable of providing accurate, relevant, transparent and comprehensive information timeously; (cid:1)(cid:2)Other mechanisms and institutions for the application of codes of conduct, conventions and best practices to limit price manipulation, fraudulent behaviour and other detrimental practices; (cid:1)(cid:2)Sound payment and settlement systems, as these provide mechanisms through which payments can be made in risk-free money and as such are essential to the smooth operation of market economies; and (cid:1)(cid:2)Market diversity and depth. Financial systems need to have a broad array of instruments and markets and to provide a sufficient range of services if they are to be efficient and flexible and resilient enough to continue to function effectively in the face of major economic changes. On the topic of institutional governance, deficiencies in management and control have been common elements in banking and other financial crises. The quality of the institutional governance of financial businesses is crucial to reducing the likelihood that crises will emerge, as well as to limiting the severity of the crises when they do occur. Finally, financial regulation and supervision play an essential role in fostering financial robustness. Official oversight of the financial system encompasses financial regulation, including the formulation and enforcement of rules and standards governing financial behaviour as well as the ongoing supervision of individual institutions. Regulators should seek to support and enhance market functioning, rather than to displace it, by establishing basic rules of the game and seeing that they are observed. Regulatory/supervisory authorities should promote the reliability, effectiveness and integrity of the market infrastructure, in particular payments and transactions systems. The Malawian experience in payment system reform At this juncture let me briefly share with you our own experiences in Malawi our efforts in modernising the payment system. The transformation of the payment system in Malawi has been influenced to a great extent by the structural reforms that have been implemented in the financial sector since the early 1980s. These reforms were initiated by the Malawi Government as part of the overall Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) that the country has implemented since 1981 with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The reforms were specifically aimed at making the whole financial system more responsive and efficient so that it can adequately support the development requirements of the country by providing the required financial resources. There are also other factors that influenced payment systems reforms in Malawi. These include: the need to attract foreign investors into the country, the effects of liberalised economic policies adopted in the 1990s and the introduction of the Southern African Development Cooperation (SADC) Regional Payment Systems Modernisation Project by the Committee of SADC Central Bank Governors. The introduction of the SADC Payment Systems Regional Modernisation Project added impetus to the reform process that was initiated under SAPs. 
 BIS Review 27/2003 5 The financial system in Malawi, like in many developing countries, is relatively small, underdeveloped and dominated by a few financial players who offer a limited range of services. The economy is predominantly rural-based and cash is the dominant mode of payment. Against this backgroung our efforts have been geared towards promoting the use of cash-less payment instruments in line with our vision and strategy. In order to effectively coordinate the reform process we formed a mother body - the National Payments Council (NPC) which is chaired by the Reserve Bank of Malawi. Membership of the Council includes all financial institutions and service providers like telecommunications company and power supply company. Thus all major stakeholders have been actively involved in payment systems reform initiatives in Malawi. We have found this to be of critical importance because in our view we consider that the task of forging the country(cid:146)s payment system vision and strategy is a shared responsibility. Through this collaborative effort we have today made tremendous progress in modernising our payment system. The Reserve Bank of Malawi spearheaded and fully financed the establishment of a proprietary Wide Area Network (WAN) infrastructure and a transaction switch - called the Malawi Switch Centre (Malswitch). The switch centre, which was a dream three years ago, is now a reality and this has been our major achievement. Under the Malswitch Model, Malawi has managed to link up all the commercial banks and other major players in the financial system in a single network infrastructure providing a number of products including the following: Smart Card The smart card is intended to reduce cash usage. Some of the commercial banks operating in Malawi have entered into an agreement with Malswitch to become issuers of the smart card. In addition, some private companies and Government Departments have started paying salaries to their employees through the smart card scheme. Retailers and merchants are also actively using the smart card. Virtual Private Network (VPN) This is part of the Malswitch system that offers a national online system linking all small commercial banks (a corporate Wide Area Network) to transact with each other while maintaining complete security and confidentiality of their data. This facility could also be used by government departments and large retailers who have branch networks across the country. The Electronic Bidding System This enables the Financial Market Operations Department of the Reserve Bank of Malawi to accept bids for Treasury Bills and Reserve Bank of Malawi Bills electronically. Capturing, cancellation and notification of bid results is also done electronically. Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System As you are all aware Malawi was the first country to implement an RTGS system using Perago(cid:146)s Central Real Time Inter-bank Settlement Processor (CRISP) software. The CRISP System in Malawi became live on 19th March 2002. We initially started with nine participants including the Reserve Bank of Malawi, but within the one year period the number of participants has increased to eleven. The system is working well and meeting our requirements. Government Credit Ceiling Authority System (CCAS) Project The project to automate Government funding arrangement is aimed at replacing the current manual process which involves physical movement of Government officers and paper between Treasury on one hand and the Reserve Bank of Malawi and the commercial banks on the other. All funding processes and reimbursements to commercial banks will be done electronically. Electronic Cheque Clearing House (ECCH) Project The ECCH is expected to be operational by the end of this year and will be running on Malswitch infrastructure. The project is spearheaded by commercial banks. 
 6 BIS Review 27/2003 Since this is an RTGS gathering I thought I should also briefly share with you the benefits we have derived from the CRISP System during the one year period it has been operational. The CRISP System provides the Reserve Bank of Malawi with up to the minute liquidity position of the financial market which is essential for proper decision making in as far as risk management is concerned. In addition commercial banks are able to determine their treasury positions and make informed investment decisions. The fast transmission of funds through the CRISP System has also enabled economic agents outside the banking system to make cost effective investment plans since funds are no longer unnecessarily tied up in the payment system as was the case before. The CRISP System has also enabled us to retrieve in a timely manner statistics on liquidity of money market players. The statistics are invaluable for the formulation and conduct of monetary policy. You will agree with me that in the absence of an RTGS system which does not have a comprehensive statistics module, data on liquidity might be difficult as well as time consuming to acquire. This obviously leads to misdiagnosis and its resultant wrong monetary policy prescription. Before I conclude the Malawian experience I would like to request participants to discuss and share experiences on the following RTGS related issues. (cid:1)(cid:2)Provision of intra-day liquidity is one of the most important aspects of an efficient RTGS system. In Malawi the Reserve Bank provides intra-day liquidity at a cost. Some participants, especially discount houses, suggest that intra-day liquidity should be free. These players do not hold liquidity reserve requirement (LRR) balances with the central bank. The question is, should these participants be given preferential treatment? (cid:1)(cid:2)After establishing an RTGS system, what is an appropriate cost recovery policy the central bank should adopt to sustain the operations of the system while at the same time ensuring that the system is affordable. Malawi, in particular would like to learn how others have approached this issue within their own countries. (cid:1)(cid:2)Through the use of the RTGS the float the banks used to enjoy is totally reduced. This used to be one of the sources of profits for banks. After the introduction of the RTGS what are the alternative sources of revenue which our banks should now rely on? Ladies and gentlemen, I also wish to urge you to seriously debate on the issues relating to the role of this CRISP User Group and how often should its members meet. The issues to be tackled by the user group should also be discussed and agreed. This is particularly important at this stage to avoid this group simply being a social club. We need to derive some benefit from it and assist each other to ensure that our systems are efficiently managed. What is the status of financial system modernisation in SADC and what are the next steps? Various steps can be taken to help strengthen financial systems. On a macro-economic level, sound, market-orientated banking and financial systems should be promoted by undertaking structural reforms necessary to remove distortions in the economy that weaken the financial system and undermine effective supervision. Stronger supervisory regimes and the institutional strengthening of the supervisory agency in a country should be undertaken. Countries should acquire high-quality payment and settlement systems and other market infrastructures such as effective clearing and book-entry systems, and ensure that such reforms are supported by the necessary legal reforms. More generally, countries should ensure that the general financial business practices and processes are in line with international best practices. In taking these steps to modernise or strengthen the financial system in a country, the help of international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlements, or companies that specialise in financial sector reform can also be employed. Most countries in the SADC region have already taken an important first step in developing a sound and robust domestic payment system, which is to define a payment system strategy and development plan. Many countries already have the legal framework required to support such a payment system in place, while five countries in SADC have gone further and have already acquired a real-time gross settlement system. Seven others are set to move in this direction within the foreseeable future. Regular consultation with other countries and market participants is important, especially on a regional level, to ensure coordination of policies and strategies, but also to share views and possibly learn from one another. In order to share these views with and get input from a wider audience, and to 
 BIS Review 27/2003 7 communicate their achievements to the rest of the world, countries may consider publishing their experiences in payment system reform by, for example, publishing a so-called (cid:145)Red Book(cid:146) in consultation with the Bank for International Settlements with the objective of providing a clear and reasonably comprehensive description of that country(cid:146)s payment systems. I would like to challenge the SADC countries that have already undertaken comprehensive payment system reform programs since the completion of the (cid:145)Green Book(cid:146) on SADC payment systems, to update these by now outdated descriptions by publishing a (cid:145)Red Book(cid:146) that reflects the current status of the payment system in that country. And of course, conferences such as this Perago User Group Conference also provide a platform for sharing experiences, keeping abreast of new financial system developments and international best standards and practices. 1998 Annual figures Total exports to other SADC countries (USD million) Exports to other SADC countries as % of total exports Total imports from other SADC countries (USD million) Imports from other SADC countries as % of total imports Angola 3.26 0.09 222.35 9.96 DRC 5.33 0.51 230.43 25.91 Malawi 101.16 21.14 375.60 66.38 Mauritius 25.44 1.49 248.19 11.36 Mozambique 106.50 43.52 354.00 43.31 Seychelles 1.33 1.47 57.62 15.04 South Africa 2,607.51 9.70 407.49 1.39 Tanzania 32.86 5.58 181.79 11.57 Zambia 201.94 19.78 564.13 51.88 Zimbabwe 494.34 28.58 1,058.84 40.40 Source: Direction of Trade Statistics Yearbook. 2002. International Monetary Fund, Washington. Comparable figures were not available for Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. This slide shows import and export statistics of selected countries in the SADC region and is based on the 1998 Direction of Trade Statistics published by the International Monetary Fund. These statistics show that a significant portion of the foreign trade of many SADC countries is with other countries in the SADC region. It therefore makes sense to start thinking of closer co-operation among countries within the Community with the aim of eventually having a shared regional infrastructure in line with international trends in regional groupings such as the European Community. A prerequisite for participating in such a regional infrastructure will be for countries to ensure that their domestic payment systems are sound and robust, which has been the main focus of the SADC Payment System Project. Perhaps we need to start thinking of linking our RTGS-systems in some way as to take the first steps towards regional settlement and interbank clearing systems. Conclusion In conclusion, I wish to once again stress the importance of the financial sector in a regional economic strategy. There is a need throughout SADC to improve existing financial systems in order to encourage both domestic and foreign savings, which can then be channelled into productive investments. SADC payment system initiatives can play a role in this process by promoting co-operation between role players in the financial sector. Financial co-operation is expected to result in greater economies of scale, a pooling of expertise, and the enhanced credibility of the reform process. It can also lay the groundwork for financial integration initiatives further down the line. These initiatives should be undertaken as part of a more holistic integration process, which also takes into account both the political and economic realities faced by the countries of Southern Africa. Central banks should work together to establish a sound basis for full economic integration in the region. Attention should be 
 8 BIS Review 27/2003 focussed on the building of a compatible financial infrastructure in the region. The challenge is a mighty one, but it is time for SADC, as well as every other country and region, to meet it. Lastly, I would like to commend Perago for taking this initiative of forming a User Group for the CRISP System. I believe this group will prove to be valuable to all of us as members since we will be able to share views and experiences to ensure efficient utilisation of the CRISP system. I only hope that this forum will continue for the benefit of all its members.  Once again I thank you very much. 
 BIS Review 27/2003 1 Joseph O Sanusi: Embracing good corporate governance practices in Nigeria Keynote address by Dr Joseph O Sanusi, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, at the 19th Annual Directors(cid:146) Seminar organised by the Financial Institutions Training Centre (FITC), Abuja, 17-19 June 2003. *      *      * The Director General, Financial Institutions Training Centre (FITC), Chairmen and Members of Board of Financial Institutions, Chief Executives of Banks, Captains of Industry, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen. I feel deeply honoured to be invited to this important seminar, as the Special Guest of Honour and for the privilege to deliver this keynote address. I should also start by congratulating the Financial Institutions Training Centre (FITC), which has put this seminar together, for its impressive contribution to capacity building in the financial services sector.  The theme for the 2003 Annual Directors(cid:146) Seminar: (cid:147)Balancing Stakeholders Interests: Issues and Challenges(cid:148) is quite relevant and timely, given the havoc which poor governance has wreaked on the corporate existence of many institutions and the failure on the part of many banks to uphold the tenets of good corporate governance. Moreover, when placed in its proper perspective, the theme of the seminar to my mind, calls for the enhancement of standards and adoption of sound corporate governance practices by banks and their corporate customers. In this context, I will like to congratulate the Management of the FITC for coming up with this discourse, which I believe would enhance participants(cid:146) awareness of the various challenges facing the board/management of institutions in the discharge of their statutory responsibilities to their various stakeholders.  Perhaps, I should observe at this juncture that the role of the FITC in providing quality human development and advisory services to its clientele has not gone unnoticed, which explains the high calibre of participation at this seminar. I will like to urge the Management of the institution to sustain and, improve on that legacy that has been the hallmark of the Centre so that it will continue to attract top management in its future programmes. Judging from its antecedents, I have no doubt in my mind that the FITC have assembled a formidable team of experts to present the seminar papers that would explore the different dimensions of the seminar theme. Distinguished participants, let me caution that there is no one single factor that contributes to institutional problems than the lack of effective governance. The issue of good governance is, therefore, an imperative for ensuring successful corporate performance. Building good corporate governance is a shared responsibility among all stakeholders, each of whom may exert pressure to move an institution in a slightly different direction. In this regard, although the motivations of the various players are different, they can and should be mutually supportive.  In any establishment, good governance starts with the owners, then it extends down through the board and management to the employees. No matter what the ownership is, there is need for transparency and accountability in its relationship with other stakeholders. In this context, all rules that define the governance responsibilities, incentives and sanctions facing the board, management and staff must be well articulated. Board members should be held accountable and liable for their actions, that impact on the interests of other stakeholders. The first major step in creating good governance is for all players to mutually agree on the common corporate goals, which must be specific, explicit and consistent. In the process there will be trade-offs and delicate balancing of various interest groups. But once the goals are determined and the respective roles of the various players are explicitly defined, there should be an incentive structure and sanctions, which must be effectively monitored and enforced.  The recent widespread corporate scandals and failures had their root in dishonest management decisions and, in some cases, outright cover-ups of illicit activities and, has brought to the fore the role, which the pursuit of narrow group interests played in wrecking these corporations and, consequently, the lives of millions of innocent citizens who had a stake in them. In particular, these developments have further raised the question of the responsibilities of the Board of Directors in ensuring that an appropriate balance is maintained between stakeholders(cid:146) interests. It is also against this backdrop that there is now a global commitment to pursue and promote good governance practices in corporations all over the world and with it came the establishment of standards, which corporations and countries are encouraged to adopt. 
 2 BIS Review 27/2003 Along with corporate responsibility, corporate governance provides the foundations of market integrity and, thus, imposes a lot of responsibility on the Board of Directors that involves striking a delicate balance between the various stakeholders. It needs to be emphasized here that balancing stakeholders(cid:146) interests goes beyond protecting the interests of shareholders in an individual organization. Indeed, it revolves around embracing good corporate governance that sets the rules and practices that govern the relationship between managers and shareholders of corporations, as well as stakeholders like the public, employees, pensioners and local communities while at the same time ensuring transparency, fairness and accountability. Striking an appropriate balance between various stakeholders(cid:146) interests is a prerequisite for the integrity and credibility of market institutions. It facilitates the building of confidence and trust that allows corporation access to external finance and to make reliable commitments to creditors, employees and shareholders. It is this contract that underpins economic growth in a market economy.  Distinguished participants, having talked in general terms about the imperatives of balancing stakeholders(cid:146) interests, permit me to take a moment to outline the challenges facing directors in the financial services sector with regard to meeting the expectations of your numerous stakeholders, including the regulatory agencies. As a regulator and supervisor of the financial services industry in Nigeria, the Central Bank has come across some unwholesome practices by top management and, sometimes with the active collusion and connivance of the board that are detrimental to the interest of other stakeholders in the organization. A good example of this is the large scale insider loans to management staff, directors, major shareholders and their relations and companies, which eventually become non-performing and, thereby, impair the operations of these institutions. I will hasten to add that, in a perfect world, directors of a company serve as a check on the excesses of the management, but where the directors themselves collude and are involved, it becomes difficult to protect other stakeholders(cid:146) interests. The situation is further compounded where the management has a stronghold on the non-executive directors. Given the observed lapses in our system, the CBN has taken a position that directors would be held responsible/accountable for any misdemeanor on the part of the management of their institutions. Directors must live up to their responsibility and protect the interests of all stakeholders alike. The norm now, the world over, is that the entire board can be removed for failure/lapses in performing their role. The challenge to you, directors, now is to redress the lapses in our financial services industry. When shareholders (or investors), whether major or minority shareholders, invest, their expectation is that companies will be run according to sound business principles that minimize the possibilities for corrupt practices and mismanagement. This expectation is legitimate and must be protected. Similarly, when creditors, particularly depositors, decide to part with their savings they have expectations that they are entrusting their funds to a trusted and honest management and, therefore, expect safety of and some returns from their foregone consumption. When this trust is undermined, then public confidence in the financial system is eroded and the entire economy becomes the loser and the worse for it. As I have observed in my previous addresses to bankers, our most valuable assets are public trust and confidence. Therefore, we should always do whatever it takes to jealously guard it. We need to learn from recent encounters with financial sector crises, the recurrence of which we should do our utmost to prevent. We also need to draw some lessons from the global events, particularly from the Asian and Latin American financial crisis of the 1990s and the more recent wave of corporate financial scandals such as the collapse of Enron, World Com and a slew of others, and change the way we do things in Nigeria. The world has become a global village, thus we have no choice other than to conform with international best practices. Balancing stakeholders(cid:146) interests and embracing good corporate governance practices are the prerequisites for attracting the much-needed foreign investment inflows that will help put the country back on the path of sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. It is noteworthy that the Bankers(cid:146) Committee has taken up the challenge for ensuring high standard of behaviour, through the establishment of a code of ethics and professionalism in banking with a sub-committee for its enforcement. Finally, distinguished participants, I am optimistic that you have a lot to gain by attending this seminar. I believe that the experts that have been assembled to handle the various sub-themes will do justice to them and will, in the process, also comprehensively address some of the issues raised in this keynote address and come up with recommendations that are implementable. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour and privilege to declare this seminar open.  Thank you for your attention. 
 BIS Review 27/2003 1 Jean-Pierre Roth: Switzerland in the EU environment Speech by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Polish-Swiss Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Warsaw, 16 June 2003. *      *      * 1. Introduction Last weekend the Polish people gave the green light to Poland(cid:146)s membership of the European Union. This means that in May next year your country will be seeing the crowning of its political efforts of the last 10 years: its accession, alongside nine other states, to the European Union. I congratulate you and share your happiness. The integration within the EU of the countries of the former eastern bloc certainly represents a decisive milestone on the way to creating a peaceful, secure and prosperous Europe. Of all the accession countries, Poland is Switzerland(cid:146)s most important economic partner. Trade between our two countries has doubled since 1995. Poland and Switzerland can also look back on more than ten years of continuing fruitful cooperation within the same constituency at the International Monetary Fund. Your EU membership and further integration will help to reinforce the economic ties between our two countries. The Polish poet and Nobel prize-winner Czeslaw Milosz once said that Eastern Europe generally knew much more about the West than the West did about the East. I have no doubt that this is especially true in your case, as members of the Polish-Swiss Chamber of Industry and Commerce. Nonetheless, I hope to be able to give you some fresh insights into Switzerland(cid:146)s position in the European framework. I shall first give you a brief overview of the present economic situation in Switzerland and then talk more specifically about our relationship with our neighbour countries. As you know, Switzerland is not a member of the European Union. But it is by no means an island or an isolated place in the Alps. Second, I should like to focus on Switzerland as a financial centre located in the heart of the continent and the challenges it currently faces. Finally, I shall outline the Swiss National Bank(cid:146)s monetary policy and what degree of freedom it has in a country fully surrounded by the euro zone. This question is particularly relevant, since progressive globalisation and Switzerland(cid:146)s close economic links with Europe regularly raise the question whether pursuing an autonomous monetary policy is still appropriate. Let me begin with the current economic situation in Switzerland. 2. The economic situation in brief In Switzerland, as elsewhere, the boom of the late nineties has been followed by a prolonged period of stagnation accompanied by rising unemployment. Not only was last year disappointing, but 2003 also began badly. Given the sluggish economic development, especially in Europe, we have been forced to gradually downgrade our forecasts. On the exchange market, the strength of the Swiss franc has been an additional factor creating further difficulties for our export sector. Investment has declined sharply in an international comparison, suggesting that the excess capacities created in the late nineties were particularly pronounced. The bursting of the equity market bubble had a severe impact on the financial sector and business in the once flourishing investment banking and asset management sectors has slumped, resulting in the need for radical structural reforms and consolidation. The Swiss National Bank has responded to the difficult economic situation with a rapid and massive easing of monetary policy. In the course of the last two years we have cut our reference interest rate - the three-month Libor - by 325 basis points to practically zero. With the marked slowdown in economic activity and the appreciation of the Swiss franc, inflationary pressures were also easing. Indeed, since spring 2001 our inflation forecast has indicated that the risk of inflation is very limited in the years to come, which has enabled us to bring about a significant reduction in short-term interest rates. Our expansive policy has aimed at supporting demand and limiting the upward pressure on the franc. 
 2 BIS Review 27/2003 So far we see no sign of a concrete recovery. We expect GDP to stagnate in 2003. Growth should accelerate again at the end of this year following a strengthening of the world economy. Basically, our business cycle closely follows the economic development of our neighbours: Germany, France and Italy, which absorb the bulk of our foreign trade. Let me now turn to Switzerland as partner of the EU. 3. Switzerland as a partner of the EU Switzerland is deeply integrated in the European economy. Although it is not a member of the European Union, it has very close ties with it. The EU accounts for 60% of our exports and as much as 80 % of our imports. In 2001, one-third of the 30 billion Swiss francs that were transferred abroad in the form of Swiss direct investment went to the EU, while 80% of foreign direct investment in Switzerland came from the EU. It is therefore not surprising that the Swiss business cycle is highly correlated with the activity in the EU, and that the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the euro is of crucial importance to us. Close economic ties also mean close institutional co-operation. An initial step in this direction was taken with the 1972 Free Trade Agreement concluded with the European Economic Community (EEC). Full membership was never a serious option. In 1992, the Swiss people even rejected the option of becoming a member of the European Economic Area. Further progress was made with the implementation, one year ago, of bilateral agreements between Switzerland and the EU. The purpose of this set of agreements is to secure for Switzerland sectoral access to the European single market. They cover seven issues, among them an agreement on labour mobility and an agreement on transportation. Since the middle of last year new negotiations have been under way between Switzerland and the EU on a further ten issues. Some of these are (cid:147)left-overs(cid:148) from the first bilateral agreements, some are new issues which have been raised by either the EU or Switzerland. The EU wanted the adoption of anti-fraud measures and the creation of a tax system in Switzerland which would allow the EU to adopt a regime of exchange of information between tax authorities. On their side, the Swiss sought an improved cooperation in the areas of internal security and asylum policy. The negotiations on seven out of the ten issues have now been substantially completed. We hope that this second round of negotiations will be concluded this year, provided that the right balance can be struck in the overall package. You may well be asking yourselves: why doesn(cid:146)t Switzerland simply join the EU instead of following the bumpy path of bilateral agreements ? The reason is that there is still no consensus in Switzerland on the question of EU membership. Winston Churchill used to say to his chauffeur: (cid:147)Drive slowly. We are in a hurry(cid:148). These words could apply to Switzerland(cid:146)s policy on Europe. Eleven years ago the Swiss people voted (cid:147)no(cid:148) to entry into the European Economic Area, because many saw this as a first step towards EU membership. Two years ago a referendum aimed at speeding up the process towards EU membership was likewise roundly rejected. Since any further moves would clearly lack political support within the country, EU membership is not on the Swiss agenda at the present time. There are many reasons for Switzerland(cid:146)s scepticism. Many people see EU membership as posing a threat to Swiss federalism and direct democracy. A full membership would also have a major impact on our monetary and exchange rate policy. Indeed, if Switzerland joined the EU, it would have to abandon its independent monetary policy and its own currency. This would deprive us of an essential component of our flexibility in setting economic policy. We could no longer pursue an interest rate policy geared to the needs of the Swiss economy. Membership would also spell the end of the interest rate advantage with respect to the euro area, which still stands at one and a half to two percentage points. This would entail the loss for the Swiss economy of an important competitive advantage. If there are grounds for hoping that an enlarged EU will lead to greater stability and prosperity on the European continent, it is also conceivable that a larger market will open new opportunities for Switzerland. Once the bilateral agreements have been extended to cover the new member countries, our economic relations with the enlarged EU will be regulated by the same network of bilateral treaties, as is the case with the current EU. The Swiss economy will thus enjoy easier access to a greatly expanded market totalling 450 million people. 
 BIS Review 27/2003 3 However, EU enlargement also represents a challenge for Switzerland. A larger Union needs to work out its joint position in lengthy internal consultation and decision-making procedures. It could thus become increasingly difficult for us to defend our own interests. Enlargement is therefore very likely to influence our relationship with the EU. Let me now move to one of the key features of our economy: our financial sector, which currently also faces some major challenges. 4. Switzerland as a European financial centre Since the beginning of the last century the Swiss financial sector has been a mainstay of our economy. It accounts for just under 6% of total employment, but currently generates over 10% of the country(cid:146)s GDP. Relatively speaking, therefore, it is more than twice as big as the German or French financial sectors, for example. Switzerland(cid:146)s globally active big banks and insurance groups are also major international competitors in most market segments. The two big banks are among the world(cid:146)s ten largest banks. In terms of value added by the financial sector, Switzerland occupies fourth place behind New York, London and Paris, but is ahead of Frankfurt. Switzerland plays a leading role in banking, above all, in asset management. Almost four trillion francs worth of assets are managed in Switzerland. This accounts for around one-third of the world(cid:146)s portfolios of cross-border investments. Over the last 10 years, our financial institutions have also greatly expanded their activities abroad on a global basis. In 2000 the value of their foreign investments amounted to some 54 billion Swiss francs, which is equivalent to around 14% of total Swiss investments abroad. Switzerland is also a magnet for foreign banks. Nearly one in every two banks in Switzerland is foreign-owned. Foreign banks contribute around 2% to Switzerland(cid:146)s gross domestic product, which makes them as important as the Swiss insurance industry and even more important than, for example, the watchmaking or the food industries. What are the reasons for Switzerland(cid:146)s success as a financial centre? For more than a century Switzerland has enjoyed peace. This has enabled it to develop conditions that are favourable to the economy as a whole, but especially to the financial sector. Among other benefits are political and economic stability, relatively moderate taxation, a reasonable regulatory environment, a very well-developed infrastructure and, not least, an independent monetary policy. The positive interaction of these various factors have in turn produced a strong currency, low inflation, a large current account surplus and, in international terms, a low interest rate level. These have been crucial factors in maintaining Switzerland(cid:146)s attractiveness as a market in which to invest. In addition to the positive macroeconomic environment, efficiency and technical know-how are equally crucial for our success. This applies particularly to companies exposed to intense and global competition like the banking industry. Over many years the Swiss financial sector has been nurturing qualities such as efficiency, a diversified and globally oriented range of services and a highly educated workforce. Technological innovations in the area of electronic payments, the electronic stock market and automated settlement systems have given Swiss banks a further comparative advantage in terms of international competition. Close cross-border cooperation has been established with other European centres. Our stock exchange for blue-chips is located in London, our future exchange is associated with the German exchange. While technical and professional know-how are important, integrity, reputation and trustworthiness are more and more of the essence. Swiss banking secrecy has sometimes proved a source of misunderstanding and even tension in our relations with our partners. The objective of our bank secrecy is to protect the private sphere and to enhance the depositors(cid:146) confidence in the banking system. It does not aim at encouraging tax evasion or protecting funds of dubious origin. As I mentioned earlier on, an agreement on the taxation of savings has recently been negotiated with the EU. EU deposits with Swiss banks will be subject to a withholding tax whose proceeds will be transferred to the country of origin of the funds. Within this new tax regime no harmful tax competition between Switzerland and the EU will take place despite the presence of bank secrecy. 
 4 BIS Review 27/2003 The importance we give to the integrity of our banking system can also be highlighted by our efforts made to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Switzerland has done much in this area to protect its good name as a financial centre. Six years ago it placed its commitment to the fight against money laundering on a statutory footing. Our anti-money laundering laws serve today as reference for many countries. Let me move on to the National Bank(cid:146)s monetary policy and the significance of the euro. 5. Switzerland as an independent monetary zone As is the case in most countries today, the Swiss National Bank pursues a monetary policy that is independent of the political authorities. We regard this independence as a key prerequisite for a successful policy. Our main goal is to maintain price stability. Thereby we create the basis for rational investment and expenditure decisions, and we contribute to a balanced economic growth. Price stability has been the traditional objective of our policy for decades, but our monetary strategy had to be adapted to changing circumstances. Following the transition to floating exchange rates some 30 years ago, monetary policy was based on the control of the monetary aggregates. We had to fight against inflation by far exceeding today(cid:146)s levels. Inflation could be sustainably reduced in the second half of the 1990s, although the monetary aggregates became increasingly unreliable as monetary indicators. Monetary policy needed to be re-designed. In 1999, we adopted a new strategy based on three elements: (cid:1)(cid:2)The first element is an explicit definition of price stability: price stability is achieved when inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, is less than 2%. We want to achieve this objective over the medium term since controlling inflation on a short-term basis would translate into high costs to the national economy. A monetary policy geared to medium-term price stability also helps to smooth out cyclical fluctuations. In a boom phase such a policy will tend to have a restrictive effect and in a cyclical downturn it will tend to have an expansionary impact. (cid:1)(cid:2)The second element is an inflation forecast. We publish a quarterly forecast of medium-term inflation. Not only does our forecast provide extremely valuable information on the future effect of monetary policy; it also plays a key role in explaining the central bank action to the public. (cid:1)(cid:2)The third element is the publication of a target range for the three-month interest rate. The target range sets the parameters for day-to-day implementation of monetary policy. Our experience with the new approach is positive. We have been able to enhance the transparency of monetary policy and to simplify lines of communication with the market.  How do we take account of the fact that Switzerland is now fully surrounded by the euro zone? Indeed, the introduction of the single European currency at the start of 1999 has profoundly changed the environment for our monetary policy. But the fears that were expressed when the euro was introduced four years ago failed to materialise. In particular, the Swiss franc is no more volatile against the euro than it had previously been against the D-mark. Immediately following the introduction of the euro it remained remarkably stable for more than a year. This was due in part to the fact that the economies of Switzerland and the euro area were strongly converging and that both central banks were pursuing a similar monetary policy. The franc did not really begin to appreciate until after the events of 11 September. Within a very short space of time it had appreciated by 5% against the euro. Later on, the way the Swiss franc was moving caused us concern on numerous occasions. This led us to ease monetary policy further last year as well. It is only recently that the franc corrected itself against the euro. The stabilisation of the geopolitical situation is likely to have played a major role in this. All in all, the Swiss franc has appreciated by 4% against the euro since its introduction - much less than had originally been feared. If one also takes into account the inflation differential between Switzerland and the euro area, the appreciation has been even more modest. 
 BIS Review 27/2003 5 Our monetary policy concept enables us to take greater account of developments on the foreign exchange markets and to communicate our intentions openly. We do not, however, actually seek to manage the exchange rate. Only on rare exceptional occasions - such as the extreme appreciation of the franc in the late 1970s - does an explicit exchange rate target make sense for Switzerland. The frequently expressed concern that the introduction of the euro would mean the disappearance of the interest rate differential between Swiss franc and euro investments has also proved groundless. It was feared that, in order to keep the exchange rate stable, the National Bank would be forced to shadow the policy of the ECB, and, with a lower exchange rate risk, that the interest rate differential between Swiss franc and euro investments would gradually narrow. This has not occurred : both short-term and long-term interest rates in Switzerland are still around 2 and 1.5 percentage points respectively below those applying in the euro area. We can continue to pursue an independent monetary course. Conclusion Against the background of the persistent weakness of the international economy, Switzerland is stuck in a rut as well. In the past few months we have had to revise our forecasts downwards on a number of occasions, most recently in last week(cid:146)s quarterly monetary policy situation assessment. For this year as a whole we are forecasting that real GDP will stagnate. Even this modest projection presupposes that the economy will pick up in the second half-year. There are still considerable risks in this regard. The exchange rate remains also a significant downside risk. Although the geopolitical situation has eased since the end of the war in Iraq, it cannot be ruled out that the franc will come under renewed upward pressure as a safe haven currency. In the present context of business stagnation, the recent correction in the exchange rate of the franc against the euro has brought our currency back to a more realistic level, which is good news for our export industry. The current weakness of the dollar, although it had been expected for some time, is a cause for concern for us especially as it comes at an unfavourable time. We watch therefore the exchange rate development very closely. In the present economic situation it is not easy to identify positive factors. One of them is definitely the environment of price stability and strong competition which is keeping inflationary expectations at an historical low level. As a result, monetary policy can remain expansionary. This is clearly the case in Switzerland. A second positive element are the structural adjustments. In Switzerland, the private sector has adjusted courageously to the new low-growth environment in which the price/quality ratio becomes a key factor of success. I think that our economy is well positioned now to benefit fully from an upturn in international trade. Last but not least - and here we join Poland - our main source of hope lies in Europe. Since Switzerland is heavily dependent on exports, sluggish economic performance in Europe, and especially in Germany, is a major cause for concern. But there are now signs of hope : the German government is considering a reform programme which should increase potential growth, and manufacturing orders are improving; in France GDP growth is positive; in the UK industrial production is accelerating again. We can now expect a gradual improvement in the overall economic picture and a progressive strengthening of consumer and investor confidence. Only renewed confidence in the future can lead us out of this delicate phase of economic stagnation. In this respect, the decision taken by a country as important as Poland to join the EU in 2004 will be a triggering factor. No doubt that joining the EU next year will give the Polish economy an additional boost. But your accession will also contribute to creating a more dynamic and competitive Europe. And this is our common interest. 
 BIS Review 26/2003 1 Susan S Bies: Strengthening compliance through effective corporate governance Remarks by Ms Susan S Bies, member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the American Bankers Association, Annual Regulatory Compliance Conference in Washington DC, 11 June 2003. *      *      * Good morning. I thank you for the invitation to speak to this American Bankers Association Regulatory Compliance Conference. Since coming to the Federal Reserve Board, I have spent much of my time dealing with corporate governance, internal control, and risk management issues. Today, I would like to talk with you about the important role that the compliance function plays in banking organizations, and how the current emphasis on improving corporate governance is an opportunity for you to strengthen the compliance function in your organization.  Introduction Over the past two years, we all have been shocked by the headlines announcing corporate governance or accounting problems at a variety of companies, such as Enron, Worldcom, and HealthSouth. As we read these headlines, the question that comes to mind is, "What were the underlying deficiencies in the internal control processes of these companies that rendered their governance practices ineffective?" As the details about the scandals have been made public, it has become clear that they exemplify breakdowns in fundamental systems of internal control. Why, then, have we seen so many headlines highlighting corporate governance and accounting problems? Because these companies lost track of the basics of effective corporate governance - internal controls and a strong ethical compass. While most companies have effective governance processes in place, these events remind all of us of the importance of doing the basics well.  Internal control framework After an earlier series of corporate frauds, the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting, also known as the Treadway Commission, was created in 1985 to make recommendations to reduce the incidence of these types of frauds. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission issued a report titled Internal Control - Integrated Framework that has become the most-referenced standard on internal control.  If one re-reads that report, the need to return to focusing on the basics becomes clear. The report defines internal control as:  a process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of... • Effectiveness and efficiency of operations  • Reliability of financial reporting  • Compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The COSO framework was the model considered when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) was enacted in 1991. Section 112 of FDICIA requires management to report annually on the quality of internal controls and outside auditors to attest to that control evaluation.  Control assessments COSO requires all managers to, at least once a year, step back from their other duties and evaluate risks and controls within their span of authority. Each manager should consider current and planned 
 2 BIS Review 26/2003 operational changes, identify risks, determine appropriate mitigating controls, establish an effective monitoring process, and evaluate the effectiveness of those controls. Managers then should report their assessment up the chain of command to the chief executive officer, with each new level of management in turn considering the risks and controls under its responsibility. The results of this process are ultimately reported to the audit committee of the board of directors. In the case of banks, management publicly reports on its assessment of the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting and the external auditor is required to attest to this self-assessment. Thus, the process helps managers communicate among themselves and with the board about the dynamic issues affecting risk exposures, risk appetites, and risk controls throughout the company.  Risk assessments such as the one outlined in COSO presumably could also be useful in assessing various lines of business when formulating business strategies. But not all corporations and boards consider risk during their annual strategic planning or other evaluation processes. The 2002 survey of corporate directors conducted jointly by the Institute of Internal Auditors and the National Association of Corporate Directors showed that directors are not focusing on risk management. I was surprised to learn that 45 percent of directors surveyed said their organization did not have a formal enterprise risk-management process - or any other formal method of identifying risk. An additional 19 percent said they were not sure whether their company had a formal process for identifying risks. These percentages indicate that some companies have directors who don't understand their responsibilities as the representatives of shareholders. The shareholders of those companies should be asking the directors how they govern an organization without a good understanding of the risks the company is facing and without knowledge of a systematic approach to identifying, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating excessive risk-taking. I trust that none of the directors who participated in the survey were on the board of a financial services company.  Although directors are not expected to understand every nuance of every line of business or to oversee every transaction, they do have responsibility for setting the tone regarding their corporations' risk-taking and establishing an effective monitoring program. They also have responsibility for overseeing the internal control processes, so that they can reasonably expect that their directives will be followed. They are responsible for hiring individuals who have integrity and can exercise sound judgment and are competent. In light of recent events, I might add that directors have a further responsibility for periodically determining whether their initial assessment of management's integrity was correct.  The COSO framework and FDICIA annual report can be an effective tool for the auditor to communicate risks and control processes to the audit committee. Members of that committee should use the reports to be sure business strategy, changing business processes, management reorganizations, and positioning for future growth are conducted within the context of a sound system of internal controls and governance. The report should identify priorities for strengthening the effectiveness of internal controls.  Indeed, beyond legal requirements, boards of directors of all firms should periodically assess where management, which has stewardship over shareholder resources, stands on ethical business practices. They should ask, for example: "Are we getting by on technicalities, adhering to the letter but not the spirit of the law? Are we compensating ourselves and others on the basis of contribution, or are we taking advantage of our positions? Would our reputation be tainted if word of our actions became public?" Compliance officers should help ensure that processes are in place for employees to raise ethical and compliance concerns in an environment that protects them from retribution from affected managers.  Internal controls over compliance Risk management clearly cannot be effective within a company if we forget about the basics of internal controls. It is worth stating that many of the lessons learned from those headline cases cited violations of the fundamental tenets of internal control, particularly those pertaining to operational risks. Based on the headlines, it seems that boards of directors, management, and auditors need a remedial course in Internal Controls 101. As corporations grow larger and more diverse, internal controls become more, not less, important to the ability of management and the board to monitor activity across the company.  The basics of internal controls for directors and managers are simple. Directors do not serve full time, so it is important that they establish an annual agenda to focus their attention on the high-risk and 
 BIS Review 26/2003 3 emerging-risk areas while ensuring that there are effective preventive or detective controls over the low-risk areas. Regulatory compliance is one of these risk areas. While boards are organized in various ways, they do have the responsibility to understand the organization of the compliance function and the extent of its effectiveness and to identify the emerging compliance risks. The challenge for compliance officers is to ensure that their staff has the expertise and ongoing training to meet the specific and changing risks of the organization.  Before a company moves into new and higher risk areas, the boards of directors, and management need assurances that they have adherence to the basics of sound governance. Many of the organizations that have seen their reputations tarnished in the past two years have also neglected to consider emerging conflicts of interest when the organization adds new products and lines of business. It is important that if a customer service or control function must be done in an independent, fiduciary, or unbiased manner relative to other activities, appropriate firewalls are in place before the product or activity begins.  Internal controls and compliance are the responsibility of line management. Line managers must determine the acceptable level of risk in their line of business and must assure themselves that the combination of earnings, capital, and internal controls is sufficient to compensate for the risk exposures. Supporting functions such as accounting, internal audit, risk management, credit review, compliance, and legal should independently monitor the control processes to ensure that they are effective and that risks are measured appropriately. The results of these independent reviews should be routinely reported to executive management and boards of directors. Directors should be sufficiently engaged in the process to determine whether these reviews are in fact independent of the operating areas and whether the officers conducting the reviews can speak freely. Directors must demand that management fix problems promptly and provide appropriate evidence to internal audit confirming this.  While we have been focused on midsized and larger organizations, internal controls are also important to smaller organizations. Many failures of community banks are due to breakdowns in internal controls, thus increasing operational risk. In smaller organizations, the segregation of duties and ability to hire expertise for specialized areas, like regulatory compliance, is more difficult. But smaller organizations still must go through the process of assessing risks and controls and ensuring that they are appropriate for the culture and business mix of the organization. A faster-growing financial services company in riskier lines of business will need a stronger, more formalized system of internal controls than a well-established company engaged broadly in traditional financial services.  Compliance risk management To be effective, compliance risk management must be coordinated at various levels within the organization. In any control or oversight function, there are common elements of a successful compliance process that each organization should exhibit. While the diversity, size, and business mix of the organization will affect the specific aspects of an effective process, every financial institution should consider these elements.  Director and senior management responsibilities. The board of directors and senior management cannot delegate the responsibility for having an effective system of compliance. Certain portions of the implementation of the compliance process may be conducted by more junior management, but this does not relieve the board and senior management of responsibility for the design and effectiveness of the system.  The board of directors and senior management must set a tone that encourages regulatory compliance. The board should receive periodic reports on the effectiveness of the compliance program and emerging issues. The board should ensure that strategic and product development efforts include an independent view of potential conflicts and new risk exposures. The board should ensure that identified compliance weaknesses are dealt with in a timely fashion, and that the line employees, as well as compliance and internal audit staffs, are trained to keep up with changes in regulations and best practices in internal controls. Most importantly, the board should ensure that the senior compliance officer has independent access to the appropriate board committee, and the senior compliance officer has the stature with senior management to see that appropriate controls are implemented.  While the governance of a bank's risk-management program comes from the top down, a successful program will involve staff at all levels, and in more than one department. In other words, while senior 
 4 BIS Review 26/2003 management bears the ultimate responsibility for successfully managing the compliance risks, management alone cannot contain these risks. This means that the teller who has contact with the customer, the auditor who periodically reviews documents for compliance, the marketing staff who prepare ads and develop new products and the attorney who reviews new forms for compliance all play an integral part in running an effective compliance management program.  Structure. The compliance function will vary by the size and complexity of the organization. But the compliance officers should be able to have access to all operational areas. One of the benefits of having an independent compliance function is that it can help identify compliance weaknesses that cross management lines of responsibilities and may not be effectively managed. In larger organizations this may require both business-line and enterprise-wide compliance committees to prioritize resources.  Further, you, as compliance officers, are the independent eyes and ears of the audit and other board committees. As you work throughout the bank, you know which managers and which projects are likely to entail greater weaknesses in compliance. By helping senior management address these risks before exceptions occur, you can help protect the reputation of managers and the bank and increase your credibility. Appropriate reporting to the senior management compliance committee and the audit committee of the board, and timely resolution of findings, will build your credibility, provided that you follow through on their behalf to ensure that managers are taking compliance and internal control issues seriously.  Scope. Compliance should have an annual work plan that lays out priorities, monitoring processes, and testing. New or changed regulations have to be evaluated and relevant internal policies appropriately modified. This can entail training for both the line and compliance staff. The frequency and extent of compliance reviews and testing should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the institution's compliance risks. Areas with higher penalties for non-compliance, that have prior findings of deficiencies or where new products or processes are being introduced should receive more attention. Unacceptable exceptions should be reported promptly to appropriate management and, if appropriate, the board of directors. Compliance officers should monitor corrective action plans, and retest to ensure deficiencies are corrected in a timely manner.  As with any risk management function, the management compliance committee and appropriate committee of the board should at least annually review and approve the compliance risk assessment, the scope of the annual plan, and adherence to the compliance plan. While the plan serves as the prioritization of resources, it should be flexible enough to allow appropriate reallocation of resources as unexpected product introductions or compliance testing results require. At the end of each year, the validity of the initial assumptions should be critically assessed and appropriate reallocations of resources scheduled for the new plan year.  Compliance audits. The internal audit function should perform independent reviews of the effectiveness of the compliance function. This would include assurance of the quality of information in compliance reports, adequacy of training programs, prompt correction of deficiencies, and implementation of compliance risk management by product managers. The internal auditor can also assess whether sufficient resources are available to meet the changing needs of the organization.  Internal audit should be independent of the compliance function. Auditors lose their independence when they perform management consulting roles for which they later will have to render an opinion. Internal audit has both the ability and the responsibility to look across all of the management silos within the corporation and make sure that the system of internal controls has no gaps. Further, the control framework must be continually reviewed to keep up with corporate strategic initiatives, reorganizations, and process changes. When an auditor becomes part of management, the independent view is lost.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act Now let's turn to Sarbanes-Oxley. At its core, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a call to get back to the basics that we have been discussing. Simply stated, the current status quo for corporate governance is unacceptable and must change.  This message is applicable to both public and private companies alike and affects everyone within a company. 
 BIS Review 26/2003 5 • The message for boards of directors is: uphold your responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness of the company's overall governance process.  • The message for audit committees is: uphold your responsibility for ensuring that the company's internal and external audit processes are rigorous and effective.  • The message for chief executive and chief financial officers and senior management is: Uphold your responsibility to maintain effective financial reporting and disclosure controls and adhere to high ethical standards. This requires meaningful certifications, codes of ethics, and conduct for insiders that, if violated, will result in fines and criminal penalties, including imprisonment.  • The message for external auditors is: focus your efforts solely on auditing financial statements and leave the add-on services to other consultants.  • The message for internal auditors is: you are uniquely positioned within the company to ensure that its corporate governance, financial reporting and disclosure controls, and risk-management practices are functioning effectively. Although internal auditors are not specifically mentioned in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, they have within their purview of internal control the responsibility to examine and evaluate all of an entity's systems, processes, operations, functions, and activities.  What are the challenges for compliance officers in the Sarbanes-Oxley era? First, compliance officers must help corporate risk officers and managers reinvigorate the risk assessment, internal controls, and ethical compass of the organization.  Recently, the Fed has been looking at the FDICIA 112 management reports on internal controls for several banks that have had significant breaks in internal controls. From these banks, we have identified several whose FDICIA 112 processes were not effective. A closer look at these situations indicates that managements had essentially put this process on autopilot. Further, the external auditors had not done effective reviews of the basis of management reports.  Before you say, "That could not happen at my company," let me remind you how we started our discussion today. In each of the cases involving banks, management seemed to be content with the loss of vigor in the process and the external auditor was apparently satisfied to simply collect a fee. This is totally unacceptable. Further, as the organization evolves by offering new products, changing processes, outsourcing services, complying with new regulations, or growing through mergers, the controls need to be modified to reflect the changes in risks. In some cases, the controls failed with respect to newer risk exposures that were not identified, or growth put strains on existing control processes that were not suitable for a larger organization.  Don't assume that what was acceptable in the past is good enough for the future. Remember that there is a tendency for an organization to go on autopilot if the compliance officer is not vigilant. You should view this as an opportunity to convince the board and management to adopt a rigorous self-assessment process for compliance controls. Further, use this as an opportunity to improve your own quality assurance process. Are you surprised by exceptions? Do you find your staff coming to different findings for compliance reviews that have similar fact patterns? Are you harder on some managers in your findings, and "trust" others to improve without citing the weaknesses? When you do not have a consistent quality for the work of the compliance function you send mixed messages to employees and officers. Further, you weaken your credibility. And more importantly in the current environment, you are not part of the process to strengthen corporate governance.  Now, certainly, we must know which way the ethical compass of the organization is pointing. Are the product designs, marketing practices, and disclosures communicating a solid image of trust and integrity that your organization is targeting?  Conclusion My objective today was to exhort you to take a stand and make a difference for the better in the corporate governance of your company. You should help lead the dialogue on corporate governance. Although I recognize that some of you are compliance officers of companies that are not subject to 
 6 BIS Review 26/2003 Sarbanes-Oxley, I believe the act is a wake-up call more generally for everyone who is part of designing and testing a system of internal controls.  The events of the past two years demonstrate how quickly a corporation's reputation can be tainted by accusations of inappropriate activities or lack of attention to regulations. Success in banking still is heavily dependent on winning and keeping the trust of customers, employees, and communities. When corporate reputations are tainted, it can take a considerable time to rebuild customer and community relationships. 
 BIS Review 26/2003 1 Joseph O Sanusi: Small and medium enterprises in Nigeria Opening remarks by Dr Joseph O Sanusi, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, at the National Summit on the Small and Medium Industries Equity Investment Scheme (SMIEIS) held at the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry Auditorium, Victoria Island, Lagos, 10 June 2003. *      *      * Representative of the Honourable Minister of Industry; The President, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Captains of Industry; Eminent Bankers; Members of the Organized Private Sector; Entrepreneurs; Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen. I am most delighted to join the President of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry in welcoming all dignitaries to this National Summit on the Small and Medium Industries Equity Investment Scheme (SMIEIS) and to make a few opening remarks. The establishment of SMIEIS was informed by the lingering problems of the dearth of long-term funding and poor business management skills which have inhibited the realization of the potentials of the small and medium-scale industries as the engine of growth in the Nigerian economy, despite the various schemes that had been initiated in the past to provide incentives for development of this sector. SMIEIS is an innovation designed for our peculiar situation in the country.  This initiative has recorded satisfactory progress so far within the short period of its existence. As at 31st May, 2003, a total of N14.6 billion had been set aside by banks for equity investment under the Scheme. However, despite the rapid accumulation of resources, only N4.3 billion, or 29.4 per cent of the fund had been invested so far. The reasons for this slow pace are not far-fetched. First, equity investment requires skill-sets which are quite different from what the banks are familiar with in credit appraisal and management. Secondly, at the time the Scheme took off in 2001, the necessary structures for the investing banks to effectively administer the Scheme were not in place. However, it is encouraging to note that several applications are being processed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the registration of subsidiaries of banks as venture capital companies for the purpose of channeling investments under the Scheme. Thirdly, the dearth of attractive projects in which banks can invest, owing to poor record-keeping, poor managerial capability and lack of business packaging skills remains a limiting factor.  Fourthly, there was resistance from the entrepreneurs who were reluctant to dilute their shareholding.  It took them time to accept the idea of patronizing equity investment instead of loans.  The main resistance was unwillingness to accept discipline resulting from sharing control.  They wish to persist in the sort of indiscipline that made some of the SMEs fail in the first instance.  It has taken some time to effect a paradigm shift and for them to appreciate that it is better to own 10 per cent of a successful and profitable business than to own 100 per cent of a moribund business.  Last, but not the least, of course, is the issue of poor infrastructure, which is constantly recurring. I wish to sound a note of warning on the banks setting up subsidiaries and venture capital companies. Banks should; (1) avoid creating cost centres that will eat into the funds available for the Scheme; and (2) take advantage of their branch network and spread to get close to various areas (rural/urban) in the country.  Specifically, banks should therefore actively involve their branches in implementing the Scheme. 
 2 BIS Review 26/2003 It is my firm belief that investments will soon increase to catch up with the accumulated fund as the capacity building efforts of the banks, other stakeholders and our investment partners targeted at the bankers and entrepreneurs begin to yield dividends and the necessary structures are put in place.  Conscious of the continuing need for capacity building and to create a conducive investment environment for the optimal utilization of the SMIEIS fund, the Central Bank of Nigeria has recently initiated a project for Baseline Economic Study to develop an integrated information system for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to foster better implementation of SMIEIS and the development of SMEs, generally. The information so gathered from the exercise will serve as a compendium for prospective investors in small and medium industries and will be widely disseminated. The study, which will be carried out by selected universities, based on their proposals, in seven economic zones into which the country has been sub-divided for this purpose, will identify the various possible industries that can be established in each region, taking into account their natural, human and material endowments and proffer strategies for achieving them. Specifically, the study will compile a compendium on project ideas and profiles, effectively disseminate information so gathered to all stakeholders, including investing banks and prospective entrepreneurs, design a generic information system that would assist SMEs overcome their financing, management, marketing and other problems. I will like to conclude my opening remarks by sharing with you my faith and optimism in the SMIEIS.  With a concerted effort and renewed commitment from all stakeholders, this Scheme will surely succeed and realize its intended objective of making SMEs the engine of growth in this economy and a veritable tool for the development of indigenous technology, rapid industrialization, generation of employment for our teeming youths and the pivot for sustainable economic development in Nigeria.   Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, it is now my honour and privilege to declare this National Summit on SMIEIS open. I thank you for your kind attention. 
 BIS Review 26/2003 1 David Dodge: How sound economic policies help during uncertain times Remarks by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the German-Canadian Business Club of Berlin-Brandenburg Berlin, Germany, 5 June 2003.  *      *      * It is an honour and a privilege to address the German-Canadian Business Club of Berlin-Brandenburg at its inaugural meeting. Groups such as this one serve many important purposes, not the least of which is the development of trading links that help to strengthen the economies of both our countries. Creating and strengthening international trading links has been one of the keys to the success of the Canadian economy in recent years. But there is much more to the story. So what I propose to do today is talk about some of the economic policies that Canada has put in place in recent years and, in doing so, touch on some of the challenges we still face.  Canada's monetary policy framework Let me start with the policy area for which we at the Bank of Canada are responsible - monetary policy. The preamble to the Bank of Canada Act calls on us to conduct monetary policy "in the best interests of the economic life of the nation," and "to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada." We know that too much demand can lead to inflationary pressures, and that too little demand means that resources are being wasted. So our aim in conducting monetary policy, insofar as monetary policy can influence demand, is to have the economy operating very close to its level of potential output.  Over time, we have found that the best contribution that monetary policy can make is to try to keep inflation low, stable, and predictable, in order to provide the best setting for strong and sustained economic growth. The question then becomes, What should a central bank target in trying to bring this about? Following Canada's return to a floating exchange rate system in 1970, the Bank of Canada tried to achieve a low-inflation environment by targeting the growth of money from 1975 to 1982. But the relationship between money growth and the rate of inflation proved to be unstable.  So, in 1991, the Bank adopted an explicit inflation-targeting approach. Under a joint agreement with the federal government, we aim to keep consumer-price inflation at the 2 per cent midpoint of a 1 to 3 per cent range. If the trend of inflation moves away from the target, the Bank will take action to return inflation to the target within 18 to 24 months.  Our framework is symmetrical. This means that we worry as much about inflation falling below the target as we do about it rising above the target. Through most of the last decade, we have succeeded in keeping inflation close to the target. And so, Canadians' expectations for inflation have become anchored around 2 per cent. All this has helped to smooth out the ups and downs in the economy and to create the best possible environment for longer-term economic growth.  This framework may sound simple in theory. But it is quite complex in practice. Our monetary policy decisions are based on economic projections, which can always be thrown off by unforeseen events. Because monetary policy actions take time to have their full impact on the economy, we must aim these actions at where we see the economy sitting 18 to 24 months into the future. In doing so, we are always looking at what is called the output gap - the difference between the actual level of production in the economy and the level of potential output. If the economy is operating above its potential capacity and inflation appears likely to be above target in the future, then we would tighten monetary policy. This would cool demand and bring inflation back down to the target. On the other hand, if the economy is operating below its potential capacity and inflation appears likely to be below target in the future, we would ease monetary policy in order to stimulate demand, close the output gap, and bring inflation back to its target.  This means that we are always looking at demand and supply in the economy and trying to bring them into balance. So, in carrying out our policy, a large part of the analysis we do is concerned with the many factors that can influence demand and supply. The most important factor is, of course, the strength of domestic demand. But Canada is a trading nation, and so the strength of world demand is also important to us. In particular, the United States is a major customer for Canadian goods, so we closely monitor the health of the U.S. economy.  
 2 BIS Review 26/2003 Economic activity is also affected by movements in exchange rates. As you well know, there has recently been a significant adjustment in the value of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, including the Canadian dollar. As always, we need to understand the causes of this movement, as well as its effect on the Canadian economy.  Furthermore, movements in exchange rates have a direct effect on the prices of traded goods and services and, therefore, on inflation. However, our research has shown that, in economies such as Canada's, the effect of exchange rate movements on consumer prices has been less pronounced in recent years, when inflation was relatively low, than was the case in earlier years, when inflation was high.  Many other considerations go into our monetary policy decisions. We hear from the Bank's regional offices across Canada, which are in constant contact with Canadian businesses. We look at the economic clues in the data on credit conditions, monetary aggregates, and some asset prices - though I should make it clear that we don't have targets for those aggregates or for asset prices. Finally, we look at the expectations of financial markets. All of this information goes into our decisions, which always have the goal of aiming inflation at the 2 per cent target over the medium term. And as I said earlier, we are convinced that keeping inflation low, stable, and predictable is the best way for monetary policy to contribute to a healthy economy with strong and enduring economic growth.  The Case for Flexibility But more is needed to ensure economic health. A doctor will tell you that, besides strength and endurance, healthy bodies need to be flexible. The same is true of an economy. Financial policy-makers not only need to encourage strong and sustainable economic growth, they also need to work on improving economic flexibility.  At the outset, I spoke briefly about trade. Removing barriers to trade is one important way of making an economy more flexible. We all know that freer international trade helps countries to more fully exploit the gains that come from increased competition and specialization. It is true that adjusting to freer international trade is not always easy. Canada's economy had to make some difficult adjustments after the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement came into effect in 1989 and after the North American Free Trade Agreement added Mexico to the group in 1994.  Both of these agreements sparked a great deal of domestic political controversy. Many Canadian companies were understandably concerned about their ability to compete. But despite initial misgivings, Canadian companies rose to the challenge. Some of the sectors that we used to protect the most - such as furniture, clothing, and wine - have since established a strong presence in international markets. Overall, Canadian exports have flourished.  The success we have had strengthens our resolve to see freer trade extended beyond regional trading blocs. Canada is hoping to see meaningful progress at the World Trade Organization's Doha round of multilateral talks. Clearly, agriculture is going to be a major hurdle. The developed countries, including all of us in the G-7, have a considerable way to go in terms of liberalizing agricultural trade. And there are other sectors where major effort is required. This effort must be made so that the global economy can benefit. It won't be easy, but, in the long run, it will be worth it.  Improving economic flexibility can also require structural reform. Improving the structures of our economies should help us not only to adjust to changing world economic conditions, but should also ensure the longer-run viability of our social- and income-security arrangements.  Clearly, most structural reforms are not easy to accomplish. Adjustments can be difficult because reforms often affect different groups in painful ways. Further, the economic benefits of increased flexibility may take a fairly long time to emerge, making it harder to muster the political will to carry out needed reforms. But these difficulties should not sway us from the task of reducing rigidities and increasing efficiency.  In Canada, we have made progress on a number of fronts over the past decade or so. In the early 1990s, Canada began to reform its system of unemployment insurance, reducing and restructuring benefits with a view to strengthening the incentive to work. In the mid-1990s, industrial subsidies were slashed by roughly two-thirds. In 1996, Canada's federal and provincial governments agreed to changes that would put the Canada and Quebec Pension plans on a sustainable footing. This meant some restructuring of benefits and a sharp increase in contributions - moves that were not popular, but were necessary. In 2000, the federal government implemented a five-year, $100-billion tax-reduction 
 BIS Review 26/2003 3 plan that lowered personal and corporate tax rates. And in the last federal budget, the government announced that Canada's tax on capital is being phased out.  I would be remiss if I did not also mention how Canada cleaned up its public sector balance sheets during the 1990s. Many difficult and unpopular decisions had to be taken, by both the federal and provincial governments. But Canada has turned a vicious circle of rising deficits and debt into a virtuous circle of balanced budgets and falling debt. Reducing, and ultimately eliminating, the deficit in the 1990s helped Canada's international credibility and led to a reduction in the risk premium demanded by investors. The fiscal improvement gave the Bank of Canada the flexibility to lower interest rates more easily when economic circumstances warranted. Not only did lower interest rates reduce debt-servicing costs, they also stimulated economic growth, which brought in more revenues for the government. The extra revenues and lower debt-servicing costs, in turn, led to an even better fiscal position.  Earlier this year, Canadian Finance Minister John Manley announced a sixth consecutive surplus in the federal budget and projected that the budget will continue to be balanced this year and next, despite slower-than-expected growth. The federal government is committed to following a prudent path for its budget planning. Canada is expected to have one of the lowest debt burdens in the G-7 this year. Not only have we reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio, but we have paid down almost $50 billion of federal debt. This has freed up about $3 billion of resources every year for the federal government. The main point is that, while the initial work of fiscal consolidation is certainly difficult, it is necessary in order to enjoy the dividends later on.  Concluding remarks These policies I've mentioned - fiscal consolidation; a monetary policy focused on low, stable, and predictable inflation; and improving flexibility through trade liberalization and structural reform - have all been difficult to implement. Putting Canada's strong economic policy framework into place involved short-term pain. But our economic performance in recent years is compelling evidence, in my opinion, that these policies are the right ones to follow.  I don't want to suggest that we've achieved perfection in Canada. Far from it. There is much more to be done, particularly in regards to microeconomic policy. Nor do I want to suggest that the precise ways in which we've implemented these policies should be followed by every country. Instead, the messages I want to leave you with are: that these economic principles are important, and implementing them is difficult, but the economic payoff is ultimately worth the effort.  In times of global economic uncertainty, there is a natural tendency to put off difficult reforms or to backtrack on hard-won policy gains. But it is precisely during these difficult times that it is most important to stay the course. Canada is committed to staying the course and to building a strong, vibrant, and flexible economy. 
 BIS Review 25/2003 1 Howard Davies: Is the global regulatory system fit for purpose in the 21st century? Address by Mr Howard Davies, Chairman of the Financial Services Authority, UK at the Monetary Authority of Singapore Lecture 2003, Singapore, 20 May 2003. *      *      * I am greatly honoured to have been invited by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to deliver their 2003 Lecture. Over the eight years for which I have had responsibility for banking supervision in the UK I have come greatly to respect the Authority’s skill and dedication, through some difficult times in the region. Your Chairman, Deputy Prime Minister Lee, and your Managing Director Koh Yong Guan, have both been wise advisers to me over the years, and we have shared many useful discussions here and in London. In 1995, when I was still at the Bank of England, we were handling the aftermath of the Baring’s collapse. Since then, we have worked on many issues together in many places, particularly in the informed international group of integrated regulators, which is proving to be a valuable forum for the exchange of ideas and experience. I shall be leaving the FSA at the end of September to move to the London School of Economics. But that will not break my links with Singapore: there are very many LSE alumni in the MAS, and in Singapore more generally, so I will continue to have a sound excuse to visit. You were kind enough to give me the freedom to choose my subject today. In doing so I have posed a question. Is the Global Regulatory System fit for purpose in the 21st Century? We could all save time if I answered ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and sat down. But I will indulge myself with a few reflections, based on eight years as a regulator, before I give you my considered response. The Asian crisis and its aftermath In the immediate aftermath of the Asian financial crises of 1997-98, there were widespread calls for a fundamental reform of the international financial architecture. It was argued that the traumas of Korea, Indonesia and Thailand, pointed to fundamental weaknesses in the international financial system. These were countries with relatively sound fiscal positions, enjoying rapid economic growth, yet when a crisis of confidence hit, their financial systems collapsed with alarming speed. This experience, which took the international financial institutions by surprise, appeared to demonstrate both that the IMF’s financial surveillance was inadequate, and that its crisis management tools were similarly lacking. Though it is also appropriate to point out that the markets did not see the crisis coming either.  There are those like Jeffrey Sachs and, from a different perspective, Joe Stiglitz, who have used this failure to mount a major assault on the policies and practices of the Fund over many years. These disputes rumble on, as Stigiltz’s ill-tempered ad hominem attack on Stanley Fischer (in Globalization and Its Discontents) demonstrated. Personality-driven disputes are entertaining for the press. But the more important question remains whether the institutional framework for overseeing financial markets, seeking to prevent crises and, when prevention fails, to manage them, is adequate. Open financial markets will always be prone to bouts of irrational exuberance, but do we do enough to contain the collateral damage which excessive volatility can cause?  Some academics, notably John Eatwell at Cambridge, argue that we need a fundamental recasting of the international financial institutions. He favours the creation of World Financial Authority charged with setting the regulatory framework for financial markets across the globe, and endowed with powers of intervention when crisis threatens. His arguments are persuasive, but it seems unlikely that countries will be prepared to cede sovereignty to such an authority on a scale which would be necessary to make it work effectively.  There have been many other less ambitious proposals, both from within the IMF and the World Bank, and from individual countries. For a time it seemed as though the creative departments of every 
 2 BIS Review 25/2003 Finance Ministry in the world – if that is not an oxymoron – were engaged in a kind of architectural competition to draw up a new set of relationships between the international financial institutions, their member countries, and the key regulatory organisations in the financial sector.  On the face of it, the changes made as a result of this frenzy of creativity have been very modest. No major new institutions have been set up.  But one potentially significant development was the establishment of the Financial Stability Forum, in a response to a report commissioned by G7 Finance Ministers from Hans Tietmeyer, the retiring President of the Bundesbank. The Forum includes Finance Ministries, Central Banks and the main financial regulators from each of the G7 countries, together with the representatives of the various “Trade Unions” of regulators such as the Basel Committee of Banking Supervisors, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). Singapore, along with Hong Kong, Australia and the Netherlands, are also present as representatives of other major financial centres while the Chair of IOSCO’s Emerging Market Committee currently participates to ensure some emerging market input, though only from a securities perspective. With the establishment of the FSF, for the first time financial regulators were brought into the surveillance game, reflecting the lessons of 97-98.  The Forum, as its name suggests, is charged with monitoring financial stability, and acting as a venue for exchange of information and the common assessment of vulnerabilities in the international financial system. It does not, however, hold any authority over member countries, or indeed over the regulators. It would therefore be hard to describe it as even one step in the direction of a world financial authority. The Forum also has no role in the management of any crises that may still occur.  In addition to the FSF, there was some tinkering with other committee memberships. For example, the Group of 22, which in fact had grown to have 33 members, was scaled back to become the Group of 20 – though actually it includes 19 countries and the European Union, which makes 34! That momentous change, in 1999, has not obviously made the world a safer place.  The founding of the G20 did, however, represent a recognition by the international community that solutions to global financial pressures had to reach well beyond the G7. Singapore is not represented at the G20. Nor are regulators like the FSA. Nonetheless, the group, composed of finance ministers and central bankers from both developed and emerging markets, has been useful in obtaining emerging market high-level political buy-in to initiatives arising from elsewhere in the financial system. The G20 have all agreed, in principle, to undergo IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) evaluations and, under the current chairmanship of Mexico, they are looking at economic growth and the role of institution - building in the financial sector along with crisis management, transparency, combating terrorist financing and development issues more broadly.  These institutional adjustments do not look fundamental. But there has been more change below the surface than they might suggest. Perhaps most importantly, a broad, albeit not universal, international consensus has developed that soft currency pegs, or other fixed exchange rate regimes, are, in combination with an adverse policy mix, highly likely to contribute to financial crises, and highly unlikely to protect countries from the financial market implications of poor economic fundamentals, or unstable financial systems.  The second important development, less widely discussed, yet which may be of equal significance, is a radical change in the focus of the IMF’s surveillance work. In institutional terms this change in focus is highlighted by the creation of a new Capital Markets Division in the Fund, which prepares a regular Global Financial Stability Report. That document, which has attracted too little international attention so far, is a brave attempt by the Fund’s staff, reinforced by new recruits from the financial markets under Gerd Hausler, late of Dresdner Bank, to focus attention on potential sources of financial instability in institutions and markets. That means, at times, drawing attention to weaknesses in the banking and insurance systems even of G7 countries, which has hitherto been difficult territory for the IMF.  Yet it is important for it to do so, not wholly because of the potential benefit for G7 countries themselves, but also to show that developed countries are taking the medicine which they now impose on others. This is because the second major change at the IMF has been the rapid expansion of its work on financial regulation. The Fund is now committed to preparing financial sector assessments (FSAPs) of member countries, and indeed of some non-members too, such as the significant offshore financial centres. These assessments review the effectiveness of regulatory structures, financial regulation and adherence to internationally accepted financial sector core standards and codes.  
 BIS Review 25/2003 3 What is the rationale for this activity, which is now consuming a significant proportion of the Fund’s resources?  The Asian crisis demonstrated that poorly regulated financial systems, particularly banking systems, could themselves be a cause of crisis, even where the macro-economic position might look relatively stable. In the case of countries like Indonesia, Korea and Thailand it became clear after the event that their banks were heavily exposed to currency risk through unhedged dollar borrowings. Furthermore, that the regulators in those countries had paid little attention to this mismatch, and indeed little attention to credit quality. In many cases banks were far too close to the companies to which they lent. There had been a rapid expansion of connected lending and little policing of large exposures, so banks were highly vulnerable to individual corporate collapses. That, in turn, precipitated the crisis in the banking system which turned an economic adjustment into a full blown systemic collapse.  Certainly, it will take some time for this IMF assessment programme to bear fruit and it will be crucial to turn initial assessments into effective long-term mitigation and implementation strategies. This will require both political commitment and, where appropriate, technical assistance. But there are signs that more developing countries now appreciate the importance of independent systems of financial regulation, and that the Finance Minister’s best friend may not necessarily be the right choice as head of banking supervision, particularly not if his family owns a large slice of the banking system.  A new agenda for change So while the architecture may remain fundamentally the same, the plumbing of the financial system has undoubtedly been improved. This is unromantic work, but when crisis hits in the middle of the night, and unpleasant odours emerge from the system, it is the plumber you call, not the architect. However, it is reasonable to ask whether these changes are sufficient to reduce the incidence of financial crises in the future and to enhance our ability to manage such crises as will, inevitably, occur.  I do not propose today to try to cover all the issues that might be raised by that general question. I certainly do not plan to talk about fiscal and monetary policies, which are no longer my area of expertise. I will also leave to one side the important developments of bankruptcy and insolvency procedures. The IMF’s Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism (SDRM) proposal seems to have been shelved for the time being but, judging from recent successful bond issues by Mexico and Brazil, some solid progress is clearly being made on collective action clauses which should allow for more timely and orderly restructuring of sovereign debt in case of problems. However, all of these subjects are, as we say, above my pay grade.  I will concentrate instead on the regulatory dimension. I do not propose a very radical agenda. Regulators are not normally revolutionaries. But I do believe there are areas in which change could beneficially be made, which would have the effect of strengthening the international financial architecture, to the benefit of us all.  There are four areas in which I would like to see further improvements.  First, we need a comprehensive set of international accounting standards which attract broad support, and high quality independent audit to help enforce them.  Second, the role of the Financial Stability Forum could be developed and strengthened.  Third, and linked to that change, there are gaps in the global regulatory system which could and should be plugged.  Fourth, we need to find ways of bringing developing economies more closely into the process of setting standards.  I will say a word or two about each of these suggestions.  (i) Accounting and auditing  Accounting standards are the foundation stone of the financial system, and of financial regulation. Without accounting numbers in which investors can have confidence regulation, cannot hope to be effective. And those accounts must be audited objectively and independently.  Since the reformation of the International Accounting Standards Board three years ago a determined effort has been under way, led by Paul Volcker and David Tweedie, to complete the standard set and 
 4 BIS Review 25/2003 secure broad agreement to their acceptance around the world. They are now close to success, but there are some difficult obstacles still to be overcome, notably the question of the treatment of financial instruments (IAS 39). I very much hope an acceptable solution can soon be found. It would be a great pity if this opportunity were missed, and without satisfactory accounting for financial instruments IASs are unlikely to be accepted in the US.  The related subject of auditing also needs attention. We know that in recent years auditors have allowed their public interest role to be forgotten, in the US and elsewhere. There is a need for stronger oversight of the profession, nationally and internationally, with greater public interest involvement in the process. At present, regulations are in discussion with the International Federation of Accountants to explore ways in which that involvement might be structured, and the Financial Stability Forum is taking a close interest, following a debate at its March meeting. I am confident progress can be made, and that the profession appreciates the urgent need to rebuild confidence in its integrity.  Ideally, too, we need a more diverse auditing industry. I am nervous about the lack of competition and choice resulting from the consolidation into four firms. We cannot afford any more mergers, or indeed failures, which is a vulnerability in itself.  (ii) Developing the role of the Financial Stability Forum  The Financial Stability Forum was developed from an original idea by Gordon Brown, which as I mentioned earlier was articulated in a report for the G7 Finance Ministers by Hans Tietmeyer. It is the one Forum in which regulators come together with finance ministries, central banks and the international financial institutions, specifically to look at financial stability issues, and how they should be resolved.  In its first four years, the FSF has made some progress. Its work on Offshore Centres certainly led to improvements in regulatory standards in a number of those centres. And it has stimulated both the securities and insurance regulators to work more quickly, and in a more determined way than was previously the case. I have first hand knowledge of that impact.  But more could be done. It remains difficult and slow to agree priorities between the Forum’s membership. I also think it could usefully take a somewhat broader view of its responsibilities.  The Forum could do more to co-ordinate the activities of the sectoral international regulators and to contribute to their priority-setting. It could use its privileged links with the G7 finance ministers to bring more political impetus to the work of the bodies represented on it. IOSCO and IAIS, for example, have no other structural links to ministers, or to central bankers. The Forum is well placed to identify weaknesses in regulation, whether in member states or internationally. This would not involve duplication of effort, as some fear, rather the addition of urgency and focus to work already under way. It could usefully play a role in following up on the IMF’s financial sector assessment programmes, not perhaps in individual countries, but by drawing general conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses revealed by those assessments in the round, and about the overall effectiveness of national follow-up. There are signs that the Forum’s membership is beginning to favour a more pro-active approach, but progress is slow.  But that recommendation does rather beg the question of what these weaknesses are, which brings me to my third point.  (iii) Plugging the gaps  I believe we can identify some gaps in our defences against financial instability, which could be plugged, if the will were there.  There is not time today for a comprehensive overview, so let me just identify a small number of issues which I believe do need to be resolved.  One important lacuna is the absence of a global regulatory regime for reinsurance companies. In some countries, as in the UK, reinsurance firms are directly regulated. In others, they are regulated only indirectly, through insurers. In yet other countries they are not subject to any meaningful regulatory regime at all. It may be argued that we have lived with this uneven coverage for some time. But there is evidence to suggest that reinsurers have been taking on more credit risk than before, often transferred out of the banking system through derivatives such as credit default swaps. So we 
 BIS Review 25/2003 5 cannot now gain a full picture of how financial risk is being transferred around the global system, without a clear view of the balance sheets, and the risk management of large reinsurance firms.  Progress is being made in the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, and the European Union is considering a directive to regularise the position in Europe. But we are not there yet.  A second, and related area is the issue of credit risk transfer and the role of derivatives. This has been the subject of some entertaining exchanges between Warren Buffett and Alan Greenspan, in the last couple of weeks. To simplify grotesquely, Warren Buffett believes that credit derivatives have generated new risks for the financial system; Alan Greenspan believes they are one reason why there has not been more financial instability during a period when markets have been highly volatile.  This is a difficult debate in which to take sides. My own view is that neither proposition is rigorously proven at this stage. So my cautious recommendation as a regulator is that we need to know more about how these derivatives are used, and where credit risk has ended up as a result. In particular, we need to know whether regulatory arbitrage is one of the causes – whether risk is migrating to sectors with inadequate capital requirements for this type of risk. That is a subject on which many FSF members agree that our knowledge base is inadequate. So far the international regulatory community has not been successful in getting a grip on the extent of the possible systemic problem. It is a gap which needs to be filled quickly.  Similarly, I am not sure we know enough about the hedge fund market.  I chaired a working group on highly-leveraged institutions for the Financial Stability Forum, which reported a couple of years ago. Our conclusion then was that there needed to be better risk management by hedge fund counterparties, better risk management by highly-leveraged institutions themselves, enhanced public disclosure by those institutions, and some other related changes.  I am not one of those who believes that hedge funds are inherently dangerous beasts in the financial jungle. Indeed in many cases hedge funds have been useful in being prepared to take positions, sometimes counter-cyclical positions, which have helped stabilise markets. But the sector has grown dramatically, and as the Long-Term Capital Management problem showed, if leverage is uncontrolled, even one fund alone can be a destabilising factor.  So while I do not believe that the case for direct regulation of hedge funds is made out, I do think we need more transparency, particularly about the extent of their leverage, and the recommendations to that effect in my earlier report have not been effectively implemented as yet. It is encouraging that under its new Chairman the SEC are holding a series of roundtables on the subject in New York.  Lastly, in this very brief review, I would identify significant gaps in the consolidated supervision of some large and diversified financial groups. Banking supervisors have learned from bitter experience that consolidated supervision of a group is essential to understand the totality of its risks, and the interaction between different parts of the group. Yet there are still major international firms without a consolidated supervisor. In Europe, through the Financial Groups Directive (FGD), we are seeking to fill that gap, for the European Union itself, requiring each firm that operates in the EU to be supervised on a consolidated basis globally, or to construct a European entity which can be supervised in this way. Through the FGD we are therefore attempting to mitigate the risks we see from non-consolidation, but it would clearly be better if those risks could be mitigated on a global scale.  (iv) Expanding the role of developing economies  The fourth arena in which I think more could be done relates to the role of developing countries in the international financial architecture. If they are not properly involved there is clearly a risk that standards may be developed which are inappropriate, or too complex to implement in developing countries.  How well are their interests represented at present in the key decision making bodies?  I have mentioned that the FSF, though originally conceived as a G7 body, quickly chose to add representatives from other significant financial markets, including Hong Kong and Singapore. I have also noted that the creation of the ministerial level G20 was an attempt to reach beyond the narrow locus of the G7 to involve key emerging markets in global financial sector developments. For their part, the international financial institutions have also recognised that an exclusively Beltway, or “Euro-centric” view is not in their long-term interests. The IMF has established a Tokyo office while the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements has added outposts in Hong Kong and Mexico.  
 6 BIS Review 25/2003 But at the level of the regulatory standard setting bodies, the picture is very uneven.  In IOSCO, the securities regulators trade union, the key Technical Committee includes Hong Kong and Mexico. It also includes Australia, which we British think is still a developing country, even if the Australians don’t! And it includes the chairman of the Emerging Markets Committee of IOSCO who, as I noted above, also participates in the FSF. The Executive Committee, to which the Technical Committee reports has an even broader membership including, for example, the People’s Republic of China.  The IAIS, the insurance supervisors organisation, does not currently limit participation in its Technical Committee, which – as in IOSCO – has overall responsibility for standard setting. A number of emerging markets are active participants in the Technical Committee in addition to contributing to the work of the separate Emerging Markets Committee. However, their involvement in the “nuts and bolts” work of standard development in a variety of subcommittees is clearly limited by resource constraints. This is an issue that concerns all of us, but bites more immediately on emerging markets.  When it comes to banking supervision, the composition of the Basel Committee is rather different. In theory a G10 body, there are now 12 national members, of whom 9 are European. And, for good measure, there are two further European observers, from the European Commission and the European Central Bank.  The Committee has worked hard to discuss the emerging conclusions of the revision of the Capital Accord with a broader range of countries, notably through the Core Principles Liaison Group which includes a number of emerging markets. But I cannot help thinking that, in the future, the Basel Committee’s full membership will need to change. The original justification was that the members came from countries which were homes to internationally active banks. But there are other countries which play host to such banks today, and there will be more in the future. I believe that, as a general point, if we want to put pressure on developing countries to adopt higher standards of supervision (and I am one who believes it is right to put pressure on in this sense) then we do need to ensure that the standard-setters are broadly representative, and are seen to have appropriate legitimacy.  And this is not just a question of optics. We need to guard against the risk that committees from a selection of the most sophisticated economies devise standards which are not capable of easy implementation elsewhere. This matters, not for issues of inclusivity or political correctness, but because common, mutually agreed standards are key to facilitating capital flows internationally. And more efficient allocation of capital internationally is vital for the developed and developing countries alike. But we have to recognise, at once, that committees composed of 150 members from every country in the United Nations are unlikely to be effective. To be effective, the standard-setting groups will need to remain relatively small, albeit differently balanced. So we must find methods, in addition to adjusting Committee memberships, which allow us to secure the benefit of the experience of others from different backgrounds.  To get this benefit we must create the right sort of opportunities for dialogue, and ensure there is sufficient capacity amongst emerging market countries to propose constructive solutions. Of course Singapore, as a major financial centre, is probably in a position to share skills with others rather than require assistance. Nonetheless, the point remains that emerging markets themselves need to formulate their opinions effectively and to be listened to by the key committees.  Formulating an opinion requires both technical skills and organisation. The UK has been active in strengthening the regulatory skill set in Emerging Markets. As a major contributor to the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) initiative – a US$53m multi-donor capacity building programme for financial sectors in developing countries – we believe that resources must be both forthcoming and targeted appropriately. Such targeting requires co-ordination between donors and must be in response to the real needs of a country. To this end we see it as imperative that there is effective follow up to the IMF’s FSAP missions to channel technical assistance to where it is most needed.  It is also important for individual regulators in developed markets to contribute to capacity development elsewhere. The growing interconnectedness of the financial system means it is in our interests to do so. Sometimes bilateral links can be valuable, especially where the legal and regulatory systems are similar, in former colonies or territories perhaps. At the FSA we have a practice of receiving secondments from other regulators, which is valuable for us, and we hope for them.  Perhaps more relevant for Singapore is ensuring that Emerging Markets’ concerns and experiences are heard. A thousand different voices can be lost in the clamour so it is important that objections are 
 BIS Review 25/2003 7 raised in an organised way, for example through regional organisations. Then the international committees themselves must ensure their consultation processes are meaningful and wide-ranging.  Though this combination of adjusting committee structures, and membership, enhancing technical assistance and encouraging effective consultation we can ensure that regulatory standards are truly global and fit for purpose in countries at all stages of financial market development.  Conclusion  So to return, finally, to my introductory question – is the global regulatory system fit for purpose in the 21st century? – it would be impossible, I think, to respond with a categorical ‘yes’. There are a number of enhancements which need to be made. In each case there are signs of progress. But there will be a continuing need to push and prod, if we are to overcome the forces of inertia built into the existing cumbersome system.  The new Chairman of the Financial Stability Forum will find a sizeable agenda of work in his in-tray. 
 BIS Review 25/2003 1 Susan S Bies: Restoring our confidence in bank controls and financial statements Speech by Ms Susan S Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, Asheville, 30 May 2003.  *      *      * This conference is always an important gathering, but not simply because of what we discuss over these few days. It serves as an annual reminder of the remarkable strength of the dual banking system in the United States. The diversity and flexibility of our banking system are unique. Bankers can make charter choices on the basis of their business needs and particular circumstances. Thousands of community banks coexist comfortably - indeed, thrive - alongside a much smaller number of very large regional and global institutions, regardless of charter. Our system provides a rich menu of choices to the marketplace, encouraging financial institutions to innovate and respond dynamically to the changing economic needs of depositors and borrowers. Under the dual banking system states have fostered innovations that likely would not have occurred as rapidly - if at all - had only federal regulation existed. The dual banking system also helps to safeguard against regulatory excesses.  In short, this structure has been critical in producing a banking system that is the most innovative, responsive, and flexible in the world. U.S. banks have developed those characteristics to survive in a market economy that is subject to rapid change and periodic stress. Our banking system is thus better able to finance growth and serve customer needs and has demonstrated its ability to rebound from crises that have, from time to time, devastated more rigid systems.  This conference also reminds us of the long history of close and successful cooperation among state and federal regulators that allows state-chartered banks to flourish in the marketplace while remaining safe and sound. As you know, the Federal Reserve has consistently been a strong supporter of the dual banking system, and that will continue. We understand, as you do, the importance of a safe and sound banking system to the proper functioning of the economy, and the role of effective supervision in ensuring sound banks.  Supervising these state-chartered banks is a very significant responsibility, considering the scope and vitality of these institutions. State-chartered banks continue to represent about half of the commercial banking industry by assets - $3.41 trillion, or 47.6 percent of the industry at year-end 2002. By number of institutions, roughly three-fourths of banks operate under a state charter - 6,311 institutions or 75.2 percent of the industry as of December. Perhaps most significant, over the past three years the vast majority of new bank charters - once again, about three-fourths of them - have been granted by states.  We have a long history of working with the states to coordinate our supervisory programs and achieve quality results. We rely on state supervisors as equal partners to ensure consistent, effective, and high-quality supervision. Together with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, we believe we have a strong relationship with the states, bolstered by our common effort to develop the supervisory protocols of the last decade and, more recently, by our work with the states and the FDIC to foster consistent examination processes and procedures.  I believe the flexibility and dynamism of our banking system contributes to the financial soundness and performance of U.S. banks. The banking industry continues to be strong and profitable despite a tepid economy and corporate governance issues. After a record year in 2002, insured commercial banks in the United States earned $24.6 billion in the first quarter of 2003 - a quarterly record. Robust growth in core deposits and vibrant activity in mortgage lending have been the key forces behind recent strong earnings, which have been offset in part by weak loan demand from businesses. Aggregate nonaccrual loans and foreclosed assets remain at about 1.2 percent of loans while credit costs have declined, as first-quarter net charge-offs dropped to 0.91 percent of average loans - the lowest level since June 2001. Although all the facts are not yet in, it appears that this credit cycle hasn't tested us nearly as significantly as we have been tested in the past.  Community banks have also remained strongly profitable through this period, although over the past two years they experienced far less of a run-up in problem assets and charge-offs than their larger 
 2 BIS Review 25/2003 counterparts. The number of problem banks remains at about 120, but actual failures remain quite low, only ten in all of last year.  Corporate governance Based on the current condition of the industry, you might ask what's on the supervisory agenda and where should we focus our attention? Although there are a number of supervisory issues that require our attention, there are two specific areas - corporate governance and quality assurance in the audit process - where I believe we should focus some of our supervisory attention.  Over the past two years, corporate scandals have focused our attention on the deficiencies in corporate governance at major companies. The reforms of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 focused on the need to enhance the governance, accounting, and disclosure practices at public companies, and the resulting dialogue has focused attention on the need to improve governance practices at other companies. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched significant regulatory reforms and initiatives to address these issues, and the banking agencies have been actively involved in a dialogue with the SEC on matters of mutual interest. The focal point of this dialogue is to implement practical steps to move the corporate governance practices of public and nonpublic companies forward, particularly with regard to the adequacy of internal controls and audits. I want to focus the rest of my remarks on steps that we can take to improve the quality assurance process surrounding internal controls and audits.  Internal controls The essence of corporate governance is ensuring that the company is operated, at all times, in a manner that manages risk, achieves the company's stated operating objectives, and protects the best interests of the shareholders. The Internal Control-Integrated Framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission is the most-often-mentioned standard on internal control at banking organizations. The COSO framework defines internal control as "a process, effected by an entity's board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of: • effectiveness and efficiency of operations;  • reliability of financial reporting; • compliance with applicable laws and regulations."  Based on this definition, it is clear that boards of directors are responsible for ensuring that their organizations' internal controls are adequate for the nature and scope of their businesses and that line management is responsible for ensuring that internal controls are functioning on a day-to-day basis. Thus, the board of directors and management need to have a quality assurance process in place for internal controls. So, how do we know that the quality assurance process surrounding the internal controls at banking organizations is working?  With respect to this quality assurance process, the Federal Reserve conducted reviews of the documentation and support for management's assessment of internal controls and the auditor's related attestations at a few problem institutions that are subject to section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. What we found was evidence that notable deficiencies had crept into the quality of the work performed by management over time as the businesses grew and new products were added. Management became less vigilant in the internal control area because of increased performance pressures. This behavior is actually counterintuitive when dealing with internal controls. As the business grows and new products are added, that is precisely the time when management needs to ensure that adequate controls are in place to mitigate risks. We are talking to the other banking agencies about these concerns and are considering the need for more detailed guidance for management that will strengthen banks' internal control practices.  Internal audit Recent corporate governance events clearly demonstrate the importance of the internal audit function. While Sarbanes-Oxley does not focus on the role of the internal auditor, bank supervisors have long 
 BIS Review 25/2003 3 recognized the importance of an effective internal audit function to the control environment. With respect to the quality of internal audit, the audit committee must pave the way for quality assurance. As we indicated in a recently amended interagency policy statement on the internal audit function, the committee should provide for the utmost independence, objectivity, and professionalism of the internal audit process. The audit committee sets the tone, and our role as supervisors is to reinforce it. The goal for internal audit should be to have no internal control surprises.  To support this goal, internal audit should have an effective quality assurance process. Risk-focused audit programs should be reviewed regularly to ensure audit resources are focused on the higher-risk areas as the company grows and produces and processes change. As lower-risk areas come up for review, auditors should do enough transaction testing to be confident in their risk rating. Audit committees should receive reports on all breaks in internal controls to determine where the auditing process can be strengthened.  Before a company moves into new or higher-risk areas, the board of directors and management should receive assurances from internal audit that the tools are in place to ensure that the basics of sound governance will be adhered to. The audit committee should actively engage the internal auditor to ensure that the bank's risk assessment and control process over financial reporting are vigorous.  Many of the organizations that have seen their reputations tarnished in the past two years have simply neglected to consider emerging conflicts of interest when adding new products and lines of business. It is important to make sure that appropriate firewalls are in place before the product or activity begins. As supervisors, we can focus attention on this area and watch for signs of any internal audit deficiencies at our institutions.  The audit committee should also require the highest possible level of independence for the internal audit process and eliminate any threats to this independence, such as the tendency for some internal auditors to act as management consultants within the organization. Many of the proposed revisions to the Institute of Internal Auditors' professional standards focus on adding value by meeting the needs of management and the board. Internal auditors add value by being effective independent assessors of the quality of the internal control framework and processes. Auditors lose their independence when they perform management consulting roles for which they later will have to render an opinion. Internal audit is one of the few corporate functions that has both the ability and the responsibility to look across all of the management silos within the corporation and make sure that the system of internal controls has no gaps and that the control framework is continually reviewed to keep up with corporate strategic initiatives, reorganizations, and process changes. When an auditor becomes part of management, the independent view is lost.  External audit Let's turn to the topic of quality assurance in the external audit process. As supervisors, we must take steps to encourage a high standard of professionalism among auditors. In some cases, this may mean undertaking an enforcement action against an accountant. The agencies are finalizing the accountant debarment rule, which will be one more tool we can use to correct errant behavior. However, before we do that, we should look at the lessons learned from some recent audit failures.  The typical fact pattern in these failures indicates that some auditors are focusing on the form rather than the substance of transactions when making critical audit judgments. Moreover, when looking at assurance services, such as the FDICIA 112 auditor attestations, some auditors have a tendency to gloss over internal control deficiencies or simply ignore significant control deficiencies because they are "immaterial." It is not meaningful for auditors to apply a financial statement concept of materiality to an attestation engagement on internal controls. From a supervisory perspective, we would consider the existence of a series of such immaterial deficiencies to be useful information in assessing the quality of the internal and external audit process. We need to change this mindset in the auditing community.  Some of this can be done through dialogue with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which we are doing. Once auditors start to routinely report known deficiencies in internal controls, we should begin to eliminate the gap between what we expect an audit or attestation engagement to include and actual services provided by auditors. However, if we continue to find significant internal control deficiencies in safety and soundness examinations that the auditor knows about but fails to disclose, because they are judged to be immaterial, then we should discuss the auditor's lack of action with the banking organization's audit 
 4 BIS Review 25/2003 committee. Furthermore, in appropriate circumstances, we may need to refer the auditor to the PCAOB or subject the auditor to sanctions under the agencies' debarment regulations if the bank is subject to FDICIA 112.  A secondary cause of the audit failures was lax professional standards. Examples in the banking area are the professional standards for attestation engagements. Currently, the standards don't require auditors to perform any independent testing of controls. Under the current standards, auditors can simply rely on the work of internal audit as the basis for issuing an attestation report on management's report on the effectiveness of internal controls. There is virtually no guidance on the criteria auditors should use to issue a qualified opinion. We have long argued that the professional standards in this area need to be more robust. In response to our criticisms and those of others, the AICPA recently proposed revisions to their professional standards to address some of these issues. However, the AICPA no longer has the authority to issue standards or to administer the quality assurance (peer review) function for audit or attestation engagements of public companies. The newly created Pubic Company Accounting Oversight Board has this authority and is just beginning to develop a framework for quality assurance. So, this may take a little time to correct. However, as supervisors, we will continue to work with the AICPA and the PCAOB to ensure that high-quality professional standards are created for public and nonpublic companies and that a robust process for ensuring audit quality is implemented.  Conclusion In closing, I would like to simply encourage all of us to be vigilant about sound corporate governance and internal control processes at banking organizations. To accomplish this, we need to insist on effective attestations on internal controls by external auditors and encourage bankers to improve the quality assurance process and independence of the internal audit function. Finally, supervisors from all regulatory agencies need to continually work together to ensure a consistent, high-quality examination process throughout our banking system. 
 BIS Review 25/2003 1 Joseph O Sanusi: Central Bank of Nigeria's standpoint of anti-money laundering compliance Speech by Dr Joseph O Sanusi, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, at the Conference on “Anti-Money Laundering in ECOWAS: Bringing the Anti-Money Laundering Require in Compliance with International Standards”, Lagos, 3 June 2003. *      *      * 1. Introduction The Nigerian economy has witnessed a serious jump in the level of financial crime since 1986, with the liberalization of the financial sector that accompanied the implementation of the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP). The SAP was initially planned for two years, during which it was projected that all the structural problems of the economy would have been addressed. This, clearly, was too short a period in which to achieve any significant results. The SAP ran through the 1990s, when it was variously adjusted to fit the political agenda of the different military regimes.  The extensive liberalization of the economy that has been undertaken since then encouraged economic crime in general and financial crime in particular, especially of the ‘white collar’ type. Consequently, and in an effort to implement the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (The Viena Convention) Nigeria criminalized white collar crime, through the following pieces of legislation: The Failed Banks Recovery of Property Act of 1994; Advance Fee Fraud and other Fraud Related Offences Act 1995; and Money Laundering Act, 1995. Even though I have been asked to focus  this paper on  money laundering, one of the several financial crimes which has been prominent in Nigeria, to the embarrassment of the Government and all patriotic Nigerians,  I will, in the process, have occasion to say something about the other forms as well, especially as they are often closely related.  What then is money laundering? Money laundering is the process by which criminals or criminal organizations seek to disguise the illicit nature of their proceeds by introducing them into the stream of legitimate commerce and finance.  Money can be laundered through a wide variety of enterprises, from banks and money transmitters to stock brokerage houses and casinos. The illicit proceeds provide the fuel for drugs dealers, terrorists, arms dealers, and other criminals to operate and expand their enterprises. Since 1999, the new management of the CBN has worked extensively to address the issue of financial crimes, particularly fraud in the banking system and other related, financial crimes. Publicity campaigns were mounted through seminars, workshops, conferences and press statements. The CBN has also improved tremendously on its supervisory and regulatory activities, with a strong effort on enforcing anti-money laundering compliance by the financial sector. The CBN has, in recent times, equipped staff in the sensitive operational areas of the Bank with tools that facilitate identifying and tracking the activities of money launders in the financial sector. After the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center, United States of America, the global efforts at surveillance increased, with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) setting guidelines for identification, monitoring and tracking anti-money laundering activities. The FATF and the United States Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) came up with detailed strategies for addressing the menace. These strategies are based on the belief that intensified surveillance will stop the criminals and terrorists using the organized banking services for their funding network, if the operators are vigilant and follow the guidelines established with adequate legislation to back them up.  The FATF at its extraordinary, plenary meeting of 29-30 October, 2001, agreed to develop special guidelines for financial institutions in the detection of the techniques and mechanisms used in the finance of terrorism. The FATF has since come up with the guidelines and has visited countries with poor legal frameworks, such as Nigeria. It has advised and even threatened to blacklist non-cooperating countries, including Nigeria. The goal in providing these guidelines is to ensure that financial institutions do not unwittingly hide or move terrorist and criminal funds.  
 2 BIS Review 25/2003 This paper which addresses the CBN’s standpoint on anti-money laundering compliance, is structured into four sections, with the introduction being Section 1. In Section 2 we discuss the legal framework on money laundering, with emphasis on the recent amendment to the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA). While Section 3 focuses on the areas of concern for the CBN. In Section four we make some recommendations and concluding remarks.  2. The legal framework on money laundering as specified in BOFIA Nigeria took a bold initiative in the 1980s, to enact the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) Act, No. 48 of 1989. This was to set the stage in confronting the menace of money laundering on economic activities, and to comply with the Vienna Convention. Again, in 1994, the Government took another bold step to address bank failure, through checking the activities of money launderers and abuse by insiders in the banking sector, by promulgating the Failed Banks (Recovery of Debt and Financial Malpractice in Banks) Act of No 18 of 1994.  Until then, a number of unpleasant developments in the banking industry, were threatening to undermine confidence in and integrity of the financial system, through facilitating crime and corruption, as well as allowing criminally-minded Bank Directors and managers to retain and savour the rewards of their illegal actions. The third bold step was the promulgation of the Money Laundering Act of 1995 and the Advance Fee Fraud Act of 1995, the latter popularly called “419”, which was to address the offences of obtaining by false presentment, financial sums from victims. These laws, however, were not as effective as anticipated over the years, due to a lack of serious cases of successful prosecution.  Consequently, it became necessary to strengthen the Money Laundering Act of 1995 by addressing its weaknesses, in order to be more effective. The following weaknesses were observed: • Ambiguity in the definition of “Money Laundering”. • The provisions of forfeiture of assets were not far-reaching. • The Act failed to take account of the practice of evading mandatory reporting requirements by the customers of financial institutions. • The provisions of section 6 of the Act, which implied that financial institutions had a discretion in deciding whether or not to report a suspicious transaction, was a loophole for non compliance. • The provision of section 10 of the Act which only penalized employees and directors, leaving out the financial institutions concerned, was an obvious drawback to compliance. • Failure to provide a “safe harbor” for financial institutions in respect of the mandatory reporting requirements was also impacting seriously on compliance. 2.1 The Amendments to BOFIA and the Anti-Money Laundering Act in 2002  Money Laundering undermines confidence in the integrity of the financial system. The amendment to the BOFIA was intended to address the observed gaps in the existing laws in order to aid compliance. The National Assembly, in collaboration with all stakeholders, prepared and proposed the bills on financial crime to the House in December 2002. These bills were: • an act to further amend the Bank and Other Financial Institutions Act 1991, as amended, and for matters connected therewith; • an act to amend the Money Laundering Act 1995 and for matters connected therewith; • an act to provide for the establishment of a Commission for anti terrorism, economic and financial crimes and for matters connected therewith. These three bills have been passed and are now part of the law of the land that must be complied with by all and sundry. 
 BIS Review 25/2003 3 Even though there had been several amendments to BOFIA since 1991, this further amendment in 2002 was to address the drawbacks observed in the anti-money laundering section of the Act. The following provisions were amended to strengthen anti-money laundering compliance: • Section 3 (3) of the BOFIA was substituted for a new subsection (3) which reads “upon the payment of the sum referred to in subsection (2) of this section, the Governor may issue a licence”. • Section 60, had an insertion immediately after section 60A and titled section 60B, giving “power of Government to freeze accounts” as follows: Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment, where the Governor has reason to believe that transactions undertaken in any bank account with any licensed bank are such as may involve the commission of any criminal offence under any Law, “he may make exparte application for of the Federal High Court verifying on oath the reasons for his belief, and on obtaining such a court order, direct or cause direction to be issued, to the manager of the bank where the account is situated or believed to be or, in the alternative, to the head office of such a bank, directing the bank to freeze forthwith all transactions. • The manager of a bank in which a direction has been issued on account under subsection (1) of this section shall, on receipt of such direction, suspend all banking transactions whatsoever, relative to such account, for such period as may be specified in the direction. • Where an account has been frozen pursuant to this section, the Governor shall refer the matter to the Nigeria Police Force, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency or any other appropriate regulatory authority. • Where it is not possible for the Nigeria Police Force, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency or any other appropriate authority to conclude its investigations within the period stipulated in the court order, the Governor shall apply to the Federal High Court for an order for the continued freezing of the account concerned. The amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering Act addressed three major areas of the CBN responsibility providing for:  • The enhancement of the instrument autonomy of the CBN, by giving more power to the Governor of the CBN to checkmate any operations in the banking system that can undermine confidence in the integrity of the financial system. • The need for increased diligence by financial institutions (Financial Sector Surveillance). • The need for customer identification and record keeping to support the process of the court, if the need arises, and that no compromise is encouraged unwittingly. The CBN has, in the past four years, consolidated its efforts in the supervision of the banks, by ensuring that the banks are examined regularly. The CBN has been able to bring together all the regulators in the financial sector, through the workings of the Financial Services Regulation Coordinating Committee (FRSCC), in order to ensure regulatory efficiency in the financial services sector. We discuss in Section 3 below, the areas of concern for the CBN on the issue of compliance.  3. Areas of concern for the CBN The CBN has been given an expanded mandate to regulate and supervise the Other Financial Institutions. In addition to the expanded mandate are the tremendous growth of the banking sector and the new policy introduced by the CBN of universal banking. The number of banks in operation is 89 in 2003. However, the branch network has grown considerably, from 2,220 in 1998 to 2,984 in 2003. Efforts at sanitizing the other financial institutions sub-sector started in 1997 which led to the stipulation of new minimum capital requirements’ for community banks (CBs) and primary mortgage institutions (PMIs), among other things. The areas of concern for the CBN can be discussed along the following three major dimensions: • Identifying financial crime trends and patterns. • Strengthening all stakeholders’ support. • Economic impact of money laundering. 
 4 BIS Review 25/2003 3.1 Identifying financial crime trends and patterns In attempting to identify financial crime trends and patterns, effort must be geared towards monitoring the flow of funds to the banks and establishing an efficient customer identification process, with adequate record keeping rules. The CBN recently issued a manual on “Know Your Customer” principles and practices. The manual emphasized the need to obtain identification evidence from private individuals, pure corporate customers and quasi corporate customers who establish business relationships with the banks. The manual indicated the vulnerability of receiving bankers/agents to money laundering. The manual was intended to serve as a further guide to the banks and other financial institutions in Nigeria on the procedures to adopt for the proper identification of their customers and, therefore, getting to know their customers. Additionally, the CBN restructuring /reengineering initiative (Project EAGLES) has established some level of information technology that is capable of identifying the methods and patterns used to commit these crimes, particularly the Advance Fee Fraud. When the CBN is fully automated, it will provide the unique capability to identify banking sector-wide trends and patterns associated with money laundering and other financial crimes. Currently, the CBN works with the newly-introduced Economic and Financial Crime Commission and the law enforcement agents, on the dissemination of information obtained through state-of-the-art data processing techniques. Going forward in the efforts of the CBN reengineering, it will be possible to expand the available techniques, using leading edge analytical tools for data mining and massaging. From the little effort made so far, the CBN has established the trend of the activities of the advance fee fraud groups and collated information on the linkages and related lead information for analysis. For example, preliminary findings show that in the month of July 2002 when the technology was installed, an average of 150 complaints per day on “419” transactions was lodged on the CBN’s web site, following which information on the activities of the scam groups and advice on what to do was given to the complainants. The number has reduced to an average of 26 complainants on “419” per day as at end of March 2003. It has also been established that most of the crimes were committed using Multilink’s telephone facilities and those of the GSM providers. There were efforts by the police to sweep on the overnight surfers at the internet cafés, mostly in Lagos, many of whom have been found to be perpetrating the 419 crimes.  The CBN also has established that the pattern of the crimes is constantly changing, with a substantial part of the 419 correspondence moved out of Nigeria, using ECOWAS countries telephone and fax numbers. The CBN efforts through joint, sting operations with the Nigeria Police, have resulted in a number of arrests of the scammers.  This technique when fully developed will facilitate the identification of suspicious transactions and the banks and other financial institutions involved in them. Another bold step taken by the the CBN is to inform the banks through a circular that any bank that is careless enough to allow a 419 transaction to go through its system, will be held responsible for the refund of the amount involved to the bonafide claimants.  The CBN has already enforced the provisions of this circular against one bank, and is ready to do it again where it is proven that the bank has weak systems, or failed to exercise due care, that will prevent the 419 transaction from going through. The CBN strategies are as follows: • Work closely with the law enforcement agents to identify and disseminate current trends and patterns of information obtained through the system • Continue to develop analytical methodologies, models and other technical tools that provide additional insights into suspicious activities and transactions through the banking system when the Banking and the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) application software are installed. • Enhance efforts to assist the newly established Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) and the law enforcement agents in tracking financial crimes and their perpetrators through information, workshops, seminars, conferences and bilateral and multilateral cooperation. The progress of these strategies will be measured by monitoring the volume and types of the crimes that are still in operation, knowing fully well that these crimes mutate very rapidly.  
 BIS Review 25/2003 5 3.2 Strengthening all stakeholders support  The CBN in April 1994 undertook to facilitate a formal framework for coordination of regulatory and supervisory activities in the Nigerian financial sector, leading to the establishment of the Financial Services Coordinating Committee (FSCC). The Committee was to address more effectively, through consultation and regular inter-agency meetings, issues of common interest to the regulatory and supervisory bodies. The name of the Committee was changed to Financial Services Regulation Coordinating Committee (FSRCC). The Committee was accorded legal status by the 1998 amendment to Section 38 of the CBN Act 1991 and formally inaugurated by the CBN Governor in May 1999. The Committee comprises the Central Bank of Nigeria (as Chairman), the Securities and Exchange Commission, National Insurance Commission, Corporate Affairs Commission and the Federal Ministry of Finance. In order to enhance the effectiveness of the Committee, the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Nigerian Stock Exchange and the National Board for Community Banks were co-opted as observers. The objectives of the reconstituted Committee were to: • coordinate the supervision of financial institutions; • cause the reduction of arbitrage opportunities, usually created by differing regulatory and supervisory standards, among supervisory authorities in the country; • deliberate on the problems experienced by any member in its relationship with any financial institution; • eliminate any information gaps encountered by any regulatory agency in its relationship with any group of financial institutions; • articulate the strategies for the promotion of safe, sound and efficient practices by financial intermediaries; and  • deliberate on such other issues as may be specified from time to time. The Committee works through sub-committees. There are five sub-committees, of which the Financial Sector Distress Sub-committee has been handling the issue of financial crimes in the sector. The Information Sharing Sub-committee moreover, has had the mandate of identifying the types of information that must be shared among the regulators and the constraints therein. This Sub-Committee is currently working directly with the CBN to build a website for the FSRCC, and to facilitate the development of the tools of analysis. The CBN effort at strengthening the support of all stakeholders is to recognize the fact that to address the compliance issue on money laundering and other financial crimes, support must be given by all the regulatory and supervisory institutions. These institutions must work together to promote the integration of the financial system, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the various pieces of legislation aimed at fighting financial crimes. On a larger scale, the CBN conducts “Bankers’ Committee” meetings every other month to discuss issues of concern to the industry, including prudential matters. This forum facilitates the discussion of global events or developments in general, and their impact on the banking sector, in particular. It is anticipated that the CBN’s ongoing IT programme when fully in place, involving a robust Banking Application and a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System will facilitate on-line, real time transactions, Straight Through Processing (STP) and, therefore, ease the tracking of suspicious transactions. It will, moreover, facilitate the interaction of the banks with the CBN, and the tracking of anonymous and/or fictitious accounts and transactions. On the international front, the CBN is also taking steps to enhance cooperation and coordination with other regulators, such as the FSA in the UK and other parties and institutions that have a stake in the international fight against financial crimes and other forms of abuse of the financial system. A recent example of this international collaboration was the mounting of a seminar on “Know Your Customer” jointly with Commerz Bank of Germany in Lagos to explain to Nigeria banks the implication for their operations, especially in correspondent banking, of the measures recently introduced by the FSA to curb money laundering, terrorist and other financial crimes. 
 6 BIS Review 25/2003 3.3 Economic impact of money laundering Money laundering affects indigenous entrepreneurship, more so with the trade liberalization. Proceeds of drug sales and other criminal activities are used to bring in and “dump” goods in the market, which are sold at prices below cost prices in the exporting countries. The reason being that the drug baron has imported so as to transfer the dirty money and not for profit motives. This situation depresses domestic production due to the uncompetitive pricing of the imported products. Because the return on investment from domestic production and other legitimate business activity will almost inevitably be lower than the high returns made by the money launderers, domestic production is thereby depressed by their activities. This situation affects small and medium scale enterprises in particular, which are the growth target which the Government is addressing. Consequent to this development, foreign investment will decline, because investors will be scared of an economic environment where illicit monies are allowed to play a significant role in the allocation of resources. 4.  Concluding remarks 4.1 Money laundering poses a danger to the health and existence of, not only individual banks but, when sufficiently widespread, the entire banking system as well. We do not have hard statistics to establish the causal relationship between money laundering and economic performance in Nigeria, but we can draw from the experience of some Latin American countries, which were notorious for drug trafficking, as compared to those of Malaysia and Singapore, two countries with the most stringent drug and money laundering laws and, very resilient and stable financial systems. One can safely draw inference from this that stringent anti-money laundering laws, coupled with strict compliance, can greatly enhance the performance of the Nigerian economy. Consequently, therefore, the CBN will continue to ensure compliance with the FATF guidelines, in addition to other domestic laws on money laundering through: • ensuring that the banks report adequately and in time as recommended; • ensuring that the FSRCC incorporates the monitoring of money laundering activities as an important agenda of its activity; • securing the judiciary’s and the law enforcement agents’ cooperation and commitment to ensure compliance; • providing support for the training of all stakeholders in order to upgrade their knowledge and awareness of financial crimes in order to achieve compliance with the standards set by the FATF. 4.2 The Money Laundering Decree as amended in 2002 is a product of concerted efforts by the CBN and other regulators and the National Assembly.  Although the threat of blacklisting the country by the FATF did speed up the amendment process, the CBN and the Legislators were, however, committed to the amendment of the Money Laundering Law, so as to bring the country to the same level of compliance as found in the other jurisdictions. The amendment has imposed immense disclosure and reporting obligations on the financial institutions in their dealings with their customers. In addition, the power of the Governor of the CBN to deal squarely with financial institutions that harbour or encourage money launderers has been enhanced by the recent amendment to the Money Laundering Act. I thank you for listening. 
 BIS Review 25/2003 1 Willem F Duisenberg: Monetary and fiscal policy in the euro area Introduction by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the International Monetary Conference, Berlin, 3 June 2003. *      *      * I would like to begin today by situating my analysis of the current situation in the context of the institutional framework for macroeconomic policies in the euro area. In the euro area, fiscal policies remain under the exclusive responsibility of national governments. Contrary to monetary policy, fiscal policies are decentralised. In this set-up, in which there is a multiplicity of actors, certain rules are indispensable. Rules provide a clear allocation of responsibilities and thereby set appropriate incentives. If they are abided by, these rules create an efficient co-ordination device for budgetary policies within the euro area. In addition, the setting of numerical limits and goals provides clear yardsticks for other policy-makers and the general public to gauge the current and future course of fiscal policies, thus facilitating surveillance and peer pressure. The Maastricht Treaty states that countries should avoid excessive deficits. Important reference values for this assessment are a government deficit level of 3% of GDP and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60%. In addition, through the Stability and Growth Pact, countries have committed themselves to respect the objective of a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus over the medium term. At the current juncture, compliance with the fiscal rules is not satisfactory in several euro area countries, with some of them experiencing or expecting fiscal deficits above the 3%-of-GDP reference value. These countries now have to pay the price for not having sufficiently consolidated their public finances when economic growth was strong. For these countries, there is a need to abide by the Pact and therefore prevent or correct excessive deficits, so that confidence in the macroeconomic framework of the euro area is boosted. However, some of the euro area countries still facing high, or even excessive, deficits are not sufficiently forcefully implementing the consolidation measures needed to reach sound budgetary positions. At this stage, these countries should focus on the implementation of growth-oriented consolidation policies that strengthen the productive forces of the economy. Such policies would support confidence of economic agents and therefore economic growth also in the short term. By contrast, many other euro area countries have already reached medium-term budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus. They can let automatic stabilisers operate freely, resulting in the current economic environment in a deterioration of the headline budget balance but not in excessive deficits. The importance of the functioning of automatic stabilisers in the euro area should not be underestimated. In the euro area, the contribution to economic stabilisation made by these stabilisers is generally higher, on average, than in other industrialised countries due to the high sensitivity of revenues and expenditures to economic fluctuations in Europe. However, we have serious doubts about the efficiency of discretionary fiscal policies. Activist policies may have pro-cyclical effects, given the time-lags involved. In addition, they risk undermining the confidence of economic agents in the fiscal framework and in its stability. As regards the monetary policy of the ECB, let me start by presenting the principle which forms the foundation of the macroeconomic institutional framework in the euro area. This principle is that of a sound monetary policy aimed at maintaining price stability. The ECB's Governing Council takes its monetary policy decisions within the framework of a well-designed monetary policy strategy. Less than one month ago, we confirmed our definition of price stability as a "year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%". We also confirmed our medium-term orientation. At the same time, we clarified that in the pursuit of price stability we aim to maintain inflation rates below but "close to 2%" over the medium term. This clarification underlines the ECB's general commitment to provide a sufficient safety margin to guard against potential risks of deflation. It also addresses the issue of the possible presence of a measurement bias in the HICP and the implications of inflation differentials within the euro area. Let me turn now to the factors which need to be taken into consideration by monetary policy at the current juncture. The first few months of this year were dominated by the uncertainty related to the 
 2 BIS Review 25/2003 escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. This environment, which was also characterised by rising oil prices, was clearly not beneficial for investment and, more generally, economic activity in the euro area and at the global level. As a result, economic growth was relatively weak in early 2003 and expectations for economic growth, at least for this year, have had to be scaled back. The rapid conclusion of the military activities was accompanied by a normalisation in oil prices and a rebound in stock markets. Both developments indicate that market fears of a worst-case scenario of a prolonged phase of acute geopolitical tensions, with negative implications for economic growth, are fading away. Still, the signals coming from economic indicators – mainly the results of surveys on the confidence of consumers and producers – have remained mixed over recent months and have complicated the assessment of the economic situation. In this regard, it remains difficult to disentangle factors which may have a transitory effect on economic activity from more entrenched trends. Overall, the information that we have gathered so far points to the continuation of weak economic growth throughout the first half of 2003. However, we expect some acceleration in economic activity in the second half of this year and thereafter. This outlook seems to be in line with financial market expectations. Let me review some of the factors which have shaped this outlook. First, corporate investment continues to be hesitant. This may be related to the process of adjustment of the balance sheets of corporations, following the rapid accumulation of debt until 2000. The effects of this build-up of debt have been compounded by the significant fall in the value of financial assets from the peak reached in early 2000. There is uncertainty over the size of the adjustment still needed in the euro area corporate sector in order to enhance productivity and profitability.  At the same time, we should not forget that the low level of interest rates that has prevailed for quite a long time in the euro area has helped firms in this adjustment process and should foster a recovery in investment. In addition, the financial position of households in the euro area has remained healthy overall. The stability of the saving ratio in the past years indicates that in the euro area as a whole there is no need for significant adjustments which could constrain the recovery in consumption. The recent fall in oil prices should also support private consumption. As regards the external balance, given the extent and the length of the period of the appreciation of the exchange rate of the euro, some restraining effects on exports of the euro area will be felt in the period ahead. However, we should keep in mind that after the correction which has occurred over the past 12-14 months, the competitive position of euro area producers, measured by indicators of real exchange rates, is now back in line with long-term averages. Furthermore, the effects of the appreciation of the exchange rate of the euro on aggregate demand may be mitigated by the significant improvements in the terms of trade, as the lower import prices will be conducive to a pick-up in consumption. In addition, the effects of the changes in the exchange rate on trade are likely to be more than compensated for in the coming years by the expected acceleration in economic activity world-wide. On the latter aspects I should however not conceal that we also see some downside risks to the global recovery in economic activity. Notably, the possible correction of macroeconomic imbalances in other major economies remains a factor of risk. In addition, we cannot exclude that the SARS epidemic may have negative supply and demand effects, although it is difficult at this juncture to assess the possible implications. What does all this mean for the outlook for price stability? Obviously, prospective developments in economic activity should contribute to restraining inflationary pressure in the euro area in the coming years. In this respect, after a period of rising wage growth, despite a context of subdued economic growth in 2001 and early 2002, we have seen signs of stabilisation of wage growth more recently. The effects of recent exchange rate developments will also make a significant contribution to reducing inflationary pressure, although some of the effects may be visible only with a certain time-lag.  Over the last couple of months, inflation has remained somewhat above 2%. We expect that, after hovering around 2% over the coming months, consumer price inflation should fall more significantly in 2004. Partly due to the high volatility observed in financial markets in the past, but also due to the low level of interest rates, the euro area economy has continued to accumulate liquid assets significantly above the amount needed to sustain non-inflationary growth. The concerns about this situation are, however, limited, at least as long as economic activity remains subdued. The easing of geopolitical tensions and the recent stabilisation in financial markets should support an unwinding of these portfolio shifts over 
 BIS Review 25/2003 3 time. In addition, the moderate growth in loans to the private sector indicates that the growth in monetary aggregates does not reflect internal demand dynamics. Thus, overall, not least due to the appreciation of the euro, inflationary pressures have declined significantly over recent months. This assessment will be reflected in our deliberations on monetary policy. As the organiser has asked me to also say a few words on the "policy mix" in the euro area, let me briefly conclude with some remarks on this topic. I think that the macroeconomic policy framework in the euro area is appropriate to ensure sustained and non-inflationary economic growth. Fiscal policy should contribute to maintaining an environment of macroeconomic stability. At the same time, the monetary policy of the ECB takes into account the fiscal policy stance, as one of the factors which contribute to the outlook for price stability over the medium term. In this respect, an efficient assignment of objectives and instruments, together with a clear division of responsibilities, is in place in the euro area. The policy objectives and the policy execution framework are known to all policy actors. An open exchange of views and information between individual policy actors can assist the overall outcome if this enhances an understanding of the objectives and strategies to pursue them. However, there cannot be any scope for an active co-ordination of fiscal and monetary policies. Such active co-ordination is bound to be ineffective, given the inability of both fiscal and monetary policy-makers to fine tune economic developments. Commitments to ex ante co-ordination between fiscal and monetary policies may blur the responsibilities of monetary and fiscal authorities and ultimately reduce their incentives to pursue their objectives. The economic outcome of such co-ordination is likely to be worse than the conduct of policies within the existing institutional set-up as only the latter ensures genuine accountability. 
 BIS Review 24/2003 1 Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala: The strengthening and development of regional bond markets Speech by Mr Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the APEC Business Advisory Council Meeting, Tokyo, 16 May 2003. *      *      * Lessons from the Asian crisis (cid:150) a local perspective  Thailand(cid:146)s experience The crisis of 1997 brought to light weaknesses in the country(cid:146)s financial sector development and the sequencing of liberalization policies. Prior to 1997, the function of financial intermediation fell almost entirely on commercial banks. They mobilized funds mainly through deposits, which accounted for roughly 80 percent of domestic banking liabilities. At the same time, they held almost 70 percent of total financial sector assets, most of which were in the form of credits to the household and corporate sectors.  Direct financing through the domestic bond market (cid:150) through both public and corporate bonds (cid:150) was relatively small and not well developed. Nine consecutive years of fiscal surplus between 1988 and 1996 provided no incentive for the government to issue regular and substantial amount of government bonds. The resultant limited supply of government bonds inhibited the development of a risk-free benchmark against which to price corporate issues and mark to market daily trading.  The crisis brought to the fore an imbalance in the structure and operation of the Thai financial markets. With financing channels limited to bank loans, Thai businesses faced severe liquidity crunch as the banking sector sharply curtailed their credit operations amidst high non-performing loans and massive recapitalization needs. This intensified the economic slowdown, as highly leveraged businesses and corporates were cut off from their traditional source of funding.    Developing the local bond market  In the aftermath of the crisis, authorities in the region mounted an effort to redress the imbalance in the financial system. In Thailand, development of the domestic bond market was given a high priority, partly because of the necessity to fiscalize the cost of financial sector restructuring and partly as an alternative-funding source to reduce reliance on bank intermediation.  A more developed bond market provides the economy with a more balanced financial infrastructure, thereby diversifying the risk of intermediation across a large number of institutions and market players. This so-called sharing of risks through pricing of risks and trading of risks is aimed to achieve a better structure and balance between bank financing, equity financing, and debt financing. Development of a liquid bond market also provides other benefits. It allows private and public sector issuers to finance long-term projects at lower cost, thus reducing maturity risks. A liquid government bond market also provides the basis for development of other segments of the financial sector that could draw in significant foreign participation (cid:150) including forward and future markets, for example, which are needed to support risk management functions of banks and firms. Developments in these markets will not only make local bond markets a more desirable investment alternative to both local and foreign investors, but would be vital in the development of a local-currency bond market. An active local bond market also supports financial system stability. Holders of bonds (cid:150) in particular commercial banks (cid:150) can make use of these bonds in securing emergency funding from the monetary authorities. An active bond market where securities are marked-to-market on a daily basis will facilitate commercial banks(cid:146) access to emergency liquidity assistance through their sale or the use of such instruments as collateral. This mechanism provides a more efficient and transparent process than the use of other types of collaterals such as land, title deeds, or receivables, which have less transparent market value and less liquidity. 
 2 BIS Review 24/2003 Development of the bond market in Thailand The local bond market in Thailand, like many other Asian markets, has been hindered by a number of institutional problems. The small size of the markets (cid:150) and the resultant low liquidity (cid:150) provided little incentive for active participation by both issuers and investors. On the supply side, a small market limits the feasible range of marketable instruments and their effective tradability. On the demand side, a small number of market players and a narrow investor base provided insufficient demand for private players to act as market-makers. A small number of market players and the dominance of a few players hindered competition and market liquidity.  Thai authorities have made significant strides in developing the government bond market since 1998. A pre-announced and regular issuance calendar for the year is now available to help investors plan their investment horizon. This has enabled the government to borrow at low cost and no longer be penalized for opportunistic behaviour of irregular issuance schedules. The Ministry of Finance now issues on a regular basis Government bonds with a maturity of up to a maximum of 20 years to establish a benchmark rate for medium to long-term debt securities. This has allowed a risk free benchmark to be constructed, and the Thai Bond Dealing Center publishes a yield curve on a daily basis.  The BOT has appointed 10 financial institutions as primary dealers for bilateral repurchase (repo) transactions. This set of primary dealers will be counterparties for bilateral repo transactions with the BOT and act as intermediaries in forwarding liquidity adjustments resulting from bilateral repo transactions with the BOT to other market participants. To further enhance trading in the market and ensure that financial institutions have sufficient liquidity for their day-to-day operations, the Bank of Thailand is in the process of phasing out the repurchase market that BOT currently operates and introduce a full-fledged private bilateral repurchase market.  Future challenges would center around improving the clearing and settlement system. These markets require a minimum turnover in order to function smoothly and cost effectively. A regional perspective: risks from currency and maturity mismatches In addition to developing local bond markets, Asian countries have also embarked on a regional initiative to promote the development of the Asian bond market. Asian countries have long enjoyed the highest saving rates in the world. In recent years regional central banks have also built up a large addition to their foreign reserves. Such a large pool of domestic savings should be channeled into long-term investment in the domestic markets to support growth and development in the region. At present however, the dominant financing tools in most Asian countries still continues to be short-term bank loans, and bond markets in the region still remain underdeveloped.  The bulk of local savings has instead been channeled to international financial centers with a wider alternative for investment and well-developed financial markets. At the same time, Asia is a recipient of short-term portfolio flows that had been destabilizing and highly volatile. These funds have further aggravated the problem of maturity and currency mismatches making the region more vulnerable to fluctuations in international capital movements.  Creating a more stable financial system Developing regional bond markets for Asia: Asian savings for Asian investment Efficient and liquid bond markets in Asia - both at the local and regional levels, would enable the private sector as well as the public sector in Asia to raise and invest long-term capital without the currency and maturity risks which accompany international capital flows into the region. Development of regional bond markets will help governments and businesses in the region reduce currency and maturity mismatches. Aside from providing stable and long-term financing alternatives for businesses and public sector agencies in the region, this would also help strengthen the financial system in the region by making available a diverse choice of alternatives for investment, as well as support economic growth through more stable financial systems in the region. 
 BIS Review 24/2003 3 The necessity to develop a regional bond market While many countries in the region have begun the process of developing bond markets (cid:150) or where they exist already, deepen and widen those markets (cid:150) countries are also looking to promote the development of the regional bond markets in parallel with development of their own markets. Given the problems of economies of scale as mentioned earlier, development of the regional bond markets would offer a more efficient and viable option in neighboring countries until these countries(cid:146) financial systems are more developed and have a more sophisticated market structure in place.  Roadmap for the development of Asian bond markets Over the past year, the development of Asian bond markets has been discussed in various international fora, such as ASEAN Finance Ministers Meeting, the Executives Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), Asian Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).  Development of the demand side, involves promoting the pooling of investor base or the pooling of reserves under the Asian Bond Fund initiative, which has had a good start under the cooperation of central banks.     Work on the supply sides revolves around issues of tax, legal and regulatory as well as accounting and should receive endorsement from the highest levels of government following the adoption of the Chiang Mai Declaration on the Asian Bond Market Development. Demand side development: establishment of the Asian Bond Fund On the demand side, central banks in the region have been working closely under the Executives Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (cid:150) or EMEAP (cid:150) to establish an Asian Bond Fund. Under this initiative, central banks will set aside a fraction of their reserves into a pool that will be invested in bonds issued by Asian governments and government enterprises, with an ultimate aim to provide a catalyst for private investors to consider investment in Asian issues EMEAP has worked out the details and modalities of the operation of such a Fund and will announce details to the public shortly.  Approaches to regional cooperation: work on developing the supply side  ASEAN+3 and APEC are both working on the development side of bond markets, including the removal of barriers impeding the issuance of bonds both in the regional and domestic contexts respectively. In addition, there has been cooperation in setting up the necessary infrastructure for such a regional bond market, including a regional credit rating agency, as well as credit enhancement facilities. Recognizing that the reason that investors have generally stayed away from bonds issued by Asian entities is due to their low liquidity and low credit ratings, APEC is currently active in the design of instruments that can be traded in these markets, through its work on securitization and credit enhancement.    Given that at present, a number of bonds issued by Asian entities are below investment grade, the use of securitization and credit guarantees to enhance the quality of these issues can act as a near-term solution to giving these issues a credit quality acceptable to investment managers, and give them the needed initial exposure to private investors. The introduction of these new instruments (cid:150) which would attain a credit quality acceptable to investment managers by achieving a high rating from international rating agencies (cid:150) would also benefit the international financial community by providing investors with a greater diversity of products and instruments for investment. More importantly, it would enable smaller corporate entities (cid:150) who would otherwise be limited to financing themselves through short-term commercial bank lending (cid:150) to access bond markets and find a source of funding more suitable to their needs. Cross guarantees A means of helping economies with less developed local bond markets to issue debt in the regional market may be through the use of cross guarantees. As part of regional financial cooperation and a 
 4 BIS Review 24/2003 step towards greater regional financial integration, cross guarantees can reduce the cost of funding for smaller economies with lower credit rating through guarantees provided by more advanced nations. The use of cross guarantees will be similar in principle to the use of credit enhancements, resulting in improved credit risk of bond issuances as well as lower funding costs for bonds. But while credit enhancement can be offered by a third party, cross guarantees are made by countries within the region in an effort to collectively develop the region. A number of concerns may arise with the use of cross guarantees, namely the problems of moral hazard arising from any type of guarantee, the resultant price distortion, and the perceived free rider problem of the smaller economies. To lessen the risks that would arise from moral hazard, such a guarantee may only be partial. The problem of price distortion will be difficult to mitigate, given that bonds issued with cross guarantees by definition will not have their total risk reflected in price. However, this in turn will help benefit issuers in terms of lower cost of funding. With regards to the free rider problem, it is clear that a system of cross guarantees will benefit the lesser developed economies most, since they will not be in a position to guarantee any other issuers. However (cid:150) with the spirit of regional financial cooperation for development of Asia as a whole in mine (cid:150) countries with more advanced financial systems may decide to offer these guarantees for a limited period of time. Proposals for development and integration: enhancing market infrastructure  Currency arrangements Issuing bonds under a basket of Asian currencies may achieve a slightly lower cost of funding, given that the currency risk of a basket is lower than the sum of the risk of the underlying currencies. This lower risk should be reflected in a lower cost off capital for borrowers. With regards to liquidity, if bonds in the region were to be issued in a basket of currencies that could be traded in many Asian bond markets, liquidity of such a bond should be better than that of any individual bond. In this regard, deep and liquid bond markets should also reduce transaction costs, making the regional market more attractive than issuing locally. Such a basket of currencies may enhance the natural hedging ability of market participants in each country in the region. Given the importance of intra-regional trade, exporters cold better match the currency exposures of their assets with their liabilities. Cooperative actions needed to facilitate growth of regional bond markets The use of these mechanisms to promote development of bond products must not detract countries from taking serious steps to developing their bond markets. The use of credit guarantees, cross guarantees, or credit enhancements (cid:150) to mention a few ways (cid:150) can only act as a temporary measure to catalyze interest in Asian issues, and at a cost. Such guarantees increase the issuer(cid:146)s cost of funding, and usually cannot be sustained indefinitely. The coverage of credit guarantees, for example, would have to be reduced from a full guarantee to a partial guarantee as markets develop. In the meanwhile, countries must tackle their fundamental problems that are hindering the rating of their issues, whether it is infrastructure, legal, or regulatory problems. 
 BIS Review 24/2003 1 Joseph O Sanusi: A central bank look at fiscal policy management in Nigeria  Keynote address by Dr Joseph O Sanusi, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, at the seminar of the Nigerian Economic Society on (cid:147)Fiscal Policy Management in Nigeria(cid:148), Lagos, 22 May 2003. *      *      * His Excellency, The Executive Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, The President, Nigerian Economic Society (NES), Council Members of the NES, Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Speaker and Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen: I feel highly honoured to be invited as a guest of honour at this year(cid:146)s seminar of the Nigerian Economic Society on (cid:147)Fiscal Policy Management in Nigeria(cid:148) and for an opportunity to present this Keynote Address. The theme of the seminar could not have come at a more opportune time, as the outcome is expected to assist the government in policy fine-tuning and implementation in the context of its economic agenda under the next dispensation. This is in recognition of the fact that fiscal policy is a major dimension of an adjustment programme to ensure a stable macroeconomic environment and improved growth performance. Suffice to say that sound fiscal policy management, predicted on consistency, sustainability, efficiency, accountability and transparency, is essential for accelerating the pace of economic recovery. Since the 1970s, the government has been overly dependent on the oil sector as the most important source of revenue accounting for four-fifths of the total. Consequently, fiscal operations have been influenced by the uncertainties of the international oil market. To minimize the destabilising influence of the volatility in the price of crude oil on government budgetary operations, efforts have been intensified since the 1980s to broaden government revenue base and enhance the contribution from non-oil sources. Federal government expenditure has closely followed developments in the revenue flow, which has given rise to a boom/bust pattern. The rapid acceleration in government spending between 1973 and 1976 was so strong that the increased revenue earnings from oil over the period was more than absorbed, resulting in substantial deficits. It has been difficult to scale down expenditure whenever there was a significant deterioration in the oil market. The result was that government resorted to borrowing from the banking system, especially from the Central Bank, to finance the deficits, with adverse implications for domestic prices and the exchange rate. Like most of the other oil exporting countries, Nigeria experienced a sharp bust of inflation in mid-1970s as public expenditure rose. It is noteworthy that fiscal dominance has been one of the sore points of monetary management in Nigeria, as it has tended to undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy. For most of the 1990s, for instance, the major source of general macroeconomic instability was the rising fiscal deficits of the Federal Government, financed mainly by the Central Bank. In recent times, the banking system has been characterized by the problem of excess liquidity arising from the expansionary fiscal operations of the three tiers of government, and the rapid monetisation of crude oil receipts. The large injections of liquidity into the system induced rapid monetary expansion that was substantially out of line with prescribed targets. A major problem of fiscal adjustment in recent times is the difficulty of lowering the largest components of recurrent expenditure such as wages and salaries, while attempting to raise the level of capital formation. A keen observer will notice that over the past decade, recurrent expenditure has been dominant in total federal government expenditure. It was 67.4 per cent in 2002, compared with 56.9 per cent and 65.9 per cent in 2001 and 2000, respectively. To generate growth, a sizeable proportion of government expenditure should be allocated to capital and socio-economic sectors. Beyond the issue of allocation, the quality of the expenditure remains critical in ensuring efficiency and optimal utilization of resources. In this regard, the Federal Government has instituted the Due Process compliance principle, which is being implemented.  
 2 BIS Review 24/2003 I wish to add that, to be able to measure the effects of policy, the availability of timely and reliable statistics on government revenue and expenditure cannot be over-emphasized. This is also consistent with the principles of transparency and accountability. There is a need for increased information-sharing on a regular basis, as information assymetry undermines policy design and analysis. It is noteworthy that this dispensation has witnessed the return of the Public Accounts Committee of the National Assembly and the oversight function of the Auditor-General of the Federation. These are welcome developments that should be sustained. Before I conclude, permit me to highlight some of the practical ways of addressing the problem of fiscal dominance in order to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. First is ensuring how the overall budget deficit will be reduced and how it will be financed in a non-inflationary way. In this regard, current effort by the Federal Government to access the capital market and restructure the outstanding debt stock is a welcome development. Secondly, the Debt Management Office (DMO) should be encouraged to assume full responsibility for government debt management, thereby relieving the CBN of such role. Thirdly, there is a need to meet the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) convergence criterion, limiting central bank financing of government to 10 per cent of estimated current revenue. Fourthly, the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Act should be rigorously pursued. Your Excellency, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt in my mind that the issue of fiscal policy management is very critical to the successful implementation of our economic programmes. In this connection, I hope the seminar will find time to ponder on the following issues: (i) the need to establish a stabilization fund which will address the problem of revenue/expenditure volatility; (ii) formulate viable fiscal rules which are consistent with our fiscal federalism, and (iii) propose the way forward in addressing the problems of inter-generational equity argument arising from debt overhang. I am convinced that the array of eminent professionals gathered here today will come up with concrete proposals that will enhance our fiscal policy in the medium to long-term. I thank you for your attention. 
 BIS Review 24/2003 1 Joseph O Sanusi: Central banking authority, economic stability and the rule of law Paper presented by Dr Joseph O Sanusi, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, at the Ninth Annual Harvard International Development Conference, Boston, 4 April 2003 *      *      * I. Introduction It is a great privilege for me to participate in this year(cid:146)s Harvard International Development Conference. The theme of the conference is quite relevant to developing countries. I, therefore, thank the organizers for the opportunity offered me to share my thoughts and experiences with you on: Central Banking Authority, Economic Stability, and the Rule of Law.  The world over, the development process is anchored on the pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies that will promote sustainable economic growth, create more jobs, and ensure equitable distribution of income to raise the living standard of the populace. The successful pursuit of these goals requires policies that will promote openness in trade, efficient financial system, increased capital flows, development of information and communication technologies and enhanced technical capability. The implementation of such policies would enable a country to integrate into the world economy and derive the gains and, sometimes, the risks from globalization. The centrality of the central bank in forging the necessary macroeconomic environment for sustainable economic growth and development is generally incontrovertible. The theme for this panel discussion is very appropriate in this regard. The key issues I seek to explore at this forum are: (cid:1)(cid:2)What is the role of the central bank and monetary policy in the development process? (cid:1)(cid:2)What has been the experience of the Central Bank of Nigeria in the development process? (cid:1)(cid:2)What are the challenges and constraints facing the Bank in the process? In discussing these issues, my focus will be on the experience of the Central Bank of Nigeria, in the context of international best practices.  II. The role of the Central Bank and monetary policy in the development process The pursuit of price stability has come to be regarded as the raison d(cid:146)etre of central banks in recent times. The near universal acceptance of price stability as the overriding goal of monetary policy derives from the recognition that, in the long run, monetary policy impacts on the price level and its dynamics. Consequently, policy instruments at the disposal of central banks should be capable of influencing the price level and expectations in the desired direction, toward the achievement of non-inflationary economic growth.  The issue that arises at this juncture is whether the central bank(cid:146)s pursuit of price stability and financial sector soundness is the only requirement to sustain the development process. While the maintenance of price stability has increasingly become the main mandate of most central banks, those in the developing countries are charged with the responsibility to promote economic development, in addition to the pursuit of the macroeconomic stabilization objective.  Central banks(cid:146) direct role in the development process, especially in less developed economies, stems from the absence of efficient financial markets and institutional structures, which are pre-requisite for the effective transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. In addition, in the pursuit of the overall economic goals of the nation, the stabilization objective of the central banker often conflicts with the sectoral pursuits of the political authority. One thing all central banks, the world over, have in common is the maintenance of financial stability as a key factor influencing macroeconomic performance and efficient payments system. The legal framework and institutional arrangements vary widely country by country in the context of the act establishing the central bank. As we are all aware, a central bank is usually established by an Act of Parliament that clearly states its mandate. 
 2 BIS Review 24/2003 III. The experience of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)  The critical role of the CBN in the management of the Nigerian economy has been made obvious by the provisions of the law establishing the Bank. The core mandate of the CBN as spelt out in the CBN Act of 1958 include: issuance of legal tender currency, banker and financial adviser to the Federal Government, lender of last resort to banks, maintenance of external reserves to safeguard the international value of the currency, promotion of monetary stability and a sound and efficient financial system. In order to discharge its responsibility efficiently and effectively, the Bank must have credibility within and outside the country. Towards this end, the Act, with the subsequent amendments, goes further to establish a governance structure with an independent Board with responsibility for policy formulation and administration of the Bank, subject to periodic reports to both the Executive and Legislative arms of the government. Although the original Act mandates the CBN to promote monetary stability, it was in the 1999 amendment to the Act that actually conferred discretionary powers on the Governor, the Board and Management of the Bank, in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy, especially the determination of the appropriate interest rate regime and exchange rate policy. In other words, the Bank was granted instrument autonomy under the amendment to the Act. In view of the destabilizing effect of monetary financing of Government deficits, the Acts specifies the limit of the CBN lending to government in terms of Ways and Means Advances to the Federal Government in the event of temporary deficiency of budget revenue, which should not exceed 12.5 per cent of its estimated recurrent budget revenue. Such advances should be repaid fully by the end of the Government(cid:146)s financial year. Moreover, the total amount of Government securities of more than two years tenor held by the CBN should not exceed 75 per cent of the total demand liabilitiies of the Bank. Cognizant of the importance of central bank autonomy for and the significance of fiscal prudence to the effective conduct of monetary policy, the CBN was actively involved in the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, currently under consideration by the National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The law, if passed, would establish further limits on Government borrowing from the CBN. Under the current dispensation, the effectiveness of monetary policy is often constrained by fiscal surprises. In particular, monetary financing of large fiscal deficits, which averaged 7.5 and 5.6 per cent of GDP annually in the 1980s and 1990s, respectively, resulted in the over-burdening of monetary policy and its effectiveness. This has of course been moderated by the current democratic government and reduced to annual average of 4.0 per cent in 2001 and 2002.  In keeping with the principle of transparency and accountability in the conduct of monetary and financial policies, the CBN publishes its monetary policy objectives, targets and measures for a two-year period. The exercise involves the review of developments in the economy during the preceding year, the identification of the prospects and problems in the years ahead and the outlining of the policy goals and performance targets for the period. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets every fortnight to appraise the performance of the economy and conditions in the money and foreign exchange markets with a view to reviewing the current policy measures, either in terms of adopting new policy initiatives or fine-tuning the existing ones as the need arises. The Committee is made up of the Governor as Chairman, four Deputy Governors and heads of relevant departments as members. Others are two members of the Board of Governors, including the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Finance. In the spirit of transparency, the summary discussions and decisions of the MPC are communicated to the general public in newspaper publications every month. Similarly, another committee, the Financial Sector Surveillance Committee (FSSC) also meets every fortnight to review developments in the financial sector with a view to taking appropriate regulatory/supervisory action that will ensure the stability and soundness of the system.  Moreover, in order to enhance regulatory effectiveness and stability of the financial sector, the Financial Services Regulation and Coordinating Committee (FSRCC), meets to coordinate activities of the various regulatory institutions in the sector. The CBN Governor acts as the chairman, while other members include chief executives of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Insurance Commission, Corporate Affairs Commission and the Federal Ministry of Finance. The Committee works towards minimizing arbitrage opportunities that are usually created by differing regulatory and supervisory standards among the various agencies; deliberates on problems experienced by every member in its relationship with any financial institution, and bridges any information gap encountered by any regulatory agency in its relationship with any type of financial institutions.  
 BIS Review 24/2003 3 The CBN takes its obligation to enlighten stakeholders in the economy on monetary and financial policies seriously. In this regard, the need to communicate to and obtain feedback from the public was instrumental to the establishment of the Monetary Policy Forum, as a medium for dialogue and public enlightenment among the monetary authorities, the banks, academia, organized private sector and other stakeholders in the economy. The Forum was created, bearing in mind that monetary policy works best in an environment in which the views of key stakeholders are taken into consideration in both its formulation and implementation. This initiative is consistent with the global move towards greater transparency and openness in the conduct of monetary and financial policies. The Forum also serves as a medium for educating the public on CBN’s monetary policy operating framework, targets and outcomes. It meets quarterly, while the wider forum, the Annual Monetary Policy Conference, holds every November. Finally, consistent with Section 9, (a) and (b) of the Act, the Bank, from time to time reports to the President and makes a formal report to the National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria bi-annually. Clearly, these processes and structures have contributed in no small measure to the positive profile of the CBN in recent times.  The CBN, like most central banks in the developing economies, undertakes some non-traditional central bank functions such as promotion of economic development, especially during the formative years in the 1960s and 1970s. The contribution of the CBN in this regard, was focused on the creation of the financial environment and institutional framework conducive to the mobilization and channeling of financial resources into productive investment. Thus, during the first decade of its establishment, the Bank concentrated on the task of promoting and transformation of the rudimentary financial structure of the economy. These included the issuance of money and capital market securities such as the Nigerian Treasury Bills and Federal Government Development Stocks. Moreover, it provided technical assistance to other relevant institutions, and start-up capital for the development of money and capital market institutions. The CBN nurtured from the cradle such institutions like the Nigerian Stock Exchange, Securities and Exchange Commission and Nigeria Export-Import Bank. The specialized finance institutions established by the CBN, in collaboration with the Federal Government, included the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB), Nigerian Bank for Commerce and Industry (NBCI) (cid:150) both now merged to form the Bank of Industry (BOI) to provide long-term capital for development. The CBN initiative to encourage long-term bank lending to the economy included the establishment of various refinance and guarantee schemes, focused on the priority sectors of the economy. Two of such schemes are the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF), and Export Refinance Scheme. IV. Challenges and constraints  As central bankers, it is beneficial to evolve the culture of a regular critical appraisal of our performance with a view to improving on our effectiveness and adapt to changes in the economic environment. Clearly, every central bank faces constraints in the conduct of economic policies, some of which create the problem of policy credibility. While some of such constraints are attributable to external factors, most are induced from within the domestic economy. Our experience in Nigeria is not an exception. Trade off in price stability mandate  One of the major problems is policy conflict in the pursuit of the overall economic objectives of government, particularly the trade-off in the pursuit of stabilization and growth objectives. Sometimes central banks are confronted with problems of inflation and stagnation, otherwise known as stagflation. If the central bank sticks rigidly to the mandate of price stability, it might address the problem of inflation in such a way that the fall in aggregate output might be exacerbated. If, on the other hand, the problem of weak growth performance is to be addressed, policies designed to stimulate higher levels of economic activity might result in further acceleration of the inflation rate. The need to maintain a delicate balance between the two conflicting objectives is, therefore, obvious.  Whatever policy mix is adopted, it is bound to influence the way central bank(cid:146)s policies are perceived by the public and the confidence it engenders in the financial system. One of the ways we have addressed this dilemma in Nigeria is to ensure that, in the pursuit of the primary objective of price stability, due consideration is given to developmental objectives. As much as possible, the CBN has avoided direct intervention in development financing, particularly where lending at interest rates below the market rates are involved. The Bank has, in this regard, embarked on schemes to establish quasi-government institutions and encouraged government funding through the Budget. There are 
 4 BIS Review 24/2003 also some relevance in the provision of refinancing and credit guarantee schemes, as earlier outlined, particularly for the agricultural and industrial sectors. The risk is that such schemes could discourage the growth and efficiency of financial intermediation, particularly the mobilization of domestic savings. Macroeconomic policy environment  Economic policies can only succeed where infrastructural impediments to supply response have been substantially minimized. Because most macroeconomic policies (especially monetary policy) work best through their effect on aggregate demand and supply conditions, structural problems could make the economy less responsive to policies. When a policy fails to achieve the intended objectives, it creates credibility gap for the central bank and outright pessimism in the process. Our approach to dealing with this problem has been to enhance public understanding of what monetary policy can and cannot do, while collaborating with other organs of government to ensure the complementarity of the various economic policies. Financial market infrastructure and institutions  The absence of efficient and sound financial institutions and necessary market infrastructure, which are critical to effective conduct of monetary policy and its transmission mechanism, constitutes a major constraint to the achievement of policy goals in most developing countries. Institutional reforms, enforceable tax policy, simplified accounting framework and a fair and efficient judicial system, are important for effective policy implementation in a coherent, credible and consistent manner.  Credible information  Poor and unreliable data is another major constraint to credible policies. The lack of timely and reliable data renders monitoring and evaluation of policy implementation difficult and the analysis arising from such data, less reliable. This undermines the setting of accurate targets and causes delays in policy response to changes in economic conditions.  Fiscal dominance  The essence of complementarity between monetary and other policies, particularly the fiscal policy, has always been emphasized as critical to the effectiveness of monetary policy. In countries characterized by fiscal expansion, resulting from large deficits financed by the banking system, particularly the central bank, the achievement of monetary policy objectives becomes very difficult. Indeed, the outcome of the central bank policies becomes uncertain. This problem has been addressed, effectively, in many countries particularly among those that have experienced intractable problem of inflation, through the prohibition of central bank lending to the government. Efforts to limit the financing of government deficits by the CBN have not been successful, despite its operational autonomy. The problem of fiscal surprises in the country is compounded by lack of control in the expansionary fiscal operations of the state and local governments. Corporate governance For credibility of the central bank to subsist, a widely accepted corporate governance arrangement must be put in place. In this regard, good governance must begin with internal consistency in the bank(cid:146)s operational framework and administrative structure such that the attainment of the primary objective of monetary and financial sector stability will be ensured, while high quality of service to government, financial institutions and other stakeholders in the economy is maintained. Besides, robust contingency plans that will promote the soundness and stability of financial institutions must be strictly implemented. In recognition of the fundamental role of the effective conduct of monetary policy in any economy a central bank should accord special attention to enhancing its efficiency. Towards this end, the central bank must be mindful of the quality of its staff in terms of technical skill, competence and knowledge. Cognizant of the need for capacity building to ensure enhanced efficiency in meeting its mandate, the CBN has in the past three years embarked on a comprehensive reform agenda under which its work processes and procedure have been upgraded and re-engineered. 
 BIS Review 24/2003 5 V. Conclusion In conclusion, I would like to make some suggestions on how good governance can be enthroned and measured, drawing on international best practices. In consonance with the principles of good governance, central banks should be autonomous from government in discharging their statutory mandates. Such independence has often been associated with the powers to limit credit to the government, given the destabilizing effect of central bank lending to finance public sector deficits. Governments should be forced to balance their budgets or borrow at market rates to finance their deficits. Although this might be a problem for countries with under-developed financial markets, the effect in promoting fiscal discipline and facilitating the achievement of growth objectives is deemed to be more profound. An independent central bank should ensure that its policy intervention is well coordinated in the context of the overall government economic policies and objectives. Policy Credibility can also be enhanced if central banks submit themselves to third party assessments, e.g. by the IMF, World Bank, and subscribe to acceptable international conventions and codes on central banking. Such a convention is the 1988 Basel Accord, which established guidelines on international minimum capital standard that limits banks(cid:146) capital requirement to their credit exposure. Adopting such standards would encourage central banks to reform their procedures and processes in line with international best practices. Moreover, accountability and transparency are best enhanced through effective information dissemination. Central banks should periodically subject themselves to public scrutiny on their operations and frameworks. Another best practice that comes to mind is the example of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, where every year, an outstanding economist is appointed and mandated to review the monetary policy of the previous year.  These are some of my thoughts on strategies for enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy in achieving economic stability. I sincerely thank you all for your kind attention.  
 BIS Review 42/2003 1 R Basant Roi: Treasury and risk management Address by Mr R Basant Roi, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the Financial Markets Association of Mauritius workshop on treasury and risk management, 10 September 2003. *      *      * President and Members of the Financial Markets Association of Mauritius Ladies and Gentlemen Good morning. Thank you Chairman for the invitation to briefly address this gathering of financial market participants this morning at the opening ceremony of the Treasury and Risk Management Workshop. As far as I recall, this is the first time that such a Workshop is being organized by your Association for the benefit of its members and for professionals involved in Treasury and Risk Management. Since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s treasury management has assumed an increasingly greater importance in our economic life. With the globalisation of financial markets treasury management has become more demanding than before. Until five years ago Treasury management was not assigned the same importance that ought to have been given by corporate bodies in Mauritius. It is absolutely essential that in today(cid:146)s world efficient treasury management occupies a seat of importance in the management of enterprises. I congratulate your Association for having taken the initiative to hold this workshop. I strongly believe that we should keep ourselves abreast of the latest developments in asset and liability management, risk management techniques and derivative instruments. This workshop is positively a first step forward. I would first and foremost like to make an observation. Treasury management is not specific to banks and other financial institutions. It does concern all of us who are in the business of managing financial resources in a globalised financial market. Enterprises producing goods and services, exporters, importers or any other economic agent that has got to manage its finance necessarily requires expertise in treasury management. In 1999, I was surprised to learn that an exporter with a turnover of over Rs2 billion did not have any expertise at all in managing its own finance. In a world economy characterized by stiff competition, every enterprise needs to be good in treasury management. In the last few years I have stressed a lot on good corporate governance as the basis for best business practices and highlighted the urgency for restructuring and consolidation of individual firm so as to enhance micro-economic efficiency. Traditionally much of the knowledge and skills of professionals in the wholesale financial markets has been learned on the jobs. This approach has varied from the simple (cid:147)Sit, watch and learn(cid:148) approach to the sophisticated mentoring system used by some large financial Institutions. Today treasury operations have grown into one of the key administrative areas of financial institutions, responsible for the processing of all financial market transactions, including a crucial role in the control of risk. Professionals constantly have to re-tool, re-equip and fully update themselves to meet the exigencies of the marketplace. With so much of innovation and technological progress taking place in the world of finance, there is no place for players having limited skills and knowledge in treasury management. The market punishes those who lag behind. One of the challenges in treasury management is to keep abreast of latest techniques and trends in the marketplace and make the most out of them. The biggest challenge for most of our market participants remains the interpretation of economic indicators, changes in policy signals and predicting the course of economic events that affect financial markets. It(cid:146)s tantamount to becoming good crystal ball readers in the money and foreign exchange markets. Treasury Management is also the Management of Risks. With the globalization of financial markets, financial institutions around the world are exposed to a multiplicity of risks. Movements in the rates of interests and volatility of exchange rates in an increasingly complex environment have made the process of managing risks a critical aspect of treasury management. May I however state that my recent experience in the domestic financial market tends to suggest that our treasury managers seem to be acquiring expertise in predicting changes in the interest rate policy stance of the Bank of Mauritius. But a very limited number of treasury managers seem to be able to foresee at times movements in exchange rates. This is quite understandable; it is not in the realm of mortals like us to accurately predict exchange rate movements. 
 2 BIS Review 42/2003 Credit risks, market risks, exchange risks, payment and settlement risks and so on and so forth are all risks that textbooks teach us how to mathematically measure. Textbooks also teach us the various ways and means of protecting against risks. Operational risk however is a type of risk that no financial institution has ever been able to guard itself against. No financial institution or any other enterprises, in particular treasury management units in any of these organizations, should ever dare to overlook operational risks. It is worth stating that many of the lessons learned from those headlines cases cited violations of the fundamental tenets of internal control, particularly those pertaining to operational risks. Lately we have observed that some institutions have been reviewing their treasury operations. The Bank of Mauritius views these undertakings as positive moves towards improving efficiency in management. In any treasury management unit it is essential to have a modularly flexible treasury system, which can adapt to the conditions of a fast moving market. One of the basic tenets for the treasury unit in a bank is the strict segregation of duties and location between the front, middle and back office, the latter controlling confirmation and settlement transactions. You can trust neither your subordinates nor your superiors. Errors can be expensive. Correct your errors. If you do not do so, your errors become fatal mistakes in treasury management. The events of the past two years demonstrate how quickly a corporation(cid:146)s reputation can be tainted by accusations of inappropriate activities or lack of attention to regulations. Success in banking still is heavily dependent on winning and keeping the trust of customers, employees, and the public at large. When corporate reputations are tainted, it does take time to rebuild customer and community relationships. Last year I met with one of the foreign exchange dealers at a reception. I told him that he was taking too much time to become a market maker in our money and foreign exchange markets. Pat came the reply from your friend that Rome was not built in a day. It took time to build Rome. I listened and did not utter any single word. This is an appropriate time for me to respond to that statement. Yes, it did take time to build Rome because they did not have the technology. You have the technology. Go ahead and develop skills in market making. It will serve all of us to have good market makers in our financial system. I am aware that the experts from the Republic of South Africa are competent persons and I trust they will do an excellent job. I wish all my good friends from the Financial Markets Association of Mauritius here the very best of success in their endeavours. Thank you 
 BIS Review 42/2003 1 David Klein: Coping with the challenge to reduce poverty Speech by Mr David Klein, Governor of the Bank of Israel, at the IMF/World Bank Annual Meeting, Dubai, 23 September 2003. *      *      * Mr. Chairman, Mr. K(cid:246)hler, Managing Director of the IMF, Mr. Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank Group Distinguished Governors, Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, The world recognized the need to give priority to the global poverty problem, and expressed a wide consensus on this matter in the Millennium Development Goals. Let me devote my statement today to this subject, and say a few words on the challenges facing Israel in its efforts to reduce poverty. We believe that poverty cannot be tackled effectively if policy is not focusing on growth. Growth is not a sufficient condition for reduction of poverty, but it is, at one and the same time, the highway to raise the living standards of those who are able to work, and the provider of resources to support those who are unable to help themselves. We also believe that in order to realize its potential growth, the Israeli economy - perhaps like some other small and medium-sized economies - has to be open to free movement of goods, services and capital, and to adhere to international standards of macro-economic management, including the standards for fiscal deficit and price stability. Such a framework maximizes Israel(cid:146)s potential contribution to science and technology as a major vehicle of growth through international trade. However, this approach also requires to make our tax regime competitive with that of other countries, which necessarily means to commensurately reduce government expenditures to keep a lid on its debt. Therefore, the macro economic framework constrains the room to handle the challenge of reducing poverty by just increasing welfare payments. When we come to formulate an alternative strategy, we rely on the experience and advice of the World Bank and the IMF and the policies of other countries, like those adopted by the European Union. One fundamental element in our strategy consists of various reforms in the labor market leading to an increase in the ratio of employed persons in the working age population. This is one dimension in which we lag behind the developed world. I need not elaborate here on the significant relation between the rate of employment and the incidence of poverty. A second key element in our strategy is targeting of the policy to reduce poverty. Like some other countries, we have a history of increasing welfare payments without making a distinction between those who are able, or unable, to work, and without applying an income test for welfare entitlement. The new policy of reducing poverty will have to target the poorest and least empowered population, and let them have a dominant role in shaping their future. To evaluate the progress we are making in poverty reduction we add to the traditional relative definition of the poverty line a need-based (absolute) definition of poverty. Once we have a meaningful and measurable target, we will be able to make our policy more effective: to introduce quantitative indicators for follow-up, define legislative measures and budgetary instruments, determine accountability for policy implementation and to make sure that full transparency of the policy making and implementation is in place. Mr. Chairman, The DC CommuniquØ published yesterday stated: Today we renewed our commitment to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to continue our work on implementing the strategies, partnerships and actions agreed in Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg. Israel has been, and will continue to be, a firm supporter of this worldwide effort to reduce poverty. 
 2 BIS Review 42/2003 Finally, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to extend special thanks to the government and people of the United Arab Emirates for their warm hospitality to all the participants of our Annual Meeting and for their generous assistance to the efficient organization of the Meeting. Thank you Mr. Chairman. 
 BIS Review 42/2003 1 Y V Reddy: The global economy and financial markets Statement by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India and Leader of the Indian Delegation to the International Monetary and Financial Committee, at the 2003 IMF/World Bank Annual Meeting, Dubai, 21 September 2003. *      *      * Mr. Chairman, The global economy and financial markets Outlook, risks and policy responses There have been several welcome developments in the global environment since we met in last April. To our relief, several uncertainties relating to Iraq war, impact of SARS and volatility in oil prices have turned out to be short-term and transitory in nature. Hostilities in Iraq have ended earlier than expected. Reflecting the cessation of hostilities, oil prices reverted back to lower levels although they have rebounded somewhat thereafter. The impact of SARS has also been successfully contained. Financial markets, which were in a state of flux, especially equity markets, have also rebounded in many countries. Interest rates in several countries have continued to decline to historically low levels. With the receding global risks, financing conditions for the emerging markets have eased considerably and spreads for many countries have declined significantly. Despite these favourable developments, the world economic outlook continues to be fragile and weighed down by downside risks. Labour market conditions continue to be soft. Data on industrial production and trade growth indicate marked slowdown. Rise in oil prices in the recent weeks is also worrisome. Investment activity in major industrial countries is yet to show a decisive turnaround, although it is heartening to note that signs of pick-up in growth in the US are discernible, of late. During our last meeting in Washington, it was expected that the global recovery could resume in the second-half of the year if the war in Iraq was short. While the growth performance of the Asian region, the Middle East, CIS countries, the African countries and the Latin American countries has shown resilience, in view of the lack of sustained recovery in the industrialised countries, several new uncertainties have arisen. It is not clear as to what extent the US dollar would depreciate and how the global economy would adjust to that. It is difficult to say as to how and when global macroeconomic imbalances would get corrected. Low inflation combined with weak global recovery has increased the risk of deflation in several industrial countries. While faster global recovery may be the immediate global concern, there is also a need to address the structural issues so as to place the global recovery on a sustainable path. In spite of large cross currency movements, misalignments continue to persist in the face of the continued global imbalances. In this context, further easing of monetary policy and stronger structural reforms in the euro area have assumed critical importance. Despite the limits set by the Growth and Stability pact on the permissible extent of fiscal expansion, cyclical expansion may be fully allowed, at least, to neutralise the impact of shortfall in revenue realisation in the face of an economic slowdown. If the sources of global growth are not diversified across regions and if countries continue to rely on the US demand to increase their exports and thereby grow faster, the case for US depreciation would become stronger. Rebalancing of growth dependence, therefore, would be critical to contain volatility in key exchange rates. Several emerging market economies have been contending with the challenge arising from current account surpluses and pressures on the exchange rate to appreciate. Large reserve accumulation by some Asian emerging market economies, in a way, reflects their lack of confidence in the international financial architecture. The improved reserve position of emerging market economies will surely provide (cid:147)self insurance(cid:148), giving the necessary flexibility for exchange rate management. As the duration of the global slowdown becomes more prolonged, fiscal and public debt problem of many countries could intensify further. Fiscal adjustment, though necessary, would have to be weighed carefully and is best calibrated with the pace of global recovery. Against the backdrop of several adverse developments including severe drought, uncertain global environment and considerable hardening of oil prices, the Indian economy performed reasonably well 
 2 BIS Review 42/2003 during 2002-03. The growth rate of the Indian economy at 4.3 per cent, though lower than expected, was one of the highest in the world. This indicates the growing resilience acquired by the Indian economy over the years. With a good monsoon so far this year, a strong recovery in agricultural output is expected. The output for the industrial sector is expected to be reinforced by the renewal of agricultural activity, the abiding strength of export growth and the improved environment for new investments as indicated by a surge in the production of capital goods and non-oil imports. Overall, the economy is expected to perform much better in the current year. The growth process would be facilitated by benign inflationary conditions, adequate liquidity coupled with soft interest rates and strong external sector. As a result of various structural reforms, the Indian financial system is increasingly becoming more sound, stable and efficient. The overall policy environment has fostered macroeconomic stability, and generated optimism regarding the medium-term. The main challenge in macroeconomic management today is reducing the high fiscal deficit and an improvement in the quality of fiscal adjustment. The recent enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act is a step in this direction, which will put in place the institutional structure for greater transparency in fiscal operations as well as a phased decline in the Central Government(cid:146)s borrowings. This will (cid:147)crowd in(cid:148) private sector investments for the achievement of self-sustaining, accelerated growth. Sri Lanka has entered into a new phase of social and economic revival with the return of peace and a wave of new economic reforms. Progress is being made towards consolidation of macro economic stability and acceleration of economic growth. Such policies are being complemented under the Fund/Bank supported PRGF/EFF and PRSC programs. The economy of Sri Lanka is expected to grow by 6 per cent this year and inflation is on a declining trend. External reserve position has also improved. Economic prospects having improved significantly, investor confidence has been growing. The approval of the PRGF for SDR 347 million for Bangladesh in June 2003 is a satisfying event this year. The country is expected to improve upon its already better economic performance, continue strengthening of external sector and make further progress towards structural reforms particularly addressed to poverty alleviation. The country has developed a competent and laudable economic management. The Fund guidance on reforms in a number of areas has been extremely valuable. It is refreshing to see increasing recognition being paid to the non-quantifiable but a critical factor to the Bhutanese development goals viz., Gross National Happiness (GNH). Factoring GNH, at least implicitly, as an objective of IFIs, could be explored. Importance of the Doha Development Agenda As one of the founding members of the GATT (1947) and the WTO (1995), India remains firmly committed towards the multilateral approach to trade relations. India is committed to ensure that the sectors in which developing countries enjoy a comparative advantage are adequately opened up to international trade. The November 2001 declaration of the Fourth Ministerial Conference in Doha, Qatar, provides the mandate for negotiations on a range of subjects. The progress so far has been reviewed at the recently concluded fifth Ministerial Conference in Cancun, Mexico. The conference reflected the diversity of views and positions, particularly in relation to agricultural subsidies and the Singapore issues. We believe that once the concerns of the developing countries are adequately reflected in the discussions, it will pave the way for rapid development in multilateral trading environment. In the context of developed countries there is a need for reduction of high tariff and subsidies to agriculture, providing effective market access, facilitating trade in services, and, whenever necessary, giving effect to the clauses extending (cid:147)Special and Differential treatment(cid:148) to developing countries in the implementation of these WTO Agreements. There is little doubt that potential gains from free and equitable multilateral trading system far outweighs the costs, and, therefore, it is of utmost importance that the international community endeavour to reach a mutually agreed agenda within the WTO framework. 
 BIS Review 42/2003 3 Strengthening IMF surveillance and promoting international financial stability Enhancing economic performance, resilience to crises and financial stability through IMF surveillance A major initiative towards preventing crisis has been enhancing the effectiveness of surveillance, and incorporation of a fresh perspective to the Fund(cid:146)s analysis and policy recommendations. Considerable work has already been done with a view to preventing crisis, including the emphasis on public and external debt sustainability assessment, analyses based on financial soundness indicators (also known as Macro-Prudential Indicators) and balance-sheet weaknesses, preparation of ROSCs and reporting of political economic issues in the staff report. However, several more steps are required to improve the efficacy of the surveillance mechanism. First, the vulnerability assessment exercise for the emerging market economies needs to be improved. Secondly, early warning system models today are far from perfect and suffer from high false-to-signal ratios. As regards strengthening of surveillance, we have come to a stage when we have all the tools available, but there are still doubts about their effectiveness for a variety of reasons. We should recognize that origins of crises in the past were also in the industrial countries and advanced financial centers leading to sudden capital flow reversals. While markets have started to learn to discriminate among countries, there is still a long way to go. Therefore, in surveillance, the Fund has a significant role in building confidence of both borrowers and lenders, which is important for an orderly market behavior. We are indeed happy to note that the Management has proposed an even handed approach to the Fund(cid:146)s surveillance in this regard. Secondly, the fundamental question relating to Fund(cid:146)s surveillance is what purpose it serves and to whom it is meant for. The objective is no doubt to identify vulnerabilities and pre-empt crises from occurring or minimizing severity of such crises, when they occur. Some clarity and transparency about the target of surveillance would be in order. In this respect, the Fund has to take a view on whether the Fund(cid:146)s assessment is meant for national governments in its role as a confidential advisor, or for the market players who in any case rely on alternative avenues for assessing publicly available information. It needs to be mentioned that immediate market reactions to sensitive information may have serious implications on members(cid:146) efforts to address a problem in hand or their plans for addressing an impending crisis. Our view is that the Fund should preserve its role as a confidential adviser and the Fund(cid:146)s assessment should be to help national authorities in reducing the recognition lag and recommending measures that could help in containing vulnerability. However, we are not opposing the dissemination of relevant information giving due consideration to the specific circumstances that members and the Fund are dealing with. The role of the CCL and precautionary arrangements in crisis prevention The Contingent Credit Line (CCL) was expected to play a critical role to serve as a precautionary line of defense, reducing vulnerability and bolstering investor confidence in eligible emerging market economies. Unlike other existing Fund facilities, the objective behind CCL was to prevent crises by making available adequate liquidity upfront to a member with sound fundamentals so as to deal with the pressure of contagion. CCL, however, has not been used by any member so far because of a number of concerns, including: (a) the entry problem - i.e. the fear that access under CCL would convey a negative signal to the market, (b) the exit problem - i.e. the uncertainty about the withdrawal of eligibility, (c) insufficient automaticity, and (d) stringent pre-qualifying norms. The very fact that no country has so far requested the Fund for using CCL resources suggest that it did not serve the intended purpose and it should be allowed to expire in November 2003. While we support the option of allowing the facility to expire, however, if there is a distinct possibility of evolving workable strategies in the near future, we are willing to go along with a consensus for further review. The existing precautionary arrangements could be suitably modified so as to enhance the capacity of the members to prevent capital account crises. We suggest that since the objective behind a modified precautionary arrangement is to prevent a capital account crisis, the access limit under the first purchase must be large (i.e. a top-down staircase pattern of disbursement rather than the present bottom-up staircase pattern) and the performance criteria must be relevant to deal with a capital account crisis (implying less emphasis on conventional performance targets and complete avoidance of the saw-tooth problem). Since the IMF would endorse the policy framework of a country before entering into a precautionary arrangement, repeated programme interruption and subsequent granting of waivers would need be avoided. Overemphasis on (cid:147)safeguarding Fund resources(cid:148) would reduce the effectiveness of a precautionary arrangement by subjecting the programme to performance criteria that would not be critical to deal with the capital account crisis. 
 4 BIS Review 42/2003 Progress with crisis resolution initiatives Efforts are also underway to develop Collective Action Clauses (CACs) to augment a market-led process for restructuring of sovereign bonds. It is heartening to note that rapid progress has been made in promoting the inclusion of CACs in international sovereign bond issuances. We welcome the positive developments relating to the development of a voluntary Code of Conduct to deal with debt restructuring. We urge that the Code should be developed in full and voluntary agreement of creditors and debtors and neither a mechanistic nor a prescriptive or standardized approach should be followed. In recent years, increasing attention has been accorded towards development and implementation of standards and codes to strengthen the international financial architecture. The IMF and the World Bank have taken the initiative to monitor and assess member countries(cid:146) financial sectors as also their observance of standards and codes through Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSCs). In future, ROSCs will help national authorities develop their own reform plans, assess compliance with international standards and codes, and serve, if published, as a signal of their policies(cid:146) enhanced transparency. They will also provide helpful inputs for IMF surveillance and technical assistance. Accelerating poverty reduction and strengthening sustainable economic growth in low income countries Millennium Development Goals, the Monterrey Consensus, and progress with the PRSP approach: the role of the IMF Monterrey has generated consensus on the issues that need to be addressed to effectively alleviate poverty. This consensus needs to be transformed into concrete action urgently. A comprehensive and transparent system to monitor progress towards fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of poverty reduction, sustained economic growth, and promotion of sustainable development would need to be developed. The IMF has attempted to achieve this through two programmes - the PRSP and the HIPC initiative. The PRSP has been instrumental in addressing medium term policy reforms to promote broad-based growth and reduce poverty. The initial experience with PRSP approach underlined the need for (i) improving public expenditure management (PEM) systems, (ii) building capacities for monitoring and evaluation, and (iii) strengthening and institutionalising participatory processes. There is a need for working with other donors for improving the effectiveness of aid in these countries. A strengthened PRSP approach will certainly emerge as the crucial link between national public accounts, donor support, development outcomes needed to meet the MDGs, the operational basis for Fund concessional lending and for debt relief under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative. While an important constraint in improving low-income countries(cid:146) economic growth is inadequacy of finance, this problem could be mitigated by ensuring their access to the private capital also. Institutional change along with appropriate economic policies are most critical. Strong institutions could provide necessary support that cuts across level of economic development, country grouping, and geographical and historical endowments. However, there are genuine uncertainties surrounding as to what constitute an appropriate institutional reform agenda. Keeping in view the country-specific imperatives, it is felt that case-by-case study could be the preferred approach to initiate institutional reforms. This would allow appropriate innovation and adaptation to suit the local conditions. Minimising vulnerability to exogenous shocks The role of Fund Assistance for countries facing exogenous shocks can hardly be overemphasised, given the fact that these shocks can have negative impact on developing countries(cid:146) growth, macroeconomic stability, debt sustainability and poverty ratios. The impressive gains made by developing countries in recent years can be considerably eroded when they face such exogenous shocks. It is a welcome step on part of the Fund to include a systematic focus in Surveillance and fund assistance programmes towards tackling the adverse effects of exogenous shocks, with a view to reducing response delays. Also welcome is the recent initiatives to strengthen existing instruments with the Fund, e.g., Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance, Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF), Stand by credit tranches, and augmentation of PRGF programmes. 
 BIS Review 42/2003 5 We believe that there is a clear need to establish a broad menu of instruments, and apply the appropriate instrument depending on the nature of the shock, based on country-specific requirements. Sufficient flexibility is needed on part of multilateral agencies to meet the financing and adjustment needs of low income countries affected by exogenous shocks. Enhanced financing may be warranted depending on the intensity of shocks. Progress with the HIPC initiative The HIPC initiative has existed for some time, with the prime motive of alleviating the unsustainable external debt burden of low income countries. Despite a commendable coordinated programme of various multilateral/bilateral creditors, HIPC initiatives faced difficulties due to inadequacy of resource, global economic slowdown, delay in implementation of policy reforms in highly indebted countries, and litigations by non-participating creditors for recovery of dues. There is a critical need for recognising country specific constraints and work out an agenda for reducing the debt burden of HIPC countries. However, debt restructuring in these countries must look beyond outright write-off of debt and explore innovative measures such as debt-equity swaps, use of export proceeds to donor countries to retire debt, and stepping up investment opportunities in these countries. Progress reports IMF quotas and governance Recent measures to increase administrative and technical support to the Executive Directors of the developing and transition countries are welcome. However, the present quota formulas do not reflect a position that is truly representative of a country(cid:146)s profile in the world economy. Despite increasing recognition of this fact, the consensus to bring about the required reform continues to elude us. We, therefore, believe that the responsibility rests primarily with the developed countries who, as the majority shareholders, must demonstrate the will to reform the international financial architecture in line with the changed realities. The quota review exercise in future should ensure adequate, equitable and appropriate representation of developing countries. Such a broader representation of the developing countries would enhance the acceptability, ownership and effectiveness of the IMF(cid:146)s programs and policies. While arriving at the quotas, the GDP must be computed on a PPP basis, as this is a more representative measure to define the relative position of a country in the world economy. Lack of data availability has often been cited as one of the significant hurdles to the adoption of the PPP based approach. We suggest that the Fund should work on how this deficiency could be satisfactorily addressed. Combating money laundering and financing of terrorism The Indian government vehemently opposes all forms of terrorism and all activities abetting it. We fully endorse the UN Security Council(cid:146)s Resolutions on combating the financing of terrorism (CFT). We restate our commitment to fight against the abuses of the financial system, including money laundering and terrorism financing. In India, we have already enacted a comprehensive Prevention of Money Laundering Act and there exists adequate legal and institutional framework to address ML&FT. We commend the Fund, the Bank, as well as all member countries, for the adoption of a comprehensive single assessment methodology for AML/CFT. Cooperation among FATF, IMF, World Bank and other multilateral institutions will ultimately lead to more efficient use of resources and a better co-ordination of the policies, taking into account country-specific problems for combating this menace. While we would like to await the full report of the pilot program for detailed evaluation and discussion of the future road map, we have noted the observations made in the MD(cid:146)s report that the assessments completed or underway reveal not only a great deal of priority attached to meeting international standards by authorities but also a wide range of compliance levels. In the countries in my constituency, adequate legal and institutional frameworks to address the money laundering and financing of terrorism are in place. In India, this has been further strengthened by enacting a comprehensive Prevention of Money Laundering Act. This Act had factored in the relevant portions of the FATF-40 recommendations. India, an active member of the APG (a FATF-style Regional Body), has completed and sent in FATF(cid:146)s Self-Assessment Exercise on the Eight Special Recommendations. Membership of FATF is in an advanced stage of processing with the FATF 
 6 BIS Review 42/2003 Secretariat. In order to strengthen international cooperation, exchange of information and outreach, India is also in the process of upgrading its Economic Intelligence Bureau into a full-fledged FIU. We had attended the last two plenary sessions of the Egmont Group with Observer status. Independent Evaluation Office The establishment of an Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) in July 2001 by the IMF marks an important step towards enhancing the transparency of activities and economic policy formulations. IEO has produced extremely insightful reports on the IMF(cid:146)s role in the recent capital account crises and fiscal adjustment in Fund supported programs, providing objective assessments of arguably some of the most controversial and contentious issues related to the functioning of the Fund. We are impressed by the iterative process by which the IEO continues to improve upon the quality of its work, and the Fund, particularly the Managing Director is responding to suggestions and benefiting from them. 
 BIS Review 42/2003 1 Jaime Caruana: Basel II - the road ahead Remarks by Mr Jaime Caruana, Governor of the Bank of Spain and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, at the Institute of International Finance Annual Meeting, Dubai, 21 September 2003. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, It is an honour and a pleasure for me to address the members of the IIF. In the kind invitation to participate in this meeting, two topics were proposed to me, the first being the economic situation and Spain(cid:146)s experience in the euro area, and the second the new Basel II capital accord. I thought that Basel II would be more appropriate, given the very crucial stage we have now reached. But these two topics, the economic situation and the new accord, have suggested to me two preliminary comments. First, while policymakers have long understood the importance of price stability to the health of an economy, in recent years we have all learned much about the concurrent need to promote broader financial stability as well. A number of different episodes of economic crisis and financial disturbance have plainly illustrated the threats that weak financial systems and poorly managed banks can pose to the macroeconomy. This is why I have always stressed that banking regulation should be analyzed not only from a micro viewpoint but also from the macro perspective. Creating the right incentives, consistent with good market practices and sound risk management, appears to be an important way of promoting the safety and soundness of the financial system and therefore a good way of sustaining both the stability and growth of the economy. This is not only relevant for prudential regulation; other areas such as accounting should also be consistent with this broad perspective. This consideration underlines the importance of taking seriously certain concerns such as procyclicality. In my view Basel II goes in the right direction. I am convinced that when banking systems are adequately capitalised, well-managed and risks are correctly assessed within the appropriate time horizon and the financial system becomes more stable, less procyclical, better able to promote sustainable growth, and more resilient during periods of distress. My second reflection is that one of the most significant conclusions of the analysis of the recent economic and financial evolution of the world economy has been the resilience of banking systems in most countries. In my view, this resilience has been the result not just of the presence of sufficient capital in the system, but also of improvements in banks(cid:146) risk management systems. I think we owe the industry a special vote of congratulations with respect to the latter, but we also owe it a commitment on the part of supervisors to continue to support such developments. This is exactly what we are all trying to do with the proposals for a new Capital Accord, which I would like to address now. As you are aware, the comment period for the third consultative paper (CP3) closed at the end of July. If you have seen the (cid:147)comments on CP3(cid:148) page of the BIS website, you will not be surprised to hear that we have received over 200 responses. I must admit that this is more than we had expected, even if it is below the 250 responses we received on the second consultative document two years ago. Obviously, not all of the comments are mutually compatible, nor would it be feasible to incorporate them all. However, there are some substantive issues which have been raised, and I will mention some of these briefly in a moment. But just let me say first that the Committee is taking the comments very seriously and working extremely hard to resolve the issues that have been raised. What is most important to the Committee is the quality and consistency of the new Accord, and we are clear that this cannot be unnecessarily constrained by deadlines and timetables. Michelangelo once said that, having seen an angel in a block of marble, he carved until he set it free. From most of the letters of comment received by the Committee this summer, it seems that the industry sees an angel in the proposals and wants to carve away at the text until it(cid:146)s been set free. Indeed, even among the most critical of respondents we had support for the Committee(cid:146)s three pillars and its intent to align capital more closely to risk; to introduce greater consistency in the supervisory review of capital adequacy; and to promote effective market discipline by enhancing transparency. It 
 2 BIS Review 42/2003 was, moreover, satisfying for us that most commentators acknowledged substantial improvements in the proposals since the release of the second consultative paper in early 2001. Respondents have raised a large number of issues for consideration, including several that address some very fundamental concepts and many that have been debated throughout the entire process. In addition, some member jurisdictions will continue to receive responses through their national rule-making processes up until late autumn of this year, during which time we can expect to hear additional views on the proposals. For those of you who have not yet managed to make it through all of the responses posted on the BIS website, I would like to mention some of the most common issues which have been raised. First of all, the complexity of the proposals. This has also been raised in the past, and is, I think, a valid concern. At the same time, we mustn(cid:146)t forget that many of the areas of the new Accord have expanded in size and complexity precisely as a response to calls from the industry for different types of business to be more finely reflected. Another key issue, mentioned in many comments, is the need to maintain a level playing field. The Committee is very conscious of this matter, and I will say something about our efforts in this respect a little later. Finally in relation to the general issues raised in the comments, I would mention fears of over-conservatism in the proposals when taken as a whole. I would like also to pick out a few of the more technical comments on CP3. For example, one issue, a high-level issue, which has also received a lot of attention, is the calibration of capital requirements to expected and unexpected losses. We have also received many comments on the securitisation proposals, on the issue of (cid:147)double default(cid:148), on the incentive structure and on the recognition of insurance within the operational risk proposals. After five years of work, the process has reached a critical stage. Leading market participants and supervisors alike have long understood that sophisticated banks have (cid:147)outgrown(cid:148) the 1988 Accord and are in need of a more refined regulatory capital regime, and we have all worked extremely hard to achieve this. So it is important to finalise the new Accord, and open the way to its effective implementation. To that end, as I have already said, we appreciate the candour and thoughts that members of the IIF and other institutions have shared with the Committee and its working groups over the years. We are studying your latest letters and suggestions carefully. As you will have gathered from my earlier summary, many comments have focused, as in the past, on the minimum requirements laid out in Pillar 1, but as we get closer to finalisation, comments about implementation are becoming more important. I would like to take a few minutes now to talk about these other aspects of the New Accord that deserve equal consideration. Let me address four specific issues: (cid:1)(cid:2)Pillar 2 and consistency (cid:1)(cid:2)Home / host implementation issues on a world-wide basis (cid:1)(cid:2)Accounting Standards and Basel II (cid:1)(cid:2)The recognition of diversification Pillar 2 and consistency On the first of these subjects, as you well know, the innovation of the New Accord does not rest solely on the refinements to the quantitative measures of risk. Another innovation, and one of the most beneficial, is the incorporation of supervisory review into the international framework. This represents a real breakthrough for all of us, since supervisors in each jurisdiction have until now found their own ways to evaluate the adequacy of a bank(cid:146)s capital base. That is an unsatisfactory solution since it can lead to inconsistencies in the way that a global banking organisation(cid:146)s operations are supervised at a local level. By incorporating into the New Basel Accord the requirement for supervisors to evaluate the internal processes behind a bank(cid:146)s view of its need for capital, the Committee expects that bankers and supervisors will engage in a more focused discussion of risk management. Pillar 2 recognises that national supervisors may have different ways of entering into such discussions and provides flexibility to accommodate those differences. At the same time, Pillar 2 will ensure that supervisors share insight 
 BIS Review 42/2003 3 into their approaches with others and will foster a better understanding among supervisors and bankers about the differences in national regulatory practices. Over time, discussions among supervisors will undoubtedly improve our understanding of each other(cid:146)s processes and promote information sharing and cooperation among regulatory agencies. Consequently, Pillar 2 should help us to reduce the supervisory burden on globally active banking organisations and foster more consistent supervisory approaches and practices across national borders. This corresponds directly to the mandate of the Committee(cid:146)s Accord Implementation Group, or (cid:147)AIG(cid:148). The AIG was set up at the end of 2001 under the Chairmanship of Nick Le Pan of the Canadian Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, and Vice-Chair of the Committee. The group comprises high-level supervisors from member countries, who share planned approaches to implementation. The intention is that this exchange of information should enhance the consistent application of the New Accord and thereby promote a level playing field - which we all agree is an important objective. In this sense, the AIG has a practical focus, while policy issues remain the responsibility of the Committee itself. Home / host implementation issues on a world-wide basis. This brings me to the second topic on my list, which is home/host implementation issues. As part of the Committee(cid:146)s general efforts in recent years to enhance its relationships with supervisory agencies outside its member countries, the AIG has itself begun a dialogue with other supervisory agencies. In fact, based on the AIG(cid:146)s early discussions, the Committee published a paper in August on the (cid:147)high level principles for the cross-border implementation of the New Accord(cid:148). In this document, we reiterate our view that home and host supervisors will retain their traditional responsibilities in regulating internationally active banks under the New Accord. Nonetheless, the revised capital framework will require an even higher level of cooperation among supervisors. Let me mention areas such as the initial approval and validation of (cid:147)advanced(cid:148) approaches to credit and operational risk under Pillar 1; the supervisory review process under Pillar 2; and ongoing assessments of compliance with the requirements for the use of (cid:147)advanced(cid:148) approaches. Although supervisors must make practical arrangements to carry out these responsibilities, the Committee wishes to implement the New Accord in a manner that strengthens the quality of supervision across all countries. Moreover, we recognise the special role we can play in helping to ensure that all host supervisors, and especially those from emerging market countries, are able to supervise the local operations of foreign banks effectively. We will continue to work with emerging market supervisors and the World Bank and IMF, as well as with the Financial Stability Institute and others to exchange ideas on ways to strengthen the regulation of both domestic and internationally active banks. A key question for many supervisors, and particularly for our colleagues in emerging market jurisdictions, is whether the New Accord represents the next step to take. The Committee(cid:146)s view has always been that the fundamentals come first. It is only after a solid foundation for a sound banking and regulatory system is in place that anyone should contemplate the more sophisticated requirements of the New Accord. Over time, it is our hope that more and more countries will adopt the new framework, but not before they are ready. The better capitalised and the better managed that all banking systems are worldwide, the more resistant the global financial system will become to periods of distress. For this reason, the Committee developed a (cid:147)simplest standardised approach(cid:148) during the consultations leading up to CP3. This approach has been developed with the assistance of some of our non-G10 colleagues. More recently, we have developed guidance to assist non-G10 supervisors in making decisions about adoption of Basel II and to help them achieve the transition in the way best suited to their national circumstances. Emerging market supervisors have welcomed both the simplest standardised approach and the transition guidance. And we will do more in this regard. We are currently considering how we might best enhance and upgrade our structures for co-operation with non-G10 countries at the Committee level. 
 4 BIS Review 42/2003 Accounting Standards and Basel II I would like to turn now to the third topic on my list. One trend in the market environment that we must track concerns the increasing harmonisation in accounting rules and practices internationally. The IIF has quite correctly noted the need to align the supervisory framework more closely with the emerging framework for harmonised accounting guidelines. A greater (cid:147)meeting of the minds(cid:148) is warranted especially now that the New Basel Accord includes explicit disclosure requirements intended to promote greater insight into a bank(cid:146)s risk profile. Yet as the Institute(cid:146)s comment letter reminds us, there are also other areas of the New Accord, such as its treatment of provisions and the valuation of financial instruments, where supervisors and accounting professionals should continue to work toward convergence. We think that In order to contribute to financial stability, accounting standards should be consistent with sound risk management and control practices in banks and should facilitate market discipline. The Committee has, therefore, attached great importance to taking an active role in the international debates on accounting and to promoting the supervisory perspective on key accounting issues. The Committee has consulted extensively with representatives of the accounting profession and this dialogue will continue. I should add that we are interested in pursuing new opportunities for discussion on issues of mutual concern with accounting-standard-setting bodies and private sector accounting professionals. In this respect, we very much welcome your initiative to enhance this important dialogue. Recognition of diversification An area of change that capital rules must mirror is the constantly evolving state of the art in risk management. The 1988 Accord became outdated to a large extent because it was a relatively simple and static document: its one-size-fits-all approach to capital regulation represented an important advance as a universally accepted standard, but it did not provide a means to recognise more advanced risk measurement techniques. It quickly fell behind as the pace of innovation in technology, financial products, and markets accelerated. In response, the Committee designed the New Accord to be a more flexible document and one that would be more welcoming of improvements in risk management techniques. Its evolutionary approaches to credit risk and to operational risk, for example, give banks a range of options to choose from and create explicit incentives for banks to strive to adopt the most advanced approaches. The New Accord still has its limits, however. Members of the IIF and others have cited as an example the failure to recognise use of full credit risk models, which would adjust a bank(cid:146)s capital requirements in accordance with the benefits of diversification in its balance sheet. As you know, the Committee evaluated proposals that would have allowed advanced banks to estimate the degree to which their assets might behave similarly or default together. For the time being, we have decided instead to establish standard estimates of diversification that banks would apply. I know that many members of the IIF have accepted that choice as prudent for now, but you have also cautioned us that this decision is incompatible with the existing treatment of market risk and the emerging practices in operational risk management. We know that some banks are making commendable progress in thinking about ways to estimate the value of diversification. Nonetheless, we remain concerned about the degree of confidence one might have in those estimates, given the relative lack of data available on which to base them. Furthermore, we are concerned that it would be difficult for third parties to validate any estimates at this time. Finally, we are not convinced about the consistency of application of these diversification effects. For example we are not certain that any leading bank today consistently adjusts the value of all of its assets based on each asset(cid:146)s contribution to diversification. Portfolio theory suggests that an obvious next step to further enhance the risk-sensitivity of the capital framework would be to incorporate calculations of diversification benefits into the framework. In the coming years, and we can start very soon, we look forward to working with banks, with banking associations such as the IIF, and with academics and researchers to find ways to move Basel in the direction of full credit risk models, and to harness other improvements in risk measurement and management practices. 
 BIS Review 42/2003 5 As we consider the long-term view, we should not lose sight of the fact that we are just at the beginning. The New Accord represents another important milestone in the adoption of more advanced risk measurement and management practices. But to remain robust and relevant to the demands of twenty-first century banking, our capital regulations must keep pace with changes in the market environment and with the state of the art in risk management. On that note, I would like to emphasise the importance of research and debate in promoting the safety and soundness of the financial system. The Basel Committee owes a debt of gratitude to the studies and efforts undertaken by economists, risk management professionals, and researchers in both the public and private sectors as we have sought ways to refine the proposals. We know that your work has helped to inform ours. The future evolution of the Accord will be dependent on input and contribution from the industry, and I look forward to continuing our healthy and fruitful exchange of views. In closing my remarks today, I would like to stress again the Committee(cid:146)s commitment to having a balanced Accord of the highest quality. Although we are encouraged by the general support for the proposals shown through the CP3 process, we recognise that there are some high-level issues still to be addressed and we are working hard to find the best ways to resolve them. I should also stress that no formal decisions have yet been taken in this respect. As you probably know, the Committee will meet next month for the first time since the comment period closed. I can assure you that we will continue to do our utmost to ensure that you - the industry - can take advantage of the benefits of the new Accord at the earliest possible opportunity. Thank you for your attention. 
 BIS Review 40/2003 1 Bank of Japan(cid:146)s September report of recent economic and financial developments1 Bank of Japan, 16 September 2003. *      *      * The Bank(cid:146)s view2 Economic activity still continues to be virtually flat as a whole, although signs of improvement have been observed in such areas as the environment for exports. With regard to final demand, business fixed investment is recovering gradually. Meanwhile, private consumption continues to be weak, housing investment remains sluggish, and public investment is declining. Net exports are virtually flat.  Industrial production continues to be basically level in response to these developments in final demand, and corporate profits are on a moderate uptrend. As for the employment situation, although the number of regular employees continues to decline, the total number of employees including both regular and non-regular employees has stopped falling. The pace of decline in wages has also slowed, and thus the decline in household income is gradually coming to a halt. However, the unemployment rate continues to be high, and hence the employment and income situation of households overall still remains severe. Turning to the economic outlook, with respect to overseas economies, the likelihood is gradually increasing that the growth rate of the U.S. economy will accelerate and that the East Asian economies as a whole will resume a growth trend. Hence, exports and industrial production are likely to turn up gradually.  With respect to domestic demand, public investment is projected to follow a declining trend, and private consumption is likely to remain weak for some time since the employment and income situation is unlikely to improve markedly. Meanwhile, the recovery trend in business fixed investment is expected to become clearer in the period ahead, mainly in large manufacturing firms, whose investment has been thus far significantly restrained despite the recovery in their profits. However, as long as the pace of increase in exports and production continues to be gradual, the recovery in business fixed investment is likely to remain moderate.  Overall, with the recovery in overseas economies, the uptrend in exports and production will resume gradually, which in turn will initiate the momentum for an economic recovery in Japan. However, a self-sustaining recovery in domestic demand is unlikely to gain momentum for some time due to persisting downward pressures from structural adjustments, such as firms(cid:146) reduction of excess debt and labor costs. In addition, as for the outlook for the environment for exports, there still remains uncertainty overall, as the employment situation in the United States continues to be sluggish and the pace of recovery in some East Asian economies such as South Korea is slow. On the domestic side, continued attention should be paid to the developments in financial markets such as the volatile movements in long-term interest rates.  On the price front, import prices have recently stopped declining, reflecting the uptrend in international commodity prices, especially crude oil prices. Under these circumstances, domestic corporate goods prices are more or less flat, which is also partly due to the rise in tobacco tax. Meanwhile, corporate services prices continue a year-on-year decrease of slightly over 1 percent. Consumer prices also continue to decline, but the year-on-year rate of decrease has diminished to 0.2 percent due to special factors, such as the rise in medical treatment costs in April in line with the reform of the medical insurance system and the rise in tobacco tax in July.                                                        1 This report is based on data and information available at the time of the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting held on September 11 and 12, 2003. 2 The Bank(cid:146)s view of recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on September 11 and 12, 2003 as the basis for monetary policy decisions. 
 2 BIS Review 40/2003 Looking at the conditions influencing price developments, the outlook for import prices is unclear at present because it largely depends on developments in the foreign exchange rate. Turning to the domestic side, the basic conditions surrounding prices, such as the supply-demand balance in the macroeconomy, technological innovations, streamlining of distribution channels, and pricing strategies of firms, are unlikely to change significantly for the time being. Under these circumstances, domestic corporate goods prices are likely to remain more or less flat for the time being. Consumer prices are basically projected to continue falling at the current moderate pace on a year-on-year basis, although there are possibilities that the rate of decline may temporarily diminish further depending on future special factors.  As for the financial environment, the outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank of Japan is moving at the 29-30 trillion yen level, as the Bank has been providing ample liquidity. Under these circumstances, the overnight call rate continues to move at around zero percent. Interest rates on term instruments remain steady. Meanwhile, interest rates on Euroyen futures are recently declining gradually after rising noticeably from late August. Yields on long-term government bonds rose rapidly reflecting an improved outlook for Japan(cid:146)s economy, and are recently moving in the range of 1.4-1.6 percent. Meanwhile, yield spreads between private bonds (bank bonds and corporate bonds) and government bonds are widening slightly after the rebound in long-term interest rates. Stock prices have been rising sharply as foreign investors continue to invest in Japanese stocks. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average is recently moving at around 10,500 yen. In the foreign exchange market, the yen appreciated as foreign investors continued to invest in Japanese stocks. The yen is currently traded in the range of 116-118 yen to the U.S. dollar.  With regard to corporate finance, private banks remain cautious in extending loans to firms with high credit risks, while they continue to be more active in extending loans to blue-chip companies. Their lending attitudes seem to be becoming slightly more accommodative in areas such as terms and conditions for lending. Meanwhile, the lending attitudes of financial institutions as perceived by firms in general are improving somewhat, although those perceived by small firms remain severe. In the corporate bond and CP markets, the issuance spreads remain steady and the favorable issuing environment is virtually unchanged on the whole, especially for firms with high credit ratings, although some firms seem to be taking a wait-and-see stance in the corporate bond issuance market in view of the rise in long-term interest rates. Credit demand in the private sector continues to follow a downtrend mainly because firms(cid:146) cash flow remains above business fixed investment and firms are continuously reducing their debts. Amid these developments, private banks(cid:146) lending continues to decline at around 2 percent on a year-on-year basis. The amount outstanding of corporate bonds issued is around the previous year(cid:146)s level.  Meanwhile, according to business surveys, financial positions of firms in general are improving slightly, although those of small firms remain severe. The year-on-year growth rate of the monetary base continues to be around 20 percent. The year-on-year growth rate of the money stock rose slightly and is at around 2 percent.  Funding costs for firms continue to be at extremely low levels on the whole. Against the above background, the financial developments are summarized as follows. Money market conditions continue to be extremely easy. Meanwhile, long-term interest rates and stock prices are rising. Growth rates of the money stock and the monetary base relative to economic activity remain high. In corporate finance, the favorable issuing environment of corporate bonds and CP is virtually unchanged on the whole, especially for firms with low credit risks. However, there has been no significant change in the severity of fund-raising environment for firms, particularly with firms with high credit risks. Developments in the financial and capital markets, the behavior of financial institutions, and the situation of corporate finance continue to require close monitoring. 
BIS Review 40/2003 1 Glenn Stevens: Economic conditions and prospects Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Australian Business Economists and the Economic Society of Australia (NSW Branch), Sydney, 17 September 2003. *      *      * Thank you to the Australian Business Economists and the Economic Society for the invitation to speak to you today. It is a pleasure to renew my association with both groups, which goes back many years.  As the title of my address indicates, I intend to offer an update of our thinking about recent economic performance and prospects for the period ahead. I(cid:146)ll begin by taking stock of the international scene, and then move on to the Australian economy. I will then, having set the context, make a few comments about recent monetary policy issues.  The global economy The world economy, and particularly the group of large industrial countries, has performed weakly for the past three years or so.  Much attention has, as always, focussed on the US. The characteristics of this particular episode in the US are well known: a very large share price boom and bust; a capital investment boom, which then broke sharply, after views about the likely return on investment changed dramatically; a stabilising role played by the US household sector, which has been prepared to borrow and spend; and periodic shocks to confidence resulting from terrorist acts, war and so on. The outcomes might have been much worse, but for exceptionally large monetary and fiscal policy stimulus applied by the US authorities, and the fact that holdings of assets whose prices declined were not highly leveraged. In fact, given the magnitude of the events, the US economy has done well to perform the way it has. Outcomes for the world economy might have been better, on the other hand, had global demand not been so dependent on the US. Unfortunately, Japan and Europe also relapsed into weakness in 2001. In the case of the euro area, performance has been less convincing than that of the US over the past couple of years. Mainland Europe shared some of the business cycle problems of the US but had neither the same degree of supply-side dynamism, nor the same scope for expansionary policy action, to aid recovery. Japan, as we all know, has struggled for some years to deal with financial imbalances, deflationary pressure, supply-side inflexibility, and political stalemate regarding remedial measures. China, on the other hand, has increasingly been an important force in the world economy. It is probably reaching the point of equality with Japan, about now, in terms of its size in international trade. China(cid:146)s growing economic importance is evident in the data, and also in the way in which the renminbi exchange rate is becoming an important political issue - just like the yen. Against that general backdrop, assessments of the near-term outlook for the global economy have undergone some important changes over the past eighteen months. Through the first half of 2002, indications of strengthening growth saw hopes rising for better times, only to be disappointed in the second half of the year. Activity remained sluggish and confidence took a hit from the aftershocks of the bubble, in the form of, inter alia, accounting and governance scandals (that is, some of the sorts of things which emerge after every period of excess).  During the first half of 2003, growth and confidence were still at a rather low ebb. Things which did not help confidence were the anticipation of war in Iraq, and the associated rise in oil prices. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was also very damaging to a part of the international business scene still struggling with the effects of earlier shocks. Then there was the spectre of deflation. It(cid:146)s understandable that this would be a concern, since inflation rates were already below zero in a few countries, and low to very low in most others. A period of below-par growth was likely, if anything, to push inflation down further. My own views about the way we should think about deflation were given nearly a year ago. I thought that it was possible that a few more countries could experience deflation briefly, but that the likelihood of widespread, protracted and corrosive deflation was low, at least absent a significant policy error. Nonetheless, since prudent central banks operate on the logic of least regret, some of them had to give attention to the issue, just 
2 BIS Review 40/2003 in case, and they did so during the past nine months. The US Federal Reserve, in particular, made it clear that it wanted to err on the side of ease, since even a low probability of inflation falling (cid:145)too far(cid:146) was something to be resisted, and openly discussed measures that could be employed were interest rates to reach the zero lower bound. The Iraq war was over quickly and its direct economic effects have been expansionary for the US economy in recent months. But all these accumulated worries affected perceptions of the outlook through to mid year.1 The clearest indication of this was that bond markets pushed down yields to levels not seen in decades. There were some special factors in operation but, even allowing for those, the tone of bond markets in May and June can only be described as particularly pessimistic. There also seemed to be some uncertainty, even if only briefly, about the US Administration(cid:146)s intentions for the US dollar. Given the rapid rise against the US dollar of the Australian dollar during that period, this caught our attention. There was a period, in other words, when it was not that hard to imagine a rather nasty international outcome - one where the fear of deflation in the US and elsewhere, regardless of how well based it was, could affect behaviour, and where the US dollar could be moving rapidly downwards, exporting any deflation pressure to other countries, including Australia. While the probability of this scenario was still not that high, it seemed to be increasing, to the point where it caused us some discomfort. Readers of the Governor(cid:146)s 6 June remarks to the House Economics Committee could see quite clearly the degree of concern at that time. We can all feel some genuine relief that things have looked better since. After a weak early part of the year, the US economy is doing much better in the second half. SARS had a big, but temporary, impact in east Asia, but relatively little impact elsewhere. East Asia is now recovering quickly from that. China continues to grow rapidly. The US economy, while experiencing very low inflation, has not slipped into deflation, and some countries which have experienced deflation seem to be experiencing a bit less of it now (e.g. China). Japan has, I think it is fair to say, surprised most people with solid growth over recent quarters. The euro area remains the weakest of the major regions, although there are tentative signs of improving conditions there in some of the most recent survey data.  For the first time in a while, consensus forecasts for world growth are edging higher, not lower. Financial market pricing also clearly has retreated from the pessimism in May and June: the exceptionally low bond rates have risen to being simply quite low. Share markets had already turned somewhat more optimistic earlier, and have remained so. While we could argue about the extent to which future profits growth in the US is required to validate current pricing, what seems in little doubt is that actual profits in the US have recovered quite strongly to date. That is testimony to the capacity of the US corporate sector to respond aggressively to problems, which is ultimately a source of dynamism for the US economy. Finally, after a very strong upward trend earlier in the year, the Australian dollar has traded fairly steadily in recent times. None of this is to say that the world economy is completely out of danger. Things could still go wrong while ongoing adjustments continue. There could be new shocks. Or the US expansion might wane if the growth in demand and output does not find some reflection in higher employment, thus starving the system of some of the fuel for further expansion in demand. Even if things are proceeding well, we will inevitably see the odd patch of weak data. Once the danger of excessive near-term weakness is past, moreover, there will be issues to address - like the long-term trend in government finances in a number of countries. But these sorts of caveats apply in every cycle, to some degree. The fact remains that things look better than they did three or four months ago, and noticeably better than we feared, at that time, they might look by now. That we are now talking about whether the pick-up extends into 2004, rather than whether it is occurring at all, is welcome progress.                                                        1 The bigger issue has always been, and remains, the nature of the peace. This will probably cost more than the war and presumably adds to uncertainty about the medium-term economic outlook, but seems not to affect short-run perceptions in the same way as actual conflict. 
BIS Review 40/2003 3 The Australian economy The Australian economy has been significantly affected by the weakness in the world scene over the past few years. This is most evident in the trends in exports. In the June quarter of 2003, aggregate export volumes were about 2 per cent lower than in the middle of 2000 (just before the Olympics spike). This is a series which in the 1990s grew at an average rate of 7‰ per cent per year. If that is a crude gauge of (cid:145)normal(cid:146) performance, there was an export volume shortfall of over 20 per cent by the middle of this year. That(cid:146)s over 5 per cent of GDP, which is a much more substantial effect than seen in the Asian crisis. Why was the effect bigger on this occasion, even though the Asian crisis had a bigger impact on the growth rates of our particular trading-partner group? The answer is mainly, I think, because the Asian crisis was a regional problem which occurred against a backdrop of strength elsewhere (as we now know, but didn(cid:146)t at the time). So many of Australia(cid:146)s exporters could find other markets. That is obviously harder to do when the problem lies with the global economy. In addition, of course, there was the effect of the drought on rural exports, and of the events of 11 September 2001 and SARS on exports of tourism services, which were over and above the normal effects of global weakness. How has the economy handled the loss of income? In a world of open capital markets, one would expect that a temporary reduction in income would in part be reflected in slower growth of spending, but in part also in a temporary change in our saving behaviour - saving less of our own income, drawing more on the saving of others. That is, we smooth our living standards in the face of swings in income. This behaviour means that there is some slowing in GDP growth, but much less than would be the case, were our spending behaviour to be confined to following much more closely the reduction in income. At the same time, as we all know, a long-term adjustment has been under way in the structure of households(cid:146) balance sheets, which has been tending to elevate spending relative to income for some time. It so happens that the direction of this effect has, in the past couple of years, suited what was needed to adapt to the international conjunctural circumstances.  We can(cid:146)t distinguish from the data what was the result of this structural change and what was due to a cyclical response to a particular income shock. But the broad effects of the combined forces are fairly clear in the national income accounts. We have seen domestic final demand rise by over 4‰ per cent over the past year - to be sure, more moderate than the 6-7 per cent pace it was recording a while back, but still faster than average. Real net exports fell by 3‰ per cent of GDP over the latest year, influenced by the world economy and the drought. Between them, those two factors did most of the work pegging GDP growth back to a below-average 2 per cent over the year. Over the same period, the current account deficit has increased by about 3 per cent of GDP. This is smaller than the decline in real net trade volumes because Australia(cid:146)s terms of trade have continued to improve over the past year - by nearly 3 per cent, which is worth about ‰ per cent of GDP in additional income. So the Australian community, by having access to capital markets, and facing macroeconomic policy settings which remained on the expansionary side, was able to continue to increase its spending at a very strong pace, even though income growth was impaired by international events. This involved declining rates of saving out of current income, and some extraction of accumulated equity from the dwelling stock. Generally speaking, to have that flexibility is a good thing - with the proviso that, as with all good things, we don(cid:146)t want to over-indulge.  We can anticipate that, over the coming year, the two factors weakening overall performance over the past year will not recur, and indeed some reversal of these effects is likely. It is widely acknowledged now that there will be a strong recovery in farm production. The prospect of some continuing improvement in international conditions means that the downward trend in non-farm exports should bottom out, and a recovery begin. At the same time, domestic demand growth should moderate a little. Capital spending by firms will probably continue to rise, but not as quickly, on current indications, as it has over the past year. Some decline in dwelling construction activity has occurred, although this looks smaller than earlier thought. Consumption spending looks likely in the near term to continue to benefit from steady growth in incomes, high levels of confidence and the higher and more accessible wealth available to households. If this outlook is correct, growth in the economy has probably already slowed as much as it is likely to. The year-ended growth rate of non-farm GDP will decline for another quarter as an earlier very strong quarter drops out. But the pace of expansion through the second half of 2003 is probably going to be 
4 BIS Review 40/2003 at least as good as it was in the first. If the global economy continues on its present track, Australian growth should clearly be picking up by the first half of next year. Inflation will be pushed down a bit by the earlier exchange rate appreciation for a while, but is still thought likely to be about 2‰ per cent in the medium term, based on the usual assumptions about oil prices, exchange rates and interest rates, and the above growth outlook. This picture is much as was described in our Statement on Monetary Policy on 11 August. Since that document was published, it is fair to say that the downside risks to the global economy have retreated further. Most recent data on the Australian economy also seem consistent with a moderation in non-farm growth in the first half of the year, but suggest that it has neither been particularly pronounced, nor showed signs of being long-lived.  Risks and policy considerations It has become much better understood in recent years that once a coherent framework for monetary policy is in place, the regular policy decision is essentially a matter of responding to the changing balance of risks to the outlook. The RBA(cid:146)s Board certainly has had a busy time over the past year or more evaluating and deciding how to respond to the evolving balance of international and domestic risks. It takes a lot more work than you might think to leave rates unchanged for fifteen consecutive months! In the middle of last year, it looked as though the international economy was returning to stronger conditions, and Australian domestic demand was growing very strongly indeed. To foster an inflation outcome consistent with our medium-term target, we believed that it would be prudent under such conditions to return interest rates to normal, or (cid:145)neutral(cid:146), from a relatively expansionary setting. Two initial steps were taken, and the likelihood of further steps clearly signalled. But in the event, the process did not continue, because the world economy began turning out differently to what we had assumed. By the end of 2002, it was clear that any thought of near-term tightening could go off the agenda for a while. The world economy had clearly lost some momentum, and for the time being, this meant that a steady interest rate structure would probably be associated with achieving our policy objectives. That remained the story through to the middle of 2003, as the Iraq war came and went, most international data looked on the soft side, the drought continued, and financial market sentiment waxed and waned. The outlook for Australia was for moderate growth - quite a good outcome in the circumstances - but our feeling was that the risks stemming from international developments were tilted to the downside. Inflation, if anything, looked a little higher than had been expected, although our judgement was that in the medium term, it would still turn out to be consistent with the target. That was a macroeconomic outlook which certainly did not, in my view at least, amount to an obvious case for monetary policy to be noticeably easier than was already in place. A reasonable case could be made that policy should be easier than neutral - but it already was, and had been for some time. Our conviction that the level of interest rates was exerting stimulus to the economy - a conviction strengthened when we looked at the demand for credit and the behaviour of asset markets - and a view that the inflation-targeting framework does not call for trying to fine tune outcomes, have both been important in policy deliberations.  At the same time, it should be obvious that the shifting assessment of the balance of risks to the outlook (which can occur without there necessarily being major changes to central forecasts) has also been critical. When, after a period of disappointing international outcomes in the first half of 2003, the external threats to the economic outlook seemed suddenly to be building up rather dangerously through May and early June, it looked like a case to ease policy was building. Throughout this period, the situation was complicated by another type of risk. While views about the international situation were changing, at home the demand for credit from households, far from diminishing, seemed to be strengthening. Apart from the fact that this meant that the near-term outlook for domestic demand might well be stronger than assumed, the Bank had an obligation to consider the medium-term soundness of the economy in addition to the short-run conjuncture. There is no doubt that the preparedness of households to borrow has been imparting some strength to demand and general buoyancy to the economy and asset markets, and that this has been helpful in supporting growth in the circumstances of the past couple of years. But there cannot be much doubt either that running up debt today must diminish the scope to do so in future, and that it must also impair, at the margin, the capacity of some households to cope with adverse shocks which might come along. 
BIS Review 40/2003 5 There are times when the above is a risk which just has to be incurred because another possible outcome is even worse. A disastrous international environment, coupled with a soaring exchange rate, would probably be one such time. That is why, in June, we publicly contemplated the possibility of easing. But we had to be fairly sure that the alternative was going to be pretty bad before we took action which we knew would be likely to inflame an asset market and borrowing boom. Monetary policy might not be able to do much to end an asset price boom without a fair bit of collateral damage - so, at least, it is commonly claimed. But whatever one(cid:146)s view on that, surely policy should avoid needlessly adding to the boom. (cid:145)First, do no harm(cid:146) is a good motto here. We have sought to balance these various concerns over the past several months. Although in early June a case to ease looked like it was building, it had not strengthened sufficiently by the time of the July meeting to warrant action. In August the case got weaker, and it got weaker again by early September. Essentially what happened was that the risks to growth from abroad abated, while those posed by the rapid rise in debt did not.  This recent experience, and the one a year earlier, is instructive in the discussion about central bank communication. What it shows is that, while it is natural for market participants and the media to want central banks to say more and more about their intentions, people need to keep very much in mind that our assessment of what we might need to do is, of necessity, highly conditional on a view of the future. And the future often turns up the unexpected - to which we need to respond by revising our intentions. So it is important that observers not only listen to the central bank(cid:146)s words, but also continue to look closely at the actual information coming in. I know the majority of you do.  Secondly, because the future cannot be known, and because things can change quickly, people need some understanding of the principles which guide central bank behaviour. So there is probably more to be gained by continued efforts at articulating how our framework for policy works, than by providing ever more frequent commentary on events. Such information hopefully provides interested observers with a device to filter, in real time, the information becoming available. This, combined with a periodic account, after the event, of how we filtered it, is the most helpful form of transparency - describing how we think about things and, within that framework, why we did what we did. The most recent Statement on Monetary Policy, in fact, goes a good deal further down this track than most of its predecessors. Conclusion The world economy is still not entirely in the clear, but is better than it was, and a fair bit better than it might have been. It is sensible at present to look for further improvement, while keeping in mind the possibility of regression. If things work out acceptably well abroad, the Australian economy will next year have a better chance of balanced growth than we have had for a few years. We will continue to assess the evolving balance of risks and will respond, in a measured fashion, as needed - and we(cid:146)ll do our best to keep you informed. 
 BIS Review 40/2003 1 Alan Bollard: The New Zealand housing market Extract from an address by Dr Alan Bollard, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to the Property Council of New Zealand, 9 September 2003. *      *      * I(cid:146)d like now to consider in more detail the New Zealand housing market, it being one of the factors behind our strong domestic economy, at a time when many exporters have seen their incomes retreat in recent months. New Zealand(cid:146)s housing sector has experienced a strong cyclical upswing over the past 18 months. It(cid:146)s not just Auckland. Sales growth and rising house prices are prevalent in many parts of New Zealand. Building consents are at cyclically high levels. That(cid:146)s both including and excluding apartments. Residential investment is expanding the nation(cid:146)s housing stock rapidly, yet demand continues to outstrip supply. We see this in rising prices and a shortage of properties listed for sale. The median time it takes to sell a house currently sits at an unprecedented low of just 26 days. As a consequence, recently house prices have been rising rapidly. What(cid:146)s driving this? The answer is demand exceeds supply. Demographics are part of the story. New Zealand has had rapid population growth in recent years, driven by net immigration. This includes not just people coming here but people here choosing not to leave. The longstanding drift of New Zealanders north and into town is also a factor. In addition, social changes are seeing the average number of persons per home reduce. Life-style changes are increasing demand for new kinds of accommodation, such as inner-city apartments and coastal and lakeside properties. Some of these factors have been at work for a long time. Even in the late 1990s, when population growth was relatively weak, there was substantial construction activity. However, more recently population growth has been marked. The natural increase in population currently is slower than a decade ago, but recent immigration has been very strong. In terms of permanent and long-term migration we had a net outflow of 10,000 persons per year in early 2001 and a net inflow of more than 40,000 per year in mid-2003. That too undersells the story. In addition we have short-term stays, such as students and those on work permits, and those who apply for residency once they are here. Total migration has been running at more than 60,000 persons per annum over the past two years. This is well in excess of the mid-1990s. Of course, more people means more demand for accommodation. Is there more to this story? Yes, we think so. In part the demand for housing reflects the fact that people with savings to invest have become disenchanted with the share market and other financial instruments. Savers still remember the 1987 share market crash and more recent tumbles in the US and Europe. As well, savers have seen global interest rates fall to historic lows and headlines of pension funds losing money. At the same time property markets have stayed uncharacteristically buoyant and so there(cid:146)s been a flight to (cid:147)bricks and mortar(cid:148). The proportion of the housing stock owned as rental property has been rising over recent years. Increasing numbers of people prefer to hold wealth in housing assets, as opposed to other investments.1 Property investment has been rising over the past year. Of course this isn(cid:146)t all bad. If lifestyles are changing and housing needs are changing and if aggregate demand is up because more people live here, then we want more house construction. If supply meets demand without bottlenecks that(cid:146)s good. There are, however, some initial signs that housing market activity and expectations of future activity are starting to exceed demand as indicated by demographic fundamentals. Credit demand has accelerated over the last year. Borrowing has begun to accelerate. Debt-to-income ratios, which began to level out in the late 1990s, are starting to rise again. People working in real estate and financial planning indicate a marked increase in the numbers of would-be investors. The newspapers are running advertisements for seminars offering to coach people on how to invest in property, often promising significant returns.                                                       1 Census and Household Expenditure Survey. 
 2 BIS Review 40/2003 I am concerned, as I said at the release of the Reserve Bank(cid:146)s Monetary Policy Statement last week, that this could end in disappointment, especially for unsophisticated investors who are rushing to get on the housing-investment bandwagon. My worry is what if things reverse and supply exceeds demand? What if recent buyers, heavily in debt, find that rents have fallen, making outgoings more than incomings? What if they decide to exit property and then can(cid:146)t sell at prices paid a few months earlier? How could supply exceed demand? We think that net immigration is likely to ease a little over the next two years. Partly that will reflect Government policy. Also the number of New Zealanders who want to begin their OE may go up again, as the economies of other advanced countries do better relative to ours.  As other investments like equities regain their gloss the person who has bought a house to sell it to another buyer may find that the next prospective buyer has put his or her money elsewhere. When pension funds prosper again, that too will have the same effect. To those who say (cid:147)Hold on, nothing is as safe as houses,(cid:148) I would say separate nominal from real house prices. Real house prices are what matters. In our recent past there have been extended periods where real house prices have dropped, as illustrated.   In the past price falls were often concealed by high inflation. Also, as the graph confirms, when property prices really skyrocket real property-price deflation often follows soon after. Rising house prices and, by inference, increasing rentals are by no means a certainty. As some New Zealanders found in the 1970s, the late 1980s and to a lesser degree in the late 1990s house prices can fall in real terms. Other countries, such as the UK, have experienced even more pronounced weakness in their housing markets at stages over the last 20 years. Prudent property investors need to ensure their ability to withstand falling prices and rents at some time in the future.  People thinking of borrowing to buy a rental property should also factor monetary policy into their calculations. If inflation starts to gain momentum in New Zealand, interest rates, nominal and real, will have to be higher to keep that inflation in check. Prospective buyers should ask (cid:147)Could my gearing face that - would I stay above water come higher interest rates?(cid:148) To conclude, why as a central banker should I care about any of this? The narrow answer is that a stretched housing market contributes to inflation. However, the wider answer is that the stability of the New Zealand economy and the security of New Zealand households are linked in terms of risk concentration. For the wider economic interest and for New Zealand households, spreading risk needs to be a higher priority. 
 BIS Review 40/2003 1 Zdeněk Tůma: Challenges of free capital movement and the role of international standards (focusing on money laundering prevention) Introductory remarks by Mr Zdeněk Tůma, Governor of the Czech National Bank, at the IFex Training Course: Fraud, Terrorist Financing And Money Laundering Prevention, Prague, 15 September 2003. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues,  It is my great pleasure and honour to give an opening address to this high-level training course. For my introductory remarks today I have chosen a topic related to the questions you are going to discuss during your seminar. I would like to focus on the issues stemming from free international mobility of capital and on the international standards that have been broadened and deepened in recent years to address underlying challenges. I will also come to the anti-money-laundering standards that form an important part of the new financial architecture.  The last few decades have seen substantial growth in global capital flows. In the emerging market economies alone, the net inflows of foreign capital have now reached about USD 150 billion a year, despite a contraction following the wave of emerging market crises in 1997-1998. The financial flows between the advanced market economies are of an even higher order, of course. Moreover, the turnover in the international markets is substantially higher than the net flows, exceeding global real economic activity many times over. Another striking feature is the fact that the international flows are currently dominated by private capital, which is in sharp contrast to what is has been two or three decades ago when official capital flows used to play a key role.  This trend has been greatly supported by the liberalisation of capital flows, both in the advanced countries and in the emerging markets. The belief has prevailed that in a long run, free movement of capital is welfare enhancing, as it leads to more efficient allocation of capital, faster economic convergence of less developed countries, better consumption smoothing, and diversification of financial portfolios.  Even though these benefits are undisputed, free capital mobility has also created many challenges. On the macroeconomic level, for example, we have observed many currency crises followed by painful stabilisation periods. These crises have often been preceded by periods of fast capital inflows, aggravating vulnerabilities in the domestic financial sectors of the emerging market economies. These financial weaknesses have then functioned as an important transmission channel for macroeconomic shocks, leading to (cid:147)twin crises(cid:148), i.e. a vicious circle of currency depreciations and failures of financial institutions. The Asian crises in 1997-1998 and the recent experience of Argentina are examples of such modern twin crises.  Another challenge related to the massive and liberalised capital flows lies in the area of international fraud and money laundering. The detection of such activities is a crucial preventive policy objective. Money laundering enables criminal activities to grow and cause further damage, the most serious case being terrorist financing. It also leads to potentially high moral and reputational costs for the financial system and for society at large. Finally, it generates inefficiencies and volatility in the allocation of resources, as launderers move their funds not in response to economic rationale, but in an effort to disguise the origin of their money. In the end, this runs counter to the desired benefits of financial liberalisation. However, in an environment where private capital moves quickly from one country to another without any permission being required, seeking the best short-term returns, it is naturally more difficult to detect fraudulent or money-laundering transactions. The environment is also made more challenging by the growing sophistication of financial products in the liberalised and globalised markets and by frequent use of off-shore centres for tax-optimisation purposes.  The ongoing financial innovations and recent negative experience have led to a widespread conviction that the international policy and financial architecture needs to be strengthened. Moreover, it has become widely understood that regulation must be co-ordinated internationally, as tightening it in only some markets and/or countries might merely shift the negative phenomena to other places, without reducing their overall severity. There have been numerous suggestions pointing in this direction, the most ambitious of which include proposals to establish a global lender of last resort and/or a supervisor. So far, however, the actual solution has been the creation of a comprehensive set of international standards and recommendations by international organisations. I consider this approach 
 2 BIS Review 40/2003 to be appropriate, as it fosters the desired degree of international standardisation of the rules, yet leaves enough room to take into account the specific features of each country and its legal system.  In the macroeconomic policy sphere, the key set of international standards for monetary, financial and fiscal policies are embodied in the Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies and the Code of Good Practices in Fiscal Transparency, approved in 1999 and 2001 respectively. Among other things, these principles deal with the independence of central banks and financial regulators, restrictions on monetary financing of state budgets, greater transparency of policy-making, and data provision. These ideas have indeed had a marked effect in practice, and the first tentative conclusion is that they have helped to mitigate the international contagion of adverse shocks. In the financial regulatory and supervisory area the work to strengthen international standards has also been very intense. The key pillar here is the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, released in 1997. The ongoing work on the Basel Capital Accord, known as Basel II, is a well-known initiative for the future. Transposing all these standards into national legal and regulatory systems has become a key part of the newly founded FSAP, a joint programme of the IMF and the World Bank.  In the anti-money-laundering (AML) area, too, the response to the recent challenges has taken the form of more rigorous international standards. The key standards here are the 40 recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), first issued in 1990 and revised twice in 1996 and also this year. After the events in September 2001, eight further recommendations were added, focusing on combating terrorism financing. These recommendations have been accepted by the international financial organisations as a basis for anti-money-laundering criteria in the financial sector. The Basel Committee published a document entitled (cid:147)Customer Due Diligence for Banks(cid:148) in October 2001 specifying details of the (cid:147)know-your-customer(cid:148) principle for banks. The IMF has added the recommendations to its surveillance work within the FSAP missions and Offshore Financial Centre assessments, having developed a methodology for assessing the general principles in practice. These AML standards are thus on a par with all the other international codes and best practices and form an integral part of the strengthened global financial architecture. I should also note that an increased awareness of the crucial role played by the AML regulations in today(cid:146)s world is also apparent among private financial institutions themselves. This has been demonstrated, for example, by their adoption of the (cid:147)Wolfsberg principles(cid:148) and the involvement of the banking associations in many countries in AML issues.  The AML regulations require financial institutions to identify their customers in certain transactions, either in suspicious ones, or in standard ones such as opening bank accounts, safety boxes, etc. The growing use of modern communications channels, e.g. telephone banking and e-finance, has made it necessary to ensure that the identification requirement is observed equally strictly for these transactions, too. Financial institutions are also obliged to store data that can be used for detecting money laundering and as evidence during subsequent legal action. Special units have been established either at existing regulatory authorities or as new public institutions, to which financial intermediaries are obliged to report either suspicious transactions or transactions exceeding some pre-specified volume. Private financial institutions must create their own internal procedures, including a clear division of responsibilities and staff training, in order to implement all the aforementioned duties in practice. As in the other fields of financial regulation, supervisors are paying increasing attention to examining whether such comprehensive procedures and their control mechanisms have been put in place, are functioning appropriately and are responding to new money-laundering practices and other innovations.  The AML system in the Czech Republic started to be built in 1996 with the adoption of the Act (No 61/1996 Coll.) Concerning Certain Measures against the Legalisation of Proceeds of Criminal Activity (the (cid:147)AML Act(cid:148)), which was subsequently amended in 2000. A draft amendment to the AML Act, which implements the EU(cid:146)s 2nd AML Directive and also the relevant Special Recommendations of the FATF on combating financing of terrorism, has recently been prepared. The Government has approved this amendment and it is currently being debated in the Czech Parliament.  A special Financial Analytical Unit (FAU) has been established as an autonomous part of the Czech Finance Ministry, to which all suspicious transactions must be reported. The regulators of the individual financial market segments, most importantly the Czech National Bank and the Czech Securities Commission, examine the regulated financial institutions(cid:146) compliance with the AML Act by means of both off-site and on-site supervision. The home regulators co-operate with the FAU, and also among themselves based on a mutual co-operation agreement. Co-operation with foreign supervisors is being established by signing Memoranda of Understanding. In this respect, the AML activities are 
 BIS Review 40/2003 3 thus following the same trend as the financial supervision in general. A crucial role is, of course, played in the AML system by the law-enforcement authorities, i.e. the police, prosecutors and judges.  In previous years, one of the most sensitive measures in the AML system was the cancellation of the remaining anonymous saving-book accounts, which had a tradition of more than one hundred years in the Czech Republic. This issue, however, has now been resolved, contributing to stricter compliance with international standards in the Czech Republic. I am also pleased to tell you that the most recent progress in this area is the approval of a regulation issued by the Czech National Bank in August 2003 that specifies requirements for banks(cid:146) internal AML systems. It is based on the BIS(cid:146)s (cid:147)Customer Due Diligence for Banks(cid:148). During its lengthy preparation we held numerous consultations with the Czech Banking Association, individual Czech banks, the FAU, further financial regulators and other parties concerned, so as to transpose the international standards into the Czech practice in an optimal way.  The CNB regulation covers all the standard elements of the AML measures I have already mentioned. One of its last paragraphs - but definitely not least - concerns the training of bank staff in AML issues. Given the emphasis on training, let me express the delight that your training course is taking place here in Prague. Given what I have said about the necessity to co-ordinate AML activities internationally, I am also glad to see that those attending the course come from numerous different countries. I hope that you will learn as much as possible here and that you will then have an opportunity to use your new knowledge actively in anti-fraud and AML activities in your home countries. Thank you for your attention.  
 BIS Review 40/2003 1 David Dodge: Canada(cid:146)s experiences of the past few decades Speech by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Spruce Meadows Roundtable, Spruce Meadows, Alberta, 5 September 2003. *      *      * Thanks to my colleagues from around the world for giving such a comprehensive review of the vital issues facing the global economy. One of the hazards of speaking last in these kinds of sessions is that those who speak before you may cover all the interesting territory, leaving you with the unenviable task of trying to tie everything together.  In this case, however, going last is not so bad. That(cid:146)s because, in order to tie together the issues discussed so far, we need to take a global view of the economy. And as far as Canada is concerned, taking a global view has always been important. Of course, every country is affected to some extent by what happens in the world economy. But Canada, with its very open economy, has a particular need to keep an eye on the changing fortunes of the international scene.  Canada(cid:146)s reliance on foreign trade has required us to be active internationalists for decades. Louis Rasminsky, who went on to become Governor of the Bank of Canada, was one of Canada(cid:146)s delegates at the Bretton Woods Conference that led to the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Rasminsky played an important role, formal and informal, at the talks. Not only was he the Chair of the drafting committee, he was also the peacemaker between the British delegation, led by John Maynard Keynes, and the U.S. delegation, led by Treasury Secretary Harry Dexter White. In the months leading up to Bretton Woods, it was Rasminsky who kept the two key delegations talking. Without his work, both as a skilled drafter and as a go-between, it(cid:146)s entirely possible that the talks at Bretton Woods could have ended in failure.  Canada was also present at the 1947 Havana Conference, where we pushed for the establishment of an international trade organization. This was meant to be a body parallel to the IMF, designed to establish and monitor a set of global trade rules. We didn(cid:146)t get quite what we wanted, but the result was still certainly positive: the birth of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In 1995, nearly five decades later, we were more successful, as we pushed the effort to turn the GATT into the World Trade Organization (WTO). So Canada(cid:146)s credentials as a supporter of institutions designed to promote free trade and a sound international financial system are well established. Of course, much has changed in the global economy during the more than half-century since those institutions were founded. Of profound significance, transportation and communications have become very much cheaper and faster today than they were after World War II. Because of this, the potential economic gains from increased international trade and finance are now much greater than ever before. At the same time, individual countries are more vulnerable to economic and financial shocks originating outside their borders. So the need for a coherent international financial system is also much greater today. And our international institutions must evolve to take all of this into account.  To help us maximize the potential gains from increased trade, and to minimize the risks stemming from greater interdependence, we need to encourage trust, domestically and internationally. Let me explain what I mean. When I use the word trust, I am talking about the understanding that can develop when people recognize that everyone benefits when everyone plays by the rules. In this atmosphere, the rules that govern behaviour reinforce people(cid:146)s actions and help them choose to (cid:147)do the right thing.(cid:148) This kind of trust allows for what game theorists call (cid:147)positive-sum outcomes,(cid:148) where progress can come through (cid:147)win-win(cid:148) situations. It also allows national economies, as well as the global economy, to be strengthened.  This kind of trust begins at home. What all of us as national public policy-makers must do, and must be seen to be doing, is work to maintain and increase trust. We need to put in place the right incentives so that, in general, people will do the right thing. To be sure, the need to enforce sanctions when people do the wrong thing is critical. But when people can operate in an atmosphere of trust, they can spend less energy keeping tabs on others, and can concentrate on more productive activities.  We have seen over the past decades that trust is important to a well-functioning financial system. And a well-functioning financial system is necessary if we are to have an appropriate allocation of savings, which is a fundamental element of solid economic growth.  
 2 BIS Review 40/2003 I would argue that five lessons can be drawn from our experiences since the time of the Bretton Woods and Havana agreements. All of them underscore the importance of trust.  The first lesson we have learned is the critical importance of having a robust legal framework. When a country has the appropriate legal structures, it creates a sense of certainty. Citizens, investors, and corporations have the security of knowing that contracts will be honoured, and that those who break the rules will be caught and punished. The protection of property rights and a tradition of contract law are prime examples of these structures.  Certainly, in recent years, we have all recognized the importance of a robust legal framework as we have watched countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia struggle to make the transition to a market economy. But we in North America have also learned over the past two years, in a rather painful way, that issues of corporate governance are extremely important as well. So when we think of legal structures, we should now also think about high standards for accounting, transparency in corporate reporting, and adequate enforcement of the rules.  The second lesson we have learned is that our fiscal policies must always be based on prudence. When public debts are allowed to mount unabated, the trust of investors and citizens can vanish quickly. In its place comes fear that the debt will either be inflated away, or that a future government may default. Since the late 1990s, Canada has seen the benefits that can come from fiscal prudence. Putting our fiscal house in order has helped to establish credibility for our macroeconomic framework. And once fiscal credibility is established and a country has a low public debt-to-GDP ratio, the (cid:147)automatic stabilizers(cid:148) - which kick in to increase government spending to cushion the impact of difficult economic times - can operate without undermining the trust of citizens and investors. The third lesson we have all learned is the importance of being open to trade. When a country opens its industries and markets to international trade, this may force painful short-term adjustments in some sectors. But at the same time, the country gains from ongoing competitive pressures which act to spur productivity improvements and raise living standards. In the end, the country as a whole is better off. But what is equally important is that those countries that have opened up to international trade play by the rules. Otherwise, we run the risk of falling into destructive (cid:147)lose-lose(cid:148) situations, where countries don(cid:146)t trust each other and resort to unilateral actions that escalate trade disputes.  Fourth, we have learned the importance of a central bank that promotes trust in the value of money, free from political interference. When a central bank delivers an environment of low, stable, and predictable inflation, the public, and especially middle- and lower-income groups, can feel more confident that their savings and purchasing power will not be eroded by high inflation. And all borrowers can be more confident that the burden of their debt will not be increased through deflation. Low inflation also helps to win the public(cid:146)s trust in the functioning of a market economy. As former Bank of Canada Governor Gerald Bouey put it, (cid:147)inflation melts the glue that holds free societies together.(cid:148) In Canada, we focus on inflation in a symmetric way. In doing so, we aim to avoid inflation while also minimizing the risks of deflation. Such an approach brings important economic benefits. But it also assures creditors that the value of their investment will not be eaten away over time. And it assures debtors that the burden of their debt will not increase in the future because of deflation.  The fifth lesson has to do with capital flows and exchange rates. Open markets and the free flow of capital can greatly accelerate development. But, as I noted before, open markets and capital flows can make individual countries vulnerable to shocks that originate elsewhere. So there is a need for countries to have a mechanism in place that helps their economies adjust to shocks. Recent experience has taught us how important it is to have this kind of adjustment mechanism in place and, in particular, how a floating exchange rate can play this role.  I know that not everyone here would agree that the floating exchange rate is the best adjustment mechanism for every country. Based on Canada(cid:146)s long experience with a floating currency, I can certainly say that it has served us well. But I(cid:146)m sure that we can all at least agree that there will always be shocks, that such shocks will have different effects on national economies, and that flexible exchange rates can help to facilitate the necessary adjustments. This lesson was clearly brought home during the Asian crisis of 1997-98. Many Asian countries, but also countries like Canada that are particularly vulnerable to sharp fluctuations in commodity prices, made relatively quick adjustments to a difficult situation through the floating exchange rate mechanism.  How does this relate to trust? Through the need to trust in market forces, I would say. When exchange rates float and capital moves freely, investors can trust that market forces are being allowed to do their job. There is an assurance that when shocks arise, countries will not be shielding their economy from 
 BIS Review 40/2003 3 market forces through restrictive trade practices, arbitrary controls on capital flows, or fixed exchange rates.  So those are some of the key lessons we can draw from our experiences of the past few decades. In Canada, we have tried to apply these lessons to our own economic situation. And I would argue that doing so has helped us handle economic shocks better recently than in the past. Now, if we apply the principle of trust that is behind those lessons to our international financial institutions, we can get some idea of how these institutions might evolve to better work for the global economy. Game theorists will tell you that the best results come when the players see each other(cid:146)s behaviour and learn from it. Put simply, actions speak louder than words.  We have already seen the GATT evolve into the WTO, which establishes the ground rules for international trade and calls to account those countries that are not playing by the rules. Such an institution is essential if we are to reduce the frequency of (cid:147)lose-lose(cid:148) trade disputes I mentioned earlier. But for the WTO to go further, as it should, it is clear that progress needs to be made in the areas of greatest interest to the poorer nations. After all, the current round of talks is supposed to be the (cid:147)Development Round.(cid:148) So it is incumbent on us in the developed world to (cid:147)do the right thing,(cid:148) and overcome domestic political difficulties to open our markets in areas such as agriculture and textiles.  Recently, we have seen the IMF take steps to strengthen its surveillance function. These steps should be supported. Countries should strive to meet the highest standards for data dissemination and should welcome assessments of their economies and financial systems. Only when all the players have complete trust in the numbers - whether they are part of a nation(cid:146)s economic statistics or a firm(cid:146)s balance sheet - will investments be made most efficiently and effectively.  The IMF(cid:146)s other role, for which it is perhaps better known, is as provider of emergency liquidity. By the end of the 1990s, the Fund had increasingly found itself providing financial assistance many times in excess of a country(cid:146)s quota, in situations where sustainability, not a lack of liquidity, appeared to be the real issue. This is problematic, for a number of reasons. Perhaps most importantly, when debtors or creditors presume that there will be large official bailouts, there is the possibility of (cid:147)moral hazard.(cid:148) This is a case where policy-makers have not provided the incentives for debtors and creditors to do the right thing.  In recent years, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England worked together to develop a (cid:147)middle-ground(cid:148) approach to crisis resolution. This approach, which was detailed in a joint paper published in 2001, was designed to provide the right incentives for debtors and creditors. It contained three basic elements. First, (cid:147)presumptive limits(cid:148) to official assistance, which would be known in advance. Secondly, the possibility of exceptional official lending, but only in the unlikely event that a crisis threatened global financial stability. Third, orderly standstills or temporary suspensions of debt-service payments to give distressed debtors some time to take steps, including debt rescheduling, to address their problems.  Since that time, the G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors have adopted much of this approach in the context of their Action Plan for crisis prevention and resolution. What is important now is that we support that Plan and enforce the rules that have been put in place. If we ignore the rules that have been established, we risk losing the trust that we are trying so hard to build. To conclude, I hope that I have been able to illustrate the importance of trust. By strengthening this trust, we can make the global financial system work better. And by doing so, we can deal with the changing fortunes of the world economy and find a more efficient means of financing world growth.  
 BIS Review 39/2003 1 Edward M Gramlich: Economic and financial education Remarks by Mr Edward M Gramlich, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Georgia Summit on Economic and Financial Education, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Atlanta, 4 September 2003. *      *      * Thank you for inviting me to speak at today’s conference. For many years, the Federal Reserve has played an active role in furthering economic education among youth. Recently, we expanded our involvement by promoting the importance of personal financial education for all demographic and social groups. In May, we launched a national campaign that included a public service announcement featuring Chairman Greenspan. Our goal is to increase public awareness of the value of effective personal financial management in home ownership, higher education, retirement security, and overall economic well-being.  While some may not consider the topic of economic and financial education to lie within the purview of a central bank, it is in fact quite consistent with the Federal Reserve’s interests in many areas - economic policy, banking supervision, consumer regulation, public information, and community affairs. Hence, we appreciate your efforts in furthering education on these topics and applaud your interest in strengthening the effectiveness of your programs.  As you are well aware, a solid understanding of economics and finance is relevant to both individual financial success and to the proper functioning of markets. Consumers who are familiar with basic economic principles, who are able to analyze personal financial scenarios and options, and who have access to pertinent financial information are important components to the success of our free market system. With these tools - knowledge, analytical skills, and access to information - consumers are able to make more effective financial decisions. This furthers market efficiency by creating demand for products that are more responsive to consumer needs.  As providers of economic and financial education, you are quite familiar with the difficulties of choosing among the myriad products and services offered by our financial services sector. Financial markets are becoming steadily more sophisticated and expansive. Consumers are required to assume ever greater responsibility for managing their personal finances, such as their employer-sponsored retirement savings accounts. The result is that the need for financial education is also growing, and is indeed experiencing an unprecedented level of attention and funding from a broad base of supporters, ranging from financial institutions to employers to faith-based organizations.  With the growth in financial education programs has come an increased interest in measuring the effectiveness of such programs. Performance and outcome measurement should be the way to justify continued support for any program. Further, the data collected for the program evaluation process can identify (cid:147)best practices(cid:148) which can be replicated on a broad scale to increase the reach and effectiveness of successful programs. But unlike readily quantifiable outcome measures such as business profits, a bright-line test of success is not always available for financial education programs. There is often no single outcome that conveys success, and the determinants of achievement may depend on factors that vary from one individual to the next. Further, these programs may not realize a return on their investment for months, or even years.  Given the importance of evaluating a program’s success, leaders of various economic and financial education programs have been exploring ways to measure the effectiveness of their activities. Staff of the Federal Reserve and the Department of Defense are currently collaborating to develop extensive and ongoing survey instruments to measure the value of financial education courses offered to Army personnel. Organizations such as Jump$tart, the National Endowment for Financial Education, and the National Council on Economic Education have employed various testing and survey strategies to quantify the impact of and measure the need for their programs.  In considering how to develop measurement criteria for financial education programs, it is logical to begin with primary objectives. The desired outcomes for financial education are  (cid:1)(cid:2)Getting the message out - that is, increasing consumers’ awareness of the importance of the  issue to their well-being.  (cid:1)(cid:2)Altering consumer behavior to improve short- and long-term prospects.  
 2 BIS Review 39/2003 These goals have parallels to other public awareness and educational campaigns, and the parallels can assist in program design and evaluation. I will illustrate by offering some perspectives.  With regard to the first outcome - getting the message out - the Ad Council has sponsored studies to determine the impact of public service announcements on its targeted audiences. The findings suggest that certain public service announcements are effective in increasing awareness, reinforcing positive beliefs, intensifying concern, and moving people to action. One study, conducted by the Advertising Research Foundation, focused on the impact of public service announcements for colon cancer awareness that were aired in four major cities over the course of a year. The research found that as a direct result of the public service announcement, awareness of the threat of colon cancer increased by more than 3.5 times after a year, and the number of people discussing colon cancer with their doctor increased by 43 percent. The research also found that the message had a particularly strong impact on men, with awareness among males increasing nearly six times and the number of males taking action increasing by 114 percent.  A separate study was conducted by the University of Wisconsin to gauge the impact of the National Crime Prevention Council’s anti-crime campaign. This study found that awareness of the trademark McGruff the Crime Dog reached 80 percent among the general public and 88 percent among crime prevention practitioners. In addition, nearly one-third of respondents indicated that they had learned from the public service announcements, and one-fifth reported that they had taken specific actions as a result of what they had learned from the campaign. These research findings suggest that issue-related information campaigns not only increase awareness of the importance of a given topic, but also motivate positive behavior change.  The second objective is to alter consumer behavior. This key goal is unfortunately quite difficult to quantify, but financial education organizations have committed their resources to conduct surveys and administer tests in order to better estimate programmatic impacts. The U.S. Department of Education is one agency that has conducted such assessments. It studied literacy programs involving teaching-related issues, including the provision of reading skills instruction to parents alongside children, the effectiveness of participatory and traditional approaches to teaching, and strategies for increasing participation and ongoing development of reading skills.  While there are many factors that differentiate financial education from adult literacy training, certain research results are suggestive. In particular, studies of methods that engage both parents and children in the educational process do reveal positive outcomes. One study compared the results of participants in Toyota Families for Learning, a family literacy-training program, with the results for participants in two adult-oriented literacy programs. Participants in the family-focused programs gained more than one grade level in their reading skills after one year, much greater than the grade-level increase of students in the two adult-oriented programs. The study attributes the increased level of success to higher retention rates in the family-focused program. It showed that 19 percent more adults remained in the family-focused program for more than twenty weeks. Other research on family literacy programs indicates that benefits also spread to child participants, with young children showing an increased interest in literacy and being better prepared for school than their peers.  Some other relevant information on educational programs designed to change consumer behavior may be found in research sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service. The agency has evaluated a range of nutrition education, health promotion, and social marketing programs intended to improve consumers’ understanding of the importance of good nutrition. The agency reviewed more than 200 studies that evaluated education research and intervention programs. These studies found that successful programs typically had five common characteristics:  (cid:1)(cid:2)They set behavior change as a specific program goal.  (cid:1)(cid:2)They incorporated motivating communications into the program.  (cid:1)(cid:2)They taught strategies for behavior change.  (cid:1)(cid:2)They included active involvement of both the individual and the community.  (cid:1)(cid:2)They attempted to build health-enhancing environments.  The review also highlighted the findings of one evaluation of a school health education program reaching about 30,000 students. This study found that between five and fifteen hours of instruction resulted in enormous gains in students’ knowledge about nutritional programs. However, between 
 BIS Review 39/2003 3 twenty-five and fifty hours of instruction were required to bring about any change in student behavior and attitudes, and even with this amount of instruction, the effects on attitudes were very small. These findings demonstrate the enormousness of the challenge in influencing behavior change through education.  I would also like to comment on the importance of developing effective information-delivery mechanisms. The agencies previously mentioned, along with others, have developed innovative Internet-based programs to provide education and information. Technology can play a big role here, by increasing the efficiency of financial education programs and by centralizing resources into information clearinghouses, which may help to reduce duplicative efforts and better exploit scarce resources. One example involves the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), which engages in activities that promote informed consumer decision-making. The agency uses different strategies to provide information to consumers on various health-related issues, including medical conditions and procedures, as well as on the range of choices in health care options and plans. Over the last several years, AHRQ has been developing software and database programs designed to help consumers and others choose among the wide variety of health care plans. This system, the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans, uses computer-driven survey instruments and reporting tools to collect data that permit a better understanding of consumers’ sentiments about health care programs and experiences. Such a system could serve as a model for using technology to help consumers assess their financial needs.  Let me conclude by repeating how pleased I am to see this group of dedicated professionals meeting and discussing the challenges that face public educators. I would like to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta for hosting today’s conference and bringing together this group of educators. With your expanded knowledge and new contacts, I encourage you to continue to seek new and innovative ways to further your work and measure the outcomes of your programs. Success in increasing economic and financial literacy will be very important to the individuals you serve, as well as to the overall economy.  
 BIS Review 39/2003 1 Lars Heikensten: The Riksbank and the euro Speech by Mr Lars Heikensten, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the SEB’s EMU seminar, Cirkus, Stockholm, 4 September 2003. *      *      * Let me begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to speak at this event. The past few months have certainly been hectic for those of us working at the Riksbank. We are undoubtedly in the eye of the storm and feature almost daily in the EMU debate. Moreover, we are affected more directly and tangibly by the result of the referendum than most people. I can take my own diary as an example; if the result is a (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote, I will be in Frankfurt for a day or two at least every other week, while if the result is a (cid:147)no(cid:148), the visits will be reduced to a few hours four times a year.  Given this, the temptation to jump into the debate head first has been strong at times. However, we have decided not to participate in any campaigns. The Riksbank as an institution took a stand in favour of EMU membership in the form of submission responses in both 1994 and 1997. However, the Executive Board has now decided to refrain from taking a stand in connection with the referendum. The personal views of the various members of the Executive Board have nevertheless been known for some time. Five of us are in favour, one against. As the staff of the Riksbank has knowledge and experience of significance in this field we have agreed to contribute factual information. We have also agreed that any senior managers wishing to express their views on various issues relating to the EMU discussion may do so, as long as this is done in a factual manner. Our ambition here is of course to ensure that the general public retains confidence in the Riksbank regardless of the outcome of the referendum. Today I intend to briefly discuss three issues that have arisen in the discussions and of which the Riksbank has knowledge and experience. The first concerns whether the differences between the ECB and the Riksbank are as large as is sometimes claimed. The second issue is the need for a national stabilisation policy. Finally, I shall discuss, on the basis of our own experiences, the conditions for influence in economic policy forums if we choose to remain outside the Eurosystem. Are there major differences between the Riksbank and the ECB? In Sweden we lived for a long time - rather longer than the core EMU countries - under the impression that better economic growth and lower unemployment could be achieved merely by allowing inflation to be slightly higher. This led to repeated devaluations and to much poorer economic growth. Sweden fell behind the other EU countries in terms of GDP per capita and purchasing power. There was a break in this policy at the beginning of the 1990s, in connection with the crisis during that period. Importing the stability-oriented policy that had long been conducted in the EMU’s core countries helped to create better conditions for future growth. The policy model we now follow comes originally from Germany. During the entire post-war period they have endeavoured, to a great extent successfully, to maintain price stability. The task of achieving this has fallen to the German central bank - the Bundesbank - which has operated independently, at arm’s length from party politics. The Bundesbank model is now copied by a number of industrial nations, which have given their central banks a large degree of independence and the task of aiming for price stability. This policy is also reflected in the Maastricht Treaty and in the Riksbank legislation. My colleagues in the major industrial nations also try - as long as they are sure that inflation is not about to deviate from the desired level - to take account of economic activity and unemployment. There are thus considerable similarities and this applies not only in Europe, but also in a comparison with, for instance, the US, although the stipulated targets vary, sometimes for historical reasons. In this sense we are all the children of the Bundesbank!  Within the central bank world the methods of working have also become more similar in recent years. Although not all industrial nations with a floating exchange rate say that they use inflation targeting, they actually do so in some form. All of them apply a forward-looking perspective; they produce forecasts and try to adapt interest rates in good time to ensure that inflation will be in line with a target 
 2 BIS Review 39/2003 that is formulated with varying precision. The ECB now says that inflation should be below, but close to, 2 per cent, which does not differ greatly from our symmetrical 2 per cent target, given the prevailing error margins. In addition, we usually say that we focus on inflation 1-2 years ahead, while the ECB says it applies a medium-term perspective. There is no great difference here, either. When it comes to communication and accountability, the similarities also outweigh the differences now. This is perhaps not so surprising. Greater independence leads to a natural increase in demands for central banks to clearly explain and account for their actions. It is also natural that it should be possible to assess these actions. To this end, those who appoint the Executive Board at the Riksbank and at the ECB have the opportunity to attend important board meetings. Both institutions are also accountable to their respective parliaments. However, there are also a number of differences. For instance, our target is more precise and we regularly publish inflation reports containing forecasts that show how our analysis work develops and changes over time. We also publish separate minutes of our monetary policy discussions.  Neither monetary policy theory, nor its practical implication is written in stone. Changes occur over time. In this spirit the ECB has been reviewing its monetary policy operations over the past year. The enlargement eastwards will entail a new, formative stage. I would gladly work actively to achieve increased clarity and transparency within the ECB if the result of the referendum is a (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote. Is a national stabilisation policy necessary? The risk that Sweden could end up in a different situation from the rest of the euro area, and that this would cause serious economic policy problems, has been strongly highlighted in the Swedish discussions, much more so than in other countries where the monetary union has been discussed. The reason for this is, of course, the severe crisis that occurred at the beginning of the 1990s, with the collapse of the krona in 1992, which had such a tangible effect on the lives of many in Sweden. In my opinion, there is a tendency to overestimate the risks that developments in Sweden will differ substantially from the rest of the world and require unique stabilisation policy measures.  When we have differed from other countries previously - such as during the crisis years of the early 1990s - this has usually been the result of conducting a different economic policy; of not having control over inflation or focussing on stability, as the core EMU countries did. However, there now appears to be a consensus that economic policy should be aimed at long-term stability and that this policy should stand firm. At the same time, I do not think that a relatively similar development in interest rates in Sweden and the euro area in recent years is sufficient argument against the need for a national stabilisation policy. While it is true that the instrumental rates have developed similarly to one another, which I believe will also be the case if we remain outside the Eurosystem, the point of a national stabilisation policy is not to fine-tune a relatively normal level of economic activity, as we have experienced in recent years, but to manage situations where Sweden for some reason deviates from the course pursued by the rest of Europe. Such a situation cannot be completely ruled out.  The task we face if the result of the referendum is a (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote is to make use both of other countries’ experiences and our own from the past ten years and to translate these into an appropriate regulatory framework for fiscal policy. The changes in budget policy, with a long-term expenditure ceiling and a budget surplus target, form a natural starting point. It is quite simple. There should be sufficient reserves for the central government to be able to bear a deficit for a period if the economy were to deviate significantly. This requires first and foremost that the central government debt be further amortised, which is a desirable goal in any case. If these reserves are available, one can be fairly sure that they will be used in a crisis situation. The opposite situation is more difficult; when restraint is required in situations where there is a risk that prices and wage formation could get out of control. It would then be necessary to find institutional solutions to help the government and parliament to make the necessary long-term decisions and to do so even in situations where they may be politically difficult and even risky. Here I think it is possible to draw on some experiences of the Riksbank’s actions in recent years. Clear targets, transparent analyses and discussions, combined with regular assessments, can put pressure on the political system to take action in time. If you remember, there was doubt at the beginning that the Riksbank would be able to achieve its inflation target. Some people say it is an impossible task. That Swedish politicians will never be able to manage fiscal policy in a responsible manner. I find this rather difficult to understand, although we have negative experiences from the 1970s and 1980s. It is enough to look at two of our three closest neighbours - 
 BIS Review 39/2003 3 Denmark and Finland. Both have experienced equally severe fiscal policy problems as Sweden, but they now have, as far as one can see, fully-functional fiscal policy regimes adapted to fixed exchange rates. A different, improved budget policy system was also established in Sweden following the crisis in the early 1990s, although this was aimed at long-term sustainability rather than stabilisation, which is only natural with a floating exchange rate.  Is EMU membership important for Sweden to gain influence? Finally, I intend to discuss what I personally consider to be the most important aspect of the EMU issue - how Sweden’s opportunity to take responsibility and exercise influence in an international economic policy context will be affected by the result of the referendum. Here I am speaking not primarily as Riksbank governor of six months but on the basis of my experiences over almost 20 years, as civil servant in the Ministry of Finance under three finance ministers and later as deputy governor of the Riksbank, representing Sweden in numerous international forums. My first reflection concerns Sweden’s influence now, compared with before. As I see it, Sweden’s influence has declined considerably, which is not always made clear in the general debate.  The most important reason for this erosion of Sweden’s position is that we, as I mentioned earlier, have declined in economic strength in relation to almost all of the other industrial nations. In addition, there is a more positive aspect here, namely that a number of former developing countries have made considerable economic progress and are now important players in the international economic policy game. The result is that we now sit at fewer decision-making tables than at any other point during the post-war period and we carry less weight at those tables where we have retained a place. One expression of this is that an ever-declining number of Swedes now hold central positions in economic policy and financial contexts. We have come a long way from the time when the first two heads of the IMF were Swedes. It is against this background - our weaker international position - that we should evaluate the importance of becoming full members of the European cooperation. Globalisation has strengthened the significance of the European Union. Of course, I can make direct contacts and conduct a dialogue with my colleagues in, for instance, South Africa or Argentina, and argue for a particular line in an international economic policy issue, which I actually often do. They listen to my arguments, but when it really comes to the crunch on an important and sensitive issue, they always wonder what Europe thinks. To an increasing extent - and here there is a tangible difference compared with ten years ago - countries in other parts of the world are regarding Europe as a whole unit. Thus, if we do not have a strong influence in Europe, we will not be heard very far. The discussion of influence focuses too much, in my opinion, on the value of sitting on the ECB’s Governing Council and determining interest rates. Of course, as members we would do all we could to ensure this functioned well, but there is no opportunity here to take into account specific Swedish interests; the rates are set for to the good of Europe as a whole. More important from a Swedish perspective would be the discussions on developments in and regulation of the financial system. As banks and securities markets become increasingly integrated, new and interesting questions arise with regard to the best means of exercising international supervision and oversight. Plans are also being drafted for the European payment system. The ECB plays a central role in this work. Whether or not we have a place at the decision-making table affects the conditions for the financial sector in Sweden, a sector that currently employs around 80,000 people, which is almost twice as many as, for instance, the forestry-based industries.  Even more important here is the broader economic policy decision-making, primarily through the Ecofin Council, where the Ministers of Finance meet regularly. The trend is clear, although the changes have so far been tentative and gradual. An increasing number of the important issues are discussed and decided in practice in the small circle of countries participating in the Eurosystem, what is known as the Euro group. It is not difficult for me to point out issues from recent years where we could probably have exerted greater influence if we had been members. During the early years, when the ECB was being built up, we sat at the decision-making table. When it then became clear that we and the Brits intended to remain on one side, our colleagues quite simply decided to postpone a number of important issues where we had strong views, including the monetary policy framework with inflation targeting, transparency, etc. This also applied to various payment system issues, where our position was weaker on the outside. 
 4 BIS Review 39/2003 We have thus already lost considerable influence, which is also confirmed in surveys. If we now say (cid:147)no(cid:148) to membership, if not for good but at least for the foreseeable future, the situation will worsen further. The fact that we were fully engaged in the work on preparing for the EMU in the mid-1990s means that we have good personal contacts, which are valuable in particular during difficult crisis and negotiating situations. A new generation of decision-makers, with whom we do not have the same relationship, will gradually enter the system. The allowances made by many countries and colleagues while expecting that we would soon join will no longer be made. The EU enlargement eastwards will also increase the group of countries involved and we will become less interesting. In addition, we will miss a formative stage in connection with the enlargement. Once it has been completed, the situation will in many ways be more fixed.  Conclusion I have discussed in my talk three questions that have arisen in the EMU debate. All three are connected in some way to the operations of the Riksbank. A brief summary of my conclusions is: (cid:1)(cid:2)The European Central Bank is sometimes depicted as an institution completely different from the Riksbank. I think this is wrong. Of course there are some differences in working methods, although these have declined recently. However, the similarities in the policy pursued are much greater than the differences. We are both children of the successful German central bank, the Bundesbank. We have sprung from the same intellectual model, where the target is price stability, the management are appointed by the political system and the actual work is done at an arm’s length from party politics.  (cid:1)(cid:2)In my opinion, the value of conducting a national interest rate and exchange rate policy is exaggerated in the EMU debate. On the other hand, it is conceivable that situations might arise where strongly stabilising fiscal policy measures are necessary. It would then be necessary to find institutional solutions to help the government and parliament to make the necessary long-term decisions and to do so even in situations where they may be politically difficult and even risky. Here I think it is possible to draw on some experiences of the Riksbank’s actions in recent years. Clear targets, transparent analyses and discussions, combined with regular assessments, can put pressure on the political system to take action in time. (cid:1)(cid:2)As representative of the Riksbank, I have been able to experience at first hand the closed doors to the meeting rooms of Europe and the fact that we have lost influence. During the early years, when the ECB was being built up, we sat at the decision-making table. When it then became clear that we and the Brits intended to remain on one side, our colleagues quite simply decided to postpone a number of important issues where we had strong views, including the monetary policy framework with inflation targeting, transparency, etc. This also applied to various payment system issues, where our position was weaker on the outside. If we now say (cid:147)no(cid:148) to membership, if not for good but at least for the foreseeable future, the situation will worsen further, as I have described already. I think this would be very unfortunate. 
 BIS Review 39/2003 1 Willem F Duisenberg: Testimony before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, Brussels, 10 September 2003. *      *      * It is my pleasure to appear before your Committee here today. As usual, I shall start my testimony with the ECB’s assessment of recent economic and monetary developments. I should then like to turn to issues relating to euro banknotes and conclude my opening remarks with a few personal observations. 1. Economic and monetary developments Starting with our assessment of the economic environment, the data that has become available over recent months has confirmed that real economic activity in the euro area was very weak in the first half of 2003, with a slight quarterly decline in real GDP growth in the second quarter according to Eurostat’s first estimate. At the same time, indications of an upturn in economic activity starting in the second half of the year have strengthened. In fact, survey data and financial market developments reflect an improvement in confidence. The expectation of a gradual economic recovery starting this year and strengthening in 2004 is in line with all the forecasts and projections which have recently become available. Both external and domestic factors continue to support the expected pick-up in economic activity. As regards the external factors, the economic recovery which is already under way in several parts of the world should lead to an increase in euro area export demand. This development should counteract the effects of the loss of price competitiveness brought about by the past appreciation of the euro. Furthermore, real disposable income should be positively affected by terms of trade effects stemming from the past appreciation of the euro. Moreover, ongoing adjustment efforts by companies to enhance competitiveness and profitability should improve the conditions for an economic upswing. In this respect, the low level of interest rates strengthens incentives to invest. As a consequence of recent developments, downside risks to the main scenario of a gradual economic recovery have declined, although they have not disappeared. Macroeconomic imbalances in some regions of the world still persist. Although these may not affect the short-term economic dynamics, they constitute a risk over the longer term. In addition, oil price developments may also pose a risk to economic activity. As regards prices, Eurostat’s flash estimate for annual HICP inflation in August was 2.1%. Annual HICP inflation is likely to hover around, or be slightly above, 2% for the remainder of 2003, not least as oil price developments imply some upward pressure in the short term. Beyond the short term, we continue to expect annual inflation rates to fall below 2% in 2004, stabilising at levels consistent with price stability. This expectation is based on the assumption of moderate wage developments in the context of a gradual economic recovery. Moreover, the significant past strengthening of the external value of the euro should continue to have lagged effects which will limit upward pressure on prices, despite some recent declines in the level of the euro exchange rate. Over longer time horizons, inflation expectations in the euro area seem to be well anchored at levels below but close to 2%. As regards our monetary analysis, monetary growth has remained strong in recent months. As a consequence, there is significantly more liquidity available in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth. This high excess liquidity is partly due to portfolio shifts and an increase in precautionary savings. However, the low levels of interest rates have contributed to the high demand for liquid assets. The current level of interest rates is also counterbalancing the negative impact of subdued economic growth on credit demand. In fact, the growth of loans to the private sector has stabilised at relatively robust levels since the beginning of the year. At the current juncture, the ample liquidity is not expected to translate into inflationary pressure. However, monetary growth needs to be closely monitored, as the significant amount of excess liquidity could become a source of concern if it were to persist when economic activity strengthens significantly. 
 2 BIS Review 39/2003 To sum up, and cross-checking the information from the two pillars, our economic analysis confirms the expectation that price pressures will remain subdued in the context of a gradual economic recovery and moderate import price and wage developments. The strong monetary expansion should not, in view of the economic situation, be seen as adversely affecting this outlook for the time being. Overall, therefore, the medium-term outlook for price stability remains favourable. Against this background, the key ECB interest rates are considered appropriate at present. Clearly, the Governing Council will continue to carefully monitor all factors that might affect this assessment. Taking a longer-term view, the current level of short-term nominal interest rates in the euro area is the lowest recorded over the past 50 years. More importantly, the low level of interest rates is at present associated with inflation expectations that are compatible with price stability. This has not often been the case in the past.  In this respect, history tells us that loose monetary and fiscal policies lead to entrenched inflation processes, which in the end had adverse consequences for economic growth and employment. If we were to learn a lesson from the 1970s and the 1980s, it would be that there are high economic costs to be paid in fighting inflation once it has become entrenched. I should recall that it was this realisation which led to the worldwide conviction that monetary and economic policies should be stability-oriented. If I look back at the early years of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), I can say that I am satisfied with what has been achieved by the monetary policy of the ECB. Inflation expectations over this very challenging period indicate that there is public confidence in the fact that price stability in the euro area will be maintained. This confidence constitutes a major achievement which - through a variety of channels - contributes to raising the growth potential of the euro area.  However, I must also confess that other macroeconomic policies have not lived up to expectations.  In the area of fiscal policy, we have seen a process where commitments made have repeatedly been broken. From the start of Stage Three, some countries have not shown sufficient determination to meet one of the key objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact, namely to achieve budgets in balance or surplus over the medium term. As the times of strong economic growth have not been properly used to bring the fiscal position of these countries onto a sustainable basis, it is not surprising that these countries have had problems during the last few years in keeping fiscal deficits below the threshold of 3% of GDP laid down in the Treaty. In this light, I view recent fiscal developments and the discussions surrounding the Stability and Growth Pact with great concern. There is growing evidence that most countries will miss their budgetary targets for 2003 by a significant margin. While the deterioration of budgetary balances mainly reflects thelower than anticipated economic growth, it is worrying that not all countries with severe imbalances have so far introduced sufficient consolidation measures.  The lack of fiscal discipline - and notably the lack of any clear medium-term-oriented consolidation strategies - is a factor weighing adversely on the euro area’s long-term growth prospects. In order to strengthen confidence in the euro area, it is fundamental to maintain the credibility of the institutional and economic underpinnings of EMU and to abide in all respects by the agreed rules of the game. It is essential that, in the budgetary plans currently being prepared for 2004, there be a correction of excessive deficits within the agreed time-frame in the countries concerned. In the other countries with fiscal imbalances, a structural consolidation effort of at least 0.5% of GDP per year is required. All fiscal plans need to be part of a comprehensive and credible medium-term strategy, with an emphasis on expenditure restraint and a growth-oriented restructuring of expenditure.  Another area in which we have seen insufficient progress over recent years is that of structural reforms. While some initiatives are under way, more needs to be done to address structural rigidities in the labour and product markets. I should like to emphasise that the benefits of these reforms for the economic growth potential of the euro area would be substantial. Such reforms are essential to address what is perceived as the euro area’s main economic problem, namely the high level of structural unemployment. While these benefits will be fully reaped over the medium term, I am also convinced that reforms would also support economic growth in the short term, as they would strengthen confidence and make the euro area more attractive to investors. 2. Issues relating to euro banknotes Let me now turn to issues relating to euro banknotes. Continuing a practice that was established last year, the ECB published, in July, its biannual information on the counterfeiting of the euro. The data 
 BIS Review 39/2003 3 confirmed what was expected from the outset, namely that the counterfeiting figures would increase in the early years of the new currency. In addition, because of its status as an international currency, the euro may be considered a more attractive target than any of the legacy currencies were. However, despite these factors, and although it may be too early to identify any reliable trends, euro counterfeiting has currently settled at a level far lower than the aggregate level of counterfeiting of the legacy currencies in 2001. This factor should be clearly emphasised, since much of the public reporting in this regard has been exaggerated or distorted. The euro banknotes are designed to be among the best in the world when it comes to counterfeit resistance. Moreover, in line with the normal practice of central banks, preparatory work has begun on developing even better protected banknotes. These may be issued towards the end of this decade. However, even the most sophisticated security devices will be useless if the banknote user makes no effort to check them. Therefore, our message to the public in our press releases on counterfeiting has consistently been that there is no undue cause for alarm about counterfeiting, but that the public should remain vigilant in checking banknotes using the FEEL-LOOK-TILT test, thereby denying criminals any chance of succeeding in their attempts at counterfeiting. This remains my message.  In addition, we are also trying to identify any need for the provision of additional information and training to the general public and, in particular, to professional cash handlers, i.e. cashiers of shops and banks, which are normally frontline targets for counterfeiters. At the same time, the ECB has been stepping up the institutional framework for combating counterfeits. In this context, I should like to refer to the close co-operation on anti-counterfeiting issues that has been established between the ECB, Europol and the European Commission. Moreover, co-operation agreements are about to be concluded between the ECB and Interpol, and between the ECB and national central banks of acceding countries. Before concluding, let me make a final remark. As you know, this is my last testimony before your Committee. I have had the privilege to preside over the ECB for the past five years, guiding it from its very inception through a number of crucial - and successful - stages, such as the introduction of the euro in 1999 and, three years later, the euro cash changeover. Both events were, in my view, major steps towards a Europe (cid:147)united ever more closely(cid:148), and I am honoured to have served the European public and the cause of European integration during these times.  Madam Chairman, Honourable Committee Members, let me convey to all of you my sincere thanks for our very fruitful co-operation over the past few years. While we may not always have agreed on all issues, I believe that our relationship was marked by mutual confidence and a truly co-operative spirit. I have enjoyed working with you and wish you, as well as my successor, much success with the challenges that lie ahead. 
 BIS Review 38/2003 1 Lars Nyberg: Developments in the property market  Speech by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, at the seminar on properties, Malm(cid:246), 2 September 2003. *      *      * I would like to begin by thanking you for the opportunity to come to Malm(cid:246) and speak about the Riksbank’s view of developments in the property market. Of course, these developments are not only of interest to those of us present today. They are important to all people, as movements in property prices have significance both for the real economy and financial developments in Sweden. When property prices rise, we feel more financially secure and increase our consumption, which leads to a rise in employment and growth. We might even borrow a bit more from the bank if we can. Normally, there is no harm in this. But there is a limit, of course, to the burden of debt households can bear without giving rise to worrisome risks. Should the debt of commercial property companies also swell, it could entail risks for the stability of the entire banking system, a point that was illustrated so well during the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. On account of this, the Riksbank monitors developments in the property market carefully. We usually divide it into two segments, which give rise to different questions and reflections. The first segment is the housing market. Since 1997, housing prices have risen by just over 50 per cent, measured in current prices. The price boom has continued in spite of the generally weak economic activity of the last two years. This is a new experience which differs from previous business cycles, when prices have tended to recede during periods of economic decline. Similar developments have occurred in other countries, for example in the US, England and Holland.  The situation could appear worrying, particularly given that the rise in housing prices has been accompanied by an increase in household indebtedness. The upsurge in prices has raised questions about the healthiness of this trend. Are the price rises in the Swedish housing market the result of a bubble? Are the higher levels of household indebtedness sustainable? The Riksbank’s view is that the current price developments in the housing market do not reflect any speculative expectations of future price rises which would warrant the term (cid:147)bubble(cid:148). Nor is household indebtedness a bigger problem than usual for this stage of the business cycle. I will explain this in a moment. The other segment is the market for commercial property. Here, it is primarily prices for office premises which have displayed a different trend to that seen in the housing market. Commercial property prices have adjusted to the economic slowdown. In Sweden, both prices and rents have fallen since 2000 at the same time as vacancy rates have risen. I myself do not believe that these price declines are a concern from an economic perspective, as was very much the case with the property crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. Although some similarities do exist between the two, the differences nevertheless outweigh them, and I will be coming back to these later. I will also be looking ahead and briefly discussing the driving forces behind price developments in the property market. Developments in the housing market In principle, there are two different methods to explain rapid price changes. The first approach is based on the fundamental driving forces that govern prices, and explains price changes through changes in these variables. Such fundamental factors include interest rate levels, household income and the production of new homes. The second approach assumes instead that prices are not governed by these fundamental driving forces, but rather are based on expectations of future price rises. Such a situation is usually referred to as a (cid:147)bubble(cid:148). A recent example of this is the surge in prices seen in IT shares during the latter part of the 1990s. The rate of increase observed then proved gradually to be unrelated to fundamental driving forces but rather to unrealistic expectations of a trend that never materialised. When this eventually became evident, prices plummeted. So the price rises seen during a bubble do not mirror fundamental factors but simply reflect expectations of future price increases. Investors become involved in a process of speculation where 
 2 BIS Review 38/2003 estimates of future cash flow are no longer of importance and price rises are instead assumed to be the trend. If you buy today, you will always be able to sell at a better price tomorrow. Where the housing market is concerned, however, there is reason to question whether a bubble is possible at all. This is because most people do not purchase a home primarily as an investment but rather as a place to live. Consequently, a house buyer neither thinks nor behaves as an investor speculating on a quick and persistent rise in prices. There can hardly be many people who buy a home solely because they expect to gain financially through a rise in house prices! So assuming that speculation on future price increases doesn’t exist, a bubble should quite simply not be able to occur. Some of you might now be thinking that this is just a convenient academic approach to the issue. After all, we have witnessed rapid price increases and even faster declines in the housing market, for example for tenant-owned apartments in metropolitan areas during the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. In principle, I would be prepared to agree, if it proved impossible to explain the price rises with fundamental factors. In order to see if there are fundamental factors that could explain the recent price increases, it makes sense to look at the driving forces that could have been important for house prices, i.e. interest rates, primarily the post-tax real interest rate, household disposable income, the supply of housing and the demand that results from people moving to metropolitan areas in particular. As regards interest rates, both real and nominal rates have fallen continuously since the mid 1990s. For households this has entailed significantly lower mortgage costs. At the end of 1992 the banks’ average nominal lending rate to households was just over 15 per cent and inflation stood at just over 2 per cent. Now, the average lending rate is around 6 per cent, while inflation has remained at about the same level. So households can incur more than double the amount of debt today and still have lower debt-servicing costs. The favourable economic climate from the mid 1990s also contributed to a drop in unemployment, on the one hand, and an increase in wages on the other. All in all, this led to a rise in household disposable income. Moreover, disposable income has continued to increase during the period of relatively weak economic activity in recent years. This has been mainly due to unemployment remaining low, in spite of the economic slowdown. So low interest rates and high growth in household disposable income are two fundamental factors that could explain the rise in prices in the housing market. Furthermore, there is no excess supply in the housing market similar to that seen at the beginning of the 1990s when housing construction was encouraged through various kinds of grants and tax subsidies. Instead, there is very little construction of housing today, and discussions are concerned rather with how to step this up. In addition to the low level of housing construction, demand for housing has risen mainly in metropolitan areas due to the greater numbers moving to these regions during the latter part of the 1990s. It is not surprising that a relatively constant, low supply, as well as high demand, should have contributed to the substantial price rises. Thus, low interest rates, an increase in disposable income and a low supply of new housing, together with high demand, are the fundamental factors that I believe have driven the rate of price increases from the mid 1990s. They also suffice to show that current price rises should not be described as an expectations-driven (cid:147)bubble(cid:148). The same analysis can be performed for several other countries experiencing similar developments in their housing market, in particular the US. So did we have a housing market bubble during the crisis years at the beginning of the 1990s? I don’t really believe that we did, at least not in the sense that homes were being bought for the purpose of speculation with a view to being sold once prices had risen further. Yes, prices rose sharply, especially in metropolitan regions, but these were due to reasons of a fundamental nature. Households’ willingness to pay increased in line with their income during the economic upswing, the deregulation of the credit market led to the removal of some financing obstacles, and the supply of housing was, in the short term, highly inflexible. This is enough to fuel a steep rise in prices. When demand subsequently waned as a result of a deterioration in household finances, at the same time as real interest rates rose and the supply of housing - both new and old - increased, prices fell again. Even substantial price movements can have natural explanations and do not have to be due to unrealistic expectations that are first raised and then dashed. Households have continued to borrow from banks and mortgage institutions throughout the economic decline, which is not the normal pattern of behaviour, but this is of course due to low interest rates. Their debt burden has grown and raised questions about whether we are heading back towards an 
 BIS Review 38/2003 3 imbalance that sooner or later will have to be corrected. However, I myself do not believe that household debt per se constitutes any immediate source of concern. Households’ debt ratio, i.e. debt as a percentage of income, is just over 110 per cent. However, as a result of the historically low interest rates, it appears that households’ debt-servicing costs will continue to be manageable. The interest ratio, i.e. households’ debt-servicing costs in relation to disposable income, is today barely 5 per cent. The situation for Swedish households is therefore considerably more favourable than at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s. At that time, the credit expansion which was caused partly by the deregulation of the credit market resulted in a debt ratio of around 130 per cent, while the interest ratio increased rapidly over a couple of years from around 6 per cent to almost 10 per cent. However, there is no doubt that the recent rise in indebtedness has made households increasingly sensitive to changes in interest rates. Households tend to focus on their cash flow and are unperturbed as long as their debt-servicing costs can be accommodated in their monthly budget. But an interest rate rise of just a few percentage points would have a much bigger impact on cash flow today than when levels were around 15 per cent. An interest rate rise of four to six per cent would cause monthly costs to increase by 50 per cent. Higher mortgage rates could therefore prompt households to increase their saving and reduce their consumption more than expected or intended. Hopefully we will be able to avoid sharp, quick interest rate rises in our conduct of monetary policy, although mortgage rates are also influenced by events outside Sweden. To some extent though, the effect of any increases in rates could be alleviated by the fact that an increasing number of households have recently been switching over to fixed-rate loans. Developments in the commercial property market Prices in the commercial property market have been driven by somewhat different forces than in the housing market. The trend here has also been more closely correlated to the level of economic activity, with prices falling over the last three years. However, the price decline in Malm(cid:246) [9 per cent] has been considerably gentler than in Stockholm [24 per cent] or Gothenburg [18 per cent]. These declines have been mainly caused by lower rents, which essentially have been a result of lower demand for office premises due to the subdued economic activity. It also makes sense that Malm(cid:246) has been affected less than the other major cities given that the slowdown has not been as severe here. The rapid rise in prices and their subsequently rapid decline points to a trend not all that dissimilar from that experienced during the property crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. Nevertheless, there are many differences between the two situations. There is no doubt that we experienced a bubble at the beginning of the 1990s, when prices largely lost their relationship to fundamentals and were instead underpinned by expectations of future price rises. For a period of time the direct yield on property was 8 percentage points lower than the yield on a government bond. So investors must have expected prices to increase a good deal more than 8 per cent in order to compensate them for the risk of investing in property rather than bonds. In this case, you can really say that expectations of price rises were high! This is not the situation today. Speculation in construction was also less prevalent during the upswing at the end of the 1990s than during the rise in activity a decade earlier. Production of property has been relatively low, and projects have had pre-contracted tenants to a greater extent. In addition, the property crisis at the beginning of the 1990s was affected significantly by the structural changes that occurred during the period. The deregulation of the credit market together with the changes in economic policy required substantial adjustments in the market. So the present situation is not a cause for concern in the same way as the situation at the beginning of the 1990s. Some thoughts on the future The fact that the situation is not a source of concern does not mean that I am predicting a significant recovery in property prices. An increase in economic activity will of course stimulate demand, which sooner or later will apply upward pressure on prices. But at the same time I can see several factors which could restrain a rise in property prices, especially with regard to office premises. 
 4 BIS Review 38/2003 Firstly, there is a risk that demand for office premises will be weaker than the general level of demand in the economy. From the mid 1990s, there was a gradual improvement in economic activity in Sweden, which resulted in higher employment in general, but particularly within office-intensive businesses such as IT and telecommunications. So the increase in demand for office premises was partly attributable to economic conditions in general, but also to especially favourable conditions within office-intensive businesses in particular. The subsequent slowdown in activity also hit some of these businesses hardest, which affected demand for office premises. Thus, a recovery in demand for office premises would not only be associated with a revival in general economic activity but also in activity within these office-intensive businesses. Irrespective of business area, it also appears that companies today, unlike at the end of the 1990s when expectations of growth and expansion were high, are seeking to reduce the area of office space per employee. This is one way for them to adapt their costs to new, more strained economic conditions. All in all, these aspects suggest that demand for office space may not recover at the same rate as the general level of activity. Secondly, unlike single-family dwellings for instance, commercial properties are a form of investment. Consequently, prices of commercial properties are affected more than single-family dwellings by the return on other investments. In times of uncertainty, property has often been seen as an attractive alternative to equities in particular, and investors tend to increase the share of property in their portfolios, thus leading to upward pressure on prices. According to Swedish Property Index, the return on property in Sweden over the past three years has exceeded that on equities. Moreover, in 2000 and 2001, the return on property surpassed that on all alternative forms of investment. Last year, however, the return on property was exceeded by that on bonds and Treasury bills. Thus, in a more optimistic economic climate, there is a risk that investment in property will appear less attractive than in equities, for example. In such a situation, as investors reduce the share of property in their portfolios, there is a risk that prices will not rise as much as warranted by the higher demand alone. Consequently, this is a factor that could restrain property prices during an upswing. Summary and conclusions The markets for housing and commercial property differ in terms of both their developments in recent years and the challenges facing them in the near future. In the housing market, prices have continued to rise despite the recent economic slowdown. The market for commercial property has instead undergone a period of adjustment towards lower prices and rents since 2000. By all appearances, the price rises in the housing market have been due to changes in the fundamental factors of significance for house prices. To speak of a housing market bubble is therefore not very constructive. Persistently low interest rates, strong growth in disposable income and low growth in the supply of residential property justifies current price levels, in spite of the weak economy. In the event of an increase in activity and higher income, which we all hope and believe will happen, there is no reason to expect a broad decline in housing prices. Of course, local differences in the production of new homes, for instance, could have an impact on prices. In the commercial property market, where rents and prices have already adjusted to a different demand climate, the price increases that naturally follow a rise in economic activity could take time, particularly as there appears to be considerable excess supply of office space in various locations. Moreover, property as a form of investment is usually considered less attractive when the economy turns around in earnest. 
 BIS Review 38/2003 1 T T Mboweni: Inflation targeting in South Africa Speech by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the BIS/SARB Reserve Management Seminar dinner, South African Reserve Bank, Pretoria, 2 September 2003. *      *      * It is my pleasure to welcome you, our guests and Reserve Bank personnel, to a dinner I gladly host in your honour. I know that you have formally been welcomed to the Reserve Bank this morning by Mr Plenderleith. But at a seminar of this stature, co-hosted by our good friends at the Bank for International Settlements, I, as Governor, felt it correct to re-iterate a warm welcome. I am especially delighted that we are able to co-host this reserve management seminar as I believe that all of us can learn from each other’s experiences regarding this important central-bank function. I know you have had a long day at the seminar and, I believe, a productive one, so I shall keep my speech brief. I have chosen not to focus on reserve management in the South African Reserve Bank, as the topic was covered to some degree in the seminar this afternoon, but rather to talk to you briefly about inflation targeting. As you probably know, inflation targeting, initially adopted by New Zealand in 1990, has been the choice of a growing number of central banks in both industrialised and emerging countries. As on November 2000, authors Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel had counted 19 inflation-targeting countries. Since then, the numbers have increased. Precisely by how many is debatable and will depend on the precise definition of inflation-targeting countries but I note that the merits of inflation targeting continue to be debated in the US. Inflation targeting in South Africa was formally introduced on 23 February 2000 with the announcement of a 3 to 6 per cent target for 2002. At that time, CPIX inflation - the rate we target - stood at 7 per cent. (Just for your information, we define CPIX as the CPI excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds, for the historical metropolitan and other urban areas.) The target range of 3 to 6 per cent set was an ambitious one. Whilst there may be debates today about whether the target range was set at the correct level, it is important to note that for both the credibility of the central bank, as well as the management of expectations in respect of inflation being a problem, the target range had to be set at a level which would properly demonstrate commitment to lowering inflation. In spite of the above-mentioned quite ambitious target, by September 2001, twelve-month CPIX inflation had decelerated to 5,8% per cent and many analysts thought that the 2002 target would be met fairly easily. To say the least, circumstances changed! The exchange rate depreciation of some 37 per cent in 2001 - that is another interesting story! - mostly in the closing stages of the year, was significantly responsible for pushing up CPIX inflation up to a peak of 11,3% per cent in November 2002. On 12 September 2002, the Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee had announced the fourth and final 100 basis points increase for the year of the Bank’s repurchase rate. As you may well imagine, I was not everyone’s most-favourite Governor! Fortunately, inflationary pressures have abated, partly related to the rand’s appreciation since December 2001 and as reflected in the year-on-year change in CPIX falling to 6,6 per cent in July 2003, and the MPC has seen fit to lower the repo rate. On 14 August 2003, following the most recent meeting of the MPC, the repo rate was further reduced by 100bp to 11 per cent effective from 15 August 2003. (Should there be anyone amongst you interested in the factors weighing on this decision, I refer you to the statement of the Monetary Policy Committee which is on the Reserve Bank website). Whilst a Governor is certainly more popular during a declining interest-rate cycle, rest assured there were critics who felt that the Bank had not been bold enough and should have, at least, reduced the repo rate by 150 basis points! Technically, what the Reserve Bank is doing could more accurately be described as inflation-forecast targeting. Given the roughly 12 to 24-month lag between interest-rate changes and their having their full impact felt on inflation, the repurchase rate is set at a level judged to be consistent with bringing inflation to within the target range within an 12- to 24-month time horizon. I am referring to the intricacies of the transmission mechanism, the clear understanding of which represents the single biggest challenge for any inflation-targeting central bank. Inflation targets of 3 to 6 per cent for 2004 and 2005 have been set by the Government, and guide current policy formulation. Given the lags, 
 2 BIS Review 38/2003 current policy changes clearly have virtually no impact on the 2003 inflation outcome; the focus is further ahead. With the CPIX again approaching the target range, it is relatively easily to somewhat superficially argue the merits of an inflation-targeting regime. Some disadvantages of inflation targeting must, however, be acknowledged. Whilst easily understood in terms of its objective, it is a complicated approach, more demanding and more difficult to implement than a monetary framework based on targeting monetary growth or a more discretionary framework. It implies greater reliance on forward indicators of inflation and a continuous assessment of the relationship between the instruments of monetary policy and the inflation target. Where forecasts turn out to be wrong, even if for completely unforeseeable reasons, the central bank’s credibility could be impaired. Of course, the counter-argument being that it simply makes visible the uncertainty that would remain hidden in other monetary-policy frameworks. Inflation targeting, if pursued at any costs, runs the risk of inefficient output stabilisation. Significant supply shocks to the economy such as sharp oil price movements, could require very large monetary-policy adjustments to bring inflation back inside the target range within the stated time horizon. For such exceptional events, some discretion and patience in re-achieving the target range should be allowed for. In this regard I wish to confirm that the Reserve Bank generally views it inappropriate to resort to the escape clause, and would rather provide an explanation to any deviation from the target range once the final outcome of the CPIX average for that year had been published. This view is held so that the market has no doubt regarding the Bank’s vigilance and commitment to achieving its targets. Indeed, following the CPIX average for the year 2002, which could only be calculated early in 2003, where the average exceeded the target, an explanation was provided in the Monetary Policy Review document of April 2003. (The bi-annual Monetary Policy Review is also available on our website). The advantages of inflation targeting are also worth highlighting. Firstly, transparency - the concept is easily understandable, with the ultimate policy objective translated into an explicit target value. Secondly, inflation targeting provides enhanced clarity about the objective of monetary policy, which is conducive to sound planning in both private and public sectors. Thirdly, the framework provides for improved accountability of the Reserve Bank. It eliminates the need to rely on a stable relationship between the money stock and inflation, which has become increasingly difficult to identify; inflation targeting enhances economic policy co-ordination with government and the central bank both publicly committed to the same inflation target. And lastly inflation targeting provides an anchor for inflation expectations and price and wage setting, thus reducing the friction which arises from widely divergent inflation expectations. May I conclude with the comment that, whilst inflation targeting is certainly no panacea, the Reserve Bank still regards it as the most appropriate framework for achieving relative price stability. I quote from our Annual Economic report 2003, released last week: (cid:147)Sound and consistent price signals are invaluable in directing resources towards their most efficient uses(cid:148); achieving this goal is, we believe, our most important contribution we can make towards optimal economic growth and development. Finally, I also, as Governor, thank the BIS most sincerely for their invaluable role in co-hosting the seminar. Our relationship with the BIS is excellent and we have derived much value in our interaction with this much-esteemed institution over many years. I hope you, as delegates, will extract maximum value from the expertise which is available to be shared. May you all safely return home, and your return on your FX assets be stable and gratifying! I thank you. 
 BIS Review 38/2003 1 Joseph Yam: Financial stability issues, dollarisation and price dynamics Opening remarks by Mr Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at HKIMR Summer Workshop 2003, Hong Kong, 27 August 2003. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to welcome you to this first (cid:147)HKIMR Summer Workshop in Money and Finance(cid:148). This is an event that we hope from now on will take place annually. The organisers have put together an interesting programme with three papers dealing with issues that are of current or potential importance for Hong Kong. The first paper, to be presented by Professor Charles Goodhart, focuses on financial stability issues. These issues are of particular interest to an international financial centre, as the success or otherwise in the maintenance of financial stability, and therefore the efficiency of financial intermediation, not only has an impact upon the domestic economy but also on the economy of the region that centre serves.  The second paper, to be presented by Professor Genberg, deals with the subject of dollarisation. Dollarisation, in the traditional sense of the US dollar replacing or displacing the Hong Kong dollar as a medium of transaction in respect of domestic economic activity, is in my opinion unlikely to occur here in Hong Kong. This is notwithstanding the operation of a currency board system with the US dollar as the anchor currency. But, from another perspective, we are seeing continuing economic integration between Hong Kong and Mainland China. We are also noticing the inevitable trends, on the one hand, of greater use of the Hong Kong dollar on the Mainland and, on the other hand, of continuing financial liberalisation on the Mainland: this will, in the fullness of time, culminate in the RMB becoming freely convertible. The subject of dollarisation, whether the predominant currency is the Hong Kong dollar or the RMB, is a fascinating one.  On a different dimension, in our attempt to enhance our status as an international financial centre, we have adopted the strategy of providing a financial infrastructure to facilitate the conduct of international financial intermediation activities in Hong Kong. This financial infrastructure is characterised by a platform on which financial activities can be transacted and settled real time in this time zone in the major currencies without, for example, Herstatt risk. We now have Real Time Gross Settlement systems for the US dollar and the euro, and of course the Hong Kong dollar. And the lead-time for the inclusion of another currency, such as the RMB, in our settlement platform, if that is considered appropriate, could be as little as six months. If this strategy is successful, it is not difficult to envisage an increasing proportion of the balance sheet of the banking system denominated in foreign currencies, and the greater use of, say, the US dollar in both the equity and debt markets. I am not sure if this is a dimension covered in Professor Genberg’s paper on Endogenous Dollarisation, but it is of particular relevance to Hong Kong.  The third paper, to be presented by Professor Kumhof, deals with issues regarding price dynamics. Professor Kumhof’s paper focuses on pricing policies and inflation inertia, at a time when we are experiencing deflation in Hong Kong: I am sure, however, that there are insights that we can derive from the paper and the discussion. Research on price formation is high on the agenda of the HKIMR and the HKMA, and possibly in academic and other organisations active in economic research in Hong Kong. We have had deflation for some five years now and we are still debating the relative importance of cyclical and structural factors behind that deflation. There is also debate on whether measures could and should be taken to limit the damaging effects of deflation, notwithstanding the fact that Hong Kong is a highly externally oriented economy. Views on price dynamics will contribute to these debates.  As you know, the HKIMR was established by the HKMA. This reflects the importance we attach to thorough analysis of monetary and financial issues that Hong Kong is facing. Developments in the local, regional and global economies provide many opportunities for Hong Kong, but also serve as potential sources of risks. It is therefore critical that we actively seek to understand these developments. To promote economic research of the highest quality, it is essential that the research activities of the HKIMR are, and are seen to be, carried out freely, without interference from interested parties, including the HKMA. It is therefore not desirable for the HKMA to exercise control of the 
 2 BIS Review 38/2003 HKIMR’s day-to-day activities. But, of course, the professional quality and academic integrity of its activities need to be monitored and ensured. For this reason, a Council of Advisors, whose members are all distinguished economists working in and outside of Hong Kong, has been established. Many of them are in fact here today. The role of the Council is to ensure the quality of the HKIMR’s activities and to alert the Board of Directors if shortcomings become apparent. While the relationship between the HKIMR and the HKMA remains close, the HKIMR does enjoy independence in research matters. One consequence of this is that the views expressed in its different publications do not necessarily reflect those of the HKMA.  One of the distinguished members of the HKIMR’s Council of Advisors is our first speaker today, Charles Goodhart, and it is my great pleasure to introduce him. It was very much his visit to Hong Kong that gave the HKIMR the idea of organising this workshop.  As you all know, Charles is one of the world’s foremost monetary economists and an expert on central banking issues. But what some of you may know is that he has had a very long involvement in, and influence on, monetary issues here in Hong Kong. This began almost exactly twenty years ago when Hong Kong, suffering from a crisis of confidence in its political future, and without any effective form of monetary control, was on the brink of a financial meltdown. The exchange rate was depreciating sharply and Charles was brought in from the Bank of England to advise us on how Hong Kong could be rescued. He gave valuable advice on a proposal to return to a fixed exchange rate system through the currency board arrangement of linking the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar. As you all know, that exchange rate link was subsequently established, in October 1983, and it is still in operation now. It commands a high degree of confidence and credibility. It has served Hong Kong extremely well in the past twenty years. In his advice, Charles also covered other strategic issues of central banking for Hong Kong. As the only remaining person in the public sector continuously involved in this area of work from then until now, I can say with some authority that the views of Charles have exerted much influence on the development of the monetary system of Hong Kong.  I do not know whether you remember, Charles, your piece of advice to the then Financial Secretary, the late Sir John Bremridge, written on 6 October 1983. I have kept a copy of it, and I often refer to it for inspiration in the past twenty years. Fortunately for me, but not perhaps for others, the advice is so highly classified that it will probably never see the light of day. But it should be all right for me to quote from your covering letter to Sir John, where you said: (cid:147)I have put in all the points of substance that I wanted to make, and I hope and believe that they will stand the test of time.(cid:148) They certainly did. And so did your suggestion that it might be desirable for the Exchange Fund in time to adopt (cid:147)more of a feature of a Central Bank(cid:148): hence the HKMA, which was formed ten years after the advice you gave. Of course, we also had the privilege of your involvement over the period from 1990 to 1997 as a member of our board, the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee, and in your occasional trips to Hong Kong.  So, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that I now invite Charles to speak in our first session of this HKIMR first Summer Workshop.  
 BIS Review 38/2003 1 Toshihiko Fukui: Economic activity and recent financial developments in Japan Summary of a speech by Mr Toshihiko Fukui, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting with business people in Nagoya, 3 September 2003. *      *      * I. Current situation of the Japanese economy and policy focuses A. Current conditions Economic activity as a whole has been flat since February this year, as has been described in the Bank of Japan’s Monthly Report of Recent Economic and Financial Developments. Recently, however, we have gradually begun to observe some signs of improvement. For example, machinery orders and the second-quarter GDP have turned out to be better than anticipated, and stock prices continue to rise.  Such domestic developments should be understood in a global context, as economic globalization progresses and the Japanese economy deepens its ties with overseas economies even further.  As you all know, during the first half of this year, the world economy was mired in the adjustment process that followed the IT boom of the 1990s, which came to an end in the fall of 2000. Furthermore, uncertainty about the economic outlook was amplified by the war in Iraq and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in East Asia. Uncertainty about the financial system problem in Japan persisted, and the fall in stock prices, including bank shares, became rather marked.  Fortunately, these uncertainties have decreased since the early summer. The actual operation of the war in Iraq concluded relatively early, and the effects of SARS have been less than many people feared. We have even begun to observe some signs of recovery in the demand for IT-related goods, although we have not yet fully confirmed the extent of their adjustment.  In these circumstances, pessimistic views on the economic outlook have receded, and an increasing number of people have become confident about a rebound of world economic growth from the second half of this year.  For example, in the United States the so-called central tendency of projected real GDP growth for 2003 among members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been revised upward, to 2.5 to 2.75 percent. This projection implies that real GDP growth would rise to the 3 percent level for the second half of 2003, from around 2 percent for the first half. For 2004, the FOMC members predict further acceleration of real GDP growth to 3.75 to 4.75 percent. In Asia, China is most likely to return to a stable growth path after overcoming the negative impact of SARS. With higher dependence on information technologies, the NIEs will expand production as the global demand for IT-related goods recovers, in the United States in particular. There is little likelihood that Europe will be a drag on the global economic recovery, although its economic outlook still seems rather unclear.  Given these overseas developments, the Japanese economy is expected to gradually increase exports and production. In addition to the possible increase in external demand, domestic demand also shows some favorable signs. Planned business fixed investment for fiscal 2003 at the moment is the largest since fiscal 2000, against the backdrop of a substantial increase in corporate profits. Moreover, we see a slightly favorable change in direction in the job and income situation of the household sector, although the situation remains severe.  B. Policy focuses Such a path for Japan’s economic recovery has been within our standard scenario since this spring, and it appears increasingly likely that this scenario will be realized.  However, questions remain as to the strength and breadth of the economic recovery once it is achieved, as well as the risk that the standard scenario may not be realized. In tackling these questions, we should keep three points in focus.  The first focus is the outlook for overseas economies, the U.S. economy in particular. In this regard, we should also pay attention to the global demand for IT-related goods.  
 2 BIS Review 38/2003 Although the U.S. economy is on a mild recovery path led by private consumption, business fixed investment and production generally remain weak, and the labor market condition continues to be severe. With residual adjustment pressure after the bursting of the IT bubble, firms are still rather restrained in their business expansion. In spite of these subdued conditions, we have recently begun to see changes and hopes for improvement. Global demand for PCs, semiconductors, and other IT-related goods is increasing. People strongly hope that a substantial tax reduction and monetary easing will work to accelerate recovery. We will monitor how these changes and hopes are translated into improving business activity and the labor market condition in the United States, and subsequently whether such an improvement has a positive impact on the world economy.  The second focus is the financial market in Japan. Stock prices rebounded from around May, and the Nikkei 225 Stock Average regained the 10,000 level after August 18 as views about the economic outlook turned slightly more favorable. Long-term interest rates also rose. In my view, these movements could be interpreted as the correction of overly pessimistic market expectations in the first half of 2003 amid various uncertainties.  Fundamentally, stock prices and long-term interest rates reflect market views about the economic outlook, so we should strive to correctly understand these views. Having said this, it is also true that markets can often move irregularly in response to a variety of factors. For example, in the United States, the 10-year long-term interest rate rebounded to the mid-4 percent level after falling to around 3 percent in June. As factors behind this gyration, many point to the deterioration of the fiscal balance and the hedging activity of investors in mortgage securities, in addition to changing views about the economic outlook. In Japan, people have already begun to talk about the possibility of overshooting of long-term interest rates, which cannot be justified by economic fundamentals. We will closely monitor financial market developments, including the possibility of large swings in long-term interest rates due to factors other than economic fundamentals.  The third focus is the extent of economic recovery spurred by exports and production amid the persisting problem of excess debt and labor.  The problem of excess debt differs from firm to firm, and industry to industry, but broadly speaking, it is largely a problem for the nonmanufacturing industry. For example, the ratio of net debt to sales has been declining significantly for the past ten years in the manufacturing industry, but remains high in the nonmanufacturing industry due to the delay in adjustment. The nonmanufacturing industry tends to retain various inefficiencies mainly because it has been traditionally less exposed to international competition than the manufacturing industry.  The manufacturing industry is the driving force behind the economic recovery if it is led by exports and production. But, to achieve sustainable growth, it is critically important whether such an initial recovery will lead to the dynamic and forward-looking improvement of the nonmanufacturing industry.  The problem of excess labor is important when we judge whether the recovery of the corporate sector might lead to an increase in private consumption through a rise in income. The Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) has been showing a consistent pattern of excess labor for both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industry since the bursting of the bubble economy. Recent labor statistics also show a continued decline in regular employment. These data suggest persistent pressure for labor market adjustment and continued severe conditions for employment and income.  Looking closely at the latest statistics, it should be noted that we have begun to observe some signs of favorable changes in the labor market. The level of employment ceases to fall if part-time workers are included, and the decline in wages is bottoming out if bonus payments for the summer are taken into account.  II. Conduct of monetary policy In these economic conditions, the Bank has been conducting a quantitative easing policy, maintaining financial market stability and strengthening the momentum for recovery by flexibly providing ample liquidity. Since I became Governor, the Bank has raised the quantitative target for the outstanding balance of current accounts held at the Bank twice, in April and May. Faced with a number of uncertainties, including the war in Iraq, SARS, stock prices, exchange rates, and the problem related to Resona Bank since this spring, we have taken a preemptive approach to monetary policy so that these uncertainties do not jeopardize the not very robust foundation for economic recovery.  
 BIS Review 38/2003 3 The Bank has also made a strong commitment to continue the current monetary easing until the year-on-year increase in the consumer price index (CPI) becomes stably zero or above. This commitment strengthens the policy effect on interest rate stability, as participants in financial markets can anticipate monetary easing as long as the year-on-year increase in the CPI remains negative.  Furthermore, the Bank has been strengthening the transmission mechanism of monetary policy so that the effect of monetary easing permeates through the economy. As part of such efforts, it began purchasing asset-backed securities in August. Underlying assets included not only receivables but also lease and loan assets, which we hope facilitate the funding of small to medium-sized firms. It was quite unusual for the central bank to directly assume the credit risk of the private sector, but we thought such a measure was necessary in light of the prevailing economic conditions, and the state of the financial system and markets.  The Bank has been taking necessary measures, without undue regard for precedent, to return to sustainable growth and overcome deflation, and it will continue to do so.  We should also emphasize stronger global linkage when we examine the problem of deflation, in the same way as economic activity.  Inflation has been declining globally, due mainly to the appropriate conduct of monetary policy and the increasing penetration of emerging countries into market economies. This phenomenon is termed (cid:147)global disinflation.(cid:148) Even if the world economy recovers, there is a strong possibility that inflation will stay at a relatively low level, while the growth rate will increase. In fact, various private-sector forecasts show that for 2004 growth will be higher compared to 2003, and inflation will remain under 2 percent in the United States, Europe, and Asia. In such circumstances, central banks have been implementing monetary policy with more attention to the risk of deflation. For example, the Federal Reserve Board announced in its FOMC statement in August that (cid:147)policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.(cid:148)  Japan is suffering from deflation, a worse problem than disinflation. This makes a stronger case for the Bank to continue implementing an easy monetary policy, compared to other central banks.  III. Revitalization of the corporate sector Stronger global linkage has some bearing on the commonly observed facts that business sentiment has been slow to improve and fixed investment has not become as active as anticipated in various countries under monetary conditions that are easier than in the comparable stage of past business cycles.  This partly reflects residual pressure for adjustment. But it also reflects more intensified competition in the corporate sector together with the progress in globalization, as well as increasing difficulties firms face in sustaining pricing power under the new conditions in which prices are being determined. We may be approaching a stage where corporate profits can only be increased by creating new value-added goods and services, and the investment opportunities for such creation are becoming more difficult to find.  For example, in Japan, the corporate management and economic framework established during the high-growth period are so firmly embedded that it is a very difficult and challenging task to transform them.  In this regard, I have been advocating three directions for firms to pursue with a view to building a new framework for the Japanese economy. The first is to boost their competitiveness and generate new consumer demand by creating new value-added goods and services. The second is to increase their business activity in the expanding Chinese and other Asian markets, and further deepen economic interdependence with them. And the third is to address global challenges such as the development of sustainable energy sources and environmental protection. If firms can make positive contributions in these directions, they will certainly be able to expand the frontier of innovation to revitalize the Japanese economy. I hope that such efforts will place the Japanese economy in a unique position in terms of the sustainable development of the world economy.  
 4 BIS Review 38/2003 IV. Current situation of the financial system and challenges The Japanese financial system, although still facing severe conditions as a whole, is steadily moving toward restoring its effective functioning.  Since last fall, there has been a growing recognition among financial institutions and related parties that an appropriate evaluation of the economic value of nonperforming loans (NPLs), and higher provisioning and more aggressive write-offs of these loans based on such an evaluation, are important in accelerating the disposal of NPLs. Further efforts have been made in this direction. In fiscal 2002, Japanese banks recorded a large net loss for the second consecutive year. This result clearly reflected the severe conditions faced by the Japanese financial system. At the same time, it signified the aggressive disposal of NPLs as shown by the substantial decrease in NPLs outstanding at major banks.  The time has now come to move to the final stage to restore the effective functioning of the financial system, keeping in mind the complete removal of blanket deposit protection scheduled in April 2005.  This removal, in my view, should not be perceived simply as a change in the type of coverage of deposit insurance protection. Instead, it should be recognized as a turning point for financial institutions in the reform of their management. Protection has been provided as a temporary buffer to avoid potential confusion. Following the complete removal, financial institutions must pursue a dynamic management strategy based on their own judgment.  To this end, it is the financial institutions themselves, not the regulatory authorities, that should take the initiative in dealing with NPLs. Moreover, they should redouble their efforts to strengthen their earnings power besides accelerating the disposal of NPLs.  V. Disposal of NPLs and corporate revitalization In addition to the appropriate evaluation, higher provisioning, and more aggressive write-offs in the disposal of NPLs, increasing attention is being paid to the importance of corporate revitalization from the viewpoint of promoting the reform of industrial structure.  The Industrial Revitalization Corporation of Japan (IRCJ), which began operation in May this year, recently decided to support four firms. The IRCJ will subsequently purchase the loan assets of these four firms from lenders other than their main bank, decide on a restructuring plan and then implement it. Individual financial institutions, major banks in particular, are establishing a subsidiary specializing in corporate revitalization. Moreover, we observe an increasing number of cases in which financial institutions set up an internal section specifically devoted to corporate revitalization, and form an alliance with outside experts like lawyers and certified accountants.  The success of corporate revitalization requires a speedy and decisive response on the part of both firms and financial institutions. Some firms with useful technology and expertise find it difficult to improve their business performance because of the large financial legacy from the past. Often these firms, in collaboration with financial institutions, can solve their problem by boldly eliminating unprofitable businesses and concentrating their managerial resources on core businesses. In this regard, it is mutually beneficial for both firms and financial institutions to promote a sufficient dialogue and reach a shared recognition about the present and future of the firms’ management.  To smoothly promote corporate revitalization, we need to improve and expand the market for loan asset liquidation, including NPLs. The expansion would help banks take NPLs off their balance sheets, but it would also invite a variety of investors with diversified risk preferences and expertise into the corporate revitalization business. If the market expands and prices for loan assets are formed efficiently, these prices will indicate the market’s evaluation of corporate revitalization.  VI. Earnings power of financial institutions and a stronger capital position When the effective functioning of the financial system is finally restored, major banks will enjoy strong international competitiveness, and local banks will be able to provide new financial services for regional development. These benefits will only be possible with the strengthening of earnings power.  To strengthen earnings power, individual financial institutions must form their own judgments on a number of issues. For example, how should they change their traditional practice for transactions? 
 BIS Review 38/2003 5 What kind of new businesses should they develop? How should they reorganize their business model? The Bank would like to support the efforts of financial institutions toward this end by providing appropriate advice through on-site examinations and daily monitoring.  In this process, financial institutions must ask themselves whether their capital position is sufficient to pursue a new business model, and if not, they of course need to boost their capital position. Needless to say, financial institutions should raise capital in the markets. In the limited time before the complete removal of blanket deposit protection, however, some may not be able to do so sufficiently. In this case, fundamentally there are two options: either reducing their business scope in line with their existing capital position or accepting the public injection of capital. I think the latter option is desirable under the current conditions in Japan. In other words, we should facilitate the process of restoring the effective functioning of the financial system through a new system of capital injection, which differs from the existing system that seeks to preempt crises.  Conclusion A number of developments indicate that the Japanese economy is moving in a desirable direction, even though it continues to face severe conditions. I believe it is the competitiveness of the private sector, both firms and financial institutions with progressive technology and expertise, that will bring about the reemergence of a truly strong Japanese economy. The Bank stands ready to provide full support to the private sector’s efforts toward this end by maintaining an easy monetary policy.  
 BIS Review 37/2003 1 Eva Srejber: Growth and competition - lessons from the past Speech by Ms Eva Srejber, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Sparbanken Gripen, B(cid:229)stad, 25 August 2003. *      *      * Thank you for the invitation to come here and speak on the occasion of Sparbanken Gripen(cid:146)s 150th anniversary. In my speech today, I intend to attempt to draw some conclusions from the experiences of our economic history during this period. One of my conclusions is that Swedish growth has been stimulated during the periods when we have allowed the market economy to operate under clear and fixed game rules, including a stable framework for both fiscal policy and monetary policy. If these conditions have not existed, we have paid a price in the form of weaker economic growth. This speech does not contain any signals regarding current monetary policy. The past 150 years have been an exciting time, in particular the first part of this period. This was when Sweden changed from being a remote, developing country with a high infant mortality rate, widespread poverty and starvation, into a prominent industrial nation. Around 1850 Sweden entered into a dynamic period of rapid development and change. A wave of liberalisation swept across the country and opened up important markets. GDP growth amounted to more than 2 per cent a year, which was twice as high as the growth rate during the first half of the 19th century. A doubling of the GDP growth rate might not sound particularly exciting, but over time it has very major effects. An increase in the GDP growth rate from one to two per cent entails the standard of living doubling within 35 years instead of 70 years. For Sweden the stronger growth rate during the second half of the 19th century meant that we emerged from the developing country stage. A number of factors contributed to this development. Free trade was an important element. Our exports abroad were central to this process, which was of course facilitated by the development of the railway system. During the first decades after 1850, there were three main export products contributing to a very rapid export upturn; oats, iron and timber. The importance of exports of oats from the southern part of Sweden is something of a curiosity. Oats were the fuel of that time. All of the horses providing transport in industrial cities like London required oats and much of this came from G(cid:246)taland. The construction of the railway, as well as investment in industry, housing construction and agriculture naturally required capital. This was mainly obtained from abroad. Sweden was a typical example of a country with an expansionary economy making use of saving in other parts of Europe. This borrowing from abroad was on a very large scale and, prior to the outbreak of the First World War, Sweden was probably the most indebted nation of the time. High level of international mobility If one looks at this period in diagram form, it is quite striking how much growth varied, even if a five-year sliding average is used. The fluctuations in economic activity were considerable and this of course put households in a vulnerable position, as there was broadly speaking no social welfare system at that time. Although living conditions improved rapidly, they were still insufficient for many people. There was extensive emigration. However, a large number of these emigrants returned to Sweden and we had a widespread interchange with other countries. There were very few limitations to international mobility for people, capital, products and ideas. If we instead look at price developments, we can observe average low rates of price increase around 2 per cent a year during this time, and during the period as whole. However, there are also substantial variations. There were general price falls - deflation - on a number of occasions. Deflation is normally associated with very large shocks such as those during the 1930s depression in the USA and Germany, but at the end of the 19th century, there were also price falls in Sweden during an otherwise favourable economic climate. One important explanation for this is that deflation is not necessarily caused by weak demand in the economy. Rapid productivity growth can also generate a price fall and this was what occurred periodically during the second half of the 19th century. In these situations deflation need not be the bugbear to economic development that it is often made out to be. On the other hand, if we move forward a few years to the period during and after the First World War, we do see large shocks - falling GDP combined with very high inflation, followed by severe deflation at 
 2 BIS Review 37/2003 the beginning of the 1920s. This was when Sweden experienced its most severe economic crisis, rather than during the 1930s as was the case in the USA and Germany, for instance. If we move forward to the post-war period, this was a unique time of high and constant growth. During the period following the Second World War and up to the 1970s, standards of living rose at a record rate throughout the world. An interesting fact is that although growth in Sweden during this period was higher than it had been at any other time, it was nevertheless rather low in an international comparison. Many European countries, including our Scandinavian neighbours, grew at an even more rapid rate. However, from the 1970s the problems increased. Growth waned and inflation rose. We managed to temporarily stimulate growth by means of substantial devaluations, but there was no proper follow-up and the economy overheated, only to turn around entirely at the beginning of the 1990s, resulting in extensive problems for the financial sector. Since then we have had a decade or so with better growth and more balanced developments. The average growth rate during these years was just over 3 per cent. This was very different from the average growth we had during the previous ten years. During the transition phase between these periods a number of important changes were implemented regarding the allocation of resources in society. Here I am referring to the deregulation of the financial markets, reforms in the pension, tax and social insurance systems and a reduction in the burden of taxation. In addition, wage formation has been improved, which has probably been facilitated by monetary policy focussing on price stability. It seems to me probable that the return to macroeconomic stability and in particular the structural reforms have actively contributed to the favourable developments of the past decade. On the other hand, I do not believe that the changeover to a floating exchange rate has been crucial in itself. Over the past century Sweden has mostly had a fixed exchange rate and usually shown good growth. At the same time, the past ten-year period has been a special one in terms of the euphoric expectations of the (cid:147)new economy(cid:148) connected to telecommunications and IT. This contributed to soaring stock market prices, followed by a fall of historic proportions. History can demonstrate similar episodes. The railway construction in the 19th century gave rise to similar over-optimism, as did the introduction of electric and internal combustion engines at the beginning of the 20th century. Sometimes, these periods of over-optimism have put considerable strain on the financial system. The strain caused by developments in recent years appears to be comparatively limited. When inventions with a broad potential for application are introduced, it generally takes a long time before we learn the best way to use them. We tend to be fixed on the current system solutions and find it difficult to see new opportunities. The sobering process that has occurred since the exorbitant expectations at the end of the 1990s with regard to telecommunications and IT therefore does not rule out the possibility that this technology will stimulate future productivity growth. Following the electricity euphoria at the beginning of the 20th century, various applications gradually changed everyday life for industry and households. Sweden was not fully electric until a few decades later. Essentially, therefore, I am optimistic with regard to what future applications in telecommunications and IT can achieve for economic growth. The financial sector - the lubricant of the economy The financial sector has played a very central role in the development of the economy over the past 150 years. It still does, although the general public is sometimes critical of the financial sector - often without considering the services the sector has to offer and how daily life would look without this sector. The fundamental functions of the financial sector - financing, risk management and intermediation of payments - are indispensable to society. Financing entails bringing together the different wishes of savers and investors. Savers want their money to be available directly, while investors often require long-term loans. These opposing wishes can be reconciled via banks, and also directly via the financial markets. The latter assumes that there are well-developed secondary markets with a large turnover in, for instance, equity. This enables companies to borrow long-term while savers can quickly sell their shares if they so desire. Risks are managed through the spread in borrowing, but also by transferring them, against payment, to others in the financial market. The spread and redistribution of financial risks enables investments to be made that would not otherwise have been possible. The third and final main task is the intermediation of payments, which enables payment to be smoothly made and received for goods and services sold either in the conventional manner or via, for instance, the Internet. 
 BIS Review 37/2003 3 In countries like Sweden we tend to take it for granted that these functions work. However, if we try to imagine that they did not exist, we will realise how extremely central they are to the functioning of the economy and to our welfare. If we imagine a country where savers and investors did not have access to functioning and reliable banks and financial markets, it is easy to see how this would hamper development. The effect would be a tendency for savings to move abroad, while profitable investment projects did not get off the ground in countries with an undeveloped financial sector. If we look back at the 1950s, we can see that the intermediation of payments functions much more smoothly today. Then, we used to stand in line to receive a pay packet, life assurance employees bicycled round to customers(cid:146) homes to collect premiums and almost everyone stood in line at the post office to pay their rent, electricity bill, etc. From freedom to regulation and the return to freedom The conditions for Sparbanken Gripen and the financial sector have certainly varied over the past 150 years. During the first part of this period, the financial sector was able to operate under considerable freedom. Bank deposits were developed as a basis for the banks(cid:146) lending. This meant that the banks created money by expanding credit to the extent that they dared to reduce their reserves. The banks also played an important role in the foreign borrowing that occurred, mainly in the form of bond issues in Germany and France. The banking system was particularly expansionary around the year 1900, when many new banks were established. Some of these did not last long. In 1907 the financial sector suffered a widespread crisis and many banks went into liquidation, were refinanced or taken over by other banks. The next financial crisis coincided with the deflation at the beginning of the 1920s. This crisis was particularly severe in rural Sweden, partly because of a severe fall in agricultural product prices. Deflation made the situation difficult for farmers encumbered with debts and thereby for the banks active in rural areas. As a reaction to the crisis during the 1920s, the difficulties of the 1930s with the Kreuger crash and in particular the outbreak of the Second World War, the central government tightened its grip on the financial sector. Many of the regulations introduced at that time still remained towards the end of the 1980s. During this period of regulation, the financial sector looked very different. It is probable that the regulations then curbed the development of economic activity. The regulations covered, for instance, the central government guaranteeing financing of housing construction and the central government borrowing requirement. Interest rates were kept lower than the equilibrium level with the hope that this would stimulate investment and growth. This of course resulted in a large demand for loans, which was managed by means of rationing. A necessary condition for this regulatory system was that the country was screened off with the aid of currency regulation that prevented savers from taking advantage of higher interest abroad. One might think it self-evident that an individual should be able to decide where in the world he or she invests his or her savings, but for a long time we lacked this freedom. In other words, one of the financial markets(cid:146) fundamental tasks was eliminated - allocating capital to the most profitable investments. During this long period of regulation we as a country forgot our own experiences from the 19th century on the value of free movement of capital and the importance of the price mechanism in efficient allocation of resources. Deregulation since then has meant that there are currently greater similarities with the late 19th century/early 20th century than with the intervening period of regulation. I have used the word deregulation here. On a general level this is an appropriate description, but one can also describe developments in terms of changes in regulation. This is because, at the same time as considerable deregulation has occurred, there are other regulations remaining and new ones have been introduced. One important difference, however, is that today(cid:146)s regulations are aimed at allowing the price mechanism to function, i.e. they are market-conforming. These regulations are usually aimed at protecting savers and investors against risks and abuse. In this sense it is a case of re-regulation. The financial sector thus fulfils a central role as a lubricant for the economy. An efficient financial sector increases a country(cid:146)s potential growth rate. Today approximately 80,000 people are employed in the financial sector, although the number of bank employees in Sweden is in relative terms lower than in any other OECD country. This and other indicators show that we have a relatively efficient financial sector. 
 4 BIS Review 37/2003 Growth based on productivity and labour I have emphasised, in this roughly sketched outline, the important role of growth in the development of our standard of living. However it also plays a central role in monetary policy discussions, as demand in the economy in relation to production capacity is decisive for whether inflationary bottlenecks will arise or whether we will underutilise the production potential. It is the potential growth rate that sets the limits. We at the Riksbank must take into account this rate and any changes in its development, even though monetary policy does not directly affect potential growth. Similarly, we must take into account changes in competitive conditions, as changes here can have both direct and indirect effects on the development of inflation. Possible measures to strengthen potential growth are an issue for other forms of economic policy, involving, for instance, the stimulation of competition to improve allocation of resources. The high growth rate over the past decade has been primarily generated by the fact that we have used available resources more efficiently. On the other hand, we have not supplied many more resources either in the form of hours worked or of capital/investment. From the mid-1980s up to 1993 the opposite applied. The limited increase in productivity that arose then was due to investment, i.e. capital intensity increased. Over the past ten years we have had an impressive annual increase in factor productivity, while capital intensity has increased at a slow rate. It is worrying that the increase in labour supply has been, and still is, so limited. In this aspect we differ from most of the other countries that have been aided by increased labour supply in raising their growth rate. An important explanation for the poorer development in Sweden is the amount of long-term sickness leave and early retirement. Worry over these tendencies increases if one takes into account the fact that future retirements may further limit the labour supply. However, let us leave the discussion of the labour supply and concentrate instead on the productivity aspect. The combination of price stability and budget stability is an important explanation for the development in productivity.1 Price and budget stability increase households(cid:146) and companies(cid:146) willingness to make long-term decisions. Stable prices also entail better information value in relative prices, which improves the allocation of resources. If we consider other factors that have stimulated the upturn in productivity in recent years, there are several central changes. One generally seeks explanations in factors such as technological developments, education, competence and incentives among the work force, as well as the allocation of resources in society. At the same time, the pressure on companies to use resources efficiently has increased during the 1990s. Greater competitive pressure resulting from both increased internationalisation and deregulation in various sectors has increased the need for companies to economise their scant resources. Less extravagant use of resources means that the labour force and capital are employed in other areas where they contribute better to the national economy. Although the changeover can be difficult for those who lose their jobs, a better allocation of resources is a necessary condition for improving welfare. Openness is important Productivity is also affected by a country(cid:146)s capacity to utilise technological progress in other countries. This capacity is in turn dependent on how open a country is to impulses from outside, which is determined by the obstacles to ideas, products, services and production factors moving freely across borders. The capacity to reconsider regulations and institutions so that changes can be adopted is an important part of this openness. The negative experiences of the closed economies during the interwar period led to trade barriers being successively lowered after the Second World War. A gradual increase in free trade stimulated the global economy and this was particularly important for small countries like Sweden. Freedom for savers to choose the country in which to save was also introduced in many countries. The obstacles to ideas, products, services and production factors moving freely across borders has declined further                                                       1 The importance of price and budget stability for productivity growth has been demonstrated, for instance, by William Easterley in (cid:147)When is stabilisation expansionary(cid:148), the World Bank, Dec 1995. 
 BIS Review 37/2003 5 during the 1990s, partly due to our EU membership and this ought to have had a positive effect on factor productivity. Internationalisation has thus contributed to an increasingly large part of the corporate sector becoming exposed to competition. Increased competition means that companies must become more efficient and cost-conscious, which in turn should have a positive effect on productivity. In addition, a new Competition Act was introduced in Sweden in 1993, containing an express ban on anti-competitive cooperation between companies and a ban on abuse of a dominant position. There has also been some further deregulation. For instance, state monopolies have been abolished and freedom to establish new companies with regard to, for instance, transport, communications and energy has been introduced. Changed competitive conditions thus affect productivity growth, but they can also affect price developments more directly. Despite the fact that we gained much stiffer legislation on competition in 1993, developments in this field appear to be moving slowly. Swedish prices remain higher than in other countries in several areas without explanations for this in the form of differences in VAT rates and wage levels. Increased competition can contribute to price levels converging, but this assumes that the relative price changes will be accepted and it can entail, as in the 1990s when electricity and telecommunications were deregulated, such large price reductions in some sectors that our inflation rate will be lower than that of other countries. Special interests and consumer interests Limits to competition are a clear example of how special interests dominate over general consumer interests. There are many examples of this in various areas of the Swedish economy, and in particular the construction sector. This means that we allow inefficiency to remain, which reduces growth and the development of most people(cid:146)s standard of living. One interesting and very recent example of how special interests have declined concerns pharmaceutical prices. A change in this field was introduced in October last year, which in principle means that pharmacies are obliged to exchange a drug in a prescription for a cheaper equivalent (generic) unless the customer is willing to pay the difference. The effect of this new regulation, combined with patents expiring, has led to significant price competition. Pharmaceuticals companies have gradually lowered their prices through more than 3,500 reductions, which benefits us as individuals when we purchase prescription drugs and as tax-payers as the cost of the county councils(cid:146) subsidies for prescription drugs declines. Pharmaceuticals(cid:146) costs are included in CPI as one of many sub-indices and are intended to reflect the average household(cid:146)s costs for prescription drugs. Over the past ten years this index has risen at an average rate of 12 per cent a year. Now this increase has been turned around to a small decrease. The difference between the historical rate of increase and the current price fall corresponds to a saving of approximately SEK 1 billion a year2 for Swedish households. Correspondingly, the county councils(cid:146) costs have been reduced by approximately SEK 2 billion. There are large sums involved here and they deserve some attention. Nevertheless, it is difficult to find articles dealing with these large savings and with the increase in competition. The main aspect appears to have been lost in the media. Instead, one finds articles on the difficulties for our monopoly company Apoteket to adapt, as it exists on a margin of approximately 20 per cent. It would be beneficial to have more discussion of, and attention paid to, the question of how to stimulate competition. In this particular case a beneficial change appears to have strongly stimulated competition. If we are to achieve increased competition in other areas, too, it is necessary to constantly emphasise consumer interests so that allocation of resources becomes as efficient as possible and protected sectors are not allowed to operate inefficiently to the detriment of potential growth.                                                       2 Statistics Sweden calculates households(cid:146) consumption of pharmaceuticals to be approximately SEK 10 billion a year. 
 6 BIS Review 37/2003 What can we learn from 150 years of history? To summarise, there have been many changes in the Swedish economy in recent times. The external framework is currently characterised by considerable fiscal policy and monetary policy stability, which facilitates planning and decision-making for both households and companies. Both our own history and that of other countries shows clearly that a stable external framework is an important basis for economic growth. We have also gone back to being open towards the outside world. During the war we were not, for obvious reasons. After that we were open for a long period according to the rhetoric, but less so in practice. Today we have regained a freedom for ideas, products, services and production factors that is reminiscent of the late 19th century and early 20th century. In both of these aspects we appear to have done our homework. At the same time, it should be remembered that many markets in Sweden still show clear signs of a lack of competition. This entails a considerable cost and in this field we appear to have more to learn from history. The significance of this is underlined by the fact that the various parts of the economy are interlinked, which often means that a strengthening of the weaker parts is more important for the whole than for the particular industry or sector. The complementarity of the economy3 makes it particularly important to remedy our weak links and to listen with humility to the proposals of, for instance, the OECD and IMF. It is often easier to identify the problems if one can look at things with a little perspective. I believe that the Swedish economy has considerable unused potential for stronger growth if we concentrate on this, that is to say, on how to make our joint share of the cake grow.                                                       3 The significance of complementarity in economic policy has been demonstrated by, for instance, Aziz and Wescott 1997 in (cid:147)Policy Complementarities and the Washington Consensus(cid:148). 
  T T Mboweni: Overview of the South African economy Address by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the 83rd ordinary general meeting of shareholders, Pretroria, 26 August 2003. *      *      * Introduction The South African Reserve Bank achieved considerable success on many fronts under difficult economic conditions during the past year. In the monetary field, prompt action during 2002 helped to restrain inflationary expectations as well as to maintain international confidence in the country(cid:146)s commitment to responsible macroeconomic policies. The strength of international confidence is reflected in the recovery in the rand(cid:146)s international value, which was a major factor in reining back inflationary pressures. In the process, the oversold net open foreign reserve position (NOFP) was finally expunged in May 2003. Against this background, it has been possible to lower interest rates in recent months. Price stability, on the basis of permanent low inflation, is an essential precondition for the economy to be able to achieve sustainable potential growth rates and thereby deliver lasting improvements in living standards for all sectors of our society. The Bank therefore remains dedicated to its task of keeping inflation within the target range, and will continue to be ready to take prompt action whenever necessary to that end. In the banking sector, financial stability has been restored after the serious liquidity problems experienced in the first half of 2002. The banking sector remains soundly capitalised and well managed, and significant progress has been made in the further application of international best practices in banking supervision. The highly-developed structure and international competitiveness of the country(cid:146)s financial system as a whole remains a significant national strength. In the administration of the Bank, costs were reduced significantly and in a number of instances departments were restructured, streamlined and staff numbers reduced. The international economic environment The global economic recovery remains weak and fragile. Having improved towards the end of 2001 and during the first half of 2002, global economic activity suffered a setback in the second half of 2002 when business confidence was detrimentally affected by revelations of corporate accounting malpractices, further declines in equity values and the threat of war against Iraq. In the first half of 2003 equity prices generally began to rise and the war in Iraq was concluded without severely impacting on oil production. Yet growth in most of the large industrial countries failed to meet earlier expectations. Although household spending was resilient, business investment in most advanced economies remained low. Lingering political uncertainties arising from the war in Iraq, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the excess capacity in many manufacturing sectors, inhibited the expansion of investment. Consumption expenditure was supported in the USA and Europe by firm property prices and the willingness of households to incur debt. The increasing household debt burden, low personal sector saving and the widening current-account deficit of the United States, pose a threat to the strength and sustainability of the world economic recovery. In addition, economic growth in other advanced economies could be curtailed by structural problems such as inflexible labour and product markets and imbalances in welfare systems. The economic growth rates of emerging-market economies diverged considerably during 2002 and the first half of 2003. Growth on the whole was quite robust in Asia and in the transition economies in Europe, while it was moderate in Africa and weak in Latin America. The strong growth in Asia was mainly the result of substantial inflows of foreign direct investment and the stimulation of intra-regional trade by the rapid economic expansion in China. European transitional economies benefited from increased and more diversified exports, while the growth in Africa was negatively affected by factors such as political instability, a severe drought in the northern and southern parts of the continent and the HIV/Aids pandemic. Financial constraints and socio-political events were mainly responsible for the low or negative growth of countries in Latin America. 
  As could be expected under these circumstances, unemployment increased in most advanced economies as well as in Latin America and Africa. Employment creation in emerging-market economies remains one of the most pressing challenges facing the world to ensure the maintenance of stability and the reduction of poverty. This requires the orderly removal of structural impediments to promote skills and create employment opportunities. Such steps should facilitate the task of monetary authorities when external shocks disturb the economies. With the exception of parts of Latin America and some countries in Africa, global inflation remained low. Small increases in prices were recorded despite a marked rise in oil and other international commodity prices during 2002. In the first half of 2003 the rate of increase in international commodity prices levelled off and contributed to the global disinflationary trend. Japan and a few other countries in Asia actually experienced a decline in the aggregate level of prices in 2002 and the first half of 2003. The low inflation in the world is assisting South Africa in combating domestic inflation. The combination of low economic growth, increased unemployment and disinflation generally led to the adoption of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in advanced economies. Interest rates were brought down to very low levels in most developed countries and fiscal deficits widened. However, these measures were unable to prevent some major corporate defaults. Although this exerted pressure on the world financial system, institutions were generally able to cope with the situation. Japanese banks were affected by bad debts and low profits and some banks in Europe also encountered problems. Insurance companies and pension funds fared worse than banks. Of further concern is the volatility experienced in exchange rates and its effect not only on the financial sector, but also on real economic activity. In particular, the US dollar has weakened substantially, which could have major repercussions for the world economy. Domestic economic developments The weakness of the US dollar was a major factor in a significant recovery in the external value of the rand. Having declined by 34 per cent on a trade-weighted basis during 2001, the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand recovered by 24 per cent in 2002 and by a further 12 per cent up to the end of July 2003. The performance of the rand was also related to South Africa(cid:146)s inherent economic strength and to the sound and consistent macroeconomic policies pursued by the authorities. Improved international perceptions of these strong fundamentals were reflected in a significant narrowing in spreads on internationally-traded South African bonds, and was recognised by higher ratings of the country by two major international rating agencies, which further underpinned the rand(cid:146)s recovery. The positive sentiment in the market was supported by attractive domestic interest rates and an increase in the country(cid:146)s terms of trade. Similarly, the real effective exchange rate of the rand recovered markedly since the beginning of 2002. This index, which reflects the trade-weighted exchange rate of the rand deflated by the production price differential between South Africa and its main trading partners and competitor countries, rose by an estimated 16 per cent over the eighteen-month period up to the end of June 2003. Even after this increase the level of the real effective exchange rate of the rand was still below the index values of early 2000, i.e. before the currency market turbulence. This indicates that South African producers are fairly price competitive, but the profitability of their international transactions has, of course, fluctuated considerably over the past three years. Domestic output could not escape the impact of the still subdued global economy. Growth in real gross domestic product slowed down from 3‰ per cent in the first half of 2002 to 3 per cent in the second half and 1‰ per cent in the first half of 2003. This deceleration in economic growth was spread across most sectors, with agriculture output actually contracting in the first half of 2003. The slower growth was accompanied by an increase in aggregate employment in the formal non-agricultural sectors of the economy in 2002. An employment gain of 54 000 workers was recorded. However, preliminary indicators point to a loss in employment opportunities in the first half of 2003. Over the same period, productivity growth receded while the average remuneration per worker rose at an estimated annualised rate of 10 per cent. As a result, nominal unit labour cost continued to increase at a rate above the upper limit of the inflation target band of 6 per cent. The decline in the rate of economic growth was due to a fall in the volume of exports, whereas domestic demand continued to increase strongly. The level of short-term interest rates seems to have had little effect on domestic demand. The rate of increase in domestic final demand declined only marginally from 4 per cent in 2002 to 3‰ per cent in the first half of 2003. The annualised growth in 
  real gross domestic expenditure nevertheless remained at 4‰ per cent in the second half of 2002 and in the first half of 2003. Growth in real household consumption expenditure slowed only slightly from an annualised rate of 3 per cent in the second half of 2002 to 2‰ per cent in the first half of 2003. The sustained high growth in consumption expenditure was made possible by relatively strong increases in personal disposable income as well as by a rise in household debt. Household disposable income benefited from higher salaries and wages, improved social transfers from government and income tax reductions. At the same time, the low level of the debt-to-income ratio of households and expectations of imminent reductions in interest rates encouraged some households to incur debt. Real household consumption expenditure accordingly retained a large part of its earlier buoyancy at the cost of a significant increase in debt. The ratio of household debt to disposable income was nevertheless still relatively low at 53 per cent at the end of June 2003. The steadfast growth in household consumption expenditure was accompanied by an annualised increase in real government consumption expenditure varying from quarter to quarter between 3‰ and 4 per cent throughout the past year. These growth levels have been maintained since the beginning of 2001 and signify the greater emphasis on service delivery in government(cid:146)s fiscal strategy. The rate of increase in real fixed capital formation picked up during 2002 and reached an annualised level of 9 per cent in the second half of the year. This rate then receded to a still high 8 per cent in the first half of 2003, brought down by a decline in the fixed investment of the agricultural sector associated with lower profits of farmers because of the marked drop in the prices of some key agricultural products. Other sectors continued to spend large amounts on the replacement of obsolete capital equipment and the development of new ventures. This demonstrates that positive expectations and sound fundamentals can sometimes carry more weight in fixed investment decisions than the level of short-term interest rates. In contrast to the continued strong growth of domestic demand, exports performed less well. In fact, the volume of exports of goods and non-factor services declined by 1‰ per cent in 2002 and by a further 2‰ per cent in the first half of 2003. With the exception of receipts from tourists visiting South Africa, the exports of other goods and services were negatively affected by the decline in global economic activity. In 2002 the decline in the volume of exports coincided with an increase in the volume of imports. Despite a decrease in crude oil imports, the volume of total imports continued to increase in the first half of 2003. The terms of trade strengthened in both 2002 and the first half of 2003, while net dividend and interest payments declined. These developments could nevertheless not prevent the balance on the current account from reverting from a surplus in 2002 to a deficit of 1 per cent of gross domestic product in the first half of 2003. This deficit was more than neutralised by a financial inflow from the rest of the world consisting mainly of foreign direct investment, borrowing by the South African government in international capital markets and net inflows of other portfolio capital. As a result, the gold and other foreign reserves of the country rose from US$12,6 billion at the end of 2001 to US$18,5 billion at the end of June 2003. On the monetary and financial fronts, the main developments during the past eighteen months can be summarised as follows: 1. The rate of increase in the monetary aggregates slowed down significantly. For instance, the growth in the broadly defined money supply (M3) measured over periods of twelve months declined from around 19 per cent in the early part of 2002 to less than 13 per cent in December 2002 and to single-digit rates during most of the first six months of 2003. The weaker demand for money reflected a slowdown in inflation and a weaker growth in real income. 2. The public(cid:146)s demand for bank credit remained resilient. Having declined from 12,5 per cent in June 2002 to 7,8 per cent in December, the twelve-month growth rate in banks(cid:146) total loans and advances to the domestic private sector picked up again to 12,7 per cent in June 2003. The continued buoyancy in the demand for bank credit by the private sector was supported by relatively low debt levels, expectations of a decline in interest rates and ongoing increases in the prices of houses, flats and townhouses. 3. The money market continued to be relatively liquid. The Reserve Bank mainly used foreign exchange swaps, Reserve Bank debentures and reverse-repurchase agreements to drain surplus liquidity, while the phasing out of the banks(cid:146) vault cash holdings forming part of their 
  required cash reserves also contributed towards this end. The daily liquidity requirement of banks was maintained at around R11 billion by these measures. 4. Short-term interest rates began to move downwards from April 2003. Having increased by about 400 basis points in conjunction with the repo rate during the first nine months of 2002 and then stabilising at this higher level for the next six months, short-term rates declined by approximately 200 basis points up to the end of July 2003. 5. Private-sector companies made increased use of the primary bond market to finance activities. With subdued share prices and the cost of funding in the money market higher than in the bond market, several companies issued bonds. The outstanding value of private-sector loan stock listed on the Bond Exchange of South Africa therefore increased from R29 billion in June 2002 to R42 billion in June 2003. 6. Long-term bond yields trended downward from late March 2002, reflecting the market(cid:146)s favourable view of the long-term prospects for inflation and the impact of a small public-sector borrowing requirement. In combination with the high level of short-term interest rates, this led to a sharply inverted yield curve. However, after the reduction in the repo rate in June 2003, the shape of the yield curve began to normalise. 7. The recovery in the external value of the rand was mirrored to a considerable extent by movements in share prices on the JSE Securities Exchange South Africa. Expectations of the impact of the exchange rate of the rand on corporate profitability, together with the gloomy international sentiment among equity investors, led to a marked decline in domestic share prices. From a high point on 22 May 2002, the all-share price index declined by 37 per cent to a recent low point on 25 April 2003. Subsequently, share prices recovered by 20 per cent to the end of July. Public finance A more expansionary fiscal policy stance has been adopted by government since the 2001 Budget, while the policy remained supportive of lowering inflation and promoting stability. This cautious expansionary fiscal stance is set to be maintained over the medium term to increase the long-term growth capacity of the economy. Government(cid:146)s main goal is reducing unemployment and ensuring that economic growth and development benefit all communities. In accordance with this policy stance, government(cid:146)s deficit was well-contained in the fiscal year 2002/03. The non-financial public-sector borrowing requirement amounted to only 1 per cent of gross domestic product in that year. This was made possible by continued strong growth in revenue collections and considerable discipline applied to government expenditure. On account of the low deficit and a downward revaluation of foreign-currency denominated loans, the ratio of government(cid:146)s outstanding debt to gross domestic product declined from 46 per cent at the end of March 2002 to 41 per cent at the end of March 2003. Monetary policy Monetary policy was dominated in the past year by having to respond to the inflationary pressures arising from exogenous shocks in the form of a substantial depreciation in the external value of the rand in late 2001 and a sharp rise in international oil prices. These shocks were mainly responsible for a surge in the twelve-month rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding interest on mortgages (CPIX) from a low of 5,8 per cent in September 2001 to a peak of 11,3 per cent in October and November 2002. The twelve-month rate of increase in the all-goods production price index also rose from 7,8 per cent in September 2001 to a level of 15,4 per cent in August and September 2002. As a result, the Monetary Policy Committee was obliged to increase the repo rate by 400 basis points in total during the first nine months of 2002. These increases were prompted by the fact that the inflationary pressures, which were at first mainly confined to rising food and energy prices, became more broadly based and in the end not only influenced the prices of goods but also the prices of services which are not directly affected by exchange rate developments. The increase in the repo rate was further based on factors such as rising inflation expectations, increasing nominal unit labour costs and high growth in money supply and bank credit extension. 
  The Monetary Policy Committee concluded at its meeting in November 2002 that the level of interest rates was appropriate to avert an inflation spiral. Although it was still unclear at that time whether inflation had peaked, the repo rate was kept unchanged because a number of developments indicated that inflationary pressures could begin to abate. These included a decline in the quarter-to-quarter production price index from 26,0 per cent in the first quarter of 2002 to 11,2 per cent in the third quarter; a strengthening in the external value of the rand; a decline in international oil prices; slower growth in bank credit extension; and a deceleration in the pace of growth in the more broadly defined money supply aggregates. Given the time lag between a change in monetary policy and its ultimate impact on inflation, the increases in the repo rate were unable to prevent the breaching of the inflation target of 3 to 6 per cent for 2002. In South Africa it is estimated that it takes between 18 and 24 months for a change in short-term interest rates to fully impact on the rate of increase in consumer prices. In 2002 the rate of increase in the CPIX averaged 9,3 per cent, or 330 basis points above the upper limit of the target. Apart from the direct monetary policy steps that were taken during 2002, the Minister of Finance announced in October that the inflation target of 3 to 5 per cent for 2004 and 2005 would be adjusted and that the target for 2004 would be set at 3 to 6 per cent. Subsequently, it was announced that the target for 2005 would remain at this level and that the target for 2006 would be made public in October 2003. These announcements were made in recognition of the fact that the exogenous shocks had thrown the downward path of inflation off course and that an excessively tight monetary policy with high short-term costs in terms of output losses should be avoided as far as possible. By the time of the March 2003 meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee it was clear that the rise in inflation had been contained. The twelve-month rate of increase in CPIX had fallen to 9,3 per cent and that of the production price index to 6,2 per cent. In addition, the growth in money supply and bank credit extension had come down to single-digit levels and the rand had recovered remarkably in the second half of 2002. Despite this more positive picture, some other developments caused the Monetary Policy Committee to remain cautious about changing the policy stance prematurely. In particular, the Committee was influenced by the fact that the meeting took place on the day that the war in Iraq started. At that stage it was uncertain what the impact of the war would be on the global economy, and more specifically on oil prices. Other considerations that led to the decision to keep the repo rate unchanged included concerns about the level of wage settlements, rising unit labour costs, large increases in some administered prices and a forecast that CPIX inflation would be close to the upper limit of the inflation target in 2004. At its June 2003 meeting the Monetary Policy Committee was confronted by a revision of the inflation figures by Statistics South Africa. Although the turning point and the pattern of change between the previous and the revised monthly series coincided fairly closely, the revision brought about almost a 2 percentage point lower than originally estimated year-on-year increase in the CPIX for the early months of 2003. The revision affected the inflation outlook as well as the Reserve Bank(cid:146)s forecast. Taking this revision and more recent economic developments into consideration, the Bank(cid:146)s forecast indicated that the inflation rate would move within the target range during the second half of 2003 and would come close to the mid-point of the target range in 2004. A number of other factors also influenced the decision to reduce the repo rate by 150 basis points at this meeting. First, the end of the war in Iraq had brought greater stability to the oil market. Second, it was clear that the exchange rate of the rand was maintaining its recovered levels in spite of continued volatility. Third, there were clear signs that inflation pressures emanating from abroad would remain weak. Finally, inflation expectations had declined in South Africa and domestic conditions generally favoured disinflation. Another development at this meeting was the decision to increase the number of meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee from four to six per year. The previous decision to limit the number of scheduled meetings to four was prompted by the argument that the meetings should coincide with the availability of quarterly data. However, this led to long intervals between some meetings. It was therefore decided that even if the latest quarterly data were not available at each meeting, there should be enough high-frequency statistics to take informed decisions. More frequent meetings should have the added advantage of reducing the fear of sudden and unexpected interest rate adjustments, and in this way promote monetary policy transparency further. On 14 August 2003, the Monetary Policy Committee announced a further reduction of 100 basis points in the repo rate to a level of 11 per cent. This decision was taken because the decline in the inflation rate continued to be in line with the Reserve Bank(cid:146)s projections and the inflation outlook generally 
  remained favourable. However, the Committee expressed concern about the high rates of increase in some administered prices, the level of wage settlements, the continued strong performance of domestic demand and the acceleration in money supply growth in the second quarter of 2003. Exchange rate policy Exchange rate policy was left unchanged in the past year. As in the preceding year, the determination of the external value of the rand was left to the market and the Bank did not intervene in the foreign-exchange market to affect the exchange rate. Although the Bank would prefer to have a strong rather than a weak rand from an inflation perspective, it does not have a target for the exchange rate. As has been emphasised on numerous occasions, it is not the Bank(cid:146)s policy to intervene in the market to affect the level or the direction of change of the exchange rate of the rand. The exchange rate of the rand was quite volatile during the past year. Unfortunately, this seems to be a fact of life for most emerging-market economies and even for some of the more advanced economies irrespective of the monetary policy frameworks that they have adopted. Although the Bank would, of course, prefer to have greater exchange rate stability, fluctuations in the external value of the rand are unavoidable in the current international monetary system of generally floating exchange rates. We know from experience that even if the rand was pegged to another currency or to a basket of currencies, it would still float against most currencies and fluctuate widely at times. The authorities can only aim at creating underlying economic conditions that are conducive to exchange rate stability. One of the factors that has contributed to the large fluctuations of the rand in the past has been the large oversold NOFP of the Bank. The Bank(cid:146)s stated objective has been to eliminate this open position, which stood at US$ 23,2 billion at the end of September 1998. During the past year the Bank purchased fairly modest amounts of foreign currency in the market at appropriate times, and also delivered the proceeds of the government(cid:146)s global eurobond issue of US$ 1,25 billion in May 2003 against the oversold forward exchange book of the Bank. These transactions converted the oversold NOFP of US$ 1,8 billion in mid-2002 to an overbought position of US$ 0,9 billion at the end of July 2003. Having removed this perceived vulnerability, the price discovery process in the foreign-exchange market has been displaying a better two-way trading pattern. With the oversold NOFP now expunged, the Bank has shifted its focus to reducing its oversold forward book and to seeking over time to strengthen the official foreign exchange reserve position. The balance on the oversold forward book stood at US$ 4,1 billion at the end of July 2003, compared with US$ 7 billion at the time of the previous annual meeting of the Bank. In accordance with the policy of a phased and gradual dismantling of exchange controls, the Minister of Finance announced further exchange control relaxations in his Budget Speech on 26 February 2003. These included a new dispensation for offshore portfolio investments, a mechanism for unwinding the pool of emigrants(cid:146) blocked funds and an exchange control amnesty. Stability in the banking sector The liquidity problems experienced by smaller banks and the eventual erosion of the deposit base of some of the bigger banks in the first half of 2002, were resolved in a satisfactory manner during the past year. In this process, however, certain consequences for the banking industry could not be avoided. The activities of two of the larger banks, Saambou Bank Limited and BoE Bank Limited, were merged with those of the big domestic banks. In addition, the reluctance of depositors to place funds with smaller banks caused some of these banks to cancel their banking registrations, while others redesigned their ownership structures and downsized their balance sheets. The turbulence experienced in the banking sector therefore resulted in a consolidation of activities before a return to stability was achieved. At the end of June 2003, approximately 83 per cent of total deposits by the public landed in the vaults of the big four banks. These changes have also made it more difficult to start new banks or for small banks to remain in business. This could affect the availability of operational capital for new entrepreneurs, which is highly essential for economic development. Small banks are often more willing than bigger banks to finance high-risk ventures because they are more versatile and can more easily target niche markets. Despite these developments, South Africa(cid:146)s banking system remains sound. Banks operating in the country are well capitalised, with an average risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio of 12,4 per cent at 
  the end of June 2003. Moreover, 35 banks holding 98 per cent of total banking assets have capital adequacy ratios exceeding the statutory minimum of 10 per cent. The liquidity of the banking sector was also generally adequate. The average daily amount of liquid assets held in June 2003 exceeded the minimum requirement by about 20 per cent. Growth in the total assets of banks moderated appreciably during 2002, but grew rapidly in the first six months of 2003 because of changes in regulatory and accounting practices that require many off-balance sheet items to be included in balance sheets. However, the quality of assets remained high. Non-performing loans amounted to nearly R25 billion at the end of June 2003, which represented only 2,6 per cent of total loans and advances. The provisions made by banks for non-performing loans were also adequate. Although household debt to disposable income rose in the first half of 2003, this ratio is still well below the average of the preceding five years. The ratio of corporate debt to profits, which is an indication of the debt-servicing capacity of businesses, increased from 5,4 per cent in the second quarter of 2002 to 6,4 per cent in the second quarter of 2003. This ratio is above the average of the past five years, probably because of a decline in corporate profits as well as an increase in corporate debt. Banks continue to be managed well. The average efficiency ratio improved in the past year, as did the return on equity and assets. A special independent investigation concerning corporate governance has confirmed that South Africa(cid:146)s leading banks are committed to high standards of management. The banks adhere broadly to international best practice. Certain suggestions were nevertheless made to improve the functioning of banks. The major deficiency that the investigation encountered was that some of the boards of banks are too big to operate cohesively. It was therefore suggested that the size of boards should preferably be restricted to 16 members and that the number of executive directors should ideally not exceed four. Although continued vigilance is required to ensure that banks comply with evolving standards, there are no major concerns in this regard. Banks are well on course to bringing their risk-management systems and data models in line with what could be required for compliance with Basel II in 2007. This new capital accord is a radical reform of the previous one and will have an impact on banks in areas such as regulatory capital, credit and operational risk management, and data and disclosure requirements. Banks are positive about complying with the new accord and regard it as a strategic challenge. The application of the new framework will require the re-engineering of supervision processes and organisational structures. In collaboration with other supervisors, the Bank is developing an implementation strategy for Basel II. Following international corporate failures, accounting and auditing standards have been revised or are being overhauled. As part of the ongoing endeavours to ensure the quality and transparency of financial reporting, a shift was made during the past year away from historical cost to fair value accounting of financial instruments, i.e. the application of Accounting Statement AC 133. As indicated earlier, this led to a substantial increase in the reported total assets of banks. A Ministerial Panel for the Review of the Accounting Professions(cid:146) Bill is revising the regulations applicable to auditors and accountants. Although all these standards are aimed at promoting the integrity of financial markets and institutions and ensuring stability, there is some concern about the management of the transition and the ultimate cost of complying with the increase in legislation that affects banks. Preparing for Basel II is in itself a considerable task. Combined with the onerous requirements of new anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist funding legislation, corporate governance standards and impending community reinvestment legislation, it increases the risk that banks could lose sight of their main business objectives. Non-bank financial institutions may also not escape this burden. South Africa(cid:146)s recent accession to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on money laundering will affect the operations of almost all financial firms. Another challenge facing the banking sector is to provide broader access to affordable financial services. A large portion of the population still does not have access to banking facilities. The challenge of broadening access to finance has to be addressed with deference to the regulatory objective of achieving a high degree of economic efficiency and consumer protection in the economy. This will require a balance between the introduction of changes to achieve the objective of greater participation and the maintenance of financial stability. The financial sector is in the process of developing a Financial Sector Black Economic Empowerment Charter to promote increased black ownership of and access to financial firms. As in the case of the 
  Mining Charter, the key elements of the Financial Sector Charter are likely to include ownership, career and procurement opportunities, and human resources development. We support this process. Moreover, ever since the attacks on the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001, the need for multilateral co-ordination to ensure continuity in financial systems has been high on the agenda of the banking sector. The Bank has assisted in the establishment of a Financial Sector Contingency Forum for such contingency planning. A key objective of the forum is to identify crisis events that may threaten the stability of the South African financial sector and to develop appropriate plans, mechanisms and structures to mitigate such potential threats and manage crisis events. Regional economic co-operation The promotion of regional economic co-operation in Africa generally and in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) more specifically continues to form part of the major activities of the South African Reserve Bank. The Bank fully supports the New Partnership for Africa(cid:146)s Development (Nepad) goals of accelerated growth and sustainable development, poverty eradication and reversing the marginalisation of Africa in the globalisation process. We will continue to play an active role towards the realisation of these ideals. The Bank has also participated actively in the Committee of Central Bank Governors in the SADC region during the past year. The major initiatives undertaken included the establishment of a Common Monetary Area Cross-border Payment Oversight Committee; the implementation of a cross-border foreign exchange recording system in Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe; significant progress in the harmonisation of national payment systems, information and communication technology capacity, banking supervision and exchange control; and agreement on the promotion of the focus on price stability as an appropriate and realisable target of macroeconomic convergence as a prerequisite for monetary integration. Internal administration In order to achieve the objective of price and financial stability and to ensure that all activities are conducted efficiently, a number of changes were again made to the internal administration of the Reserve Bank in the past year. In particular, the reduction of costs without loss of productivity received high priority. Staff and operational costs were thoroughly scrutinised to minimise expenses. A moratorium was placed on appointments with effect from 1 August 2002 to reduce staff numbers. Moreover, voluntary early retirement packages were also offered during April 2003 to 282 staff members aged 50 and older to curtail costs. A total of 173 responses have been received to date, of which 114 staff members indicated that they accept the offer. A number of initiatives were launched in the area of information and communication technology focusing on cost reduction and improved efficiency. The renewal of the mainframe and the improved management of the network infrastructure will result in significant cost saving over time, address future capacity requirements and improve the availability and reliability of the Bank(cid:146)s infrastructure. In reviewing the implementation of the Bank(cid:146)s cash handling strategy, the average overnight notes-held-to-order limit for commercial banks was increased, the service arrangements for Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces were terminated, and a levy was introduced on banknotes deposited and withdrawn by banks. The Bank(cid:146)s seven branches have met all the distribution and circulation requirements of banks and the cash industry. The overall productivity of the branches has kept track with established requirements and their processing of banknotes averaged 95 per cent of the installed capacity. Strategies to combat the counterfeiting of banknotes and coin are being developed. In line with international best practice, the Bank will enhance the security features of banknotes in the near future to deter counterfeiting. A decision has also been made to introduce a new R5 coin in response to the counterfeiting of such coins. Significant progress has been made to strengthen the Bank(cid:146)s ability to oversee the safety and soundness of the payment system and to strengthen its regulatory framework. In aligning South Africa(cid:146)s payment system practices and arrangements with international developments, discussions have taken place with domestic banks and the Continuous Linked Settlement Bank in London. The aim is to reduce foreign exchange settlement risk through the synchronisation of the settlement of the 
  two legs of a foreign exchange transaction in a single time zone. The Bank also entered into negotiations with the Bankers Services Company (Bankserv) to determine the feasability of transferring the ownership and operation of the SARB-link network to Bankserv to reduce costs. In a further effort to avoid duplication and save costs, the former Money and Capital Market Department and International Banking Department were merged into one new department, the Financial Markets Department. The merger reflected the increased integration of South Africa into global financial markets, which made a distinction between domestic and international financial markets less relevant. The merger had the added benefit of facilitating and improving the co-ordination of monetary policy implementation, while allowing for a more efficient allocation of human resources. Cost saving was also an important objective in the operations of the Bank(cid:146)s subsidiaries. As a result of the current and projected low domestic and international demand for coin, the staff of the SA Mint Company (Pty) Limited was reduced by some 40 per cent through a combination of natural attrition, early retirements and a retrenchment programme. In addition, the management of the SA Mint was restructured to improve efficiency. In the SA Bank Note Company (Pty) Limited marketing was intensified to increase capacity utilisation. The marketing initiatives paid off with the award of two further banknote printing contracts from African countries. The training and development of staff continue to be important objectives of the Bank. In this regard the South African Reserve Bank College again played a major role by offering a variety of learning programmes. The various departments also put considerable effort into on-the-job training of staff members. The Bank is further committed to achieving its objectives for staff transformation by 2005, and reports annually on its progress to the Department of Labour in terms of the Employment Equity Act, No 55 of 1998. In keeping with the decision of the shareholders on 25 April 2002 to terminate the listing of the Bank on the JSE Securities Exchange South Africa, an Over-the-counter Share Transfer Facility for trading Reserve Bank shares was established. This facility has delivered the desired results and 87 registrations in respect of 240 237 shares were effected up to 31 March 2003. Finally, the extensions to the head office building, which were started in 2001, were completed. The building now meets the Bank(cid:146)s requirements in respect of office space, parking and conference facilities. Staff members who had to work in other buildings or who had to be relocated to other premises for the duration of the building alterations, have been moved back to the head office building. Acknowledgements All these improvements in the functioning of the Reserve Bank could only be achieved with the help of other persons and institutions. In conclusion, I therefore want to thank everyone who assisted the Bank to accomplish its objectives. In this regard I have to name the Presidency, the Government and Parliament for their support of our work. I also wish to express my appreciation to the Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank, including the deputy governors, for their commitment to the Bank. In particular, I want to thank Dr M T de Waal, who retired from the Board, for his contributions over the past years. Last but not least, I want to thank the management and staff of the Bank for the outstanding way in which they performed their duties. They have responded with vigour to all the challenges we have encountered and have demonstrated commitment and high professionalism in performing their work. This is a truly remarkable institution to be associated with. Thank you. 
 BIS Review 36/2003 1 Toshiro Muto: What have we learned from (cid:147)unconventional(cid:148) market operations? Speech by Mr Toshiro Muto, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, on the occasion of a meeting with participants in market operations, Tokyo, 23 July 2003. *      *      * I. Monetary policy in uncharted territory As the Japanese economy has been facing severe adjustment in recent years, the Bank of Japan has effected various measures that are unprecedented for any central bank, including the zero interest rate policy, quantitative easing, and a commitment to continuing the current policy until the consumer price index stably reaches zero or above. Moreover, the Bank will be able to purchase asset-backed securities from the end of July, thus expanding the scope of the assets it purchases. People often talk about the so-called (cid:147)unconventional monetary policy(cid:148) under deflation. All of the above measures can be considered unconventional in light of traditional central banking. Until recently, it appears that the zero interest rate policy and quantitative easing have been considered a special case for Japan, a country suffering from deflation. However, there are now several countries whose policy interest rates are approaching zero. For example, the short-term policy rate is 1 percent in the United States and zero to 0.75 percent in Switzerland. As a result, the zero interest rate policy and quantitative easing have been increasingly attracting the attention of other countries. Since the Bank began to conduct monetary policy in uncharted territory, it has constantly made new findings in the area of financial markets and money market operations. As the pioneering central bank in this uncharted territory, the Bank is in a unique position to explain to the audience both at home and abroad the experience under the zero interest rate policy and quantitative easing. As all of you here are experts in market operations and other financial market transactions, I feel it may be stimulating to focus my talk on the issues of mutual interest related to market operations and financial markets, rather than talking about developments in the economy and monetary policy in general. It is often said that the devil is in the details. Therefore, I believe it is useful for fruitful discussion on monetary policy that we share a few findings from market operations under quantitative easing, even though these findings may appear rather technical. II. Findings in the area of market operations There are a few important pillars in the current quantitative easing framework. Among them, the most important is to use the outstanding balance of current account deposits at the Bank as the main operating target and to provide ample funds through market operations. A. Increase in demand for current account deposits Obviously, if we provide ample funds to the market, short-term interest rates will fall to zero. If short-term interest rates are significantly above zero, financial institutions will limit the amount of funds in their current account deposits, which pay no interest, roughly to the required reserves. Such behavior has been familiar to many central banks for many years. But what would happen if short-term interest rates were to decline to zero? A little more than two years ago when the target for market operations was changed from the overnight call rate to the outstanding balance of current account deposits, both market participants and the Bank doubted whether it was really possible for the Bank to provide the current account deposits with funds far in excess of around 4 trillion yen, the required reserves at the time. In fact, in the month of May 2001, only two months after a new target of 5 trillion yen for the current account deposits was introduced, we frequently observed undersubscription in market operations where bids fell short of the Bank(cid:146)s offers. You may recall that undersubscription occurred repeatedly also in subsequent market operations. However, since autumn 2002 when the target for the current account deposits was raised from (cid:147)around 10 to 15 trillion yen(cid:148) to (cid:147)around 15 to 20 trillion yen,(cid:148) undersubscription has rarely occurred. The target has been raised since then, and now stands at (cid:147)around 27 to 30 trillion yen.(cid:148) Indeed, this high level of the target was unthinkable when quantitative easing was first introduced. With the caveat 
 2 BIS Review 36/2003 that there is probably a limit to increasing the target since it is inconceivable that all financial institutions hold their assets in the current account deposits at the Bank, the first of the findings from our experience of more than two years of quantitative easing is that a central bank can provide a fairly large amount of funds even under zero interest rates. Among the factors that enabled the provision of a large amount of funds, initially considered almost impossible, the following two factors stand out in significantly increasing the financial institutions(cid:146) demand for current account deposits at the Bank. One factor is the growing conviction of many financial institutions that they would not have a problem holding current account deposits substantially exceeding the required reserves, as a result of the virtual disappearance of the opportunity cost for holding the current account deposits. At present, not only major banks but also regional banks and foreign banks(cid:146) branches in Japan hold sizable current account deposits at the Bank. The interest income earned in the money market is so small that financial institutions keep their daily excess funds in the current account deposits at the Bank rather than invest them in the money market in view of administrative costs and possible losses, however unlikely, due to the defaults of counterparties. Another factor relates to the periodic rise of concern over financial system stability triggered by such events as the fall in stock prices. When the availability of funds tends to be tight as at the end of the financial year, including the mid-year book closing, or the calendar-year end, financial institutions try to smooth out their funding. This will increase the demand for holding current account deposits at the Bank. In fact, during the financial crisis of 1997-98, the money market shrank, and the liquidity shortage forced a number of financial institutions with rapidly deteriorating creditworthiness into bankruptcy. It may be quite natural that renewed memories of this period prompted extremely strong demand for current account deposits at the Bank. B. Factors leading to undersubscription Such an increase in the demand for current account deposits by market participants must somehow be met by supply. Otherwise, interest rates will rise. As you all know, supply is being made in the form of the Bank(cid:146)s funds-supplying operations, where market participants place bids against the Bank(cid:146)s offers. Thus, the second finding under quantitative easing is that the Bank needs to devise a variety of measures to provide ample funds. For example, even when some market operations resulted in undersubscription, others were successful. Also, the extent of undersubscription varied depending on the time of year. It is not easy to deduce these situations from the theoretical analysis of aggregate supply of and demand for the current account deposits. Having said this, one of the main reasons for undersubscription was the growing sense of a surfeit of funds in the market. This was the case in May 2001, soon after the target for current account deposits was introduced, when sentiment that the additional supply of funds was redundant seemed to be growing stronger day by day. The undersubscription in February and March 2002 and the summer of 2002 was caused in part by such sentiment, but other factors were also at work. Undersubscription is likely to occur when there is an increase in market participants(cid:146) demand for the financial assets the Bank offers to purchase in its market operations. Funds-supplying operations are the transaction where a central bank provides funds to the current account deposits of financial institutions against its purchase of a specific financial asset. For example, during February and March 2002, uncertainty about financial system stability was heightening as full protection of time deposits was about to be lifted from April. Moreover, the demand for such risk-free assets as treasury bills (TBs) and financing bills (FBs) by all economic agents, including financial institutions, increased significantly in the market. In such circumstances, the Bank(cid:146)s offers to purchase TBs and FBs failed to attract a sufficient number of bids, and undersubscription ensued. A change in the long-standing skewed distribution of funds across financial institutions also contributed to undersubscription. In the past, major banks had a balance-sheet structure in which the deposits they received fell short of their loans. At present, the deposits at these major banks are in excess of their loans reflecting an inflow of deposits. As a result, their funding needs in the market have been reduced. It is not certain whether undersubscription will recur in the future. But what is certain is that the success of the central bank in providing a massive amount of funds under zero interest rates will depend on micro-level factors, including the funding position of individual financial institutions and the demand for specific assets used in the Bank(cid:146)s market operations, in addition to the overall supply of 
 BIS Review 36/2003 3 and demand for current account deposits at the central bank. In this regard, by closely monitoring the changes in each financial market, the Bank has been carefully selecting the means by which it carries out market operations for the smooth provision of funds. For example, the Bank has recently expanded the scope of acceptable bills by lengthening the maturity period up to 12 months as well as the range of eligible counterparties for its bill purchasing operations. It has also conducted a combination of longer-term funds-providing operations and shorter-term funds-absorbing operations. III. Challenges under quantitative easing A. Criteria for assessing financial market stability The first challenge under quantitative easing is to select the criteria by which the Bank should assess the state of financial markets when conducting market operations. Some economists may argue that the quantitative easing framework requires the Bank to do no more than mechanically maintain the target balance for current account deposits every day. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily the case. Even when the Bank maintains the target balance, there are cases in which financial markets remain unstable. In these cases, ensuring financial market stability becomes most important. Then, the question is how to assess subtle changes in financial markets in light of maintaining their stability. In the money market, a tightening of the market will not necessarily be translated into a change in overnight interest rates, as these rates have been at around zero. For example, even when concern about financial system stability intensified in autumn 2002, the unsecured overnight call rate stayed at 0.001 percent. However, the repo rate on forward transactions, the yield on TBs with longer maturity, and the offer rate of the Bank(cid:146)s funds-supplying operations all increased. Thus, when conducting market operations under such circumstances, it becomes important to judge how and to what extent the target balance for current account deposits should be achieved and various interest rates should be stabilized to ensure financial market stability. Moreover, the criteria for such judgment differ depending on the economic and financial conditions. Therefore, it has become very challenging to judge whether financial market stability is being maintained. B. How to evaluate the functioning of financial markets The second challenge is to maintain the functioning of financial markets. The word (cid:147)call(cid:148) in the money market derives from the phrase (cid:147)money at call,(cid:148) referring to the money available on demand. The amount outstanding of the call market decreased substantially after financial institutions felt that it would not be a problem to hold reserves far in excess of required reserves. Since the call market is the market in which participants lend and borrow short-term funds, the shrinking of the market implies a possibility that financial institutions may not be able to appropriately perform their banking activity. Therefore, the Bank inevitably has a serious concern about maintaining the functioning of the market. Lenders in the money market are reluctant to lend when market rates fall to virtually zero. Some regional banks have closed down their Tokyo branches. It has also been pointed out that, with liquidity in the call market declining as a result of less market participation, the market may not function effectively in funds procurement in times of emergency. Let me elaborate by illustrating these points with examples. The amount outstanding of the call market stood at 26.5 trillion yen at the end of February 2001 just before the introduction of quantitative easing. This amount fell by roughly 10 trillion yen in two years to 16.5 trillion yen at the end of February 2003. In addition to the introduction of quantitative easing, two factors among others are considered to have contributed to this reduction: one is the progress in consolidation among large financial institutions, and the other is the shift of deposits to large banks, which are usually on the funding side in the call market, as a result of the partial removal of blanket deposit insurance. Let us look at the contrast between call transactions involving overnight instruments and those involving term instruments. The amount outstanding of overnight transactions fell by some 20 percent, from 15.3 trillion yen at the end of February 2001 to 12.3 trillion yen at the end of February 2003. During the same period, the amount outstanding of transactions involving term instruments decreased from 11.2 trillion yen to 4.2 trillion yen, about one-third the level at the end of February 2001. Looking at the money market in terms of secured transactions, the total amount of bond gensaki and repo transactions hardly changed, remaining at around 18 trillion yen per business day during the same 
 4 BIS Review 36/2003 period. In fact, the amount outstanding of the secured call market now is even larger than before the introduction of quantitative easing. These facts suggest that the deterioration in the functioning of the money market is a phenomenon related not only to zero interest rates, but also to the extremely cautious attitude of market participants in taking on credit risks. I have just mentioned that in Japan, with short-term market rates declining virtually to zero, lenders become reluctant to lend, and that some regional banks have closed down their Tokyo branches. Similarly, in the United States, with the decline in the federal funds rates, there is heated discussion as to how far the interest rate on money management funds could decline relative to the returns on trust funds, and whether the decline in interest rates would interfere with the effective functioning of this major channel of funds intermediation. In essence, the discussions in the United States and Japan have something in common. The transaction and settlement of funds and securities as well as the assessment of credit risks always entail some fixed costs. And when short-term market rates approach zero, interest revenues may fall short of these costs. This tends to hinder the smooth implementation of various financial transactions. The relationship between the zero interest rate policy or quantitative easing and the market functioning requires a multifaceted examination. Thus, we would like to examine this issue from a broader perspective, not focusing narrowly just on the decline in the amount outstanding of the call market. IV. Outright purchase of long-term Japanese government bonds (JGBs) I commented earlier that one of the findings under quantitative easing was the need for the Bank to devise a variety of measures to provide ample funds. I have also just mentioned financial market stability and the deterioration of market functioning in the context of concern and challenges under quantitative easing. As an application of these discussions, I would now like to turn to the outright purchase of long-term JGBs by the Bank. Many central banks in major industrialized countries conduct monetary policy mainly through money market operations. It is only those in the United States and Japan that also conduct the outright purchase of long-term government bonds on a large scale. Even before the Bank began quantitative easing, it was effecting the outright purchase of long-term JGBs to provide liquidity for sustainable growth in line with the long-term trend increase in banknotes. When introducing quantitative easing, the Bank adopted a new framework for market operations according to which it would increase the amount of its outright purchase of long-term JGBs when it considered such an increase necessary for the smooth provision of liquidity, subject to the limitation that the outstanding amount of long-term JGBs effectively held by the Bank should be kept below the outstanding balance of banknotes issued. Based on such thinking, the Bank increased the amount of its outright purchase of long-term JGBs four times, from an initial 400 billion yen per month to the current 1.2 trillion yen per month. As a result, the Bank now holds more than 60 trillion yen of long-term JGBs, which accounts for about 60 percent of the monetary base. From the viewpoint of conducting market operations, the outright purchase of long-term JGBs, after the adoption of quantitative easing, has greatly contributed to achieving smoothly the target outstanding balance of current account deposits at the Bank. Undersubscription has not yet been repeated in the Bank(cid:146)s market operations. However, should such cases arise again, it would be highly reassuring from a practical standpoint that the Bank has a means of securing a fixed amount of increase in the outstanding balance every month. Let me share with you some observations in relation to the significant increase in the outright purchase of long-term JGBs. The first observation is that we regard the outright purchase of long-term JGBs as a market operation that does not result in undersubscription. The question is why market participants take the trouble to bid on the Bank(cid:146)s offers for the outright purchase of long-term JGBs when they can sell these bonds in the market. If asked, market participants give the following explanations to this question. First, the Bank requires market participants to bid actively against its offers, which is one of the Bank(cid:146)s requirements for participation in market operations. Second, selling a large amount of long-term JGBs through the Bank(cid:146)s outright purchase has a smaller effect on market prices than selling them in the market. And third, unlike short-term interest rates, interest rates on long-term JGBs have not yet reached zero. All these explanations appear plausible, but cannot be conclusive. The first explanation also applies to 
 BIS Review 36/2003 5 the Bank(cid:146)s market operations for providing short-term funds, and these operations have actually experienced undersubscription. The second one may hold true to some extent. The third explanation that interest rates on long-term JGBs have not yet reached zero seems the most convincing. Whatever the explanations, from the viewpoint of providing ample funds and analyzing the effect on market prices of JGBs, we should pay more attention to the motivation of market participants for bidding on the Bank(cid:146)s offers. The second observation is that the provision of funds dependent largely on the outright purchase of long-term JGBs has created concern in the Bank(cid:146)s market operations. The Bank is currently conducting the outright purchase of long-term JGBs at a high rate of 1.2 trillion yen per month. Its balance sheets at the end of March 2003 revealed that the total of banknotes and current account deposits increased by about 6.5 trillion yen from a year earlier on the liability side. On the asset side, the outright purchase of long-term JGBs increased substantially, while money market operations decreased. In fact, the amount outstanding of long-term JGBs held by the Bank at the end of March 2003 increased by roughly 9 trillion yen from a year earlier, while the amount of funds provided by money market operations decreased by about 7 trillion yen. The difference of about 3 trillion yen between the increase in the total of banknotes and current account deposits and the amount of funds provided by the Bank is explained by the decrease in government excess funds, which were paid to the private sector. If the decrease in the volume of transactions in the money market were to cause difficulties to financial institutions in smoothly raising short-term funds, the Bank(cid:146)s money market operations may provide an alternative means of securing smooth funding. In this context, a decrease in the Bank(cid:146)s money market operations could be a destabilizing factor for financial markets. Even when there is a surplus of funds in the money market as a whole, money market rates could rise slightly due to a decrease in the supply of short-term funds by the Bank. If money market rates were sufficiently positive and there were no concern about financial system stability, the Bank would be free to use any assets for its operations, because a surplus or shortage of funds would ultimately be adjusted in the market. However, this is not currently the case in Japan. The outright purchase of long-term JGBs is a means to smoothly increase the outstanding balance of current account deposits, and has played a significant role in securing financial market stability. At the same time, such a purchase has engendered some unexpected side effects, such as fewer opportunities for the Bank to conduct money market operations, which has in some cases led to a slight rise in money market rates. Let me briefly touch upon the relationship between long-term interest rates and the outright purchase of long-term JGBs. Market participants often point out that the decline in long-term interest rates up until mid-June was partly due to the Bank(cid:146)s outright purchase of long-term JGBs. The outright purchase of long-term JGBs of 1.2 trillion yen per month could facilitate the adjustment of dealers(cid:146) position in the market. And it appears easy to understand that when long-term interest rates fall for some reason, the existence of such a purchase would make dealers more bullish than otherwise. But, based on the observation that the yield on ten-year JGBs has been fluctuating between 0.4 percent and 1.4 percent for the past month or so, the relationship between long-term interest rates and the outright purchase of long-term JGBs may not be as simple as it appears. V. Relationship between the Bank and its counterparties in market operations A. Findings in the area of supply and demand for funds The number of counterparties in the Bank(cid:146)s market operations is close to 150 at present. When financial institutions become eligible as a counterparty in the Bank(cid:146)s market operations, they are requested to bid actively against the Bank(cid:146)s offers for market operations, process transactions accurately and swiftly, and provide the Bank with market information and analyses useful in conducting monetary policy. In addition, the Bank recently began considering the amount of successful bids in the previous year as a criterion for the selection of counterparties for market operations in the following year. These requests are being made because the central bank needs to effect monetary operations through the smooth provision of funds. Also, the eligibility criteria for counterparties must be as transparent as possible since it is impossible to conduct transactions with all market participants. 
 6 BIS Review 36/2003 Having said all this, let me note that the Bank and its counterparties in market operations are important to each other as trading parties in financial markets. In my opinion, the term (cid:147)trading party(cid:148) has two significant implications. The first implication is that both the Bank and its counterparties aim to achieve their respective goals through the transactions in funds and JGBs. The Bank controls the amount of money in the market or the level of interest rates, while the Bank(cid:146)s counterparties adjust their position in funds and JGB holdings and improve profitability. Let me take the example of undersubscription. Undersubscription in the Bank(cid:146)s funds-supplying operations occurs in the following cases: financial institutions have already secured enough funds to satisfy reserve requirements for the period; they have managed to raise sufficient funds in the market to cover themselves over interim and fiscal year-end book closings; and, they can sell any TBs or FBs or CP they hold to end-investors without difficulties. Thus, undersubscription occurs when counterparties do not need the Bank(cid:146)s market operations. This implies that, in order to smoothly conduct market operations, the Bank must understand and satisfy its counterparties(cid:146) need for market operations. It also means that the Bank must devise market operations that create such a need. This rather obvious point was not clearly recognized under the past framework where interest rates were the target. In that framework, the Bank was rather passive. It provided funds when interest rates rose higher than the target, and absorbed funds when interest rates fell below the target. In contrast, under the present framework where funds are amply provided to achieve the target balance of current account deposits, the Bank has been under pressure to increase funds held in current account deposits in line with the target. This has increased more than ever our awareness of the significance of transactions in financial markets. For example, if for some reason we observe a tightening of the conditions in a certain market in the money markets, the Financial Markets Department of the Bank will consider providing funds to that market. Given its responsibility to ensure market stability, the provision of funds in such a circumstance would clearly be an appropriate decision. Looking at this differently, a tightening of market conditions suggests that there is a demand for funds in that particular market. As the Bank is trying to maintain the balance of current account deposits at unprecedentedly high levels, it should take advantage of such a demand for the smooth provision of funds. B. Exchange of information through market operations The second implication of a trading party is that the Bank and its counterparties exchange information. As is suggested by the term (cid:147)market intelligence,(cid:148) we may be able to obtain a variety of information and knowledge by carefully monitoring market movements. This is the reason why we request the counterparties to provide us with market information and analyses useful in conducting monetary policy. We conduct market operations daily, and the results of these operations are a very important source of information for us in gaining insight into the counterparties(cid:146) assessment of our offers. Of course, this is not a one-way flow of information. Presumably the results of market operations offer the counterparties valuable information on overall market conditions, including insight into the action of other participating players. It may perhaps seem counterintuitive, but the results of market operations have come to play an increasingly important role, given the reduced number of transactions taking place in the money market. I would like to add that, as players in the same market, the Bank and its counterparties in market operations should exchange information and ideas on how to improve the market infrastructure and make the market function more smoothly. Concluding remarks My talk today has focused on technical aspects of market operations conducted under quantitative easing. It includes a number of issues that are of fundamental importance when thinking about the conduct of monetary policy. Market functioning, which I touched upon, is one of these important issues. We at the Bank will continue to exert every effort to enhance the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, while ensuring the smooth provision of funds within the framework of quantitative easing. 
 BIS Review 36/2003 7 We are closely monitoring the market for even the slightest change through various channels, including daily market operations. However, we believe it is major market players like yourselves who possess the most reliable information and insight into market conditions through direct dealing with a variety of customers. As we are now in uncharted territory for monetary policy, we appreciate your sharing with us your insight so that we can together navigate these waters safely. 
 BIS Review 36/2003 1 R Basant Roi: Regulatory and supervisory infrastructure in Mauritius Address by Mr R Basant Roi, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the Annual Meeting of the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors, Pointe aux Piments, 22 July 2003. *      *      * Honourable Minister of Economic Development, Financial Services and Corporate Affairs Mr Colin Powell, Chairman of Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen Good morning I am delighted to welcome you to the Annual Meeting of the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors in Mauritius. It is my privilege to welcome Mr Colin Powell who has been the Chairman of the OGBS since 1981. I am pleased to note that a seminar on the New Capital Accord and Corporate Governance was held yesterday with the collaboration of the Financial Stability Institute. Mauritius is a member of the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors as from the time offshore banking activities started here. I wish to stress right at the outset that the Bank of Mauritius has been pursuing a selective licensing policy with a view to bringing into our jurisdiction players of international repute. The maintenance of a clean international image has always been an overriding consideration. Of late there has been mounting demand for tighter surveillance of offshore centres to guard against money laundering and international financial instability. More than ever it is necessary to enhance supervisory co-operation between banking supervisors in offshore financial centres through the implementation of international standards for cross-border banking supervision. The globalisation of financial services companies, coupled with the development in information technology have greatly facilitated movements of funds from one jurisdiction to another. Often funds are moved by a (cid:145)simple click of the mouse.(cid:146) It is imperative for all jurisdictions to observe acceptable standards of banking supervision. The efforts made in one jurisdiction to combat money laundering can be nullified by the deficiencies and lax regulations existing in other jurisdictions. We fully appreciate the role of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) that carried out evaluations of anti-money laundering regimes in different countries. Naming and shaming non-cooperative countries does seem to produce the desired results. I wish to express my appreciation of the Customer Due Diligence (CDD) document - a joint product of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors. While the document recognises the cross-border implications of financial transactions, it also favours exchange of information pertaining to customer adoption policies and procedures of financial institutions. The essence of the Customer Due Diligence paper has been included in the revised version of the Guidance Notes on AML/CFT. The Bank of Mauritius has issued the new Guidance Notes to the industry on a consultative basis. The Customer Due Diligence document also attributes the responsibility to national supervisors for ensuring that banks have minimum standards and internal controls that allow them to know their customers. Given the increasing responsibilities of bank supervisors, I have proceeded with a significant capacity building in the Supervision Department of the Bank. The staff has been almost doubled and is being intensively trained to meet the challenges in the years ahead. Last year, we underwent an FSAP assessment at our own request. The Bank of Mauritius Act and Banking Act are being revised to further enhance compliance with the (cid:147)Core Principles(cid:148) and to take into consideration the recommendations made by the FSAP team following its detailed assessment of compliance with the 25 core principles for Effective Supervision and Transparency of Banking Supervision. The Bank issued on November 2002 a Guideline on Public Disclosure of Information by financial institutions. Rigid bank secrecy laws are no longer acceptable in the global fight against money laundering. Information has to be shared with competent authorities. In this connexion, the Financial Intelligence and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2002 established the Financial Intelligence Unit. The FIU has explicit power to gather, analyse and disseminate information. 
 2 BIS Review 36/2003 In the last few years we have made a great leap forward in improving the regulatory and supervisory infrastructure in Mauritius. We have since quite sometime adopted a prophylactic approach in our regulatory and supervisory policies in respect of our banking industry. The job of regulators and supervisors has never been an easy one. It is often misunderstood. It(cid:146)s a highly complex one full of invisible hurdles. The hurdles stemming from inside the country are relatively easy to overcome. Those stemming from abroad are not that easily overcome. Regulators and supervisors across the world have however been doing an excellent job. They are never congratulated for their good performance. And never expect to be congratulated. So let us congratulate ourselves. Let me wish the Annual Meeting of the OGBS the very best of success. May I also wish you a pleasant stay in Mauritius. Thank you. 
 BIS Review 42/2003 1 Seung Park: Economic situation and monetary policy in Korea Contribution by Mr Seung Park, Governor of the Bank of Korea, to the Korea Times, 24 September 2003. *      *      * 1. The Korean economic situation and outlook From early this year, Korea has been experiencing the most difficult economic situation since overcoming the 1997 currency crisis. Last year(cid:146)s strong GDP growth of 6.3 percent was achieved against the backdrop of the depressed world economy. This year, though, Korean GDP grew only 3.7 percent in the first quarter compared to the same period of the previous year before sliding further to 1.9 percent in the second quarter. Although economic activity appears not to have worsened from its trough in the second quarter, no clearly marked recovery trend has yet become evident. This lackluster economic performance came primarily from unfavorable external factors. The recovery of major economies worldwide and most significantly that of the U.S. proved to be delayed. Uncertainty also mounted in response to the war in Iraq, the North Korean nuclear issue and the widespread outbreak of SARS within East and Southeast Asia. Unsurprisingly, domestic demand contracted greatly, particularly in the form of consumption and facilities investment. Lately, external conditions have been showing a gradual improvement. After the early end to the war in Iraq, the economies of the U.S. and Japan have shown clear signs of a recovery. Euroland has not yet shaken off its recession, but there too indicators of consumer and business confidence are picking up. China is again seeing strong economic growth now that SARS has been contained. All in all, the general outlook for the global economy is brightening. In addition, hopes are growing that the North Korean nuclear issue can be peacefully resolved as, prompted by the holding of multilateral talks, all the countries involved have stepped up their efforts to bring this about. The effects of the various pump-priming measures taken by the Bank of Korea and the government are expected to become progressively more tangible. For its part, the Bank of Korea has lowered its policy rate twice this year. Meanwhile, fiscal expenditure is being expanded by the drawing-up and approval of a 4.5 trillion-won (nearly 38 billion-U.S. dollar) supplementary budget. Measures to reduce the tax burden have also been taken including the lowering of the rate of special excise tax and the granting of increased tax credits for investment. Given the upturn in global conditions and the emerging effects of the economic stimulation package, the Korean economy is expected to move onto a moderate recovery track in the near future, though there may be some impact from the damage inflicted by the recent typhoon. The problems we confront, though, are by no means simple. Above all else, we have the issue of the high social costs exemplified by the recent confrontation between labor unions and employers and the prevalence of actions placing the interests of vested interest groups above those of society as a whole. The timely resolution of this conundrum is crucial to the long-term health and viability of the country(cid:146)s economy. We also have to tackle the potential threats to financial stability including the mounting number of Koreans on credit blacklists, swelling overdue loans in the household sector and the frail management status of certain financial institutions. One of the characteristics of Korean society inherited from a history of adversity is that when people share the perception that the country faces a crisis, they unite as one in enduring whatever hardship it takes to overcome it. This was the wellspring from which Korea drew the strength to surmount the currency crisis. And helped by these social dynamics, Koreans will, I am confident, deal skillfully with the present challenges. There are already signs that a social consensus has been reached on the need to overcome the problems that I have mentioned for the good of the Korean economy. The government is now also directing its attention toward curing the evil of spiralling social costs. 2. Monetary policy In the light of the shifting economic environment, the Bank of Korea has conducted monetary policy so as to support the economic recovery while smoothing out the internal and external disequilibria. 
 2 BIS Review 42/2003 Early this year, because of the current account moving into the red and the upward price pressures brought about by the steep run-up of international oil prices, we had difficulties in making use of the interest rate policy lever to deal with the downturn in economic activities. We therefore left our target rate, the overnight call rate, on hold. But the current account shifted into surplus and price movements settled down once international oil prices showed downward stability following the early end of the war in Iraq. For this year as a whole, too, our forecasts pointed to core inflation being held stable within its target range at the 3 percent level and to the current account maintaining its underlying surplus trend since the 1997 currency crisis. Under these circumstances, the Bank of Korea moved to revive business and consumer confidence. In May and again in July, it reduced its overnight call rate by 50 basis points in all, bringing it down to its present historically low level of 3.75 percent. A number of actions have also been taken by the Bank of Korea to stabilize the financial markets. It has ensured an adequate supply of liquidity through open market operations in order to counter temporary financial market unease. This emerged in March following the revelation of accounting malpractices at a few large companies and worries about credit card companies going under. It resurfaced in June when the staff of Chohung Bank went on strike. The Bank of Korea will continue to adopt a (cid:147)look at everything approach(cid:148) in the future, taking into overall account the impact of changing conditions at home and abroad on growth, prices and the balance of payments. In the course of conducting monetary policy, particular attention will be paid to alleviating potential risk factors including household debt so as to ensure the stability of the financial markets. From the start of next year, the revised Bank of Korea Act will come into effect, substantially increasing the Bank of Korea(cid:146)s powers and its degree of independence. Under the revised central banking legislation, the existing practice of setting an inflation target every year will be replaced by a medium-term inflation targeting system. The central bank is also given greatly increased responsibilities for the comprehensive management and oversight of the payments and settlements system. In keeping with its heightened role, the Bank of Korea will strive even harder to be effective in achieving the twin goals of its monetary policy: macroeconomic stability and financial stability. 
 BIS Review 42/2003 1 Joseph Yam: A broad-brush economic picture of the Asia-Pacific region Opening remarks by Mr Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the 2003 Australasian Macroeconomics Workshop, Hong Kong, 22 September 2003. *      *      * Good Morning, It is a great pleasure for me to open the 2003 Australasian Macroeconomics Workshop and to welcome all of you to Hong Kong. I understand that this is the eighth time the workshop is being held, and that it is the first time you are meeting outside of Australia and New Zealand. I am delighted that you have chosen Hong Kong. We are now, I hope, entering a period of optimism for our city after a very tough few months, and there are continuing structural adjustments in Hong Kong arising from the economic integration with the Mainland, which is growing rapidly, bringing challenges as well as opportunities: it is a very interesting time to see Hong Kong. It may surprise you that the HKIMR decided to follow the splendid precedent set by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in 2002 and host this year(cid:146)s workshop. But it should not be too much of a surprise. Rather than giving a traditional lecture this morning, let me explain to you why, as Chairman of the Board of the HKIMR, I feel that conferences such as this are so important. But I should first say this: while the HKIMR was established by the HKMA, its Council of Advisors, of which I am not a member, determines its programme of activities. It therefore enjoys professional independence. Thus, I was not a party to the Council(cid:146)s deliberation of, and its decision to support, Professor Crosby(cid:146)s proposal to hold the Workshop here. But I am very pleased that the Council of Advisors decided to do so. I will start from the observation that Hong Kong(cid:146)s economy - like many Asian economies - is a small ship in a big ocean. While the weather today may be placid, the winds can pick up without warning and the waves can be forbidding. You all know about the series of massive speculative capital flows that Asian economies, and even Australia and New Zealand, were exposed to during the Asian financial crisis, and how Hong Kong finally rode out that storm. In times such as those, policymakers naturally ask what is the right course to steer, what are the right policies to follow. One policy is clear - to ensure that the boat is as seaworthy as possible. This, of course, we have sought to do. Following the Asian financial crisis we took a large number of measures to improve the functioning of the currency board, and the efficiency of the financial infrastructure in Hong Kong more broadly. We also continue to monitor and improve our system of banking supervision, in recognition of the fact that one reason we did ride out the Asian financial crisis was undoubtedly that banks were strong. Some observers have suggested throwing some sand in the wheels of international finance. By limiting capital flows, the argument goes, it becomes easier for central banks to maintain monetary and financial stability in turbulent times and to cope with the potency of international finance that comes with globalisation. Indeed, control in one form or another has become quite popular in this region. But, for an international financial centre such as Hong Kong, whose main source of income stems from an ever-growing economic and financial integration with the rest of the world economy, such a policy is, to us, clearly undesirable. Moreover, the Basic Law of Hong Kong also bars any foreign exchange control policies and any restrictions on the free flow of capital within, into and out of Hong Kong. Others suggest that the Hong Kong economy would be better able to withstand economic shocks and disturbances if the currency board was adjusted or gave way to something else: different observers have different pet ideas and there seems to be no agreement on what that alternative would be. I have spoken a great many times on this topic and I do not propose to do so again today. Let me just say that I remain convinced that the currency board has remained a fundamental source of stability for Hong Kong in the 239 months of its existence since it came into being in October 1983. What else can be done to ensure monetary and financial stability not just in Hong Kong, but also in this rather fragmented and diverse region, in terms of geography, size of markets, culture and stages of economic development? To my mind, much greater regional co-operation in the monetary and financial arenas should be on the policy agenda. Such co-operation can take many forms, ranging from increasing and more open interactions between central banks in the Asian region for the purpose of enhancing the stability, integrity, diversity and efficiency of financial intermediation in the region, and admittedly very much further down the road, to serious discussions of whether monetary integration and the establishment of an Asian Monetary Union should be a goal. 
 2 BIS Review 42/2003 But to do that, we need to build stronger personal links between economists working on monetary and financial issues at universities, in central banks and in international institutions such as the IMF and the BIS. By debating and discussing and, yes, disagreeing, we can over time generate much more clarity about what path we need to follow in enhancing monetary and financial stability in Asia and elsewhere. Some may wonder why I include academic economists in that list. I do so for three important reasons. First, research undertaken in universities very frequently serves as a starting point for work undertaken in central banks. One of you may just have written a very good paper on the sensitivity of the New Zealand economy to international business cycles or the determination of capital flows between Thailand and the rest of the world. It may well be that this paper, unknown to the author, triggers research at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on how sensitive our economy is to external factors or on the determination of capital flows in and out of Hong Kong. Secondly, academic research undertaken in a free and open manner, and presented at conferences such as this, serves to improve the quality of research in central banks. There is a strong presumption in my mind that competition, no matter whether it be in the market for airline tickets or in econometric models of exchange rates, are beneficial to consumers - and central banks are large consumers of economic research. More directly, I know that some of the HKMA(cid:146)s research staff will present papers here, and I am sure that your comments on the papers will trigger ideas for how they could be improved. Next time, they will be better. Thirdly, universities are the source of staff for central banks. We do hire your students and sometimes we are even able to hire academic researchers. In sum, the Asia-Pacific region needs more co-operation and exchange of ideas in the monetary and financial sphere, and to achieve that it needs stronger links between economists working in this area in central banks, international institutions and universities. This is exactly what the Australasian Macroeconomics Workshop is all about, and I am delighted that we could tempt you to come to Hong Kong for this year(cid:146)s meeting. Thank you and let the fun begin. 
 BIS Review 42/2003 1 Ernst Welteke: The global economic situation Speech by Mr Ernst Welteke, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank and Governor of the IMF for Germany, at the 2003 IMF/World Bank Annual Meeting, Dubai, 23 September 2003. *      *      * I. I am pleased that the IMF and the World Bank are holding their annual meetings in the United Arab Emirates this year. For the first time, these meetings are being hosted by a country in this region. I am sure that the IMF and the World Bank have made an excellent choice in selecting Dubai as the venue. I thank the United Arab Emirates for their warm hospitality and their splendid organizational performance. II. The economic situation in many parts of the world has improved. The IMF(cid:146)s latest forecasts indicate that an upswing is under way. While we broadly share this view, we see, however, still a number of risks. In this context, I wish to mention three problems: First, there are widespread concerns that the large current account deficits and surpluses are not sustainable. Reducing trade restrictions and internal imbalances would mitigate the risk of disorderly exchange rate adjustments. However, measures distorting exchange rates, trade, or capital movements are counterproductive. Global economic problems require multilateral resolutions. Second, despite some progress in consolidating government budgets, the risks associated with large budget deficits have by no means been averted: This is not least reflected in the recent rise in long-term interest rates. Therefore, fiscal consolidation must be continued. This is a particular challenge in periods of insufficient growth. A medium-term fiscal framework could help to overcome these problems. Third, monetary policy makers are currently facing an unfamiliar situation: For several years now, both inflation rates and nominal interest rates have been at their lowest level in decades. At the same time, there is ample liquidity which is still growing. New bubbles must be avoided. Therefore, central banks must remain vigilant. As a central bank Governor, I am particularly keen on making that point. III. Ladies and Gentlemen, despite these risks, the economic upswing will broaden and gain strength. This will provide an opportunity which must be seized to fully implement the ongoing reforms. We all know that reforms may be painful in the short run. However, they provide the basis for higher growth in the long term for the benefit of all. IV. We have to make sure that the economic upswing stabilizes and broadens in a sound financial environment. The IMF and the World Bank have an important role to play with regard to crisis prevention and crisis resolution. I welcome the progress made in this area: (cid:1)(cid:2)The IMF(cid:146)s surveillance will be further strengthened. (cid:1)(cid:2)Transparency will be enhanced. 
 2 BIS Review 42/2003 (cid:1)(cid:2)More and more countries are realizing the benefits of the Financial Sector Assessment Program. (cid:1)(cid:2)And the rules governing access to the Fund(cid:146)s financial resources in capital account crises have been strengthened. Going forward, the focus should be on implementing these measures. V. Ladies and Gentlemen, the World Bank and the developing countries are facing major challenges too. (cid:1)(cid:2)Let me begin with the Doha round. I find it inappropriate that industrial countries spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year to protect their own products. These subsidies are several times larger than the amount of development assistance. This makes it difficult to exploit the virtues of globalisation for the benefit of all. It would be extremely unfortunate if the failure of the Cancun negotiations would lead to trade conflicts. Again, there is no reasonable alternative to the multilateral approach. (cid:1)(cid:2)Second, the (cid:147)Millennium Development Goals(cid:148) reaffirmed at Monterrey are a guideline for German policy. Achieving these goals requires joint efforts. Well-targeted financial aid to developing countries can only be successful if combined with good governance and sound institutions. (cid:1)(cid:2)Last but not least, a remark on quotas and voting rights. I know that many countries are seeking higher voting shares. Yet, the proper functioning of the IMF and the World Bank as financial institutions requires that a strong link is maintained between member countries(cid:146) quota shares and their capacity to contribute to the financial resources as reflected by their economic weight. However, I believe there is certainly some justification for an increase in basic votes. Thank you for your attention. 
 BIS Review 42/2003 1 Y V Reddy: A central banker(cid:146)s perspective of the world economy Statement by Mr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India and Alternate Governor of the Fund for India, at the Joint Annual Discussion of the Boards of Governors, on the occasion of the 2003 IMF/World Bank Annual Meeting, Dubai, 23-24 September 2003. *      *      * World Bank Group International Bank for Reconstruction and Development International Finance Corporation International Development Association International Centre For Settlement Of Investment Disputes Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency International Monetary Fund Mr. Chairman: Since we met last in April 2003, there have been some signs of improvement in the global environment. Recent economic data of some countries as well as some forward looking market indicators, particularly those relating to financial markets indicate that we may be seeing some signs of global economic recovery. While we share the view that this could indicate the beginning of a stronger recovery, we recognize that considerable risks still persist, though the upside risks appear to outweigh the downside risks. The outlook for the United States, Euro area and Japan presents a mixed picture. If current trends are any indication, global recovery in the near-term would be led by the United States. However, the widened and historically high twin deficits, in fiscal and current accounts, of the United States pose the threat of possible disruptive adjustment of the US dollar against other major currencies. We recognize this as a necessary short term trade-off for realizing medium-term gains. We, therefore, urge all the major currency areas to coordinate their policies and to carefully monitor currency market behavior to minimize potential adverse repercussions on financial markets and on sustainability of global economic recovery. The recent depreciation of dollar has, to some extent, minimized the possibility of such disruptive adjustment. Further, continuing robust productivity trends support the strong prospect for recovery in the United States. In this regard, there is considerable merit in the U.S. evolving a medium-term fiscal framework to bring its fiscal position on to a sustainable path. The outlook for the Euro area seems rather flat. As in the US, there is a comparable element of trade-off. While the monetary stimulus provided by the European Central Bank is encouraging, scope exists for using fiscal stimulus in a more countercyclical manner. In our view, the Stability and Growth Pact should be applied in a flexible manner to allow the automatic stabilizers to run their courses in the short-term, even if that results in marginal breaching of ceilings on fiscal deficits, especially in countries where this could trigger recovery. We welcome the reforms undertaken to improve the accounting and auditing standards and corporate governance practices both in the US and the EU. These improvements are partly reflected in the strengthening of corporate bond and equity markets. The primary bond market issues have become more buoyant. Sovereign yields, in general, have declined, combined with a compression of yield spreads. We consider these developments as supportive of increased capital flows into emerging markets and for the general strengthening of intermediation in international capital markets. Though there was a temporary upward shift in the long-term yields of bonds in the US, potential for significant risks of further increase in bond yields appear remote. First, the policy interest rates have declined to historically low levels and upward hikes in quick succession are therefore unlikely. The housing and mortgage markets as also bond markets cannot withstand such sudden shocks. Second, the probability of inflation undershooting and the consequent adverse implications for deflationary expectations are feared by many. The question also remains as to how long and to what extent the US would lead the global recovery. It is important for the EU and also Japan to intensify structural and financial sector reforms with redoubled vigor. In some countries, labor and product market reforms should receive priority as 
 2 BIS Review 42/2003 important components of such reforms. We encourage the Euro area countries to take steps to promote productivity and efficiency gains, given the minimal scope, in the short-run, for achieving higher labor participation rates. The necessity of achieving these gains, and a general increase in demand arises from the impending medium-term fiscal risks associated with demographic trends and the attendant pension reforms. Similarly, we recognize that more vigorous steps may help Japan counteract deflationary expectations an address the fragility of the financial system. In the medium-term Japan also requires further restoration of fiscal stabilization. Growth is expected to remain robust in most emerging market economies and, to some extent, in Africa. These are propelled in no small measure by stronger macroeconomic policies, structural reforms and improvements in the institutional structure. Prospects have also improved due to general improvements in major industrial countries, favorable terms of trade due to non-oil commodity price increases, and improved financial market conditions, especially in the bond markets. It is imperative that greater resources flow into these countries to help sustain growth. The current favorable financial market conditions, no doubt, provide an opportunity for these countries to steer ahead with remaining structural reforms and achieve greater fiscal and external sector sustainability. Among the developing countries, emerging countries in Asia continue to remain a bright spot. They have shown extraordinary resilience in the face of the recent global slowdown and continue to exhibit healthy recovery. While timely and complementary policy actions taken by a number of countries to facilitate the revival of external demand and expand intra-regional trade are promising, medium-term prospects would depend on the recovery in major industrial countries. The scope for exchange rate flexibility, particularly in view of the recent build up of reserves in many countries, has generated a lot of debate over the last few months. This calls for a more dynamic and pragmatic approach in the analysis of recent trends in exchange rates and reserve management practices keeping in view country specific circumstances. The recent strengthening of external position of many developing countries through building up substantial foreign exchange reserves can be viewed from several perspectives. First, it is in part, a reflection of the lack of confidence in the international financial architecture. International liquidity support through official channels is beset with problems relating to adequacy of volumes, timely availability, reasonableness of costs and above all, limited extent of assurances. Second, it is also a reflection of efforts to contain risks from external shocks. Private capital flows which dominate capital movements tend to be pro-cyclical even when fundamentals are strong. It is therefore necessary for developing countries to build cushions when times are favorable. High reserves provide some self-insurance which is effective in building confidence including among the rating agencies and possibly in dealing with threat of crises. Third, the reserve accumulation could also be seen in the context of the availability of abundant international liquidity following the easing of the monetary policy in industrial countries. The resultant excess liquidity flowed into the emerging markets. In the event of hardening of interest rates in industrialized countries, this liquidity may as quickly dry up; in that situation, emerging market should have sufficient cushion to withstand such reverse flows of capital. Fourth, and most important, the reserve build up could be the result of countries aiming at containing volatility in foreign exchange markets. It should be recognised that the self corrective mechanism in foreign exchange markets seen in developed countries is conspicuously absent presently among many emerging markets. It is also necessary to recognize that developing countries face major challenges in their effort for sustained economic growth which could enable them to make a significant impact on poverty reduction. Recent studies by the World Bank indicate that there would be considerable shortfalls in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). These failures would not only be limited to some under-performing low income countries; even countries which have made rapid strides in sustained economic growth over the past decade, would not be able to meet critical goals. The level of development assistance currently available and even the additional commitments made at Monterrey, and subsequently, would not be sufficient to meet the minimum financing needs. Developing countries have huge unmet financing needs relative to MDG targets and even with their best efforts, they would not be able to make up the deficiency. There is a very strong case for substantially stepping up the quantum and improving the quality of development assistance. There are two aspects to this which we would like to stress. One, is the need to make allocation of development assistance to countries equitable. The guiding principles should be the incidence of poverty and the effectiveness of poverty reduction efforts. This is best done in multilateral settings so that allocation based on national or strategic considerations are kept to the minimum. The breadth of their work, especially the analytic services and the richness of their development experience improve the quality of policy dialogue. There is also the need to reduce transaction cost of development 
 BIS Review 42/2003 3 assistance through better harmonization of procedures and processes. The Rome initiative needs to be followed up and bilateral donors should look at ways of working with multilateral institutions so that common mechanisms for project preparation, appraisal, procurement, monitoring, reporting, auditing, etc. could be evolved. Another way would be to cofinance projects and programmes that recipient countries draw up and avoid running parallel stand-alone projects that yield sub-optimal results and strain country capacities. Developing countries have been taking courageous steps in reforming their policy environment, improving their institutions of governance and in general, widening, deepening and making more equitable the delivery of services to the poor. Timely and productive development assistance as well as increased access to markets are required to complement and strengthen these efforts. Developed countries must be prepared to play the role of partners in this process as they agreed to do at Monterrey. All players in the development process - developing countries, developed countries and the multilateral institutions - have to work to bring about greater accountability. The monitoring of policies, actions and outcomes needed to achieve MDGs can be a useful tool to bring about increased effectiveness of the development process. While this would require considerable efforts at improving the capacities in developing countries, particularly in gathering reliable and accurate statistical data, such efforts should be a part of the overall development process and should not be seen as an end in itself. Side by side, we need to develop strong partnerships so that country ownership is assured. Further work is also required in order to enhance the voice and participation of developing and transition countries in the multilateral institutions. While we appreciate that there are no quick fixes, we would stress that on-going dialogue and efforts to evolve solutions that better reflect changed realities is the way forward. Together, we would work towards improving the environment where we see the benefits of economic growth percolating to those who have been hitherto denied and to those who have suffered painful adjustments. There is no single mantra that would work everywhere and our policies should recognize this. But, if we are able to develop a real partnership, with each nation allowed to exploit its comparative advantage, and not be held back by artificial barriers and constraints, there is no reason why we will not succeed. 
 BIS Review 40/2003 1 Vepa Kamesam: Financing for entrepreneurship and SMEs - an Indian perspective  Address by Mr Vepa Kamesam, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at OECD (cid:147)Workshop on Entrepreneurship in a Global Economy: Strategic Issues and Policies(cid:148) in the panel (cid:147)Identifying the Real Policy Issues(cid:148) in the Session on (cid:147)Improving Financing for Entrepreneurship and SMEs(cid:148), Budapest, 9 September 2003. *      *      * I am indeed thankful to OECD for inviting me as speaker at this important workshop on (cid:147)Entrepreneurship in a Global Economy(cid:148). In my address, I shall share with you some of the initiatives that are being taken by the Indian authorities with regard to the Small Scale Industries (SSI), against the backdrop of the SME financing in a cross-country perspective. In view of the continuing financing problems of the SMEs, at least two broad approaches have been adopted at the national level viz.,  (i) facilitating access of SMEs to extant sources of financing; and  (ii) developing newer sources of financing in terms of venture capital and business angle networks. As far as existing sources of financing are concerned, the trend is towards reduced and more flexible loan schemes as well as loan guarantees. Competitive markets and a deregulated interest rate regime generally ensure that interest rates on guaranteed loans (including guarantee premium) are relatively low.  With regard to newer sources of financing, many OECD countries are considering liberalizing the rules regarding venture capital investment. On-going research at the OECD indicates that effective venture capital policies include diversifying venture investors, channeling venture capital to seed firms in growth sectors and phasing out of Government equity schemes as private markets develop.  Like any other developing countries, in India also, the Small Scale Industry (SSI) plays a very significant role in terms of balanced and sustainable growth, employment generation, development of entrepreneurial skills and contribution to export earnings. As at the end of March 2002, there were around 3.6 million SSI units - constituting 95 per cent of the industrial units in the country - which produced a large number and a wide range of items with associated technology varying from traditional to state-of-art. These SSI units provided employment to nearly 20 million persons, accounted for 40 per cent of the value added in the manufacturing sector, 34 per cent of total national exports and 7 per cent of GDP during 2002-03.  In the Indian context, the definition of the SSI sector is largely framed in terms of cumulative investment in plant and machinery while most of the countries adopt the level of employment as the criterion for defining the SSI sector. According to the official definition adopted in India since 1998, the investment limit up to Rs.10 million in plant and machinery is treated as SSI sector. However, in respect of certain specified items such as hosiery, hand tools, drugs & pharmaceuticals and stationary items above investment limit in plant and machinery has been enhanced up to Rs.50 million. Since 1967, there is a policy of reserving selected products in the manufacturing sector for exclusive production in the SSI sector. The list of reserved items has been revised from time-to-time.  The policy initiatives in India have always recognised that SSIs contribute to the material progress of the country. Small firms are capable of producing a larger quantum of consumer goods than before to meet the possible increase in demand that would arise on account of the spurt in incomes, generated by fresh investments in heavy and basic industries. It is also taken for granted that small firms would, in the process, create additional employment opportunities. Implicit also is the assumption that SSIs are less capital intensive and more labour absorbing. This is regarded as an important gain of promoting SSIs, given the country(cid:146)s resource endowments, namely labour abundance and scarcity of capital.  Among the developing countries, India was the first to display special consideration to SSIs. As alluded to earlier, the basic focus of Indian Government has been that, employment generation is of paramount importance in a labour surplus economy. Small enterprises manufacturing labour-intensive products make economical use of capital and absorb the abundant labour supply that characterise an 
 2 BIS Review 40/2003 underdeveloped economy. Various measures used for the development of SSI have included product reservations, fiscal concessions, preferential allocations of credit and interest subsidy in a credit rationing framework, extension of business and technical services by the government and preferential procurement by the government. SSIs have been given preferential treatment through the provision of lower interest rates as well as requirement for a minimum credit allocation from the commercial banks. Since 1986, fiscal incentives have also been provided to the SSI units in terms of complete exemption from excise duties or payment of lower rates, under specified conditions. Since April 1995, SSI units are allowed a deduction of 25 per cent of the profits for a period of ten years, for taxation purpose. In case the SSI units set up in specified backward area, full tax exemption is allowed for the first five years and a deduction of 25 per cent in the subsequent five years. In recognition of the contribution and the vast potential of the SSI sector as well as its inherent infirmities, provision of adequate credit to this sector has continued to be an important element of banking policy, even though economic and financial policies themselves have undergone significant transformation, particularly after the initiation of structural reforms in 1991. Bank credit to the SSI sector increased from Rs.168 billion in March 1991 to Rs.530 billion in March 2003.  In the policy context, there has been a paradigm shift. The Indian industry remained within a inward oriented policy framework up to the 1990s. With globalisation, liberalization, financial and real sector reforms, the country adopted an outward looking approach. At present, both the industrial sector in general and SSI sector in particular are exposed to international competitive environment. However, the most significant aspect is that India has evolved a sound institutional set up for financing of the SSI sector. A separate industrial policy was announced as part of the structural reforms in 1991 which not only eliminated various controls on the industrial sector, provided a greater role for the private sector and encouraged inflow of foreign investment and technology, but also contained specific initiatives for the development of the SSI sector. The introduced a comprehensive policy package which includes fiscal, credit, infrastructural and technological. Now the emphasis is on quality improvement, marketing and streamlining regulations.  There are multiple institutions in the public, private and cooperative sectors of the Indian economy that cater to the credit needs of the SSI sector, both for fixed assets creation as well as for working capital. Consequent to the nationalisation of major banks in 1969, banking policy mandated that at least 40 per cent of bank credit should be directed towards the priority sector constituting agriculture, SSI and individual service and business sectors. Preferential treatment was also provided to the SSI sector via lower rates of interest on bank credit. The Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) was set up in April 1990 as the principal financial institution for promotion, financing and development of the SSI sector and for coordinating the activities of other institutions engaged in similar activities. A Fair Practices Code has also been adopted by SIDBI which, inter-alia, clearly sets out the procedures that would be followed in respect of loan applications, appraisals and disbursements. In order to boost investment in SSI sector, the benefits of exemption of capital gains arising from the transfer of long-term capital assets are allowed if such capital gains are invested in bonds by the Small Scale Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) with effect from April 2002.  A Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for Small Industries has been launched and the SIDBI set up the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Small Industries (CGTSI), to implement the Guarantee Scheme. The main objective of CGTSI is to facilitate hassle-free credit to the SSI sector and encourage banks to shift from collateral-based or security-oriented lending to. The CGTSI is in the process of developing a Mutual Credit Guarantee Scheme (MCGS) on the lines of similar schemes in Italy and other European countries; such schemes essentially involve a guarantee from industry associations in which the borrower is also a member which, in turn, enhances the lender(cid:146)s confidence. The SIDBI has also encouraged the growth of the venture capital industry for hi-tech SME units in India by promoting 13 State / regional level funds and setting up an all India Venture Fund.  The Government of India had launched many Schemes for technological upgradation and modernisation, protection of workers affected by technological upgradation and modernisation, infrastructure development, entrepreneurship development, as well as increase in the investment limit (to Rs.50 million) for SSI units producing certain items. The Government of India set up a new Ministry in October 1999 to provide more focussed attention to the development of the SSI sector. Several expert committees had also been set up over the 1990s to assess the problems of the SSI sector. Most of the recommendations of these Committees relating to simplification of loan application forms, launching of a new Credit Guarantee Scheme, raising of composite loans, etc have been accepted and implemented.  
 BIS Review 40/2003 3 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also been emphasising on the flow of bank credit to micro enterprises in rural and semi-urban areas set up by vulnerable sections of society including women. A number of initiatives have been taken in this regard and banks have been advised to provide maximum support to Self Help Groups. Furthermore, four informal Groups have been set up by the RBI to analyse various micro-finance issues relating to (i) structure and sustainability; (ii) funding; (iii) regulations; and (iv) capacity-building. The RBI will discuss the recommendations of the informal Groups in a wider forum for possible implementation.  The SSI sector has so far been resilient to the impact of the policy changes - increasing domestic and foreign competition following the de-reservation and import liberalisation of items as well as the relatively high interest rates - and has withstood the general deceleration in the industrial sector during 1997-98 to 2002-03. It has been well recognised that the investment limit of Rs.10 million for the remaining SSI units leaves little scope for such producers to achieve economies of scale and scope and become competitive. Today, it is, in fact, incentive-compatible for SSI units to remain deliberately small - by fragmenting production - in order to avail of fiscal benefits and to stay outside the purview of labour laws. The pace of de-reservation of SSI items, therefore, needs to be accelerated so as to ensure that size does not remain a constraint to higher production, cost-efficiency and technological upgradation.  Let me now focus on the major problems/challenges faced by the SSI sector which are enumerated as under: Collateral The limit for collateral free loans to tiny sector is Rs. 0.5million and that for other SSI units was Rs. 0.1 million. This limit has since been raised to Rs. 0.5 million for other SSI units also. Many small-scale entrepreneurs are facing difficulties in providing collateral security as per the requirements of the financing banks. The limit of 0.5 million has been further increased to Rs.1.5 million in respect of SSI units with good track record and financial position. The problem is addressed to a certain extent with the introduction of the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust Scheme under which collateral free loans up to a limit of Rs. 2.5 million are guaranteed. Cost of loans The high cost of borrowings was a major constraint affecting the growth of the sector. The Bank Rate changes by the RBI combined with CRR and repo rate charges have emerged as signalling devices for interest rate changes. The reduction in Bank rate announced in the last Monetary and Credit Policy or outside the policy from time to time has resulted in a consequential reduction in the lending rates. Banks have now the flexibility to offer lending rates on a fixed rate or on a floating rate. The reduction in interest rates and the offer of floating rates will help the SSI units to procure funds at lower costs than what was prevailing in earlier years.  Delayed payments Considerable delay in settlement of dues/payment of bills by the large-scale buyers to the SSI units adversely affected the recycling of funds and business operation of SSI units. Though the Government has enacted the Delayed Payments Act, many of the SSI units are reluctant to pursue cases against major buyers. The Act since amended in 1998 has made it compulsory that the payment of SSI suppliers should be made within 120 days. To improve the plight of SSI entrepreneurs due to delayed payments, steps for strengthening and popularizing factoring services, without recourse to the SSI suppliers may have to be thought of seriously.  The banks have also been advised about sub-allotting overall limits to the large borrowers specifically for meeting the payment obligations in respect of purchases from SSI. It is expected that these measures will improve the situation of delayed payments.  
 4 BIS Review 40/2003 Marketing Marketing remains the most critical area for the SSI Sector as some of the units are very small and so is their output individually. Adopting consortium approach could best solve the marketing problems of the SSI sector. Besides finance for marketing related activities, dissemination of requisite information on demand pattern, futuristic trend, etc. could be made available by the Development Institutions/SSI Associations, etc.  Challenges emanating from the WTO To face the challenges emanating from the WTO agreement, SSI units irrespective of their size need technology up-gradation and modernisation. An awareness about the implications of WTO agreement has to be created. The preparation for competitiveness needs to be done by the Government as well as entrepreneurs and the corporate. The Government should provide good infrastructure and create level playing field for the industry. Considering the fund constraints with SSI Sector Government has introduced the credit linked capital subsidy scheme for Technology up gradation of Small Scale Industries under which 12% back ended capital subsidy would be admissible on the loans advanced to the SSIs by banks/financial institutions for technology up gradation in certain select sectors.  Sickness Growing incidence of sickness of SSIs is yet another area of concern. When the sickness prolongs it leads to the closure of units and unemployment. Lately mortality of the SSI units has been showing increasing trend. This has wider implications including locking of funds of the lending institutions, loss of scarce material resources and loss of employment. The number of sick SSI units as a percentage to the total number of SSI units is around 10. The number of units identified as potentially viable as a percentage to total sick SSI units is around 8. The causes of sickness are both internal and external. The major causes are limited financial resources, lack of organisational, financial and management skills and expertise, diversion of funds, diversification/expansion before stabilisation, non-availability of power supply shortage of raw materials, marketing difficulties, delayed and inadequate credit, globalisation and liberalisation of the economy, obsolete technology, inadequate infrastructure, etc. With a view to ensuring that potentially viable sick SSI units are provided with the timely and adequate assistance by all agencies concerned, there are State Level Inter Institutional Committees (SLIIC) constituted in each state involving State Government, Financial institutions, commercial banks and SIDBI. SSI Associations are also invited to the meetings of this committee. A sub-committee of SLIIC has also been set up in each state to examine the individual cases referred to it for rehabilitation. To address the incidence of growing sickness in the sector RBI has recently issued a complete set of revised guidelines drawn up on the basis of the recommendations of a Working Group constituted by it for the purpose.  Policy initiatives The Indian industry remained within an inward oriented policy framework up to the 1990s. With globalisation, liberalization, financial and real sector reforms, the country adopted an outward looking approach. At present, both the industrial sector in general and SSI sector in particular are exposed to international competitive environment. However, the most significant aspect is that India has evolved a sound institutional set up for financing of the SSI sector. New industrial policy was announced as part of the structural reforms in 1991, which eliminated various controls on the industrial sector, provided a greater role for the private sector and encouraged inflow of foreign investment and technology, but also contained specific initiatives for the development of the SSI sector.  The pace of de-reservation of SSI items, needs to be accelerated so as to ensure that size does not remain a constraint to higher production, cost-efficiency and technological upgradation. The case for de-reservation of the SSI sector becomes even stronger in the light of the experience of South-East Asian economies which indicates that (a) their export basket transformed from labour-intensive and relatively low technology products (textiles, clothing, shoes, toys, etc) in the 1980s to higher-technology consumer goods and capital-intensive goods (capital goods and petrochemicals) in the 1990s and (b) production of such consumer goods could be achieved by large-scale final assembly operations coupled with copious out-sourcing to small enterprises in order to maintain their competitiveness. Thus, with the de-reservation of the SSI sector in India, a larger number of industrial 
 BIS Review 40/2003 5 units would be in a position to exploit the opportunities provided by globalisation, given the vast potential of exports from this sector. Ministry of SSI under Govt. of India has been laying more emphasis on cluster-based approach for development of SSI sector. So far Ministry has identified 60 clusters for focused development of SSI and banks in these areas are initiating necessary steps to meet their credit requirements effectively.  Future action As the evidence shows, several initiatives are being taken at the national and international levels to foster the development of SMEs and improve their access to finance. Notwithstanding these initiatives, impediments to SME finance remain, in different degrees, in both developed and developing economies, which constitute the single most important factor that could circumscribe their growth trajectory. Accordingly, the attention of policy makers may need to focus on the following three broad issues, viz., creating a conducive business environment, development of clusters, and enhancing credit flows to SMEs as these are widely debated in the contemporary discussions. Governments need to take initiatives to ensure that the overall policy environment encourages industrial activity in general, and SME activity, in particular, given the latter(cid:146)s significant contribution to general economic activity in many countries. This would entail efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability in terms of low fiscal deficits and debts (such that private savings are not pre-empted), low and stable inflation, low real rates of interest and a sustainable current account. This apart, initiatives would need to be taken, wherever necessary, to remove outdated and anomalous restrictions on domestic production, bring about a reduction in tariff and tax rates to internationally competitive levels, create a competitive environment through appropriate legislation, if necessary provide public infrastructure support, reduce inflexibilities in the labour market with due cognizance to the need for appropriate social safety nets and invoke necessary reforms in bankruptcy and exit procedures. Streamlining of procedures to disburse loans to SMEs, creating a regulatory/legal framework that ensures timely payment of dues to SMEs, providing technical training to staff of financial institutions and organising general awareness programmes on SME financing would also be necessary. These measures would not only encourage SME activity but also have a salutary impact on their efficiency and hence, on their overall requirements of finance. Newer forms of SME financing need to be fostered viz., venture capital and leasing. Commercial banks and local government funding agencies would need to play a major role in venture capital financing while insurance funds and pension funds could be tapped as important sources of finance. Leasing, on the other hand, requires a less rigorous legal and regulatory framework vis-(cid:224)-vis bank lending, since the leasing company retains the ownership of assets till the end of the lease. Even so, strengthening of leasing laws, encouraging banks and financial institutions to support leasing companies and appropriate training through technical assistance would help foster the development of this alternative important source of finance for SMEs. In conclusion major problems/challenges faced by SSI sector in India are: (cid:1)(cid:2)availability of collateral free loans (cid:1)(cid:2)cost of loans (cid:1)(cid:2)delayed payments (cid:1)(cid:2)marketing (cid:1)(cid:2)challenges emanating from WTO related issues (cid:1)(cid:2)sickness A number of steps have been initiated to promote the healthy growth of SSI Sector. However, to ensure the prospects of these enterprises, SMEs, in the coming years will have to gear up to face the challenges of liberalisation. I am confident that given the inherent strength, the sector will develop a global vision, respond to more demanding standards of the customers and adopt key strategies that could take them ahead in competition. Credit should not be a constraint for viable projects. I believe that the workshop would bring out valuable policy recommendations for shaping future policy initiatives.  
 BIS Review 40/2003 1 J(cid:252)rgen Stark: EMU - recent developments Opening address by Dr J(cid:252)rgen Stark, Vice President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at CEPR/ESI Conference on (cid:147)The Euro Area as an Economic Entity(cid:148), hosted by the Deutsche Bundesbank in Eltville, 12 September 2003. *      *      * I am very pleased to welcome you here at the Bundesbank(cid:146)s Training Centre on the occasion of the seventh CEPR/ESI Conference. It is important that academics meet with central bank staff. On the one hand, these meetings can help to convey new ideas to monetary policymakers. On the other hand, these ideas should also be scrutinised by more practice-oriented economists. Such meetings also serve the mutual understanding of one another and help to clear up misunderstandings.  I consider these meetings especially valuable because academics should increasingly confront themselves with practical questions and day-to-day policy making. In turn, central bankers are too closely watched to allow themselves to fall behind the curve of academic thinking.  Only a few years ago, the title of this conference would have had a question mark at the end. This is no longer necessary. The euro area, with the highest possible degree of monetary policy integration, is indeed an economic entity, but obviously not a political entity. The political regime consists of a centralised monetary policy and decentralised, but coordinated, economic and budgetary policies. This institutional setting is challenging. It is a unique but appropriate concept tailored to European needs.  We all know, the euro area did not become an economic entity overnight. This fascinating development has its roots in a much broader process initiated in Europe almost half a century ago. The convergence which has taken place in the run-up to monetary union and beyond is impressive. However, this process of European integration is far from complete and is still evolving. Let me now turn to more recent developments. Naturally, the conference will touch upon crucial issues arising after the first five years of the third stage of European Monetary Union (EMU).  In order to stimulate the discussion, allow me to make a few comments from the vantage point of someone involved in the practical sphere of monetary union: I will comment: (cid:1)(cid:2)firstly on the ways the perception of monetary policy within the euro area has evolved; (cid:1)(cid:2)secondly on converging or diverging growth and inflation rates; and  (cid:1)(cid:2)finally on what we have learned up to now with regard to policy coordination and the Stability and Growth Pact. 1. Monetary policy In the past some rather critical statements have been made by academics belonging to the Centre for Economic Policy Research with regard to monitoring the ECB. At times one actually had the impression that the ECB came off much worse than other central banks. These criticisms ranged from those on individual measures taken by the ECB - or it refrained to take - to questions of communication and strategy. Concerns, for example, were voiced about the role of monetary growth in the ECB(cid:146)s strategy. There were also many calls for a more precise definition of the term price stability. Another favourite pastime seems to have been the hunt to dismantle at last the unpopular Stability and Growth Pact.  Since reviewing its strategy this year, the ECB has been making efforts to clarify some misunderstandings which have emerged in its communication with the public. It was made clear that with regard to price stability, the ECB was striving to maintain a medium-term inflation rate of below but close to 2%. Furthermore, it was stressed that money has to be evaluated with respect to the long-term relationship between monetary growth and price dynamics. The (cid:147)monetary analysis(cid:148) will complement the (cid:147)economic analysis(cid:148), which is more relevant in the short to medium term.  
 2 BIS Review 40/2003 I have the impression that, in general, these clarifications were well received. I hope that the conference today and tomorrow will help to shed some light on other important issues within the euro area as well.  2. Business cycles and inflation differentials The introduction of the euro was linked to the expectation that the business cycles of the member states would converge more closely. Furthermore, a decoupling from the US business cycle was expected since the euro area has only a marginally higher degree of openness than the United States. The diversion of growth rates among member states has declined recently. Unfortunately this represents a convergence towards Germany(cid:146)s stagnating growth figures - and not towards the faster expanding euro area countries, as would actually have been desirable.  Contrary to expectations at the outset of monetary union, the business cycles of the euro area and the US seem to be still closely correlated. Economic globalisation has increased international linkages through various channels such as trade, foreign direct investment flows, globalised financial markets and interlinked business expectations. But the most significant point is that shocks to confidence such as the bursting of the high-tech equity bubble and the terrorist attacks have hit capital markets to a similar extent all over the world.  A lack of convergence is revealed by the sustained differentials in inflation among the euro area(cid:146)s member states. It is true that these differentials are fairly small in comparison to the first half of the 1990s. However, following a substantial convergence in the run-up to EMU, inflation differentials widened again.  Divergent economic developments are apparent in other currency areas, too, such as in the USA, without monetary policymakers being able to address this issue. Monetary policy has to be geared towards the data for the currency area as a whole. It cannot address regional policy problems. Otmar Issing once coined that quite succinctly - (cid:147)one size must fit all!(cid:148) The member states had to accept that fact when they joined the third stage of European economic and monetary union. If persistent diverging trends emerge, either they have to be accepted, or, if detrimental economic consequences result, measures need to be taken at the national level. However, interest rate differentials also reflect the adjustment of the real exchange rate. But I do not want to elaborate much on inflation differentials. This issue will be covered in depth in tomorrow(cid:146)s policy lecture by my colleague, Hermann Remsperger. 3. Policy coordination and Stability and Growth Pact The asymmetry of political responsibilities in EMU makes a comprehensive system of coordination procedures indispensable. I believe this is undisputed. The rationale arises from the need to take account of the spill-over effects from national economic policies. Consequently, the EC-Treaty obliges member states to consider national economic policies (cid:147)as a matter of common concern(cid:148) and subject them to multilateral procedures.  Of all the coordination mechanisms, name recognition is highest for the Stability and Growth Pact. The Pact may not be popular in all places, but at least it is well known, albeit not well understood everywhere. I will later on try to illustrate why I remain an ardent advocate of the Pact. However, the core coordination instrument are the broad economic policy guidelines (BEPG). They contain the principal policy objectives and measures. They build the overarching structure for the more specialised coordination and consultation procedures. The guidelines make specific recommendations to each member state and to the Community and are endorsed by the Heads of State or Government. However, they are politically but not legally binding and there are no really effective instruments for enforcing their implementation. Due to the medium and long-term nature of many recommendations, measuring progress concerning implementation has become the main focus of the Commission(cid:146)s work.  
 BIS Review 40/2003 3 The specific coordination processes are: (cid:1)(cid:2)The Luxembourg process (1997), which aims to create more employment. It consists of employment guidelines which have to be implemented by (cid:147)national action plans(cid:148) on employment and are monitored by the Commission.  (cid:1)(cid:2)The Cardiff process (1998), which is intended to enhance structural reforms in the member states and their multilateral monitoring to create (cid:147)peer pressure(cid:148) among them.  (cid:1)(cid:2)The Cologne process (1999), which established a (cid:147)macroeconomic dialogue(cid:148) at Community level with representatives of governments, ECB and trade unions involved. This dialogue aims not to achieve an ex-ante coordination of economic policies, but the exchange of information and views on economic developments.  These processes were enhanced in 2000 by the (cid:147)Lisbon-strategy(cid:148) with its (cid:147)new strategic goal(cid:148) for the next decade, that is (cid:147)to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion(cid:148). A very important conclusion in Lisbon was that no more coordination processes are needed and that the existing processes should be simplified. It is also very reasonable that the BEPGs now focus increasingly on structural policies. That can be a vantage point for the coordination processes to accomplish better-then-expected results in future. Up to now, it has been difficult to detect a noticeable impact from these various coordination processes on the convergence among member states.  Within the framework of the Luxembourg process, governments did not meet their commitments to enhance employment. Unemployment is increasing again and is not significantly lower than in 1997. In keeping with wage autonomy, governments simply cannot impose any guidelines that regulate negotiations between management and trade unions. Up to now, the Cardiff process has led to only limited progress, if at all, on structural reforms in larger economies. The Cologne process seems unnecessary to me. In my judgement, all these processes have been little more than bureaucratic exercises. What are the reasons? (cid:1)(cid:2)after convergence efforts in the run up to the third stage of EMU: adjustment fatigue; (cid:1)(cid:2)the willingness for further progress on integration has lost steam; (cid:1)(cid:2)political behaviour has not adapted to the new environment. The integration of Europe is linked to the readiness to curb national sovereignty. The lasting success of the euro cannot be achieved solely through monetary policy. The success relies as well on the support of the fiscal, labour and structural policies of member states. However, coordination should not be understood as a substitute for the responsibility of policymakers at the national level. The decentralised approach offers scope for healthy policy competition. (cid:147)Best practice(cid:148) should prevail. Furthermore, from a political-economy viewpoint, coordination is an extremely helpful instrument to implement unpopular but necessary policy measures at the national level. The Stability and Growth Pact is part of the foundation of economic and monetary union. But some governments act as if they bore no overall responsibility for this political project of European integration. The ongoing debate on so called (cid:147)reform(cid:148) or on relaxing the terms of the pact has already damaged the foundation and will jeopardise the functioning of monetary union in the medium term. However, it was in fact, a great achievement to adopt self-imposed budgetary rules in order to support monetary policy and to prevent a repetition of the problems of the 1970s. Furthermore, the Stability and Growth Pact is dealing with the challenges of ageing populations.  A critical assessment has to be made, I feel, concerning those initiatives - some of which have already been implemented - that aim to refine the rules of the pact. As a result, these rules, which were originally straightforward and transparent, are becoming increasingly complex and opaque. Even so, the debate is continuing down the same road. The proposals contained in the Sapir Report of June 2003, which would allow an overshooting of the 3% criterion not only in (cid:147)severe recessions(cid:148), but also given almost any decline in economic performance, would dilute the Stability and Growth Pact to the point where the fiscal policy rules are no longer recognisable. I agree with Otmar Issing: the real problem is not any supposed lack of flexibility in the pact, but the failure of some large economies in the euro area to make use of growth phases towards sound and sustainable fiscal positions, like others did. The current difficulties should therefore not tempt 
 4 BIS Review 40/2003 politicians to relax the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact but to apply the rules strictly. The pact is, after all, not an end in itself. It is in the very interest of member states and their people. The consolidation of public finances is indispensable, not least in view of the to be expected strains and burdens on future generations from demographic changes. The Stability and Growth Pact should be seen as part of a comprehensive strategy to avoid pro-cyclical behaviour, to create sufficient budgetary safety margins and to attain sustainable public finance. I know it will be difficult to achieve, but I would very much welcome your support in convincing both the public and politicians that the principles and procedures for budgetary policy in the Treaty and in the Stability and Growth Pact are vital for the success of Economic and Monetary Union. I believe I am on common ground in stating that from a theoretical perspective, the impact of fiscal policy on the economy is rather uncertain. Empirical evidence generally points to a positive but low impact of an expansionary policy on output. Therefore, the power of fiscal policy to reduce cyclical volatility or to stimulate the economy should not be overestimated.  Discretionary fiscal measures have proved to be ill-suited for fine-tuning the economy in the past. Due to time-lags it has often lead to a pro-cyclical impact on the economy. Moreover, asymmetric behaviour in recessions and booms has contributed to deteriorating public finances in the last decades.  Instead, structural reforms directed at improving price and wage flexibility and the mobility of labour could strengthen other channels of stabilisation.  To sum up, by ensuring sound fiscal positions and emphasising the role of automatic fiscal stabilisers in dampening cyclical fluctuations, the EC-Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact form an adequate framework for fiscal policy in monetary union. The pact is not a curse but a blessing. And on a personal note, I would like to add that the very constituting principle of all democracies is the rule of law. It means that government in all its actions is bound by rules fixed and announced beforehand. The rule of law lays down the primacy of law over policy. Governments which do not uphold this principle offend against the fundamentals of modern societies and risk a substantial loss of confidence. This holds true for Argentina(cid:146)s arrears to the IMF and for attempts of EU-Countries to not comply with the spirit and letter of the EC-Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact.  The latter is especially disturbing, because the rule of law in modern societies seems to be a French invention. It is based on the principle of separation of powers which was formulated as early as 1748 by the great French political philosopher, Montesquieu. Moreover, it was the French people who first realised this concept in continental Europe. A government breaching the law leads down the slippery slope from which escape is extremely difficult to find. I would also like to draw your attention to a paper Hermann Remsperger and I have written on the importance of budgetary rules and on the criticism of the Stability and Growth Pact. Up to now there is only a German version but the English translation is already in preparation and will be available in a few days on our website.  My experience tells me that central bankers and academics alike are willing to listen and to learn. The ability and willingness to comprehend is decisive for the success of this conference.  My most important task today is to award the CEPR/ESI prize for the best central bank research paper. Of the numerous papers submitted, Gert Peersman(cid:146)s paper entitled (cid:147)What caused the early millennium slowdown? Evidence based on vector autoregressions(cid:148) was deemed to be the best. The paper attempts to answer this difficult question by academic means. At the same time, the paper demonstrates to what extent our answers are determined by the respective method of analysis used. Mr Peersman, I congratulate you on receiving this award. 
 BIS Review 40/2003 1 Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Emerging trends in Asia and their implications for Malaysia Keynote address by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the The Asian Banker Summit 2003, (cid:147)Post-Asian Financial Crisis: Securing Financial Stability(cid:148), Kuala Lumpur, 16 September 2003. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen  As we advance into the 21st Century, sustainable performance demands resilience to the economic cycle, resilience to unstable market conditions and overall resilience in an environment of rapid change. To prosper in this new environment, we need to have the capacity to withstand the entire business cycle, to survive the increased volatility in the financial markets and to have the capacity and agility to adjust to the changes taking place. Sustainable performance is key in achieving long-term relevance and success. To achieve this, it is important to look beyond the short-term perspective and build the capacity and the resilience to meet the new challenges that are emerging in this new environment.  It is my honour and pleasure to be invited to this Asian Banker(cid:146)s Summit 2003. Let me join the organisers in welcoming you to Kuala Lumpur. It was exactly five years since the countries in East Asia have emerged from the financial crisis, when stability in the financial markets was restored and the economic recovery resumed. Asia has now emerged as the fastest growing region. Despite a more difficult external environment, the Asian region has demonstrated resilience. The new trends emerging in Asia point to significant transformation taking place in the economies in Asia. These trends have contributed toward increasing the growth prospects for the region.  Today, my remarks will focus on these fundamental trends that have emerged in Asia and the promise that they hold for the prospects for this region. I would also like to take this opportunity to share with you the implications of these trends for Malaysia and the strategies and responses that we have adopted in addressing the challenges that we are faced with in this more difficult environment.  Emerging trends in Asia: Economic transformation in Asia Asia(cid:146)s resilience can be traced to several important trends which have contributed to the economic and financial transformation of the region. The dynamic transformations taking place in our region are significant and varied. The region accounts for more than half the world(cid:146)s population and 23% of the world economy. The growth for the region as a whole is forecast to be one and half times higher than the global average.  Of significance, is the trend towards greater integration in the region on several fronts. Intra-regional trade in Asia has increased significantly in recent years. Intra-regional exports account for about one third of total exports of the region. Intra-regional trade within ASEAN has increased significantly to account for about 24% of the region(cid:146)s total trade, exceeding ASEAN(cid:146)s trade with the United States. Trade with China, India and Korea has increased dramatically. Since 1993, China(cid:146)s role in the region has reversed from that of a net exporter to a net importer. The share of East Asian exports to China has doubled in the recent decade.  Previously, the high economic performance in Asia was driven by the export orientation and investment driven growth. In the recent decade, greater focus has been accorded to domestic sources of growth. Increased emphasis has been accorded to promoting the role of consumption demand in the growth process. Traditionally, the countries in the region have high savings, relative to other regions. ASEAN(cid:146)s saving rate of 35% is nearly double that of NAFTA and one and a half times higher than the EU(cid:146)s. There, therefore, remains significant potential for high rates of consumption without resulting in risks to our system. The increased consumption demand has been a factor that has reinforced the trend toward greater intra-regional trade in Asia.  There has also been a trend towards greater intra-Asian investment flows in the region. This includes increased reinvestment of the surplus funds back into the region, both in the form of foreign direct investment and portfolio capital flows. The recent establishment of the Asian Bond Fund is a step in this direction. Initiatives are in progress to promote the development of regional capital markets. The 
 2 BIS Review 40/2003 initiative to develop an Asian Bond Market will contribute towards recycling part of the high savings to finance productive activity within the region.  While the Asian regional economies have common threads that prevail across the region, the economies are generally diverse in their economic activities. While there are areas of competition, there are trends towards increasing specialisation and complementarities. These structural shifts arose from new technologies, new demand patterns and new production organisation structures. In essence, there is a movement from bilateral inter-regional trade flows to a more fully developed intra-regional division of labour incorporating all phases of production and markets. This has led to greater optimising of the comparative advantage of the region.  Finally, there has been an intensification of regional co-operation in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. There has been a high level of financial co-operation among the Asian economies. Co-operation has been in the area of enhanced regional surveillance, standardisation of systems and documentation, regional capacity building programmes and regional swap facilities. This strengthened co-operation enhances the foundations for realising the potential that the region possesses.  Ladies and gentlemen,  In a world where uncertainty has become a permanent feature of the environment, the challenge before us is to be able to increase our tolerance level to the shocks and changes that may occur. Building tolerance levels involves enhancing our capacity, strength and resilience to cope with the changed environment. Precautionary measures can be taken to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities. Despite uncertainties and unstable conditions, initiatives can be taken to achieve sustainable performance.  In the current environment, the pressure is for greater market orientation and liberalisation on the premise that competition would lead to pricing that would facilitate a more efficient allocation of resources. This, however, is not the only objective that is to be achieved. Consideration needs to be given to the objective of promoting growth, financial stability and social stability. Some of these objectives are conflicting and need to be carefully balanced, taking into account the trade offs.  Increasing the tolerance level amidst a volatile environment The pursuit of efficiency and competition has to be balanced with the objective of attaining soundness and preserving stability. Given the unique characteristics and peculiarities of emerging economies, the transition to a more liberalised environment would demand appropriate sequencing of measures to be taken.  Factors commonly ascribed as key in achieving and safeguarding financial stability include sound macro-economic management, effective regulatory and supervisory framework, greater transparency and disclosure of information, increased market discipline, dynamic accounting and auditing standards as well as the existence of strong corporate governance. For emerging economies, the requirements extend beyond these factors to include other areas, namely the development of the necessary financial infrastructure that supports a strong foundation that is able to provide depth and breadth to the financial system and economy as a whole. Of equal importance, is the need to develop alternative sources of funding, such as the equity and bond markets, not simply to ensure a more balanced allocation of financial and economic resources within an economy but more importantly to attain greater diversification within the financial system, hence ensuring the efficient distribution of risks within the system. In addition, the integrity and credibility of the payments system and effectiveness of regulation and supervision would require the support of a comprehensive set of legislations, one that would need to evolve in tandem with the developments that are taking place in the financial landscape.  It is also recognised that good corporate governance reinforces sound regulation and supervision. It contributes towards maintaining market confidence, and strengthens transparency and accountability. For corporate governance to work, good corporate practices need to be instilled and embedded in all aspects of the operations and at all levels within the organisation. To succeed in the new environment, institutions will require qualified board members and management teams that exhibit a high degree of professionalism. In addition, transparency and disclosure is essential, particularly in a rapidly changing environment and greater attention is being accorded to make banking systems more transparent. While the comprehensive and timely availability of financial information will enhance market discipline in 
 BIS Review 40/2003 3 emerging market economies, the disclosure of information must be complemented with the ability of the market players to analyse, digest and appropriately interpret the information to achieve the desired results.  Closely related to this is the need to strengthen the framework for consumer protection to provide an avenue for redress in cases where consumers are placed in a disadvantaged or unfair position resulting from financial transactions taken due to lack of transparency and understanding. The move towards the adoption of the supervised market approach requires continuous efforts to enhance product disclosures and to elevate the level of financial literacy of consumers. Dealing with consumer awareness and education require considerable time and commitment.  While recognising the potential benefits of liberalisation to the domestic financial system, the need to ensure the proper sequencing, and to manage the liberalisation process must be accorded importance. Financial systems in emerging economies have and are expected to continue to play a significant role in the economy. As such, the process of international integration of the domestic financial system has to be paced with developments in the domestic system so as to ensure that the system is adequately prepared to cope with the challenges arising from the liberalisation process without destabilising effects on the domestic economy. The liberalisation process must be managed with respect to identifying the potential sources of risks to the system. Experience has shown that the timing for opening up of the financial system will need to be sequenced and guided by the objectives to develop a more diversified economy where the respective sub-sectors and segments of society have access to adequate financial services; and to ensure the enhanced and meaningful contribution by domestic financial institutions to the economic growth and transformation process through capacity building. In achieving these objectives, a key trade off is between the need to enhance institutional capacity and the need to phase in competitive forces through the appropriate sequencing of market liberalisation.  It is therefore, important that the liberalisation process is sequenced and managed effectively, according to the stages of development of the domestic financial system, the inherent risks and the strength of the social safety net as well as the tolerance level of the financial system. Successful implementation of this process, including evaluation of the trade-offs involved, will at the same time enable the emerging economies to achieve the overall national objectives.  It must be emphasised that the tolerance level for the system as a whole will only be as strong as the strength of its components. Having robust financial institutions that are able to withstand any potential shocks and that have the agility and adaptability to embrace the future challenges are key to ensuring long-term sustainability and survival in the competitive future as well as the maintenance of financial stability.  One of the most important aspects in enhancing the tolerance level involves building the capacity and institutional development.  Wide-ranging strategies have included consolidation, reengineering of business processes and reassessment of business models to fit the new financial landscape. Leveraging on advancements in information and communication technology is important to improve business automation and efficiency levels.  To achieve a higher level of operational efficiency, rationalisation of business networks and outsourcing are gaining greater significance. The journey is however never-ending, to adapt to the changing needs of the market, and at the same time, taking into account all the potential risks.  The need to enhance the capacity at the firm level is not limited to improving the way business is conducted and the level of efficiency in doing business. The financial institution, as a service provider, relies heavily on human intellectual capital which contributes to the innovativeness and competitiveness of the institution. Thus, human capital has been constantly sharpened through continuous development programmes and challenged to maximise its full potential. Towards this end, Bank Negara Malaysia has established the International Centre for Leadership in Finance to provide an avenue for the development of industry leaders especially in this region.  In the wake of the growth in the volume and complexity of financial transactions, and worldwide integration of financial markets, risk management has increasingly become a key concern. Sound risk management practices will minimise adverse consequences faced by financial institutions during periods of uncertainty. Effective risk management systems facilitate the measurement and management of risk exposures, thus minimising potential future losses. In addition, robust internal 
 4 BIS Review 40/2003 controls which are designed to provide qualitative standards are also necessary to complement the quantitative analysis of risk and provide a check and balance in the overall risk management practices.  The Malaysian experience Let me now take the opportunity to share with you Malaysia(cid:146)s experience in addressing some of these issues. The blue print for the development of the financial sector in Malaysia is outlined in Financial Sector Masterplan that was released about three years ago. The Masterplan is all about determining the future directions of the financial system and to define the financial structure that is most appropriate to our requirements as our economy moves to the next stage of development. It therefore provides the direction and common purpose for all the relevant parties in the financial sector, the industry, the market participants, the regulators, and the government. In emerging economies, the role of the government and the regulator is important in particular to prioritise policy goals, build the infrastructure, provide the legal and supervisory framework, and in addressing market failures. The key emphasis of the plan is to move toward a more diversified and balanced financial structure with a strengthened institutional framework, enhanced market infrastructure and practices, and an appropriate regulatory environment in line with the transformation that has taken place.  The Asian crisis highlighted the vulnerability associated with fragmented financial systems and the risk of excessive reliance on the banking sector. Strategies therefore focused on introducing reform measures to strengthen the banking sector and develop and enhance alternative sources of financing. The objective is to develop an intermediation structure that will facilitate an economic transformation toward a more diversified economy, namely:  (cid:1)(cid:2)Develop the domestic bond market;  (cid:1)(cid:2)Develop venture capital industry to support new growth areas such as the ICT and bio-technology sectors;  (cid:1)(cid:2)Enhance the framework for financing the small and medium-sized enterprises or SMEs;  (cid:1)(cid:2)Develop micro finance services especially micro credit for micro enterprises; and  (cid:1)(cid:2)Strengthen the development financial institutions to ensure more effective use of public sector resources in achieving socio-economic objectives and greater complementaries with the banking sector.  Following the successful financial restructuring and consolidation of the banking sector, efforts have shifted to building the domestic financial infrastructure. The industry-wide consolidation exercise for the domestic banking institutions after the crisis saw the 71 banking institutions pre-crisis being consolidated into 10 domestic banking groups. The consolidation exercise was a major structural enhancement of the financial system. Banking institutions have now attained a minimum capital size that is able to benefit from economies of scale and undertake the necessary investment in technology important to the industry.  A major transformation of the structure of financial intermediation can be seen in terms of the deepening and broadening of the private debt securities market. Efforts were directed to promote a robust domestic bond market to provide a competitive source of long-term debt funding and viable investment alternatives for investors. The trading and information infrastructure was enhanced with the introduction of the Fully Automated System for Tendering, Bond Information and Dissemination System and real-time gross settlement system. The regular issuance of MGS with various maturities along the active benchmark yield curve has facilitated the evolution of a benchmark yield curve. The introduction of new instruments such as asset-backed securities and MGS futures were facilitated, and liquidity in the market was improved by enlarging the size of MGS issues and widening the institutional investor base. The introduction of the Principal Dealer (PD) system promoted an active market-making mechanism for both Government and selected securities in the bond market.  In terms of magnitude, the bond market (including both public and private sector bonds), tripled in size from 44.7% of GDP in 1996 to 80.6% of GDP as at end-June 2003. The private debt securities market accounted for 54% of bonds outstanding and 43.6% of GDP as at end-June 2003 compared to 13.5% of GDP in 1996. Funds raised by the private sector through the bond market increased to 16% of the total private sector debt financing (as at end-June 2003) from 9.3% in 1996.  
 BIS Review 40/2003 5 Another development in our financial landscape is the growing significance of Islamic banking and finance in the financial system. Islamic banking has strongly emerged as an efficient and effective financial intermediation channel, forming an integral part of the overall Malaysian financial system. Today, we have developed a comprehensive Islamic financial system covering banking, Islamic insurance, the money market and capital market, that operates in parallel with the conventional system. Islamic banking now accounts for 10 percent of the market share of the total banking system.  There has been a rapid expansion in the development of Islamic financial instruments. At the global front, Malaysia was the first country to issue a sovereign Islamic financial instrument launched in the international financial markets. The capacity of the Islamic banking institutions to arrange and offer products with attractive features and competitive pricing, which are comparable to the conventional products has been enhanced. While Islamic finance was first introduced to meet the needs of the Muslim community, today, the Islamic financial products and services have wide appeal to both Muslim and non-Muslim customers.  The Malaysian Islamic banking institutions operate under a robust regulatory and supervisory framework at par with the conventional banking institutions to ensure the soundness and stability of the system. At the international level, the establishment of the Islamic Financial Services Board will further harmonise the international prudential and regulatory standards for the Islamic financial institutions on a global basis.  The development of the venture capital industry, a better framework for SME financing and the provision of micro financing continue to be important priorities to ensure that credit is made available to all segments of the economy, as well as to support the growth of new areas and industries. Increased focus on developing these financing modes has been supported with higher public sector budget allocations for the venture capital industry and for specific development financial institutions to channel micro-credit to small micro-enterprises.  Priority has also been accorded to investment in information and communications technology by the banking sector. With the completion of the consolidation exercise, domestic banking institutions have actively embarked on upgrading their systems, including in product delivery, risk management and information systems. The adoption of technology in the Malaysian banking system has predominantly been to automate business processes. However, more recently technology has been used as a tool to assess and drive business performance. With competition in the market becoming increasingly intense, the ability to understand the drivers of performance and the ability to make prompt response is vital to remain competitive.  Business delivery channels and business processes have also been reviewed to enhance efficiency levels and service quality to the customers. Many have formed strategic alliances with partners to enrich their value proposition to their customers through cross-selling of products and services. Indeed, the Malaysian banking industry has now become more consumer-centric. Several banking institutions have embarked on customer relationship management systems to better understand the needs of their customers in order to provide better levels of service and to gain a better understanding of their drivers of profitability.  In the area of corporate governance, the hybrid approach adopted by Malaysia includes legal reform, self-regulation as well as measures to encourage market-based regulation. New measures were introduced to further improve the level of governance among banking institutions. This includes limiting the number of directorships of chief executive officers, reviewing the responsibility and accountability of the board and management as well as requiring for the setting up of various board committees.  Emphasis on improved corporate governance goes hand in hand with the call for improvements in risk management standards. Arising from the experience during the Asian financial crisis, greater emphasis has been placed on enhancing the credit skills and to create a more robust credit culture. An accreditation process was introduced, aimed at better equipping credit officers with the required skills. Efforts are also on-going to prepare the industry for an enhanced risk management regime under Basel II and to continuously provide the relevant input towards the development of the framework, particularly from the perspective of emerging market economies.  A comprehensive 10-year consumer education programme was also introduced early this year. This is to raise consumer awareness and understanding on banking products and services and to educate the public on their rights and responsibilities in their relationship with a financial institution. The transparency and disclosure standards on banking products and services are also currently being 
 6 BIS Review 40/2003 enhanced to equip consumers with the ability to make informed financial decisions. It is envisaged that consumers will play a bigger role in instilling market discipline amongst financial players.  A deliberate reform of our payment system has also been undertaken to ensure that the payment system is stable and efficient. In July 1999, Bank Negara Malaysia implemented a Real Time Gross Settlement System known as RENTAS for inter-bank funds transfer to reduce the credit and settlement risk in the financial system. The RENTAS system also handles scripless debt securities trading, processing and settlement system on a real time Delivery versus Payment model that reduces counterparty risk substantially. In addition, a range of retail payment systems has also been implemented to further increase payment system efficiency through electronic channels, which include the introduction of Inter-bank Giro, Internet banking, mobile banking and the electronic purse.  Cards have also rapidly become an important payment instrument in Malaysia. In maintaining public confidence in using payment cards, Malaysia has taken steps to combat credit and ATM card fraud. Malaysia is the first country in the Asia Pacific region that had mandated the migration of ATM cards to chip based cards and the second country after Taiwan to implement the migration to EMV chip based credit cards, targeted to be completed by end-December 2005. The recent enactment of the Payment Systems Act 2003 is also a testimony to the Bank(cid:146)s commitment for greater payment system oversight, and to provide legal certainty to the finality of payment instructions carried out through major payment systems.  Social responsibility of banking institutions Sustaining growth in emerging economies requires stability to be preserved in the macroeconomic environment, the financial system and markets as well as social environment. The responsibility of achieving social stability and development should no longer be the exclusive domain of the government. The focus on short-term returns should not be at the expense of long-term sustainability. It is increasingly being advocated that corporate social responsibility is an important part of the business environment. Corporate social responsibility refers to operating business in a manner will also contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and local community and society at large.  The banking institutions, being the main provider of financing in the economy, need to assume a much greater role in contributing towards the long-term development of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In developing the SME industry into strong and resilient enterprises, banking institutions need to reassess their relationships with the SMEs as financing alone will not guarantee the long-term success of the SMEs. The traditional relationship between creditor and debtor has to evolve into a business partnership whereby banking institutions are expected to play a more participative role in identifying gaps in processes, skills and expertise as well as usage of technology. Gains can be reaped as the SMEs grow in significance in the economy.  Positioning the central bank to meet the challenges ahead My presentation on institutional development and capacity enhancement would not be complete if it did not include the central bank. The new environment in which central banks are operating has also changed dramatically. Central banks are continually being confronted with the need to balance between conflicting objectives, and conflicting means to achieve the objectives. To stay at the forefront in dealing with the new challenges that we are faced with, our own efforts have also been focused on strengthening our capacities and capabilities. This includes measures to continually review our strategic orientation and key priorities and the necessary changes that need to be made so that we are positioned to effectively deal with new challenges and changes taking place.  Central banks in emerging market economies have a much broader mandate than our counterparts in the more advanced and mature economies. Of importance, is our developmental role in charting the development of the financial system, institutional development and the overall economic management. To achieve our strategic intent and build the infrastructure to support our strategies, investment in technology and the appropriate skills, and the transformation of our organisation into a knowledge-based organisation were among some of the major initiatives made.  
 BIS Review 40/2003 7 Conclusion To conclude, the East Asian region has, since the financial crisis, experienced pronounced economic and financial transformations. Our experience in Malaysia shows that a more diversified and sound financial sector, a more efficient and competitive financial industry and all the structural enhancements made, have evolved a more effective and resilient financial system. This has enhanced the tolerance level to withstand the more difficult and challenging environment.  Such fundamental changes, however, cannot be expected to be achieved within a short period of time. Enhancing the tolerance level in the financial sector of the East Asian economies is one of the important elements in strengthening the growth prospects for the region. The overall economic and financial transformation that has occurred has resulted in an Asia that is a mutually reinforcing region of growth; an Asia that has an increasing role in the creation of wealth; and an Asia that will be an important region in promoting and supporting global stability and global growth. 
BIS Review 40/2003 1 David Dodge: Fostering confidence Speech by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Vancouver Board of Trade, Vancouver, British Columbia, 10 September 2003. *      *      * Good afternoon. It(cid:146)s great to be back in Vancouver and to renew acquaintances at the Board of Trade. I(cid:146)m going to spend some time today discussing the Bank of Canada(cid:146)s outlook for the Canadian economy and inflation, and how we are responding. But in order to understand the current economic situation, we need to look at some of the extraordinary events of the past year or so and how those events have affected the economy. My last public speech here was almost exactly a year ago. You will recall that, at the time, markets were still in turmoil in the wake of Enron, WorldCom, and other corporate governance and accounting scandals of late 2001 and early 2002. In the United States and Canada - as well as in many other countries - corporations, regulators, and governments were beginning to respond with measures aimed at restoring and maintaining investor confidence.  Then came 2003 - which could well be named (cid:147)The Year of the Shocks.(cid:148) There was the war in Iraq, which is still being played out. The worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was a blow to Canada and to Asia. The human toll of SARS in Toronto was accompanied by a severe drop in Canada(cid:146)s tourism and travel industry. We also had an isolated case of mad-cow disease that blocked our exports of beef and cattle. Many of these export restrictions remain. And the forest fires in British Columbia have caused extensive financial and emotional pain. Meanwhile, the softwood lumber dispute with the United States has not been resolved. And recently, Ontario suffered through North America(cid:146)s biggest-ever power outage.  However, the good news is that Canadian consumers and businesses have been remarkably resilient through the past year or two in the face of all these shocks. But these kinds of shocks can have a significant impact on consumer and business confidence, especially when they happen in quick succession.  Today, I want to talk about the role that confidence plays in our economy and the measures that are being taken to strengthen it. Trust and confidence are essential if markets are to operate efficiently, so that businesses can finance themselves in good times and bad. And Canadians need to maintain confidence in the macroeconomic framework so that we can all reap the benefits of a smoothly functioning economy. The role of confidence in monetary policy At the Bank of Canada, we spend a lot of time thinking about confidence, because it is important to the conduct of monetary policy, which is focused on inflation targeting. We aim to keep the trend of inflation at the 2 per cent target midpoint of a 1 to 3 per cent range. When the trend strays away from that midpoint, either upwards or downwards, we take action to return it to 2 per cent over the medium term. We do that by adjusting our target for the overnight interest rate. Over the past decade or so, we have successfully kept inflation at around 2 per cent, on average. Here(cid:146)s where the confidence factor enters into the equation: Canadians now expect that inflation will stay near the target - not just for the near term, but into the future. They believe that the value of their earnings and savings won(cid:146)t be eroded by inflation and that the real burden of their debt won(cid:146)t be increased by deflation.  That confidence has paid a real dividend in terms of monetary policy effectiveness. Inflation targeting works best when Canadians believe that it will work - in other words, when they have confidence that we will keep inflation near the 2 per cent target.  With this confidence, inflation and inflation expectations, as well as interest rates, have become more stable - and this benefits the whole economy.  How did we achieve this confidence dividend? By establishing a track record of credible, consistent monetary policy, together with greater accountability and transparency. Like many other major central banks, we have embraced the notion that monetary policy is more effective when people can 
2 BIS Review 40/2003 understand what their central bank is doing and why. That is the motivation behind our semi-annual Monetary Policy Reports and Updates, our eight interest rate announcements every year, and our many public appearances and speeches.  Of course, monetary policy does not function in isolation. It works best when it is complemented by fiscal policies aimed at avoiding deficits and lightening government debt burdens. Reducing, and ultimately eliminating, the federal deficit in the 1990s helped Canada(cid:146)s international credibility, lowered the risk premium demanded by investors, and gave Canada more flexibility to adjust to changing economic circumstances. And continued fiscal prudence has given us the flexibility to weather the recent economic turmoil rather well.  Canadians have now seen the benefits of low, stable, and predictable inflation, and balanced budgets. And they expect that their central bank and their governments will continue to deliver those benefits through responsible monetary policy and prudent fiscal management.  Confidence in markets So, good monetary and fiscal policies deliver a confidence dividend. But, of course, trust and transparency are crucial factors all across the economy and the financial system. We all know that a business will not last long if it squanders the confidence of its customers, suppliers, and investors.  The corporate finance and accounting scandals of 2001 and 2002 hurt more than just profits and portfolio gains. They also sideswiped the confidence of financial market participants. The problems that brought down Enron, WorldCom, and others were not limited to those companies. In fact, the international task force appointed by the International Federation of Accountants - and chaired by John Crow, a former Bank of Canada Governor - correctly notes that Enron was the event which, by its sheer size, awoke many to issues that had been significant for some time.  What(cid:146)s encouraging is that this awakening has happened quickly and that considerable effort is being made to address those issues and reinforce trust in the financial system. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States, for example, is aimed at restoring trust in corporate financial reporting. Other international efforts are underway to improve both reporting and monitoring of public companies.  In Canada, federal and provincial governments have been working with the private sector to review and improve the framework governing public companies and capital markets. These initiatives are summarized in a document entitled Fostering Investor Confidence in Canadian Capital Markets, which can be found on the Department of Finance(cid:146)s Web site.  Efforts are focused on four areas:  (cid:1)(cid:2)improving financial reporting and disclosure; (cid:1)(cid:2)enhancing the quality of the audit process; (cid:1)(cid:2)strengthening corporate governance and management accountability; and  (cid:1)(cid:2)toughening enforcement. All of these efforts are aimed at building the confidence needed to allow markets to protect the interests of investors and creditors and to operate efficiently so that businesses can finance their operations at the lowest cost. Steps to foster confidence Let(cid:146)s look first at what(cid:146)s been done to date to improve financial reporting and disclosure. Our system, which has already worked quite well for Canadians, is being strengthened. The proposed new changes are aimed at building confidence while keeping compliance costs relatively low.  New guidelines on continuous disclosure obligations of public companies are being drafted by the Canadian Securities Administrators. The goal is to implement them by January 2004. There are also new guidelines from the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) on stock options, financial guarantees, and off-balance-sheet arrangements. And the Investment Dealers Association (IDA) has developed new rules to promote the independence of financial analysts. 
BIS Review 40/2003 3 To improve the quality of the audit process, a new Canadian Public Accountability Board will oversee the practices of firms that audit publicly listed companies. Its chairman is Gordon Thiessen, my predecessor as Governor of the Bank of Canada. And David Scott, a senior partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers, was recently appointed as CEO. The Board will inspect audit firms and will make recommendations on accounting and assurance standards, rules of conduct, and governance practices. Its efforts are being augmented by the new Auditing and Assurance Standards Oversight Council, which is designed to provide perspectives from outside the accounting profession on the oversight and setting of corporate audit standards. Critical initiatives to restore investor confidence are also being taken in the areas of corporate governance and management accountability. Most importantly, many companies have taken, or are taking, action on their own in this regard. Their efforts are being supported by the actions of provincial securities commissions. In January, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions released new guidelines on corporate governance for federally incorporated financial institutions. In last February(cid:146)s budget, the federal government announced a plan to strengthen the corporate governance standards in the Canada Business Corporations Act and the financial institutions statutes.  Institutional investors have also been pushing for better corporate governance practices and management accountability. They have established the Canadian Coalition for Good Governance, chaired by Michael Wilson, former Minister of Finance. The Coalition recently published new Corporate Governance Guidelines for Building High Performance Boards.  There has been a perception that the authorities have not been vigilant in enforcing the rules with respect to fraud and insider trading violations. Recent studies suggest that Canadian firms pay a penalty, in terms of their market valuations, as a result of this perception. That is why it is encouraging to see that steps have been taken to toughen enforcement. The B.C. government has draft legislation to increase fines, give more power to the provincial Securities Commission, and increase the rights of investors. Ontario and Quebec have passed legislation to increase penalties and to broaden the investigative powers of their securities commissions. New guidelines from the IDA include stiffer penalties for securities dealers that break IDA rules.  In last February(cid:146)s budget, the federal government announced stronger enforcement measures to combat fraud in capital markets. Amendments to the Criminal Code will make it easier to prosecute lawbreakers. More money will be dedicated to investigating serious cases of capital market fraud. And special teams of investigators, forensic accountants, and lawyers will be set up in key financial centres. These are just some examples of the progress that has been made in Canada by companies, regulators, and governments to build investor confidence in our financial markets. Of course, these efforts also promote better corporate decision-making, greater efficiency, and stronger corporations. That is why it(cid:146)s in the interest of all of us that we make further progress.  What should we bear in mind as we continue to make these improvements? First, we must not be lulled into thinking that all the problems are behind us. Unless we remain vigilant and rigorous in our efforts, we risk squandering the good work done so far.  Second, while we must apply the same principles to all companies, they must be applied in ways that do not impose undue compliance costs, especially on smaller businesses.  Third, while our standards don(cid:146)t have to be identical to those in other countries, they must be seen to be as effective. Canadian and U.S. capital markets are already highly integrated and Canadians (and Americans) have benefited greatly from these open, transparent, and competitive markets.  Indeed, since world markets are increasingly integrated, there is a great benefit to having standards that are globally consistent. Right now, there appears to be willingness on the part of authorities in a number of countries to find a reasonable mix of principles and rules for accounting standards and securities regulation that could be applied globally. The International Accounting Standards Board and the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board are cooperating in such an undertaking, with the support of other countries, including Canada. It is important that Canada continue to work towards sensible global standards. We must identify how our practices should change to fit those standards in order to help our capital markets stay competitive in an increasingly global environment. Markets work more efficiently when they all operate under clear, transparent, and reasonable rules and principles - both internationally, and also within Canada. That is why we at the Bank of Canada encourage efforts to achieve uniform securities law, regulation, and enforcement across this country.  
4 BIS Review 40/2003 Finally, as we set new rules to promote confidence, we must be careful to avoid creating a regime that stifles financial market innovation. We need to create a framework that balances the necessity for effective and enforceable rules to promote confidence with the need to facilitate new and innovative methods of corporate financing to improve the allocation of capital. This type of framework is the best support we can provide for the efficient operation and continued growth of our financial markets. But it won(cid:146)t do the whole job. A sound legal and regulatory framework must be combined with strong and widespread ethical standards. CEOs and other corporate officers must take it upon themselves to communicate with investors clearly, openly, and fairly. Investors, for their part, have a responsibility to take into account all available information. And regulators, politicians, and public servants must all perform their functions in a way that reinforces trust. We all benefit when everyone plays by the rules. Only by reaffirming the integrity of individuals, corporations, and public institutions can we restore and maintain the confidence dividend. Indeed, as I said at the outset, the resiliency of Canadian consumers, investors, and businesses has helped us weather recent economic shocks. Confidence will be critical to strengthening our economy in the months ahead and to a sustained expansion over the medium term. So let me now briefly discuss the Bank(cid:146)s views on the economy and inflation.  The current economic situation Since our Monetary Policy Report Update in July, inflation pressures in Canada have continued to ease. Part of the recent decline in inflation has come from an increase in the amount of slack in the economy. The pace of growth in the second quarter of this year was interrupted by a number of near-term factors, especially SARS and trade restrictions on Canadian exports of cattle and beef because of an isolated case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Growth in the third quarter will also likely remain below the economy(cid:146)s potential because of the remaining trade restrictions on beef and cattle, as well as the effects of the power blackout in Ontario and of forest fires in Western Canada.  The prices of some services have been temporarily depressed by SARS. In addition, there has been a greater-than-anticipated reduction in the prices of a number of goods, such as motor vehicles, clothing, and household furniture and appliances. We had expected our core rate of inflation - which strips out the eight most volatile components of the consumer price index, as well as the effect of changes in indirect taxes on the remaining components - to decline below the 2 per cent target. In fact, that happened earlier than the Bank had anticipated. Our core inflation measure is likely to decline somewhat further in the next few months. And we see the trend of inflation remaining below the 2 per cent target for some time.  As I(cid:146)ve said, part of this lower trend in inflation is a result of the slack in the economy that has opened up in 2003. In addition, prices of many traded goods have fallen worldwide because of excess supply. The rise in the Canadian dollar earlier this year pulled down the price of imported goods, and some retailers have passed on these savings to consumers. As well, vendors are lowering prices to clear their inventory, especially in the automobile sector. Price pressures that we saw from higher insurance premiums earlier this year appear to be dissipating as the year progresses.  The total CPI inflation rate has come down from 4.6 per cent in February to 2.2 per cent recently, because of the decline in core inflation and because of smaller increases in energy prices. Swings in energy prices remain a risk to our total inflation outlook in the months ahead, although we assume oil prices of about US$27 per barrel in 2004.  Notwithstanding the temporary factors that have affected the economy in the second and third quarters of this year, we see indications that the conditions are in place for stronger economic growth. Here(cid:146)s why. Growth of final domestic demand has remained robust, and the adverse effects of the shocks that I just mentioned are beginning to dissipate. The economic rebound in the United States began earlier, and will be stronger, than previously expected. More robust consumer demand and strengthening business investment in the United States should augur well for Canadian exports. We are also seeing a strengthening trend in Asia. As well, the tone of capital markets remains favourable.  So, despite current weakness, the accumulation of economic evidence to date reinforces the Bank(cid:146)s view that growth in the Canadian economy will strengthen towards the end of 2003 and through 2004.  Last week, we lowered our target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point, to 2 3/4 per cent. With this decision, policy interest rates will support the return to levels of economic 
BIS Review 40/2003 5 activity that are consistent with an overall balance between supply and demand in the economy. Achieving that balance will work to return inflation to the target over the medium term.  Conclusion Canadians have been through a lot this year. But each shock also represented an opportunity - to learn, to improve our ability to handle a crisis, and to strengthen our sense of community.  No one can predict what kind of shocks our economy will face in the future, but we know that shocks will occur. What(cid:146)s important is that we have a robust economic and financial framework that allows us to deal with those disturbances and to seize opportunities as they arise. It is that strong framework that gives businesses and investors the confidence to take risks and to innovate.  We are making progress in building the framework that supports the confidence dividend. During the 1990s, we improved our fiscal and monetary policies. Now, as I have described, we(cid:146)re working to make our financial systems more robust and efficient.  These continuing efforts promote confidence. They improve our ability to withstand all types of economic shocks and to capitalize on opportunities.  
 BIS Review 39/2003 1 R Basant Roi: Review of the financial sector in Mauritius Address by Mr R Basant Roi, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the seminar on Financial Sector Assessment Programme, Pointe aux Piments, 8 September 2003. *      *      * Hon. Minister of Economic Development, Financial Services and Corporate Affairs Mrs Ann Rennie, Deputy Mission Chief Ladies and Gentlemen Good morning I am pleased to be here in your midst, this morning, for the opening of this Seminar on the Financial Sector Assessment Programme. Over three years ago, on May 26, 2000 the Financial Stability Forum had issued a Press Release in which it categorised Mauritius in the third and last group of countries regarding their perceived degree of supervision and co-operation. The categorisation was carried out on the basis of a survey, including questionnaires that were, according to the Press Release, forwarded to supervisors the world over. We were not even aware of this survey. Yet, Mauritius was categorised in the last group. Worse, Mauritius was never given a hearing before its categorisation in the last group. In spite of all the statements of good intention made in the Press Release, some damage had already been inflicted to the image of Mauritius as a financial services centre. Voices against this approach were raised at various international meetings of Governors of Central Banks.  Subsequently, the IMF was urged and, rightly so, by the Financial Stability Forum to take a lead role in the assessment of jurisdictions(cid:146) adherence to international standards. The IMF held a Consultative meeting to hear the views of outside experts from onshore and offshore centres and international agencies. This initiative was formally and fully backed by Mauritius.  The World Bank joined in with the IMF. The assessment of Mauritius by the joint IMF/World Bank Mission has been fair and just. The FSAP Mission has given the authorities of Mauritius a fair hearing. The assessment has been thorough and has been carried out in a manner that should help all of us here to further strengthen the soundness and safety of our financial sector. A careful reading of all the recommendations made in the Report does allow us to spotlight certain areas that are really vulnerable to risks. With a financial system like ours that is fully integrated with the world(cid:146)s financial system we cannot afford to take lightly the vulnerabilities highlighted therein. Despite certain disagreements that we have had with the FSAP mission(cid:146)s views, I must say that the quality of the recommendations is very much appreciated. I seize this opportunity to commend the FSAP Team, in particular Mr Abdessatar Ouanes and Mrs Ann Rennie, for having given a well-balanced assessment of our financial sector. The Report does not merely refer to the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of our financial sector. It does also underline the strength of our financial sector and the progress that has been made in recent years with regard to our supervisory framework. I am particularly pleased to note, among the findings of the FSAP Mission, the following: 1. Overall, the Mauritian financial sector is currently in good health, and the short-term stability risks are modest.  2. Mauritius has a relatively large and well-developed domestic financial system and a growing offshore sector. 3. The authorities have embarked on an ambitious program to transform the economy, and the Government, in partnership with the private sector, is taking decisive measures to build a knowledge economy based on higher value-added services, notably in information and communication technologies. 4. The assessment of Standards and Codes found a high level of compliance with internationally accepted norms and best practices. 
 2 BIS Review 39/2003 5. Mauritius(cid:146) strong economic performance has spurred the development of a large, profitable and sound banking sector. 6. The banking system of Mauritius is profitable, well capitalised and generally sound. 7. The quality of banking supervision in Mauritius has improved significantly over the past few years and is of a generally higher standard than in most African countries. 8. The Bank of Mauritius Guidelines on Corporate Governance, Internal Control and credit are all of a commendable standard reflecting international best practices and the capacity of the Bank of Mauritius to enforce the Guidelines has improved with the development of knowledge and skills within the Supervision Department. We expect that, on the basis of the FSAP Report, the Financial Stability Forum will issue another press release announcing the removal of Mauritius from the third category.  Our commitment to proceed with the various recommendations is already evidenced by the actions that have already been taken by the authorities in Mauritius. We are thankful to the IMF and the World Bank for the prompt response given to our request for Technical Assistance to beef up our supervisory and legal framework. A few laws have, under the whip of the Honourable Minister for Financial Services, been enacted: the Anti-Money Laundering (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act to further strengthen our institutional and regulatory framework with respect to money laundering; the Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act which lays the basis for Mauritius to ratify the Convention. Regulations under the Financial Intelligence and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2002 have been promulgated. Another law on Mutual Assistance in Criminal and Related Matters has also been enacted. Guidance Notes on Anti-Money Laundering and combating the Financing of Terrorism have been updated and aligned with international standards as acknowledged by the FSAP Mission. The ambiguity as to whether the Bank of Mauritius is empowered to issue such Guidance Notes has been dealt with in the Anti-Money Laundering (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. Furthermore, a few additional guidelines are being worked upon. A draft Guideline on Credit policy has already been finalised and is due to be issued to the industry shortly.  In February 2002, at the Quarterly meeting of the Banking Committee, I proposed to Chief Executive Officers of banks, the establishment of a Credit Information Bureau in Mauritius. Bankers enthusiastically welcomed the project. A Sub-Committee, comprising senior officials of all commercial banks and headed by the Manager Legal of the Bank of Mauritius was appointed to make recommendations on the way forward. The Sub-Committee submitted their report in August 2002. I am happy to note that the FSAP mission is supportive of this initiative. The National Bank of Belgium houses one of the most sophisticated Credit Information Bureau in the world. I accordingly solicited the assistance of the Governor of the National Bank of Belgium to guide us on this project. A delegation headed by the Managing Director of the Bank of Mauritius, comprising bankers, will proceed to the National Bank of Belgium for a prospecting visit in November this year.  In all the assessments that have been made so far a common thread is perceptible. The strong willingness of the authorities in Mauritius to co-operate and to promote the country as a sound and clean jurisdiction runs through the assessments. Even before the Financial Sector Assessment Programme started we, at the Bank of Mauritius, had already identified certain areas of vulnerability of our banking industry. We did initiate several remedial actions and I am particularly pleased to note that the FSAP Report does make mentions of the various initiatives. The FSAP Report is a critical assessment of where we stand today. The recommendations are expressions of views regarding what need to be done now and in the immediate future. But we need to constantly review our supervisory and legal framework in the light of changes taking place in the domestic economy and in the dynamic international financial system as well.  We have a panoply of rules, guidelines and laws for the proper conduct of banking business in Mauritius. As regulators and supervisors we need to exercise discretion failing which the very purpose of the rules, guidelines and laws could be defeated. Let me share with you a brief paragraph from Sammuel Brittan(cid:146)s Economics and Ethics: (cid:147)Most real-world situations are more complicated that the simple prisoner(cid:146)s dilemma, and the possibility of choosing an inappropriate strategy is a real one. 
 BIS Review 39/2003 3 This possibility arises because the way in which strategies are normally determined is via the application of widely accepted rules - whether these are obviously moral, such as (cid:145)do not kill(cid:146); conventional, such as (cid:145)drive on the left(cid:146); or habitual, such as (cid:145)do not scatter litter(cid:146). But many widely supported moral practices and rules are double-edged. Frank cites a hypothetical Jones who sacrifices a day(cid:146)s earnings of $300 to prosecute Smith for stealing a $200 briefcase. The motive here can only be described as vengeance. Frank is inclined to regard Jones as a social benefactor because his action discourages theft. May be. But encouraging vengeance as a general practice is playing with fire.(cid:148) Regulators and supervisors or any other authorities should make productive use of the rules, guidelines and laws in the best interest of our financial sector. Misuse of the rules, guidelines and laws by anyone of us could only jeopardize the achievement the authorities(cid:146) objectives. The goal should be the promotion of the growth of our financial market without excessive constraint.  Let me wish all the participants in the Seminar a pleasant working day. Thank you. 
BIS Review 39/2003 1 Ben S Bernanke: The economic outlook Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Bloomberg Panel for the Outlook on the U.S. Economy, New York, 4 September 2003. The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System(cid:146)s website. *      *      * I am pleased to have this opportunity to participate in the Bloomberg Panel on the Outlook for the U.S. Economy. When I was a boy in South Carolina, my parents always advised me never to discuss religion or politics in public, those being subjects on which everyone has a strong opinion but on which no one can ever be proved wrong. I have always followed their advice on those particular topics, but I am afraid that economic forecasting may be just about as bad on both counts. Everyone has strong views on where the economy is heading, but when the time finally comes to compare your forecast with the data, the world has changed in eleven unpredictable ways that no one can blame you for failing to foresee - that is, if they remember what you forecast in the first place.  Unfortunately, as helping to make monetary policy is part of my current job, I cannot avoid forming some opinions about the outlook for the U.S. and world economies. Today I will give you a few of my impressions about what seems likely to unfold in the next year to eighteen months, as well as what I see as the most important risks to that forecast. I will talk first about output growth and unemployment, and then about inflation, and I will conclude by discussing some implications for monetary policy. Both my prepared remarks and the comments I may make in the discussion later should be clearly understood as reflecting only my own views and not those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  The forecast through 2004: Growth and unemployment To provide some context for this talk, I consulted the prognostications (in August releases) of some prominent private - sector forecasters and surveys of forecasters, namely Global Insight (formerly DRI-WEFA), the Blue Chip Survey, Macroeconomic Advisers, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters (see table 1). As you will see, I agree with several aspects of these well-regarded forecasts but (perhaps at my peril) disagree with, or at least have reservations about, some others.  Beginning with the real side of the economy, we see in table 1 substantial agreement among the private-sector forecasters about the prospects for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate through the end of 2004. All the forecasters expect output growth during the second half of this year to be strong, in the general range of 3.7 to 4.2 percent. Despite the projections of high growth rates, the private forecasters expect the unemployment rate to remain at about the current rate of 6.2 percent through the end of this year. The private-sector forecasters also see strong economic growth continuing, although generally not accelerating, in 2004. Measuring growth as 2004:Q4 over 2003:Q4, Global Insight forecasts 4.1 percent growth for real GDP in 2004, Blue Chip calls for 3.7 percent growth, Macroeconomic Advisers sees 4.0 percent growth, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters looks for 3.8 percent growth. Notably, according to the professionals, even this performance is not expected to decrease the unemployment rate by very much. Only Macroeconomic Advisers sees unemployment in the fourth quarter of 2004 falling as low as 5.4 percent; the rest foresee the unemployment rate remaining at 5.8 or 5.9 percent during the last quarter of next year.  These projections for the paths of growth and unemployment are broadly consistent with forecasts made by the members of the FOMC prior to our June 24-25 meeting and released shortly thereafter as part of the Federal Reserve’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. The FOMC members’ forecasts for real GDP for 2003 were for growth over the entire year; they were not broken down by quarter. However, given information about the first half available at the time the Committee’s forecasts were made, the central-tendency FOMC forecast for real GDP growth for the year as a whole almost certainly implies a noticeable pickup in the pace of expansion in the second half of 2003. For 2004, the central-tendency FOMC projection for real GDP growth as of the end of June covered the range of 3-3/4 percent to 4-3/4 percent, a forecast more optimistic than even current private-sector forecasts of growth for next year and suggestive of an acceleration in real activity from the second half of 2003 to 2004.  
2 BIS Review 39/2003 The central tendency of FOMC forecasts for the unemployment rate, as of the end of this past June, called for the rate to fall to between 6 and 6-1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and to decline to between 5-1/2 and 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004. Again, these values are broadly consistent with the more recent private-sector forecasts. In particular, the private-sector forecasters and FOMC members evidently agree that strong GDP growth will only gradually erode the accumulated slack in the job market. Simple arithmetic tells us that all the forecasters are expecting much of the projected increase in output to be met by ongoing increases in labor productivity, rather than by substantial new hiring. This point is a crucial one, to which I will return later when discussing inflation projections.  I should tip my hand at this point and say that I personally find the real growth and unemployment forecasts just described to be broadly reasonable, though there are important risks. In particular, I have been of the view for quite a while that acceleration of growth to 4 percent or better in 2004 is plausible; and I agree also that the decline in the unemployment rate, though steady, is likely to be slow.  Why do I believe that there are grounds for optimism about economic growth, even as more caution is warranted regarding unemployment? The consumer plays a central role as always, and recent news on retail sales (including automobile sales) and housing starts and sales, among other data, suggests that household spending continues to hold up well, as it has throughout the past three years. Tax cuts, signs of stabilization in the job market, and rising stock prices are among the factors that should keep the consumer in the game as the recovery proceeds. What makes the situation today feel particularly encouraging, however, is that we may finally be seeing some signs of a revival in business investment. Because I see the strength and sustainability of that revival as the key to the forecast, I would like to discuss it in a bit more detail.  In a speech I gave to the Forecasters’ Club last April (Bernanke, 2003a), entitled (cid:147)Will Business Investment Bounce Back?,(cid:148) I pointed out that the recession that began in March 2001 is distinctive in being one of the few business-led-as opposed to household-led-recessions of the post-World War II period. In particular, a sharp decline in business investment spending that began in the second half of 2000 was the proximate cause of the recession. By the same token, I argued in my earlier speech - making a point that many others have made as well - that a balanced recovery would be impossible without a sustained revival in capital expenditures. My earlier speech surveyed the prospects for various types of investment spending but emphasized the importance for the strength of the investment recovery of CEOs’ views on prospective returns to capital expenditure and the future of the economy - their animal spirits, if you will.  With a little more than four additional months’ worth of data, what can we say today about the recovery of investment spending? As I noted in April, the best prospects for an investment rebound in the corporate sector lie in the equipment and software sector, particularly in high-tech equipment. Over the summer we have seen indications of at least a moderate pickup in this sector. Notably, according to the preliminary GDP estimates, real investment in equipment and software rose at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second quarter. Real expenditures for high-tech equipment advanced 34 percent (at an annual rate) in the second quarter, a significant step up from the first quarter, and real spending on software rose at a 9 percent rate. Perhaps managers have finally decided that they can’t put off that IT upgrade any longer. Even spending on communications equipment was strong in the second quarter. Investment in non-high-tech equipment, including both transportation and general machinery, has also improved. In recent months, indicators such as orders data and indexes based on surveys of managers’ plans for capital expenditures have strengthened, on balance, suggesting that investment in equipment and software is likely to continue to rise in the near term.  By contrast, as I noted in my earlier speech and others have observed, investment in nonresidential structures is not a promising source of growth. The strength in this category in the second quarter was due importantly to an increase in spending in the drilling and mining sector, tied primarily to high natural gas prices. The outlook for buildings, particularly office and industrial buildings, remains weak, as high vacancy rates and low utilization rates persist. However, for better or worse, investment in nonresidential structures has become such a small part of aggregate spending on average that recovery in this sector is not a make-or-break factor for the overall economy.  Looking beyond the very near term, I see some grounds for optimism that the revival in business investment will persist, laying the foundation for continuing rapid expansion in 2004. First, the strong growth in demand already in train should provide incentives to corporate managers to expand productive capacity, particularly given the efforts that they have already made to reduce costs and 
BIS Review 39/2003 3 increase the efficiency of production within existing plants. In that regard, I think it is worth pointing out that firms have been meeting demand recently not only by getting greater productivity out of their existing capital and labor resources but also by running down inventory stocks relative to sales. If the past is a guide, we may soon see a quarter or two of inventory building that provides a powerful boost to the growth rate of output.  Second, financial conditions remain favorable to business investment. Profits are rising smartly, and corporations have considerably improved their balance sheets. Although corporate bond rates have risen in the past few months, they remain low by historical standards, and spreads have continued to come down. Banks are well capitalized, profitable, and eager to lend to business borrowers. In short, both internal funding and external finance for investment are available. Third, tax provisions passed in 2001 and 2003 lower the effective cost of investing in new equipment. Finally, as best as we can tell, expectations and attitudes in the business community - as reflected in surveys, information from business contacts, analysts’ expectations of long-term earnings growth, and the like - have brightened somewhat. When all these factors are taken together, it seems a reasonable bet that the revival in capital expenditures will continue and will strengthen sufficiently to support the optimistic growth forecasts that I discussed earlier.  As the prospective investment revival is central to the optimistic growth forecast, however, it is also the locus of the most critical risks to the forecast. For some time now, CEOs have displayed a greater reluctance to invest and hire than standard econometric models predict. Commentators have given this negative residual many names: the workout of post-bubble excesses, geopolitical uncertainty, the reaction to the accounting scandals of 2002, and self-fulfilling pessimism. Personally, I admit that I don’t fully understand the sources of this conservative behavior on the part of company management, and for that reason, I cannot be entirely confident that caution will not continue to predominate in the executive suite. A weaker investment trajectory reflecting continued CEO caution would probably not derail the current recovery, but it would certainly put the more-optimistic growth projections for 2004 out of reach and would substantially slow the absorption of unemployed resources.  I have not mentioned the trade sector. Net exports have been a drag on U.S. growth; indeed, in the second quarter, net exports deducted (in an arithmetic sense) a hefty 1-1/2 percentage points from U.S. real GDP growth. My sense is that the optimistic growth forecasts for the United States for the next year do not rely on anything more than a modest increase in growth in the rest of the world. Of course, to the extent that unanticipated strength abroad materializes and raises demand for U.S. exports, the outlook here will improve further.  Finally, a word on long-term interest rates, which as you know have been rising. At current levels, bond yields do not pose a major risk to continuing strength in housing or the recovery in corporate investment, in my view, though they may well end the boom in mortgage refinancing activity. Since those consumers who had the most to gain from refinancing have mostly already done so, a slowdown in refinancing is unlikely to have a significant effect on household spending.  The forecast through 2004: Inflation I turn now from the forecast for real activity to the outlook for inflation. As before, I will both compare the various published projections and talk about some risks to the forecast.  Inflation has been quite low, of course, and the private-sector forecasters expect inflation to remain low for the rest of this year and next. As table 1 shows, forecasts for CPI inflation for the second half of 2003 (the average of third- and fourth-quarter inflation forecasts, at an annual rate) by Global Insight, Blue Chip, Macroeconomic Advisers, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters are tightly clustered in a range of approximately 1-1/4 percent to 1-1/2 percent. (I will not comment here on forecasts for inflation as measured by the GDP price index, also shown in table 1, other than to say, as you can see for yourselves, that they are also quite low.) The same four sources report CPI inflation forecasts for 2004, fourth quarter over fourth quarter, of between 1-1/4 and 2 percent.  For monetary policy purposes, one is often interested in measures of underlying inflation. One such measure is so-called core CPI inflation, defined as the rate of change of the consumer price index excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be relatively volatile. I was able to find a core CPI inflation forecast only for Macroeconomic Advisers. Macroeconomic Advisers expects core CPI inflation for 2004 to be 1.5 percent, compared with an expectation of 1.3 percent for overall CPI inflation. If Macroeconomic Advisers is representative, then the distinction between core and overall CPI inflation is not of first-order importance for next year’s inflation forecast. As best as I can tell, the 
4 BIS Review 39/2003 same should be roughly true for inflation forecasts for the second half of 2003, though not for 2003 as a whole (the third column of the table) because of the sharp increases in energy prices in the first quarter of this year.  For comparison with the private-sector forecasts, the FOMC’s central-tendency forecast at the end of June was that inflation in 2004 will range between 1 and 1-1/2 percent, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) chain-type price index. Because of differences in the construction of this index and the CPI, an upward adjustment of 0.2 to 0.4 percentage point is probably necessary to make PCE inflation comparable to CPI inflation. Hence the FOMC central-tendency forecast for inflation for 2004 is also broadly consistent with the private-sector estimates.  One can try to assess the validity of these forecasts in two ways. For the short run, a couple of quarters, looking in some detail at the components of price indexes, to try to isolate trends and special factors, is useful. For the longer run, there is no substitute for thinking hard about the underlying economic factors influencing inflation.  Consideration of the details of the price indexes suggests that the rather marked deceleration we recently saw in core inflation measures has come to a halt for now, and indeed, that core inflation may tick up a few tenths during the remainder of 2003. The reasons are largely technical. Probably the most important factor, quantitatively speaking, has to do with the way that the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates owners’ equivalent rent (OER), an estimate of the cost of living in one’s own home. Data on market rental rates for homes and apartments are important inputs into the calculation of OER. Because rental leases often include landlord-provided utilities, the BLS subtracts estimates of the costs of utilities from market quotes of gross rents to obtain estimates of rents net of utilities. However, to the extent that, in the short run, landlords do not fully pass on changes in utility costs to renters, the BLS adjustment is an over-correction. In particular, in periods when energy prices and hence utility costs are rising, as in the first half of 2003, the BLS procedure may overstate the deceleration in rents net of utilities and hence in owners’ equivalent rent. As a result, on this particular count, the slowdown in CPI inflation may have been slightly overstated in the first half of 2003. If so, the stabilization in residential energy costs in the second half of 2003 should unwind this effect and likely add a bit to measured inflation going forward.  Another example of a special factor affecting measured inflation arises from the fiscal problems of state and local governments: To cover rising budget deficits, a number of public university systems have announced large tuition price hikes for the upcoming academic year. These tuition hikes will naturally affect the measured cost of living. As one-time events that are more fiscal than monetary in nature, however, I do not consider them particularly important from a monetary policy point of view. A similar effect was seen in the increase in the July CPI number, which was partly attributable to a rise in tobacco excise taxes imposed by a number of states. Other examples arise because of lags in data collection: For example, telephone rates are incorporated into the CPI only with some lag, so that rate increases that occurred earlier this year will not be reflected in the index for a few months yet. I alert you to some of these special cases only to illustrate why the Federal Reserve does not react to month-to-month changes in inflation data, or any other series for that matter.  For assessing the inflation forecast for the longer run, in this case the year 2004, one has to turn to the underlying economics. I do not disagree with the general tenor of the private-sector forecasts and the FOMC projections. It seems plausible that the combination of a strengthening recovery, well-anchored inflation expectations, and a monetary authority strongly committed to stabilizing inflation will serve to keep inflation in the projected range. However, in my view, the most likely outcomes are in the lower part of that range, and I believe that the risks remain to the downside. The reason is that ongoing productivity growth, together with stepped-up capital investment, may enable producers to meet expanding demand without substantially increased hiring in the near term, with the result that labor markets remain soft. Indeed, as I have noted, several of the private-sector forecasters project unemployment rates still near 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004, despite real growth approaching 4 percent for the second half of 2003 and all of 2004. By a standard textbook calculation (Bernanke, 2003b), this amount of slack should lead to additional disinflation of a few tenths of a percentage point or so by the end of 2004. So by my reckoning, inflation in 2004 might well be a bit lower than in the second half of 2003, not higher as the majority of private-sector forecasters have projected. Of course, if real growth were to disappoint - for example, because the investment rebound in 2004 was less strong than is hoped for and expected - the disinflationary pressures would be all the stronger.  Caveats abound, of course. As I have already noted, for various reasons including some special technical factors, core CPI inflation is likely to tick up during the remainder of 2003. It is always 
BIS Review 39/2003 5 possible that employment may rebound more quickly than we now expect. And, as history tells us, inflation forecasts only two to five quarters out have large standard errors, so that a wide range of inflation outcomes are possible for 2004. Nevertheless, for now it seems to me that, with inflation already low, disinflation risk will remain a concern for some time.  Implications for monetary policy Let me turn then to the implications for monetary policy. Given these forecasts, how should the Federal Reserve be expected to respond?  Since May 6, the Federal Open Market Committee has assessed the risks separately for the two main components of its mandate, economic growth and inflation. According to the statement that followed our August meeting, the FOMC views the risks to sustainable growth as being roughly balanced. However the risks to inflation, according to the statement, are tilted downward, with the probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation outweighing the probability of an increase in inflation. As I see it, the persistence of economic slack even as growth picks up makes it likely that inflation will remain low and in some scenarios may fall still further.  As the statement concluded, (cid:147)the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.(cid:148) How long is (cid:147)a considerable period(cid:148)? The right answer, I think, is that (cid:147)a considerable period(cid:148) is not a fixed stretch of time but depends on the evolution of the economy. In particular, in my view, the Federal Open Market Committee has little reason to undertake significant tightening so long as inflation remains low and promises to remain subdued, as it does today.  Let me elaborate. In the past, significantly tighter monetary policy often came shortly after the beginning of a cyclical pickup in economic growth. When Fed policymakers responded that way, they did so as the consequence of living in a regime in which inflation was already above the desired range, and the rapid acceleration of activity threatened to press against capacity and raise inflation still higher. Then the risk to satisfactory economic performance was that inflation would rise too high, and policy was forced to preempt that risk. Today inflation is at the lower end of the range consistent with optimum economic performance, and soft labor markets and excess capacity create a further downward risk to inflation. As a result, I believe that increased economic growth may not elicit the same response from the Fed that it has sometimes elicited in the past.  Besides the fact that inflation is currently at the low end of the desirable range, there is a second reason why the Fed may not respond as it has in the past to a pickup in economic growth. As you know, we have seen in the past few years a truly remarkable increase in labor productivity, sufficient to permit growth in output even as employment has fallen. Output growth arising from higher productivity is not typically accompanied by increased inflationary pressures. Indeed, I would argue that, in situations of considerable slack, growth that is generated solely by increased productivity, and that is unaccompanied by substantial employment growth, may possibly require monetary ease, rather than monetary tightening, in the short run.  I should emphasize that, though current circumstances should permit the Federal Reserve to accommodate a considerable period of above-trend growth, this does not in my view imply an increased tolerance for inflation. The FOMC has made clear in its new statement, as introduced after the May 6 meeting, that it has an acceptable range for inflation, consistent with its mandate for maintaining price stability. The current policy of ease results from concerns that inflation will fall below that acceptable range. But at some point in the future, disinflationary forces will abate, and the risks to inflation may turn upwards. At that point I expect that the FOMC will act forcefully to ensure that inflation remains low and stable.  Let me close by restating and summarizing the three main conclusions of these forecasts for monetary policy. First, a (cid:147)considerable period of time(cid:148) is not a fixed period of time but depends on the evolution of the economy. In my view, the Fed has no reason to undertake a significant tightening of policy so long as inflation is low and inflation pressures remain subdued. Second, productivity-led growth that does not raise the underlying rate of resource utilization does not increase inflationary pressures and thus, in my view, should not prompt a policy tightening. Finally, the Fed’s current policy of resisting a fall of inflation below its implicit zone for price stability does not, in my opinion, signal a new dovishness with respect to inflation in general. I expect the Fed to be just as tough in resisting unwanted upward movements in inflation as it currently is in resisting undesired declines.

 BIS Review 39/2003 1 Willem F Duisenberg: Changing fortunes - financing world growth Speech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the 2003 Spruce Meadows Round Table, Calgary, 5 September 2003. *      *      * It is a great pleasure for me to be part of this round table discussion today and I would like to thank the organisers for inviting me to share some thoughts with you on the topic of financing world growth. Since 2000, we have witnessed terrorism, war and declines in world equity markets, all of which contributed to increasing an already ongoing deterioration in confidence in most countries. Now with the end of the major hostilities in Iraq, the reduction in geopolitical uncertainties and lower oil prices, a gradual upturn in world economic activity is expected and it is important that policy-makers do all they can to support it. Given the breadth of this topic and therefore the strong temptation to overrun on my time allocation, I will focus on just two points. First, I would like to say a few general words about the roles and, may I add, limitations of monetary and fiscal policy in reviving global demand, and the importance of microeconomic policies in this respect, in particular the role of structural reform in increasing potential growth. Second, with the help of regional-specific examples, I would like to present some future challenges with respect to microeconomic policies and structural reforms in the world.  Monetary and fiscal policy, and structural reform The achievement and maintenance of strong growth implies a perspective that extends beyond shorter-term cyclical developments. Indeed, over the medium term, economic growth tends to be negatively affected by the considerable costs associated with inflation, and the prospect of stable prices is therefore a key factor of growth. By being strictly geared towards maintaining price stability in a credible and lasting manner, monetary policy makes an important contribution to achieving a high level of output and employment, and to sustaining growth. Confidence in lasting price stability removes the inflation risk premium on interest rates, ensuring low real interest rates, which in turn foster investment, growth and employment. Theoretical and empirical evidence clearly confirm that there is no long-term trade off between price stability and economic growth. Trying to use monetary policy to fine-tune economic activity or to gear it above a sustainable level will, in the long run, simply lead to rising inflation - not to faster economic growth.  Fiscal policy also plays a key role in contributing to macroeconomic stability. Stable, sustainable and efficient fiscal policies exert a favourable effect on long-term growth performance. They stimulate savings, capital formation, employment and innovation. And they facilitate the task of the monetary policy-maker in maintaining price stability. Sound public finances should rely on automatic stabilisers, rather than discretionary fine-tuning, to dampen the cyclical fluctuations of aggregate demand. Theory suggests that there are delays and risks associated with the latter - getting the timing wrong may result in pro-cyclical polices and make a monetary policy orientated towards price stability more difficult. In the medium term, fiscal policies can best contribute to sustaining non-inflationary growth by pressing ahead with fiscal consolidation.  Ultimately, over the economic cycles, growth will reflect conditions on the supply side of the economy. It is therefore microeconomic, and not macroeconomic, policies that can promote the supply of labour and capital and their efficient allocation, further innovation and the diffusion of new technologies, and as a result, mitigate problems such as structural unemployment. Structural reforms in the labour and goods markets are a key element of any long-term strategy to improve investment, growth and employment prospects. First, more flexible markets increase the speed with which countries can adapt to economic shocks, thereby speeding up economic recovery. Second, increased competition in labour and product markets is conducive to a high level of innovation and the rapid spread of technological progress. This in turn supports long-term growth, without contributing to inflationary tendencies. Third, structural reform may facilitate the transmission of monetary policy. In more rigid economies, interest rate changes are transmitted to prices after a longer delay, and structural barriers can prevent the economic efficiency gains of the primary objective of monetary policy - price stability - from being fully realised.  
 2 BIS Review 39/2003 It is important to mention here the close interplay between rigidities in capital, labour and product markets, which can strengthen one another. These interdependencies mean that structural reforms in any one of these markets will have an impact on the functioning of the others. It must be emphasised therefore that only a comprehensive reform programme can create the necessary conditions for stronger economic dynamism.  The need for structural reforms tends to become most urgent and evident to policy-makers during economic downturns. But don’t forget that structural reforms do not provide short-term solutions to economic problems. Although they can have positive short-term confidence effects, it normally takes time for their benefits to unfold. Hence I cannot emphasise enough the need to speed up the pace of structural reforms in capital, labour and product markets. Structural reforms in various regions of the world Let me now turn to the issue of future challenges with respect to microeconomic policies and structural reforms in particular economic areas. I shall start with structural reforms in the euro area, and then move on to say a few words about structural reform in the EU Neighbouring Regions, the United States, Latin America and, finally, East Asia. Euro area Economic activity in the euro area remained subdued in the first half of 2003. However, there is increasing reason to expect that it will recover gradually in the second half of 2003 and strengthen further in 2004. Although the outlook for price stability is favourable, having allowed interest rates to fall to historically low levels, monetary policy cannot by itself generate lasting and sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. Part of the weakness in economic growth in the euro area may be linked to a lack of ambition in recent years in both fiscal and structural reforms to improve the conditions for investment and employment in the euro area.  The euro area needs structural reforms which increase the flexibility of labour, financial and product markets and effectively increase potential output growth, job creation and investment.  Although the extent and implementation of labour market reforms have been uneven across countries, the efforts made in the 1990s resulted in positive progress in two areas: first, in fostering employment growth across most sectors, which rose to 1.5% per year on average between 1997 and 2001, and second, in helping groups, such as women, the young and old and the least educated, to enter the labour market. Labour market reforms should now focus on reducing high structural unemployment and increasing participation and employment rates. Indeed, it is important that, alongside social considerations, the countries of the euro area give more weight to economic efficiency within labour markets. Capital market reforms can also play a major role in making the euro area economy more flexible. Much has been achieved, not least due to the introduction of the euro, and the bulk of the Financial Services Action Plan has been implemented. However, the further integration of national capital markets towards a truly European financial market would be an important step towards safeguarding markets against country-specific shocks.  Finally, greater efforts must be made to remove existing barriers in product markets. Since the early 1990s state enterprises have undergone extensive privatisation, the use of state aid has fallen and market entry barriers have been lowered, although not evenly across all countries or sectors. In addition, there are still significant barriers to the further removal of price pressures, and these will need to be phased out. EU Neighbouring Regions  The ten countries that are about to join the European Union have made considerable economic progress in recent years in terms of macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reforms. As a group and individually, these countries have achieved significant and sustained improvements in their economic fundamentals. In this regard, the perspective of EU accession has been an important anchor for policies. However, the process of catching-up in real incomes has been significantly slower than expected at the start of transition, and today, as they prepare to join the EU, there is still a significant GDP per capita gap with the current Member States. Improving the growth performance of acceding 
 BIS Review 39/2003 3 countries remains an issue of vital importance. While EU membership itself and the lagged effects of earlier reforms should foster the catching-up process, sustained policy action is needed to further improve the growth environment in the acceding countries. Reforms should, in particular, be conducive to capital accumulation and bring about tangible increases in total factor productivity.  In other EU neighbouring regions, efforts in structural reforms have varied considerably. Following a severe financial crisis in 2001, Turkey witnessed a strong rebound in 2002 and began an ambitious process to reduce inflation, while still struggling with some of its long-standing problems. This achievement was supported by structural - though still insufficient - reforms. In Russia, after a long delay in the early years of transition, a first package of structural reforms has been implemented in recent years, positively contributing to the strong recovery the country has been enjoying since the 1998 crisis.  United States Turning to the United States, labour, product and capital markets have reached a high degree of flexibility. This reflects both the traditional market-oriented nature of the US economic system and reform efforts over the past 20 years, including a variety of deregulation measures in the 1980s. The flexible microeconomic structure of the US economy has helped to make it one of the strongest growth poles in the world, with GDP growth averaging 3.3% from 1983 to 2002 (compared with 2.4% in the euro area). At the same time, the US experience shows that no country can consider structural reforms as (cid:147)completed(cid:148). In its latest Article IV report on the United States, the IMF identified a number of areas where further efforts would be desirable, including the budgetary framework, the social security system and the energy sector. Also, the series of corporate failures in 2001-02 revealed weaknesses in corporate governance practices, including accounting and audit rules, which are currently being addressed by the US authorities. Latin America  Over the last two years, growth in most Latin American countries has been weak. This year, however, there are signs of a modest upturn, with confidence slowly returning. This has been due, in part, to the direction of the structural reform agendas of many countries in the region. To strengthen the foundations for growth, policy-makers must remain committed to implementing structural reforms. Countries that have made the greatest strides in reform are already reaping the benefits. Both Mexico and Chile, which are at the most advanced stage of reform in the region, have proven remarkably resilient to turmoil in regional economies and have weathered the period of weak global growth well, considering their exposure to sluggish mature economies. Other countries in the region have embarked on reform agendas and should be encouraged by the international community to see them through as swiftly as conditions allow. East Asia  As for the crisis-hit countries in Asia, economic performance has been positively correlated with progress in reforms. Stronger average growth potential in countries such as Korea and Malaysia reflects partly the authorities’ determination in pushing through corporate reforms, reforming the financial sector and strengthening insolvency laws. In China, the authorities have repeatedly emphasised that banking reform, if coupled with the restructuring and privatisation of state-owned enterprises, is key to strong growth and financial stability in the medium term. The situation in the Japanese economy calls for urgent structural reforms. Authorities have made some progress in addressing the fundamental weaknesses and a reform strategy has been set out. First, banking sector reform has been appropriately focused on strengthening loan classification practices and accelerating the disposal of non-performing loans (NPLs). However, while progress has been made on the former issue, financial institutions still hold large amounts of NPLs in their portfolios and more progress would be desirable. Second, a strategy to promote deregulation in the product and labour markets has been set up. The successful implementation of structural measures in the Japanese product and labour markets would have the benefit of not only increasing potential output and employment, but also decreasing the vulnerability of the Japanese economy to economic shocks. 
 4 BIS Review 39/2003 Concluding remarks  Let me conclude by first addressing the economic policy-makers in the euro area. I am convinced that economic activity in the euro area can only be lifted to a new, structurally higher, level by far-reaching and progressive structural reforms. In this respect, the major contribution that monetary and fiscal policy can make is to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment, entailing price stability and sound public finances. Moreover, as I have already argued, the effectiveness of both monetary and fiscal policy in bringing about macroeconomic stability hinges on the microeconomic functioning of the euro area economy, which can only be enhanced by embarking on structural reforms. I am pleased to observe that some countries in the euro area have already realised that the only solution to addressing the current economic slowdown lies in structural reforms to strengthen the functioning of the economy. I warmly welcome the efforts of the governments of these countries and sincerely hope that others will follow their example.  Second, as I have sketched out in my remarks to you today, while the need for structural reforms is pressing in the euro area, in all other regions of the world - albeit to different extents and to address somewhat different problems - there are benefits of structural reform to be won.  Thank you very much for your attention. 
 BIS Review 39/2003 1 Jaime Caruana: Chairman of the Basel Committee discusses Basel II Reuters interview with Mr Jaime Caruana, Governor of the Bank of Spain and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Basel, 8 September 2003. Interviewed by Stella Dawson and Thomas Atkins. *      *      * New bank rules to smooth economic swings - Caruana  New capital rules for banks worldwide should smooth economic swings and strengthen the financial system, making it easier for central bankers to set interest rates, the new head of the Basel Committee said on Monday.    In his first major interview since taking over the mammoth job of pushing through the (cid:147)Basel II(cid:148) bank capital accord, Jaime Caruana told Reuters that he doubts the complex risk-based capital requirements will worsen business cycles.    Instead, he said inserting more regulatory oversight into assessing how much capital a bank sets aside against possible loan losses, and increasing the amount of information banks must make public, should make banks much safer and better prepared for economic downturns.    (cid:147)It is a completely new approach. In that sense it is a kind of revolution,(cid:148) said Caruana, who is also governor of the Bank of Spain.    Some bankers and politicians have criticised the reforms, which aim to lessen the risk of banking crises and are scheduled to take effect at the end of 2006.    But Caruana said that requiring banks to run their capital through a stress test to assess what impact worsening economic conditions will have on their loan portfolios, and requiring bank supervisors to evaluate those models independently, increases the safety of the bank.    (cid:147)This is one of the measures that will help the banks to be less pro-cyclical because they will have taken into account the whole (business) cycle,(cid:148) he said.    The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which groups supervisors from major industrial economies, released the new rules earlier this year. The rules, dubbed Basel II because they replace a 1988 accord, were open for comment until July.    Critics have said the Basel II accord, by requiring banks to increase capital reserves as loans get riskier, will withdraw credit from the economy exactly when it is most needed, creating a credit crunch and making business downturns more severe.    While Caruana said that badly capitalised banks that have not assessed their risk properly certainly will face problems, he does not view it as endemic. Rather the banking system overall will be better capitalised so less vulnerable to shocks.    This in turn will reduce the need for central bankers to keep interest rates low for protracted time periods to help offset credit crunches, as the Federal Reserve did in the early 1990s U.S. banking crisis.    (cid:147)The fact that the banks are well capitalised and sensitive to risk, it will make monetary policy if anything easier,(cid:148) said Caruana, who took over the Basel Committee in May. Caruana also sits on the Governing Council of the European Central Bank which sets euro zone interest rates.   Less blue sky or rain? His top assistant Daniele Nouy, who is secretary general of the Basel Committee, was even more 
 2 BIS Review 39/2003 insistent, saying in the same interview that the new accord should help to smooth economic cycles.    (cid:147)I am personally absolutely convinced that it will be much less pro-cyclical than the old accord,(cid:148) Nouy said. The new accord will require banks to make better decisions earlier about how much capital they need, thus reducing risk and economic volatility.    (cid:147)Right now we move from blue skies to full storm (in bank lending activities),(cid:148) she said. (cid:147)This could easily disappear. We will have much more light grey and dark grey. I know it is very hard to convince people in advance, but I have zero doubt on that.(cid:148)    As for the pressure the new accord will place on bank regulators, Caruana said he was impressed by how well prepared they are in general. Many bank analysts have said that relying on a patchwork of different national supervisory structures to implement the regulatory pillar will highlight weaknesses, for instance in emerging markets.    (cid:147)You would be very surprised. There is tremendous supervision there,(cid:148) he said.    Bank regulators have progressed immensely in the past five years in their sophistication in risk management assessment and are well equipped to implement the accord, he said.    Moreover in the European Union, where the ECB lacks a formal bank regulatory role, Caruana said he sees no need for changes in the system.    (cid:147)We are talking about national supervision with very good contact with national central banks, which are part of the euro system. This is a structure that is working now, and I don’t think the Basel II will affect this structure. Certainly it makes it extremely necessary that supervisors and banks have a good relationship and risk-focused supervision, but this is already there.(cid:148) *      *      * New Basel Committee head opens door to rules delay  A top global regulator thrashing out new banking rules left the door open on Monday to delay the (cid:147)Basel II(cid:148) accord, which will force sweeping changes in how banks set aside capital for unforeseen hazards.    In an interview with Reuters, Jaime Caruana, the new chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, defended the controversial accord, saying he was more concerned with getting it right than with meeting the committee’s self-imposed deadline of end-2003 for a final draft.    The committee would decide at its next meeting in mid-October whether it would be possible to meet the original timetable, he said.    (cid:147)There are some concerns that the tight timing that we have may jeopardise the quality we have in the accord,(cid:148) he said in his first major interview since taking over the committee in May. (cid:147)The first consideration is going to be the quality of the accord. Still, we are working with the same timetable.(cid:148)    A storm of criticism from banks, academics and politicians in recent months has strengthened expectations that the final draft will not be completed until some time in early 2004, instead of end-2003 as planned. Critics blast the rules as fearsomely complex, too prescriptive and incurring costs far greater than the potential benefits.    Some areas require more work, such as risks posed by highly diversified banks and on credit derivatives. Regulators were prepared to adapt the accord as they gained a better understanding of new risk modelling techniques, said Caruana.    (cid:147)Certainly there will be issues that will be important that we cannot manage now,(cid:148) he said. (cid:147)We have recognised that the Basel II process is an evolutionary approach.(cid:148)   
 BIS Review 39/2003 3  The Basel II accord, so named because it will replace the 1988 Basel Accord, would update existing rules on how much capital large international banks must hold to remain sound and reflect changes in financial services over the last 15 years.    Due for implementation in 2006, it would set standards for how bank capital is supervised and what type of financial disclosure institutions must make.    Experts say that a delay in publishing the final draft of even several months could throw the target implementation date back by a full year if it means domestic rule-making and legislative deadlines in Europe cannot be met. Caruana, the Bank of Spain governor, has become the driving force in one of the most controversial regulatory efforts in decades, said he was prepared to intensify efforts to convince those affected of the accord’s merits.    (cid:147)There is a unanimous understanding of the need for Basel II,(cid:148) he said. (cid:147)It is a completely new approach and in that sense you could say that it is a kind of revolution.(cid:148)   To the ramparts  Caruana defended the accord, saying the U.S. decision to apply the new rules to only the top 10 banks - instead of all banks as Europe intends - met the spirit of the accord because U.S. banks already met high regulatory capital standards.    (cid:147)We respect their decision. We think this is perfectly compatible with Basel II. Europe has taken a different decision,(cid:148) he said.    Caruana rejected concerns that it could dry up some capital markets, as banks fear, as some market activities could be assigned a higher risk weighting under the new accord.    (cid:147)Frankly speaking, we don’t think that this is a problem. The strategic decisions that banks have already taken are based on economic capital and the accord should not change this,(cid:148) he said.    Daniele Nouy, secretary general of the Basel Committee and Caruana’s top assistant, said in the same interview that banks already assigned a cushion of economic capital to their different areas of activities, including market activities. The new accord should broadly follow existing practices.    (cid:147)We don’t anticipate as many changes as people believe,(cid:148) she told Reuters. (cid:147)The important thing is that economic capital will be close to regulatory capital.(cid:148)    But Caruana did acknowledge the need for further study, especially on how diversification of banks’ activities across business lines and economic zones.    (cid:147)We do not recognise properly all the diversification that a bank has when it has exposure to several markets,(cid:148) he said. (cid:147)We need to know what the best practice is so it can be incorporated.(cid:148)    Potential future risks posed by credit derivatives exposure would also require more work, Nouy said. (cid:147)There are many different practices in the industry and we simply do not yet know which is the best one going forward,(cid:148) she said.   Consolidation not a goal  Caruana distanced himself from speculation that the new accord could drive sweeping strategic changes in the financial sector, including mergers and acquisitions, saying it was not the committee’s goal to drive consolidation among banks.    Some banks, however, may conclude on their own that the new accord will increase pressure on them to join forces with other players in order to improve their business models under the new accord, he said.    
 4 BIS Review 39/2003 (cid:147)I think this will be more based on decisions taken by the industry,(cid:148) Caruana said. (cid:147)We don’t have this as an objective.(cid:148)    Caruana also rejected criticisms that the accord could punish banks in some developing nation markets because they lack the sophisticated risk-measurement techniques used by the world’s biggest banks.    Indeed, the accord could smooth the punishing volatility of capital flows in and out of emerging markets as banks and investors better understand lending risks by applying the new rules. (cid:147)Good risk management should also support emerging markets,(cid:148) he said.    Caruana said he welcomed China’s announcement in August that it would delay adoption of the new accord, introducing its own rules in the meantime as its capital-weak banks struggled to modernise and reform.    (cid:147)It was perfectly consistent with what we were saying...a right timing and a proper sequencing was important, not to rush,(cid:148) he said.  *      *      * Caruana, man of simple taste, faces complex Basel II  Bank of Spain Governor Jaime Caruana is a man of simple tastes.    A recent visitor to the Bank of Spain commented on the elaborate chandeliers in a conference room, a mass of coloured glass grapes. (cid:147)I love those chandeliers,(cid:148) the visitor said. (cid:147)Personally I find them rather excessive,(cid:148) Caruana replied.    For a fan of the simple, it’s no small irony that Caruana is driving a highly complex rewrite of global bank safety rules as the head of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, in one of the most dramatic and controversial financial reforms ever.    In his most difficult job to date, Caruana took control of the committee at a time of unprecedented criticism for New Basel Capital Accord or Basel II, designed to replace the 1988 accord that set out how banks allot cash to buffer against surprise risks.    The agreement being drafted by global regulators is now under fire from banks who say it is convoluted, expensive, heavy-handed and poorly tested, and who now seek to stall or derail it.    Not devoid of a dry sense of humour and with a shy smile, Caruana is known as a diligent and rigorous technocrat, a fan of teamwork who avoids showiness.    (cid:147)The core of the issue is whether Caruana will be able to demonstrate his leadership in the next couple of months,(cid:148) said one committee member who works directly with Caruana, who spoke under the condition of anonymity.    (cid:147)It’s not easy to guide such a group of self-confident people,(cid:148) the committee member said. (cid:147)He’s just trying to fight his way.(cid:148)    Part of the problem is that Caruana’s predecessor, New York Federal Reserve Chairman William McDonough, left large shoes to fill. McDonough’s unexpected retirement in June left critics wondering whether his successor would be able to hold together a global project.    (cid:147)There were definitely advantages in having a superpower in charge of this committee,(cid:148) said the Basel Committee member.    Karel Lannoo, head of the Brussels-based think tank Center for European Policy Studies, said Caruana is a strong player with anti-establishment nuances who should be able to push through the 
 BIS Review 39/2003 5 accord and even impart some Spanish character to it.    (cid:147)Caruana is, in the Spanish context, very well regarded,(cid:148) said Lannoo, a frequent adviser to the European Commission and a member of the academic European Shadow Regulatory Commission.    (cid:147)He was a broker. He knows market risk. He worked on the trading floor,(cid:148) Lannoo said.    Lannoo and the shadow committee are critics of the accord, saying its overly complex nature may in fact heighten systemic threats by (cid:147)capturing(cid:148) regulators who would be required to take a more active role in banks’ daily operations.   Revolution in the making  The new accord, now over five years in the making, represents a revolution for the banks who will adopt it. It leaves the first accord’s simple dictates behind and offers a menu ranging from basic to complex.    A second Basel Committee member, who also requested anonymity, said he had few doubts that the technocrat Caruana was the right choice for the job due to his expertise in such a complex field. (cid:147)This is not new territory for Jaime,(cid:148) he said.    Indeed, some critics of the accord say a technocrat like Caruana is just who is needed to make sure that the byzantine draft is moulded into shape before being finalised by the end of this year.    Caruana, a 51-year-old Valencian, studied telecommunications engineering and then qualified as a government economist.    Those who have worked with him say he is a real technology fan, which given his studies is no surprise.    The current controversy over the Basel reform is probably a source of discomfort for Caruana, who keeps himself to himself. (cid:147)He is very simple and discreet, and shys away from limelight,(cid:148) says a former colleague.    Some feared that the independence of the Bank of Spain might be brought into question when Caruana was named governor in July 2000, given his links to the ruling conservative Popular Party.    However he has carved out a reputation as a hard worker who has kept his head down, remained polite and attentive, and has helped his credibility as head of the central bank. (cid:147)He likes teamwork, and is very close to those he works with,(cid:148) one former colleague says.    Caruana worked for the Trade Ministry from 1979 to 1987, including a three-year stint in New York, and then spent 10 years first as chief executive and then as chairman of private brokerage Renta 4.    He was named Treasury Secretary at the Finance Ministry in 1996, when the Socialists were voted out, and was in that post for four years under the Popular Party before heading the Bank of Spain’s supervision department.    In July 2000 he took over from highly-respected Bank of Spain governor Luis Angel Rojo, under whom he had worked as supervisor.   
 BIS Review 38/2003 1 Ian Plenderleith: Is monetary policy different in Africa? Speech by Mr Ian Plenderleith, Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, 29 August 2003. *      *      * A good deal of attention has been directed in recent years to the very interesting and germane question of how far the challenges facing central banks in conducting monetary policy in emerging market economies differ from those facing their colleagues in developed countries. Are the very evident differences, for example in economic and social structure, in the pace of change and in exposure to shifts in the global economy, so significant as to require a difference in approach to conducting monetary policy? If so, what are the material differences and what adjustments do they require policymakers to make, in focus or in process? In particular, can inflation targeting, which was adopted with such good effect by a vanguard of (mainly) developed countries in the early-1990s, deliver similar beneficial results for the larger phalanx of emerging market economies who followed suit in the late-1990s? The purpose of this contribution is not to add to the burgeoning theoretical literature, but to offer some observations from practical experience of both worlds. That experience needs some disclaimer at the outset. Thirty years of wrestling with British monetary policy at the Bank of England certainly does not entitle one to claim any extended track record of success, though the last ten years went a lot better than the previous 20. Equally, six months (so far) contributing to the conduct of monetary policy in South Africa is far too narrow a span to allow one to claim any first hand expertise in the distinctive circumstances of emerging market economies. But the privilege of serving successively on the Monetary Policy Committees of two such different countries is given to relatively few central bankers and it has been fascinating to try to assess whether monetary policy really is different in Africa. What strikes one initially, in moving from a developed to an emerging market economy, is the remarkable similarity in the monetary policy process. This, on reflection, perhaps ought not to be surprising, given the effort the international community has invested in recent years in promulgating standards of international good practice for the conduct of macro-economic policy. In terms of the structure of the policy framework, one obvious common feature is the critical importance of government establishing a disciplined and coherent framework for fiscal and monetary policy to work in mutual support, so that weakness in the public finances does not undermine monetary discipline and so that the commitment to low inflation is seen to be embedded as a key feature of the government’s overall economic strategy. Another common feature is the need for the central bank to be able to act independently in pursuing low inflation, and to have the technical expertise and professional competence to do its job and command public confidence. Yet another common feature is the need for the country to have a reasonably developed and competently-regulated financial system. In all these respects South Africa scores highly, as indeed international scrutiny through visiting IMF/World Bank missions has confirmed. In process, too, the procedures through which monetary policy are conducted are remarkably similar. There are differences, but they are essentially ones of form, rather than substance.  Thus, as in other inflation-targeting countries, the inflation target is set as a key government economic objective. A structured Monetary Policy Committee in the central bank meets at regular, pre-announced intervals to take a considered decision on interest rates, enabling policy-makers to step aside from their day jobs for 36 hours and concentrate on a communal review of the monetary outlook. The emphasis, as elsewhere, is on a forward-looking assessment, weighing uncertainties and risks in the unknown future. Also, as elsewhere, the process is surrounded by lively public debate as to what monetary action should be taken, with market commentators showing commendable lack of reticence in arguing their views. Key to the value their contributions can add is the high degree of transparency in the process. In South Africa, as elsewhere, communication and explanation are key elements in monetary policy achieving its behavioural effects, and also critical features in the process by which the central bank is, quite properly, held accountable for its actions. 
 2 BIS Review 38/2003 All these elements, then, look and feel remarkably similar to a central banker migrating from an advanced developed country to an emerging market economy. What is, of course, fundamentally different is the economic, social and cultural environment in which the policy process has to be operated. This difference in the environment could simply be regarded as a feature that raises the level of uncertainty facing policy-makers as to what is going on in the economy - a difference in degree, but not such as to make the challenges different in kind in any fundamental way. A higher level of uncertainty can in fact matter a lot in itself, in making policy-makers less confident of their judgements and more inclined to wait and see. But there are grounds for arguing that the distinctly different environment in emerging market economies goes further in its implications for the way in which monetary policy has to be operated. Four possible effects can be identified. First, because they are undergoing significant structural change, many emerging market economies may be more vulnerable to shocks than fully-developed economies. Of course, all economies experience shocks, but the frequency and scale may be greater in emerging market economies. These shocks can have their origin in the domestic economy (a poor crop) or arrive unexpectedly from overseas (higher oil prices). Either way, they are difficult enough to handle if they impact on the demand side, but more often the emerging market central banker has to grapple with sharp movements in cost pressures on the supply side. The orthodox response to shifts in supply conditions is to accept the first-round effect on prices and concentrate monetary action on heading off second-round impacts that can otherwise generate an inflationary cycle. This may be conceptually clear, but in practice it is a hideously difficult distinction to have to translate into monetary decisions. It is a good discipline in these circumstances to remind oneself regularly that higher interest rates will not help to make the maize crop grow higher. South Africa’s experience in 2001-02 is a good case in point. A precipitate and largely inexplicable fall in the exchange rate in the latter part of 2001 combined with higher fuel costs and increases in domestic food prices to deliver a severe inflationary shock. The central bank’s response, to raise interest rates in progressive steps in 2002, was exemplary and appears to have worked well, with inflation now falling steadily back towards target range as the shock recedes. But the consequences were to make the central bank’s task of embedding low inflation in the fabric of the economy much more challenging, because of the inevitable questions this experience raised as to whether, faced with such shocks, monetary policy really could achieve permanently low inflation. That it can, and is doing so, is now gaining wider acceptance, as reflected in continuing evidence of falling inflationary expectations. But it has required, alongside carefully-timed monetary tightening, a strong effort by the central bank to communicate its determination. The prevalence of supply-side shocks would thus seem to be one area in which emerging market economies may face particular challenges in operating monetary policy. Another may arise from the impact of the exchange rate. Movements in exchange rates may have a relatively larger impact in emerging market economies, and their currencies may be more exposed to underlying volatility. Certainly, recent experience in South Africa suggests that the recovery in the rand over the past year has been an important factor in containing inflation. In part this recovery has reflected the general weakening in the dollar, and factors such as higher commodity prices have also been an influence. But the currency’s recovery has also been an important channel by which monetary tightening worked its way through to the economy. If the relationship between interest rates and exchange rate movements were predictable, the effectiveness of the exchange rate transmission channel would be helpful to monetary policy. But in practice this relationship remains rather inscrutable. Moreover, the fact that emerging market currencies are subject to volatility resulting from shifts unconnected with the country itself, such as the recent substantial adjustments by the dollar and the euro, means that movements in the exchange rate can have impacts on domestic monetary conditions that can be both large in their effects and impossible to anticipate. Of course, it can always be argued that in these circumstances the central bank should try to moderate movements in the exchange rate in greater or less degree. But the instruments available, for example through capital controls or official intervention, if maintained for any period, do not have at all an encouraging track record and may have counter-productive side-effects by impeding desirable structural adjustment or actually increasing exchange rate volatility. The appropriate remedy is to stick to the fundamentals, focusing monetary action determinedly on low inflation while taking into account impacts from the exchange rate as one 
 BIS Review 38/2003 3 amongst a range of relevant influences. But it needs to be recognised that these impacts may be particularly significant for emerging market economies. A further distinctive feature is more straightforward, but can easily be overlooked - that policy-makers in emerging market economies tend to have less information available to them about developments in the economy. This is essentially a form of resource constraint. It applies to statistics, where relevant series may be available less frequently, or in less comprehensive or disaggregated form, or simply less reliable. In South Africa, what was in origin a relatively minor distortion in the compilation of the CPI produced a downward revision, when it was discovered, of nearly 2 percentage points in the 12-month rate of inflation. This at least had the merit of being a rare example of a good news shock. Such events are not unique to emerging market economies: the UK and others have experienced problems with important statistical series from time to time. But diverting scarce resources to statistical compilation is inevitably a problem in an economy where the relevant skills are often a key constraint on economic development as whole. The same applies, too, more generally to knowledge of the transmission mechanism: understanding of functional relationships across the economy is bound to be less secure when the structure of the economy is undergoing rapid change. The existence of a large informal economy further complicates the task. This leads to a fourth implication for monetary policy in an emerging market economy. This is the critical role played by confidence in, and the credibility of, the policy framework. This has both a domestic and an international dimension. Domestically, there is a critical need to win public acceptance of the value of low inflation and public confidence in the determination and ability of the central bank to achieve it. Internationally, confidence that the policy framework will be adhered to can have a powerful influence on investment inflows and on the exchange rate. These factors are, of course, crucial to monetary policy in any country. But the task of buttressing them is the more challenging in emerging market economies because the track record of commitment is relatively much shorter. These can be argued to be some of the distinctive challenges faced by monetary policy-makers in emerging market economies. Are they, however, sufficiently distinctive as to require any fundamentally different approach in the conduct of monetary policy? The answer, to quote Evelyn Waugh, has to be, (cid:147)Up to a point, Lord Copper.(cid:148) They are not different in kind from the factors which central banks in any country have to face. But they do perhaps play a more predominant part in the monetary policy judgement in emerging market economies than elsewhere. This suggests two final observations.  First, because of the uncertainties, central banks in emerging market economies may understandably tend to be relatively cautious in adjusting their policy stance, in the sense of spacing adjustments in relatively smaller steps over more extended periods. No central banker need ever apologise for being regarded as being cautious. But it does mean that, even in circumstances in which there may be a case for contemplating more bold action, the balance of risks may argue against such an approach. Secondly, given the challenges, can an inflation targeting framework realistically be expected to deliver the desired results in the emerging market context? If the various distinctive features identified above - periodic unexpected shocks, exchange rate volatility, imperfect information sources and public confidence that is not yet fully robust - occurring in whatever combination, result in the central bank missing its target for any extended period, there is of course a danger that the credibility, or even the feasibility, of the process could be called into question. But arguably, it is precisely in these circumstances that the clarity an inflation target can be most helpful, and powerful, in communicating the central bank’s policy intentions. That the challenges are formidable is not a reason for stepping back from clarity. It is, instead, a powerful reason in favour of the clarity of an inflation target can deliver, reinforced by effective communication by the central bank, consistency in its conduct of policy and transparency in explaining its actions. In this broader perspective, the fundamentals of monetary policy are not, in any meaningful way, different in Africa.  
 BIS Review 38/2003 1 Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Challenges of financial education in Malaysia Opening remarks by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the Launch of the Insurance Consumer Education Programme, Kuala-Lumpur, 29 August 2003. *      *      * Saya berasa amat berbesar hati mengalu-alukan kehadiran tuan-tuan dan puan-puan ke majlis pelancaran Program Pendidikan Pengguna bagi industri insurans dan takaful pada pagi ini. Pelancaran program ini merupakan satu lagi perkembangan penting dalam pembangunan industri insurans dan takaful. Ladies and Gentlemen, The economic and financial landscape in Malaysia has undergone significant transformation. In the process, the economy has become more diversified with new sources of growth. In tandem with these changes, we have seen the modernisation of the financial sector that has also become increasingly more diversified to meet the new requirements of the economy. There has also emerged new distribution channels and channel convergence within the financial sector. The financial sector has also increasingly leveraged on advances in technology which has significantly changed the way financial business is being conducted. As market advances continue to expand the range of financial products and services, consumers are being faced with increasingly complex choices and options in the management of their personal finances and exposure to risk. In this more complex financial landscape, it becomes important for consumers to have improved access to information. Financial education for Malaysian consumers is central to this process. It is therefore a matter that is accorded high priority by the Central Bank.  It therefore gives me great pleasure today to launch the Consumer Education Programme for the insurance and takaful industries. This represents an important step in the ongoing evolution of the development of our financial system. Indeed, this also represents a part of the overall efforts to promote market integrity and consumer protection over the whole spectrum of banking, insurance and takaful activities in the market. For consumers to fully realise the benefits of increased opportunities available in this continuously changing financial environment, consumers need to be in a position to actively manage their financial assets while at the same time safeguard their financial future.  The public response to the launch of the Consumer Education Programme for the banking sector early this year has been most encouraging. To date, more than two million visitors have accessed the Bank Negara Malaysia(cid:146)s (cid:147)Banking Info(cid:148) website and more than 360,000 booklets have found their way into the hands of consumers. The launch of the Consumer Education Programme for the insurance and takaful industries today will be part of this on-going effort to enhance the ability of consumers to understand and draw meaningful comparisons of alternative financial products and make better-informed decisions in financial planning.  In formulating a consumer education strategy, the distinct features of the insurance industry have been taken into consideration to meet the information needs of insurance consumers. Insurance contracts are essentially formed on the basis of disclosures made by prospective policyholders about the risks to be insured. Such disclosures determine if an insurer will assume the risk and the price at which it is assumed. The ability to enforce a claim against an insurer will depend on the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures. This underwriting and claims assessment process distinguishes insurance from other financial products. There is also a wider range of intermediaries in the insurance industry compared with other financial service industries. The entire spectrum includes the insurance agents, insurance brokers and advisers in the distribution process, and the loss adjusters, managed care organizations, lawyers and auto repair workshops in the claims process.  The unique features of insurance have significant implications on disclosures and liabilities which directly affect the insuring public. The implications become even more significant as competitive pressures give rise to the rapid introduction of new products that require a better understanding of what they entail on the part of the average consumer. The specific objectives of the Consumer Education Programme for the insurance and takaful sector are therefore: (cid:1)(cid:2)to promote public understanding of critical information when buying insurance and takaful products and services; 
 2 BIS Review 38/2003 (cid:1)(cid:2)to familiarise the public with the underwriting and claims processes; and (cid:1)(cid:2)to create awareness of ethical market practices such that consumers can be more assertive and discerning in making decisions. The Consumer Education Programme seeks to provide relevant information to consumers about insurance products, their costs and benefits, processes and documentation involved in the insurance cycle, and more importantly, the rights and responsibilities of the various parties to an insurance contract. It is also to promote greater awareness among consumers about the means and avenues for redress in the event of dispute or dissatisfaction with any insurance product or service.  This Consumer Education Programme for the insurance sector will extend over a 10-year horizon and will be undertaken on several levels under a step-by-step approach to reach out to the various target groups. Similar to the Consumer Education Programme for banking, the insurance education programme has been given the acronym: (cid:147)InsuranceInfo(cid:148) (or (cid:147)InfoInsurans(cid:148) in Bahasa Malaysia). Over time, it is envisaged that the acronym and the programme will become readily recognizable in the public domain.  In its first year, the Consumer Education Programme will focus on the wide dissemination of information in 12 priority areas that have been identified. These include issues on the fundamentals of insurance and takaful products and services, highlighting the important terms and conditions, rights and obligations under a policy contract as well as the redress avenues available, and the common insurance and takaful products. With participation from the insurance associations, Bank Negara Malaysia has produced 12 booklets that set out the important information for consumers in these areas. These booklets can be obtained from the principal offices and branches of insurance companies and takaful operators, as well as from selected branches of banks that have bancassurance arrangements with insurers. Ladies and Gentlemen, In addressing the challenges of financial education, collaborative partnerships are important. No single organisation can be expected to meet all the demands for consumer education. While Bank Negara will continue to actively engage the insurance industry in the development, production and dissemination of educational materials and initiatives, the process needs to be driven by the industry.  Insurance intermediaries provide the direct link to the insuring public and therefore is an essential part of the efforts to increase familiarity on insurance by the community. With approximately 147,000 agents currently in the market, the agency force can contribute significantly towards raising the level of financial literacy among Malaysians through InsuranceInfo. Similarly, the various consumer associations, through their direct contact with consumers, have an important role to play in promoting an active consumer movement by providing useful guidance to consumers in dealing with issues relating to insurance and takaful matters. Their wide network, close proximity, and good relationship with consumers can contribute towards the successful implementation of the Consumer Education Programme.  Just as the rapid deployment of new information technology has expanded the scope of financial services, so too, has it increased our options for meeting the challenges of financial education. In this regard, the InsuranceInfo website represents an important delivery channel which has significant potential to be used extensively to bring relevant and timely information to the public. All the pamphlets and booklets can be downloaded from the website. Over time, the website will be continually enhanced to provide for a more interactive and user-friendly interface with consumers that will also enable consumers to provide feedback on the programme and obtain prompt answers to their questions.  Ladies and Gentlemen, The Consumer Education Programme represents one of several important elements in the overall strategy of enhancing the consumer protection infrastructure. To achieve the desired outcome of high standards of market conduct that are founded on principles of integrity, sound ethics and professionalism, Bank Negara Malaysia has adopted a combination of regulatory policy instruments. These include policy development, regulatory initiatives, compliance reviews and ongoing surveillance. Recent initiatives that have been implemented in the area of strengthening market conduct within the insurance sector include: 
 BIS Review 38/2003 3 (cid:1)(cid:2)The framework for the introduction of qualified independent advisers is currently being finalized. Such independent advisors will form a new distribution channel for the sale of life insurance products. These intermediaries will be licensed under the Insurance Act and will be held to the highest standards of prudential conduct, accountability and governance to safeguard the interests of consumers. (cid:1)(cid:2)The entry requirements for agents have now been raised under a graduated implementation programme that commenced in April 2003. Under the programme, examinations have been made mandatory to maintain continuing education standards of agents. (cid:1)(cid:2)Guidelines dealing with unfair practices in insurance business have been introduced in April 2003 to provide a more comprehensive framework for the regulation of insurance market practices. Among other things, the Guidelines provide for enhanced disclosures to consumers, requirements for insurance to be sold on equitable terms and conditions, and specific restrictions against misrepresentation and unfair discrimination. (cid:1)(cid:2)The Guidelines on Claims Settlement Practices introduced in 1995 have now been revised to incorporate new measures and improved market practices in claims handling, as well as the specification of minimum fraud control and risk management practices relevant to the claims process.  (cid:1)(cid:2)A minimum standard on product disclosure and transparency in the sale of medical and health insurance policies was issued in May 2003. The standard requires insurers and their intermediaries to provide sufficient details of the essential features of medical and health policies so that policyholders will understand the important provisions of the policies, in particular, with respect to premiums, benefits, exclusions and limitations under the policies. (cid:1)(cid:2)A survey has also been commissioned to determine the level of consumer satisfaction with financial services, including insurance. The results of the survey will provide important input for the development of a service quality index for financial services that will serve as a benchmark for financial institutions to evaluate their service levels and identify areas for improvement. In our efforts to promote a larger role for consumer activism, attention has also been directed at enhancing dispute resolution mechanisms for consumers to seek redress. Within the insurance sector, the Insurance Mediation Bureau established in 1992 constitutes the main avenue outside the court system for resolving disputes between policyholders and their insurers. To further enhance the role of the Insurance Mediation Bureau as a dispute resolution mechanism, an expanded scope for the Bureau involving higher limits for claims falling within its purview and the inclusion of third party claims is being considered. This will provide greater access to the Bureau for a wider spectrum of the insuring public. At the same time, efforts are also underway to merge the mediation bureaus of both the banking and insurance sectors into a single new Financial Mediation Bureau that will serve as a one-stop centre for the resolution of a broad range of retail consumer issues raised against the financial institutions that are regulated by the Central Bank.  With effect from 1 June this year, we have also made it a requirement for all insurers and takaful operators to establish dedicated complaints units in their respective organizations. The experience has been that most complaints can be resolved in-house by the service providers themselves, in particular those complaints that involve delays in claims settlements due to institutional procedures, which generally comprise the bulk of public complaints. The establishment of the complaints unit by insurers and takaful operators is expected to promote a more pro-active approach in the management of complaints. Such consumer complaints also provide valuable information regarding any shortcoming in the products and services. Responding to consumer complaints also promotes customer goodwill. Certainly, as consumer awareness and financial literacy increases with the implementation of this Consumer Education Programme, it is essential for financial service providers to recognise the opportunity to build customer loyalty and increase customer retention through this mechanism.  Ladies and Gentlemen, The advent of new technology and other market innovations will bring new challenges and possibilities for businesses and consumers. We can expect that this pace of change in the financial services industry will continue to increase. In striving to adjust to these changes, we should not underestimate the significant improvements in financial and business practices that can be achieved by empowering consumers through education.  
 4 BIS Review 38/2003 As we continue on this drive to raise the standards of individual economic and financial well-being through consumer education, the broad involvement of all parties involved in every stage of the programme(cid:146)s implementation is vital to encourage expanded linkages between business and consumer education on an ongoing basis. Our success in this important endeavour will have a significant bearing on how well prepared our society is to meet the challenges of an increasingly dynamic and complex financial environment.  Dengan itu, saya ingin mengambil kesempatan ini untuk mengucapkan terima kasih kepada semua pihak yang terlibat di atas kerjasama dan sumbangan serta komitmen yang diberikan bagi menjayakan Program Pendidikan Pengguna ini. Usaha-usaha sedemikian diharap akan dapat membaiki dan meningkatkan lagi prestasi dan keupayaan industri insurans dan takaful dalam memberikan pengguna produk dan servis bertaraf antarabangsa. 
BIS Review 38/2003 1 Svein Gjedrem: Monetary policy and the economic situation Speech by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, 2 September 2003.  The text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. The speech is based on the assessments presented at Norges Bank(cid:146)s press conference following the Executive Board(cid:146)s monetary policy meeting on 13 August and on previous speeches.  The Charts in pdf can be found on the Norges Bank(cid:146)s website. *      *      * The operational target of monetary policy as defined by the Government is inflation of close to 2.5 per cent over time. The inflation target provides economic agents with an anchor for their decisions concerning saving, investment, budgets and wages. The inflation target is a vehicle for monetary policy(cid:146)s contribution to stabilising output and employment. This intention is also expressed in the Regulation on Monetary Policy. High demand for goods and services and labour shortages normally point to higher inflation. When interest rates are increased, demand falls and inflation is kept at bay. When demand is low and unemployment rises, inflation will tend to slow. Interest rates will then be reduced.  Norges Bank sets the interest rate so that future inflation will be equal to the inflation target of 2‰ per cent. The interest rate has been reduced since December last year in response to the change in the inflation outlook. This was the result of weaker cyclical developments in the world economy and a sharp drop in interest rates internationally. In addition, the Norwegian business sector has felt the effects of the high Norwegian cost level. The weak prospects at home and abroad have in turn had an impact on the Norwegian labour market and the outlook for wage growth and inflation in the years ahead.  The mandate implies that the interest rate must be adapted to the outlook for the Norwegian economy. If it appears that inflation will be higher than 2‰ per cent with unchanged interest rates, the interest rate will be increased. If it appears that inflation will be lower than 2‰ per cent with unchanged interest rates, the interest rate will be reduced. This orientation of monetary policy will normally also contribute to stabilising output and employment. The impact of monetary policy occurs with a lag. The current inflation rate does not provide sufficient information to determine the level at which interest rates should be set now. Our analyses indicate that a substantial share of the effects of an interest rate change will occur within two years. Thus, two years is normally a reasonable time horizon for reaching the inflation target. The interest rate influences inflation indirectly via domestic demand for goods and services and via its effect on the exchange rate. When interest rates rise, it becomes more profitable for households to save, and they will therefore postpone consumption. Borrowing also becomes more costly, with an associated decline in investment. Lower demand in turn curbs the rise in prices and wages. Higher interest rates make it more attractive to invest in NOK and borrow in foreign currency. Therefore, higher interest rates normally lead to an appreciation of the krone. This makes imported goods cheaper. In addition, a strong krone reduces activity, profitability and the ability to pay in the internationally exposed sector. Expectations in the US as to how far the interest rate will fall have been adjusted downwards considerably since summer 2002. Last summer, market participants expected the key rate in the US to be increased to about 5 per cent towards the end of 2004. Now interest rates are believed to have reached their lowest level and are expected to remain at 1 per cent until the end of 2003, with a gradual rise to about 2.5 per cent in 2005.  Clearer signs of the expected upswing have emerged recently, however. GDP grew by 3.1 per cent (seasonally adjusted, annual rate) in the second quarter. Optimism among participants in the financial markets is increasing; both equity prices and long-term interest rates have risen.  Despite improvement in the US economy, some aspects still give rise to uncertainty as to whether the expected upswing will be sustained. Capacity utilisation in manufacturing is still low. The household saving ratio is low and household debt is high. The current account is showing a large deficit.  
2 BIS Review 38/2003 At its monetary policy meeting in August, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 per cent. The Committee perceived that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters were roughly equal. The Committee judged that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.  Asia is showing signs of recovery. China is leading the field with economic growth approaching 10 per cent and Thailand is showing strong growth. But the picture is not all positive. South Korea has experienced slower growth this year. South Korea is one of the countries that is particularly affected by the competition from China. In Japan, where growth has been low for a long period, there are indications that growth is picking up, although it is still too early to say whether it is sustainable. The key rate in the euro area has been reduced to 2 per cent. Forward rates imply that interest rates are expected to remain at 2 per cent to the end of 2003, before rising slightly next year.  GDP growth in major European countries is low or negative. In the Netherlands, GDP has dropped for three consecutive quarters, and Germany has recorded a decline over the past two quarters. France(cid:146)s GDP showed growth in the first quarter and a decline in the second quarter of this year. For the euro area as a whole, preliminary figures indicate zero growth in the second quarter. Some consumer and business confidence indicators have recently shown signs of improvement, and the EU Commission(cid:146)s estimates point to moderate growth in the next few quarters. There are, however, no clear signs of an imminent and rapid recovery. Among our trading partners as a whole, economic developments over the past year have been far weaker than Norges Bank and others, both analysts and international organisations, had expected. Growth projections for 2003 have been revised downwards substantially over the past year, reflecting the effect on the world economy of a number of negative shocks such as the war in Iraq and SARS. Global growth is still expected to pick up gradually towards a more normal level, but the upswing may come at a later stage than previously assumed. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the global economy is facing a relatively long period of stagnation with low and possibly falling inflation. This risk is reflected in the low short-term interest rates in the US, Europe and Japan. Long-term interest rates have edged up again recently. This may be an indication that financial market participants are now somewhat more optimistic and expect that the economic policy stimulus will have the desired effect. In spite of weak economic developments, oil prices have remained high. Low levels of production in Iraq have contributed to holding up oil prices. Strikes and production problems in Venezuela and Nigeria have also played a role. These developments may keep oil prices high until growth in the global economy returns to normal. The oil industry will then have come through this period of sluggish growth in the global economy since 2000 without a fall in revenues. This has, in isolation, curbed the effects of the international downturn on Norway. However, the situation, as a whole and with regard to oil prices, is still highly uncertain. Weak external developments have in particular had negative spillover effects on the Norwegian economy through the appreciation of the krone, the fall in equity prices last year and lower demand for Norwegian exports. The krone exchange rate is the price of our currency measured in terms of a foreign currency. Developments in other countries are just as important for the krone as developments in the Norwegian economy. The krone has been strong. As a result, prices for imported goods have fallen. This has contributed to low inflation despite strong wage growth over a period of several years. Our analyses indicate that the most important reason for the appreciation of the krone from May 2000 to the end of 2002 was the positive and widening interest rate differential. Combined with the interest rate differential, the fall in equity prices and reduced fluctuations, or volatility, in foreign exchange markets contributed to the appreciation of the krone last year. The effect of the interest rate differential on the krone has been amplified by developments in international capital markets. Part of the appreciation in 2002 may also be due to higher oil prices. In a highly uncertain situation and with fears of war in Iraq, the Norwegian krone, buoyed by a relatively high interest rate and oil wealth, may have been regarded as an attractive alternative. Investment in NOK may have been considered a good hedge against a downturn in the world economy as a result of fears of war and high oil prices. Since December last year, the interest rate differential between Norway and other countries has narrowed by 
BIS Review 38/2003 3 about 3 percentage points. Since the beginning of 2003, the krone measured in terms of the trade-weighted exchange rate index (TWI) has depreciated by 11 per cent.  At the beginning of the 1990s, the Norwegian economy was in a deep recession. Production was far below capacity. When growth in the economy picked up, capacity utilisation increased. The output gap shows the difference between actual GDP and the level indicated by trend growth - estimated at close to 2‰ per cent in Norway. Around 1996, there was full capacity utilisation, and the output gap, as we normally measure it, closed. Subsequently, costs increased and prices for goods and services produced for the Norwegian market accelerated. The upturn peaked in 1997, with GDP growth approaching 5 per cent. In 1997 and 1998 the economy shifted from an upturn with high growth rates to an expansion with lower growth but low unemployment, labour shortages in many sectors and strong growth in labour costs. Unemployment has increased again since 2001. Capacity utilisation in the mainland economy has fallen again from a high level and is now on a par with the level in the years 1995-1997, before cost inflation accelerated. The output gap has again closed. At the same time, wage growth has dropped to a more sustainable level. However, growth in the economy stalled last winter. It has therefore been appropriate to reduce interest rates markedly. Even though the krone has depreciated this year, competitiveness is still fairly weak. In the period 1996-2003, competitiveness in Norwegian manufacturing has deteriorated by about 13 per cent. The deterioration is solely ascribable to higher growth in labour costs in Norway than among our trading partners. The krone measured in terms of the trade-weighted exchange rate index (TWI) is currently at about the same level as in 1996. Compared with the average for the last 30 years (1970-2003), wage growth has contributed to a deterioration in competitiveness of 15 per cent. In the years around the turn of the millennium, the depreciation of the krone veiled the underlying deterioration in competitiveness. In May 2000, the krone exchange rate reached its lowest level in six years. In the following period and until the end of 2002, the krone appreciated, and the effect of high wage growth gradually came into evidence in overall corporate results. Results last year were affected by a particularly strong krone in the second half of the year. The krone exchange rate, measured in terms of the TWI, has now returned to the level of the mid-1990s, while the business sector is still grappling with the high level of costs that has built up since 1998. Changes in the krone exchange rate have proved to be reversible, but the loss of competitiveness and jobs caused by the relatively high level of domestic wage growth is more difficult to recoup. In recent years, labour costs have accounted for an increasing share of corporate earnings. In 2002, labour costs accounted for more than 90 per cent of total factor income in manufacturing.  The increase in wage shares is affecting corporate behaviour. The demand for labour is declining. Credit demand and investment in the enterprise sector are low. At the same time, the commercial property market is weak. Vacancy rates for commercial premises are high and rents have fallen. This will have an impact on investment in the period ahead. Lower interest rates will normally result in higher inflation, partly because the krone depreciates, and partly because of a rise in demand. Enterprises will thus be able to increase their earnings. Business sector activity is stimulated most effectively by low interest rates and a weak krone.  Due to the past few years(cid:146) wage settlements, households have strengthened their financial position at the expense of private and public enterprises. House prices have edged up after stagnating earlier this year. Household borrowing has moderated somewhat, but is still high. Against this background, growth in private consumption is expected to be fairly high in the period ahead. Consumer spending on goods is rising, pointing towards growth in private consumption this year on a par with our projections in the June Inflation Report. Mainland GDP is projected to rise less than trend growth this year and to reach trend levels in 2004.1 In 2005, GDP growth is projected to be higher than trend growth. Investment activity in mainland Norway is low. Investment in the petroleum sector is rising, but a large share of the increase in demand is being met by imports. Public consumption increased sharply in 2002, but there will be little stimulus to the economy from the public sector this year. Growth will mainly be fuelled by private                                                       1 Projection in Inflation Report 2/03 based on assumptions concerning forward rates and a gradually declining krone exchange rate. 
4 BIS Review 38/2003 consumption in the second half of this year and into 2004. We expect that investment in mainland enterprises will gradually pick up from a low level. In order to set an appropriate interest rate, it is important to be be able to form a reasonably accurate picture of the economic situation. Economic statistics are the most important source of information, but they are published with a lag and some of the figures are revised frequently. In autumn 2002, Norges Bank established a regional network as a tool to gauge the level of activity in the Norwegian economy. The network consists of companies, organisations and municipalities throughout Norway. In the two rounds of talks in connection with Inflation Report 2/03, 450 contacts were interviewed. We will be having six rounds of talks each year with business and community leaders concerning financial developments in their enterprises and industries, with about 200 visits in each round. The selection of contacts represents the production side of the economy, both industry-wise and geographically. In the course of 2003, the number of contacts in the network will rise to about 1000 persons, who will be contacted once or twice a year. The Department of Economics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology is responsible for the network in Trłndelag county and conducts contact meetings. Official statistics and current market information will continue to be the main basis for our assessments, but due to the time lag and revisions of statistics, supplementary information is useful. The regional network provides up-to-date information on the state of the Norwegian economy. Regular communication with local contacts in Norway’s business and community life provides us with information that supplements available official statistics. It also provides us with additional information on areas not covered by official statistical sources, and we learn which issues are of particular interest to enterprises.  Information received from the regional network supported the picture presented in the June Inflation Report: enterprises are reducing costs while households(cid:146) financial position is strong. We are waiting to see if the results of the current round of talks will point to increased optimism in the business sector and in public entities or if the prospects for the future continue to be regarded as somewhat negative. Inflation is low in Norway. The rise in consumer prices adjusted for taxes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) has slowed primarily due to developments in prices for imported consumer goods. Low inflation is due to the appreciation of the krone throughout last year and low inflation abroad. The rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services has also slowed. This is particularly the case for domestically produced goods influenced by world market prices. Domestic price inflation has nevertheless remained close to 3 per cent, due to high wage growth over several years. In July, the year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE was 0.7 per cent, which is lower than projected in the June Inflation Report and substantially lower than the inflation target. There are also prospects that inflation will be low for some time ahead. The analysis in the June Inflation Report showed that a reduction in the sight deposit rate towards 3 per cent, combined with some depreciation of the krone, could bring inflation up towards the target two years ahead.2 More moderate wage settlements in the future would provide a basis for even further monetary policy easing and a weaker krone.3 Without considerable monetary policy easing, inflation might have remained too low for an extensive period.  The short-term nominal interest rate in Norway has now reached a historically very low level. Interest rates have not been lower since the first nine to ten years following the Second World War. The real interest rate is also low, although by no means as low as it was when inflation plagued Norwegian savers in the 1970s and 1980s. The low interest rate must be viewed against the risk of persistently low inflation both in Norway and in other countries. So far, indicators of inflation expectations do not point to any substantial deviation from the inflation target of 2‰ per cent. However, if inflation should remain too low for an extensive period, there is a risk that expectations of continued very low inflation will be generated. It may then prove difficult to fuel economic activity by stimulating demand. A marked easing of monetary policy has therefore been appropriate. The inflation target is symmetrical. It is equally important to avoid an inflation rate that is too low as it is to avoid an inflation rate that is too high.                                                       2 Based on assumptions concerning forward rates and a gradually declining krone exchange rate. 3 Based on assumptions concerning forward rates and a gradually declining krone exchange rate, and an assumption that monetary policy easing will not translate into stronger wage growth. 
BIS Review 38/2003 5 Capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy is now neither abnormally high nor abnormally low. However, available statistics indicate that economic growth came to a halt during the winter. A global upswing will contribute to stronger growth in Norway. Growth is sluggish already, however, with stagnation in many business sectors. Since inflation is also low, a low interest rate is appropriate now. But it is always a question of weighing one consideration against another. Since December last year, monetary policy has been eased to a greater extent and more rapidly than has been customary. Following this phase of substantial easing, uncertainty with regard to economic developments in the period ahead has been somewhat greater than normal. With the easing that has been implemented, we must be particularly alert to changes in private consumption, wage growth and the krone exchange rate. If households expect the interest rate to remain low, private consumption may increase more than has been assumed. House prices and household borrowing may again accelerate. However, increased slack in the labour market and declining migration to the largest towns will reduce these effects. The risk of stronger growth in household demand must be weighed against the sluggish developments in the business sector. Even though the krone has depreciated from its strong level at the beginning of the year, competitiveness is still relatively weak after many years of high wage growth. In addition, vacancy rates for commercial premises are high and rents have fallen.  Another risk is that wage growth may accelerate again, as it did following the interest rate reductions in 1999. This risk is also being reduced by a slackening labour market. Unemployment in 2004 will probably be on a par with the level in 1996 and 1997. Annual wage growth in these years was a little less than 4‰ per cent. The low pay increases in this year(cid:146)s wage settlement also indicate that the social partners have placed more weight on the effects of pay increases on future developments in interest rates, the krone exchange rate and employment. In addition, activity in public and particularly sheltered industries is probably still feeling the impact of the expensive pay increases last year and earlier years. We expect that in light of the experience gained in 2002, public entities will exercise more caution in future wage settlements. Developments in the krone exchange rate represent another source of uncertainty. The relationship between the krone exchange rate and the interest rate differential against other countries is not necessarily stable over time. Themes in international financial markets shift. However, the depreciation of the krone this year is contributing to stabilising inflation and activity in the economy. We may not yet have seen the full effects on the krone exchange rate of the interest rate reductions that have been implemented. At the same time, the krone can be influenced by fiscal policy and the outlook for wage growth. Norges Bank(cid:146)s Executive Board sets the interest rate with a view to achieving the inflation target of 2‰ per cent. The inflation target is also a vehicle for monetary policy(cid:146)s contribution to stabilising output and employment. When setting the interest rate, the Executive Board seeks to achieve a balance. The objective of stimulating growth in the Norwegian economy and achieving the inflation target is weighed against the risk of new pressures building up in the economy over the long term. Since December 2002, we have judged that to achieve this balance it was appropriate to reduce the interest rate to a low level. At the last monetary policy meeting on 13 August, it was decided to reduce the interest rate to 3.0 per cent. With an interest rate of 3.0 per cent, the Executive Board(cid:146)s assessment remained unchanged, i.e. that the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2‰ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS Review 37/2003 1 Glenn Stevens: Structural change and the conduct of monetary policy Speech by Mr Glenn Stevens, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium, Jackson Hole, 30 August 2003. *      *      * Thank you to the organisers for the invitation to take part in this symposium. I(cid:146)d like to arrange my remarks around three types of structural change. The first is change in the underlying structure of the real economy. The second is change in the inflation process. The third is change in the financial structure. I will argue that the last is probably the most difficult for central banks to deal with. Structural change in the real economy Changes in industries(cid:146) relative shares of production or employment, or changes in the extent to which foreign competitors penetrate national markets, have always been a feature of market economies. This kind of structural change reflects shifting tastes, the opening of new markets, the advent of new competitors and the introduction of new technologies and so on, which periodically disrupt established patterns of production, distribution and consumption. What(cid:146)s monetary policy(cid:146)s job in the face of such changes? Generally speaking, it is simply to let them occur, and to resist any temptation to use monetary policy to address the adjustment issues. Monetary policy cannot, for example, cure an unemployment problem that is the result of the collision of changing industrial patterns with rigid labour market practices. Nor can it address the inter-regional differences in an economy caused by concentration of declining sectors in one area and of growing sectors in another. Other policies must come to the fore in dealing with these sorts of problems. (That said, an improvement in structural policies which enhances the economy(cid:146)s supply side should ideally be complemented by more accommodating demand management, all other things equal.) That is not to say that these sorts of structural change may not raise some technical issues for monetary policy. They may well affect our judgement as to what setting of the instrument will contribute to the long run goals of policy, which themselves are invariant to the changed structure. If structural changes are, for example, affecting the relationships between conventional measures of economic slack and prices, or the economy(cid:146)s medium-term potential output path, or the relevance of particular economic indicators, then that should be taken into account in setting the instrument. How does one go about that? There is no simple device available for this purpose. It is essentially a matter of trying to be quick learners - continually being on the look out for things which are different to the past, and not being too wedded to particular empirical representations of the economy. We have to develop some notion of the economy(cid:146)s behaviour - it(cid:146)s not good enough to say we know nothing. But (cid:145)models(cid:146) of the economy - whether of the formal or informal kind - need to be viewed as working hypotheses, continually open to amendment in the light of new experience.1 This holds as well for analytical constructs we commonly use, like output gaps, NAIRUs, natural real interest rates and so on. It(cid:146)s important to keep these devices in the realm of useful ways of organising our thinking, and to take care not to elevate numerical estimates of them to central status, lest a shift in relationships take policy-makers off course. The RBA(cid:146)s approach has been to do our best with various pieces of empirical research in these and other areas, and to allow them to inform our judgement about the outlook and policy, but not in any sense to be a substitute for that judgment. I(cid:146)m sure that the same occurs in other central banks. Provided we are mindful of these broad principles, and I think most central banks are, we should be able to cope with shifting economic structure acceptably well. And there is little to suggest that this sort                                                       1 It could be added that taking on board some of these sorts of change may involve being prepared on occasion to give some weight to judgement before all the empirical evidence is crystal clear - while recognising that you might be wrong and trying to weigh the costs of being wrong. A case in point would be the way US policy makers backed their judgement about higher trend productivity growth before it was all that clear in the official data. 
2 BIS Review 37/2003 of ongoing evolution of economic structure poses greater problems for policy makers today that it has in the past. A different type of structural change has to do with the time series properties of the economy - in particular, the degree of variation from quarter to quarter. As we have heard at this conference, there seems to be reasonably clear evidence that, for many of the major countries, this variation diminished during the 1990s. This was also true in Australia(cid:146)s case, where the standard deviation of quarterly GDP growth in the 1990s was about one third lower than in the 1980s, and two thirds lower than in the 1970s. Better policies, more flexible economies, and smaller shocks - that is, better luck - are all (complementary) explanations for this phenomenon. That is a very favourable environment for central bankers. To some extent, we(cid:146)ve been given an easier hand to play than some of our predecessors. I for one would very much like to see it continue! Of course, it may not continue. Shocks could be bigger in future. Or structural policy improvements might be partly reversed (e.g. if there were an increase in protectionism). Perhaps the relatively stable geopolitical environment which must have helped growth in the 1990s will not be present in the decade ahead. In such a world, monetary policy makers would face a tougher time. Even optimal policy adjustments would most likely be associated with more volatile overall performance. Whether financial market prices currently embody any significant probability of such an outcome is an interesting question to ponder - my guess is they do not. In a scenario like this, expectations about what monetary policy might be able to deliver in terms of smoothing the business cycle and year to year inflation rates could turn out to be disappointed, and we would all have a more difficult time explaining this to our respective citizens. But apart from sharpening our communication skills, there is not much we can do about these possibilities other than to wait to see if they occur. Structural change in the inflation process The second type of structural change about which I want to talk is change in the inflation process. In the post-world war II era, we have witnessed two structural changes in the properties of the aggregate price level. First, there was a tendency for persistent inflation, to an extent not seen before, which had become quite noticeable by the late 1960s. (cid:145)The Great Inflation(cid:146) accelerated in the 1970s, and for most industrial countries, the peak inflation rate was reached some time between about 1974 and 1982. Since then, we have seen a second phase, during which the continual rise in the price level has slowed down, and in many places we today see, more or less, price stability. A few factors made a contribution to these swings, including adverse supply shocks in the 1970s, and favourable ones for much for the 1990s. These sorts of things can make monetary policy(cid:146)s job harder or easier, though of course monetary policy ultimately has to take responsibility for price level outcomes in the long run. One of the central lessons drawn from that experience was the importance of expectations in the inflation process. The more ambitious expansionary policies could only deliver the intended gains while expectations remained stable. Once expectations started to move up, policies were less effective in boosting output, because people behave differently when inflation is thought to be a part of the economic furniture. Moreover expectations of continuing inflation, once they had developed, proved to be fairly stubborn, which tended to constrain the ability of monetary policy to support the economy when demand was weak. But by the same token, something we observe today is that when expectations are anchored at appropriately low levels, monetary policy has more flexibility. Policy makers have room to be a little more tolerant, for example, of a decline in the exchange rate. Our own experience in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis from 1997 was that in the face of a pronounced weakening in the exchange rate, inflation expectations remained quite well anchored. While inflation did increase temporarily as a result of the fall in the exchange rate, the likelihood of a persistent problem with inflation was low. Hence monetary policy was able to follow a fairly accommodative stance, in the face of a very weak international environment, rather than needing to tighten to safe-guard medium-term price stability. This would not have been possible in earlier times, and the extra flexibility made a considerable 
BIS Review 37/2003 3 difference to economic performance.2 So expectations matter, and it is not unreasonable to think that the efforts of policy makers to be clear about their goal of controlling inflation, and to act consistently with that goal, made a difference to the characteristics of the inflation process. That in turn has allowed policy some additional short-run flexibility. The question many have recently debated is whether there is now another sea change occurring in the inflation process every bit as profound as that which took place during the 1960s, but in the other direction. That is, is the prevailing problem in future going to be not inflation, but deflation? For my own country the answer is clearly (cid:145)no(cid:146), for the foreseeable future. Others are more qualified to answer for other countries. But either way, here again expectations will be important. While they are strongly held above zero, it will be easier for monetary policy to help get an economy out of an incipient deflation. Were expectations of deflation to become entrenched, on the other hand, policy would face a much more difficult task to remedy the situation. This highlights the importance of articulating the goals of policy as clearly as possible, so as to give expectations an anchor. For inflation targeting countries such as Australia, stressing the symmetry of the target is quite important in this context. Countries such as the US without a formal target have also indicated that there is an inflation rate so low as to be undesirable. Mere announcements are not in themselves enough, of course, and have to be backed up by credible policy actions, and in countries where chronically weak demand is already accompanied by flat or falling prices, not all of these actions will necessarily be in the realm of monetary policy. But to be clear that policy is seeking to maintain, or to return to, low but above zero inflation is probably a necessary, even if not sufficient, condition for adequate outcomes. Experience of previous periods of deflation in our own countries (admittedly not first hand for most of us here) and observation of Japan(cid:146)s travails in the past decade, also points to the importance of financial structure. This leads naturally into my third topic. Changes in financial structure There has rightly been much emphasis on corporate sector finances, and government finances, in most of the industrial countries for many years. One or both of these areas have created big problems in just about every country at one time or another, and in a number of countries the struggle to get public finances in order is set to continue for some time ahead. But one of the most striking areas of financial change in recent times has been the increased opportunity for households to adjust their financial positions, certainly in the English speaking countries. Access to credit has expanded remarkably over the past couple of decades. The structural decline in inflation has produced much lower nominal interest rates, and it is nominal rates which matter for households looking to borrow to finance a housing investment. At the same time, lenders find households less risky borrowers than companies. Both these factors are encouraging households to take on more leverage. Financial innovation also means there is much greater opportunity to collateralise assets. With the big run up in house prices which has occurred, there is a very large pool of potential collateral which has not as yet been tapped. And a fairly long period of relative economic stability - in Australia(cid:146)s case, a quite long expansion, now in its thirteenth year - has meant that people feel more comfortable with more leverage. In Australia(cid:146)s case, household gross assets are now about 8‰ times current income, compared with about 5 times in 1980, and about 6 times as recently as the mid 1990s. Financial assets have grown, but much of the increased wealth has been in the form of dwellings. Since 1997, the Australia-wide median price for an established house has doubled. At the same time Australian households are more indebted. The ratio of debt to income has risen, from a point well below that seen in comparable countries in the mid 1990s to now being towards the top of the range seen in like countries today. Leverage - the ratio of debt to assets - has not increased as fast as the ratio of debt to income (which implies that net worth has increased substantially) and it remains lower than in some other comparable countries, but even so it has increased noticeably. These trends show few signs, at present, of imminent change.                                                       2 It(cid:146)s true that generally lower pass through of exchange rate changes to inflation has also helped in instances like the one I mention here - though I can(cid:146)t help feeling that the low inflation environment generally, and the associated set of expectations, have been important in driving that result. 
4 BIS Review 37/2003 We are yet to see the full ramifications of this structural change in household behaviour and balance sheets. The fact that balance sheets are so much bigger presumably means that changes in wealth are likely to matter more, relative to changes in things like current income, than they used to in determining the course of household spending over the business cycle. Secondly, higher leverage means that negative shocks to income are more likely to be amplified as they work their way through the economic system. Moreover, leverage may yet increase a good deal further, since the as-yet-untapped equity in the housing stock is still very large, and the capacity to access it is growing. And thirdly, of course, higher leverage means that monetary policy(cid:146)s impact via its effect on the behaviour of borrowers will be bigger than in the past - especially in a country like Australia where the majority of household debt is at floating rates. The asset price channel of policy might also end up being bigger. We have watched these developments with rather mixed feelings. For some years, the most plausible explanation for the trends I have just described was that there were good fundamental reasons for a change in households(cid:146) balance sheets. Households had for various reasons been constrained to a position of relatively low borrowing, but when the various constraints were lifted, it was inevitable, perhaps even desirable, that there would be a period of strong growth in lending to households as they moved towards a new balance sheet equilibrium. From the mid 1990s until about 2001, this seemed the best story. But over the past year or two, we have become less confident that a sensible one-time balance sheet adjustment should still be continuing, and more concerned that an increasing number of households may be putting themselves in a position of vulnerability. This is, of course, our particular experience of the thorny question of monetary policy, debt and asset prices. Like other central banks we have grappled with the question of what, if any, response monetary policy ought to make to this situation and, like others, we have not found that question amenable to a straightforward answer. On the one hand, these developments are exerting some expansionary impetus to the economy at a time when global demand conditions are weak. To that extent, they are helpful in avoiding undue weakness in the Australian economy. On the other hand, the household sector(cid:146)s ability to cope with some future contractionary shock is probably being impaired, at the margin, as leverage continues to increase. While we do not think that there would be any significant financial sector fragility as a direct result of this increased debt even if house prices were to fall in the near term, we fear that there could still be significant general economic fall out if the economy is subject to some other shock, mainly because household consumption could retreat quite quickly. Dealing with all this is still very much a work in progress, but as I reflect on our own experience to date and that of others, a few observations come to mind. First, it is not very helpful to couch the discussion in terms of whether monetary policy should try to prick (cid:145)bubbles(cid:146). This tends to side-track discussion on to questions like whether we can confidently identify, indeed even define, (cid:145)bubbles(cid:146), and whether or not aggressive policy action is appropriate if we can. A more helpful way to set it out it is to think about the balance of risks facing the economy: is there something occurring which is increasingly likely to be a misalignment, a subsequent reversal of which could prove to be disruptive? And if so, is there some monetary policy course which, while possibly involving some short-run cost to economic activity, would reduce the risk of bigger loss of economic activity later? Can we, to use the popular metaphor, buy some insurance and at what price? Second, any response by monetary policy is bound to be relatively moderate, because the uncertainty about the effect of policy on the dynamics of asset prices is considerable. That means that asset prices are still likely to move quite a bit in these episodes. Policy(cid:146)s ability to smooth things out is limited (which is something we already know as a general proposition anyway). Third, I am inclined to agree with recent work in the Bank of England that suggests that it is possible, at least in principle, to embed this discussion within a medium-term inflation targeting framework. For inflation targeting countries, it would certainly be a retrograde step in my view to be perceived as walking away from a framework which has for a decade delivered good results, in favour of some explicit pursuit of asset prices per se. Fourthly, even if we do bring asset prices and debt within the existing framework, we have a difficult problem in practice. Our approach to monetary policy, and our presentation of the objectives of monetary policy, are usually geared to horizons of a year or two. This holds for most explicit inflation targeters and also, I think, for those with more implicit goals. But asset price events and the balance sheet changes which accompany them usually do not occur neatly on that frequency. The really big ones can be once-in-a-generation developments. 
BIS Review 37/2003 5 If it were to be decided that monetary policy should be more responsive to asset price events, such an approach would have to be motivated by a broader and rather more long-term notion of financial and monetary stability than is in common use today. For those of us who use explicit inflation targets, for example, there would be a need to focus on a longer time horizon and perhaps somewhat greater toleration of short run deviations from the medium-term target. The presentational difficulties of this, while not necessarily insurmountable, are certainly not trivial. If we do need to move in the direction of giving asset price and debt developments more weight in the conduct of monetary policy than hitherto, we need to educate our respective communities about these issues. That education process is probably a good thing anyway, regardless of policy intentions. Conclusion Discussion about these matters is doubtless set to continue. It is pretty certain that structural change will always be with us. Central banks have routinely to be on the look out for the sorts of changes which, while leaving ultimate objectives unchanged, might alter the short term tactics of policy settings. But I think that financial structure changes, which often occur over longish periods, will probably be for central banks the most difficult ones to handle. 
  Zdeněk Tůma: The role of rules in public finance Introductory remarks by Mr Zdeněk Tůma, Governor of the Czech National Bank, at the International Institute for Public Finance, Prague, 25 August 2003. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, It is a great pleasure and honour for me to join the previous distinguished speakers with some introductory remarks to this high level conference. As a central banker, I would not pretend to be an expert in specific details of public finance. Therefore, I have chosen a general topic that is common to both central banking and fiscal policy. That topic is the application of rules in stabilisation policies Over the last twenty years, the philosophy of stabilisation policies has evolved substantially. The rules-versus-discretion debate has led to a preference for a rule-based approach to policy making. This has been supported by the negative historical experience with discretionary policies, as well as by a realisation that successful public policies in first place have to be credible and transparent, so as to direct private expectations in a desirable way. In terms of the actual institutional design, monetary policy has played a leading role, the shift to greater central bank independence with a clear anti-inflationary mandate marking this trend. Nonetheless, three serious questions have emerged as a result. First, whether independence and reliance on strict policy rules has too high costs in terms of macroeconomic instability. Second, how to co-ordinate monetary policy with governmental actions to make a consistent policy mix. And third, how to compensate for the democratic deficit of technocratic monetary policy decision-making. Concerning the first issue, empirical research has found out that greater central bank independence is on average associated with lower inflation, but not with higher volatility. This (cid:147)free lunch(cid:148) was a bit surprising in the light of the (cid:147)conservative central banker theory(cid:148). It reflects the fact that the actual institutional and policy design has evolved over time to guarantee that the mandate to achieve low inflation is not interpreted rigidly. In fact, most central bankers pay attention to real economic developments in their policies. In the last decade, this fact has been formally and institutionally reflected in the (cid:147)flexible(cid:148) inflation-targeting regime. This regime is often described as (cid:147)constrained discretion(cid:148), meaning that it aims at making the monetary policy-making constrained by understandable procedures and at the same time flexible in responding to unforeseen shocks. As far as the democratic deficit is concerned, this issue has been addressed by moving to greater transparency and accountability of central banks. The burden of proof in central banks(cid:146) communication has shifted over the last two decades. At present, it is necessary to give convincing arguments if one thinks that the central bank should not give out some information, rather than to argue why something should be revealed. This has been a significant shift in the central banks(cid:146) mentality. Regarding the issue of communication and co-operation between the central bank and government, no universal solution has been found so far. There are many institutional arrangements, ranging from formal contracts between the government and central bank to non-formalised consultations between the two bodies. The efficiency of such arrangements, however, depends in most cases on their actual implementation. Now I come to the fiscal sphere. A trend towards rule-based policy can be observed here as well, albeit with some time lag and in a different form compared with monetary policy. The difference originates mainly from the fact that fiscal policy is by definition a political issue with strong redistribution aspects, which cannot easily be mandated out of direct democratic control. The independence solution is thus not readily available here, even though there have been such suggestions in the economic literature. This contributes to the fact that no single elegant model has yet been found in practice. The existing rules usually take the form of self-imposed constraints, such as legal constraints (balanced-budget acts in some countries) or international treaties (S&G Pact). Apart from this difference, though, the aim to implement rules stems from the same reasons and faces similar challenges as in monetary policy. The idea that policy should be designed in a way that does not put short-term political gains above the longer-term interests of society, that takes into account its impact on private expectations, and that is transparent to the public, is common to the monetary and 
  fiscal spheres. Similarly, the rules must also address the issue of their costs in terms of macroeconomic stabilisation and finding a proper policy mix. The teething problems with the Stability and Growth Pact have been an example of these challenges. One of the key motivations of the Pact was an effort to avoid free riding by national governments in a multinational currency area. In other words, the desire to achieve a proper policy mix was present at the birth of this rule. In spite of that, the Pact is now criticised for being too rigid, not allowing for a proper policy response in times of distress, and thus ultimately leading to poor real economic performance. This naturally undermines its credibility and supports calls for various (cid:147)escape clauses(cid:148), to use the inflation-targeting terminology. The Pact is thus fighting the same battle that the conservative central banker was some time ago. It should evolve towards a (cid:147)constrained discretion(cid:148) system that will fulfil its major goals - sustainability, credibility and co-ordination of stabilisation policies - yet at the same time be sufficiently flexible to allow for proper responses in adverse periods. It has yet to convince policy-makers and the public that it can deliver the lunch without them having to pay too high a price for it in terms of cyclical stabilisation. So far, the Pact has seemed to be losing the battle. This is somewhat unfair, as the adverse period came before most EU countries had achieved the target of balanced structural budgets, which reduced their manoeuvring space considerably. In a sense, the Pact is thus paying a price for being too lax in the previous period, i.e. not defining a binding convergence path to the target, rather than a price for being too rigid. On the other hand, I also agree with many of the critiques and proposed adjustments to the Pact. Defining a convergence path, looking at structural rather than headline budgets, taking into account public debt levels and sustainability of public finance, etc., are certainly steps towards achieving the (cid:147)constrained discretion(cid:148) in fiscal policy I am talking about. The adverse period should thus be taken as an opportunity to modify the rule in a favourable way, rather than as a reason to scrap it completely. I believe that pursuing this opportunity will secure a future for the S&G Pact. I am convinced that some rule of this kind will always have to be in place in the eurozone, and not only because of its multinational nature, but also due to the general advantages of rules. Let me also mention briefly the importance of the S&G Pact for the Czech Republic and other EU accession countries. The Czech Republic, like many other CECs, is facing the problem of rising budget deficits. This is partly a reflection of the previous transition costs, but these are gradually fading away. The root of the problem is structural, similar to the challenges faced by advanced EU countries as well - population ageing, an overgenerous social system, etc. At present, most countries are preparing consolidation programmes aimed at reversing the negative trends. Usually, the ambition is to bring the public deficits close to, or below, the 3% Maastricht level. For example, the target in the Czech Republic is not to exceed 4% of GDP in 2006. Nonetheless, it has not yet been fully appreciated that upon EU accession, the Stability and Growth Pact will become relevant to the new member states. Admittedly, the application of sanctions will be postponed until a country becomes a member of the eurozone. But even if a country is not a subject to sanctions, as a member of the EU club it should have in place at least a credible programme towards achieving its objectives. Moreover, if a country targets relatively early eurozone entry, it should first create a sufficient safety margin above the 3% deficit limit to be insured against distress - i.e. it should avoid the mistake that has been made by some of the current eurozone members concerning the S&G Pact. I hope that the uncertainty surrounding the Pact(cid:146)s future would not be viewed as an excuse for delaying necessary fiscal and structural adjustments. Even if redefined in a more flexible way, it is quite clear that the structural deficits currently observed in many of the CECs will not be tolerable under the Pact, as they will not pass the sustainability and policy mix tests. Therefore, the existence of the S&G Pact makes the case for fiscal consolidation even more appealing than it might look at first sight. To conclude, let me wish you a very fruitful discussion during this conference, as well as a very pleasant stay in Prague. Thank you for your attention. 
 BIS Review 37/2003 1 Alan Greenspan: Monetary policy under uncertainty Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, 29 August 2003. *      *      * Uncertainty is not just an important feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape. As a consequence, the conduct of monetary policy in the United States at its core involves crucial elements of risk management, a process that requires an understanding of the many sources of risk and uncertainty that policymakers face and the quantifying of those risks when possible. It also entails devising, in light of those risks, a strategy for policy directed at maximizing the probabilities of achieving over time our goal of price stability and the maximum sustainable economic growth that we associate with it. Toward that objective, we have drawn on the work of analysts who over the past half century have devoted much effort to improving our understanding of the economy and its monetary transmission mechanism. A critical result has been the identification of a relatively small set of key relationships that, taken together, provide a useful approximation of our economy(cid:146)s dynamics. Such an approximation underlies the statistical models that we at the Federal Reserve employ to assess the likely influence of our policy decisions. Despite the extensive efforts to capture and quantify these key macroeconomic relationships, our knowledge about many of the important linkages is far from complete and in all likelihood will always remain so. Every model, no matter how detailed or how well designed conceptually and empirically, is a vastly simplified representation of the world that we experience with all its intricacies on a day-to-day basis. Consequently, even with large advances in computational capabilities and greater comprehension of economic linkages, our knowledge base is barely able to keep pace with the ever-increasing complexity of our global economy. Given this state of flux, it is apparent that a prominent shortcoming of our structural models is that, for ease in parameter estimation, not only are economic responses presumed fixed through time, but they are generally assumed to be linear. An assumption of linearity may be adequate for estimating average relationships, but few expect that an economy will respond linearly to every aberration. Although some nonlinearities are accounted for in our modeling exercises, we cannot be certain that our simulations provide reasonable approximations of the economy(cid:146)s behavior in times of large idiosyncratic shocks. Recent history has also reinforced the perception that the relationships underlying the economy(cid:146)s structure change over time in ways that are difficult to anticipate. This has been most apparent in the changing role of our standard measure of the money stock. Because an interest rate, by definition, is the exchange rate for money against non-monies, money obviously is central to monetary policy. However, in the past two decades, what constitutes money has been obscured by the introduction of technologies that have facilitated the proliferation of financial products and have altered the empirical relationship between economic activity and what we define as money, and in doing so has inhibited the keying of monetary policy to the control of the measured money stock.1 Another example of ongoing structural change relates to innovations in mortgage finance. This includes the elimination of Regulation Q, the emergence of variable rate loans, the growth of the mortgage-backed securities market, and improvements in the efficiency of the credit application process. These developments appear to have buffered activity in the housing market to some extent from shifts in monetary policy. But some of the same innovations in housing finance have opened new avenues of policy influence on economic behavior. For example, households have been able with                                                       1 Nonetheless, in the tradition of Milton Friedman, it is difficult to disregard the long-run relationship between money and prices. In particular, since 1959 unit money supply, the ratio of M2 to real GDP, has increased at an annual rate of 3.7 percent and GDP prices have risen 3.8 percent per year. (A consistent time-series for M2 is available back to 1959. Among other changes, deposit data at a daily frequency were incorporated in measures of the monetary aggregates as of that date.) 
 2 BIS Review 37/2003 increasing ease to extract equity from their homes, and this doubtless has helped support consumer spending in recent years, complementing the traditional effects of monetary policy. * * * What then are the implications of this largely irreducible uncertainty for the conduct of monetary policy? A well-known proposition is that, under a very restrictive set of assumptions, uncertainty has no bearing on the actions that policymakers might choose, and so they should proceed as if they know the precise structure of the economy.2 These assumptions--linearity in the structure of the economy, perfect knowledge of the interest-sensitivity of aggregate spending and other so-called slope parameters, and a very specific attitude of policymakers toward risk--are never met in the real world. Indeed, given our inevitably incomplete knowledge about key structural aspects of our ever-changing economy and the sometimes asymmetric costs or benefits of particular outcomes, a central bank seeking to maximize its probability of achieving its goals is driven, I believe, to a risk-management approach to policy. By this I mean that policymakers need to consider not only the most likely future path for the economy but also the distribution of possible outcomes about that path. They then need to reach a judgment about the probabilities, costs, and benefits of the various possible outcomes under alternative choices for policy. A policy action that is calculated to be optimal based on a simulation of one particular model may not, in fact, be optimal once the full extent of uncertainty in the policymaking environment is taken into account. In general, it is entirely possible that different policies will exhibit different degrees of robustness with respect to the true underlying structure of the economy. For example, policy A might be judged as best advancing the policymakers(cid:146) objectives, conditional on a particular model of the economy, but might also be seen as having relatively severe adverse consequences if the true structure of the economy turns out to be other than the one assumed. On the other hand, policy B might be somewhat less effective in advancing the policy objectives under the assumed baseline model but might be relatively benign in the event that the structure of the economy turns out to differ from the baseline. These considerations have inclined Federal Reserve policymakers toward policies that limit the risk of deflation even though the baseline forecasts from most conventional models would not project such an event. * * * At times, policy practitioners operating under a risk-management paradigm may be led to undertake actions intended to provide some insurance against the emergence of especially adverse outcomes. For example, following the Russian debt default in the fall of 1998, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) eased policy despite our perception that the economy was expanding at a satisfactory pace and that, even without a policy initiative, was likely to continue to do so.3 We eased policy because we were concerned about the low-probability risk that the default might severely disrupt domestic and international financial markets, with outsized adverse feedback to the performance of the U.S. economy. The product of a low-probability event and a severe outcome, should it occur, was judged a larger threat than the possible adverse consequences of insurance that might prove unnecessary. The cost--or premium--of the financial-contagion insurance was the associated increase in the risk of higher inflation at some future date. This cost was viewed as relatively low at the time, largely because increased competition, driven by globalization, thwarted employers(cid:146) ability to pass through higher labor costs into prices. Given the Russian default, the benefits of the unusual policy action were deemed to outweigh its costs. Such a cost-benefit analysis is an ongoing part of monetary policy decisionmaking, and tips more toward monetary ease when the fallout from a contractionary event such as the Russian default seems increasingly likely and its occurrence seems especially costly. Conversely, in 1979, with inflation threatening to get out of control, the cost to the economy of a major withdrawal of liquidity was judged far less than the potential long-term consequences of leaving accelerating prices unaddressed.                                                       2 William Brainard, (cid:147)Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy,(cid:148) American Economic Review, May 1967, pp. 411-25. 3 See minutes of the FOMC meeting of September 29, 1998. 
 BIS Review 37/2003 3 * * * In implementing a risk-management approach to policy, we must confront the fact that only a limited number of risks can be quantified with any confidence. And even these risks are generally quantifiable only if we accept the assumption that the future will replicate the past. Other risks are essentially unquantifiable--representing Knightian uncertainty, if you will--because we may not fully appreciate even the full range of possibilities, let alone each possibility(cid:146)s likelihood. As a result, risk management often involves significant judgment on the part of policymakers, as we evaluate the risks of different events and the probability that our actions will alter those risks. For such judgment, we policymakers, rather than relying solely on the specific linkages expressed in our formal models, have tended to draw from broader, though less mathematically precise, hypotheses of how the world works. For example, inference of how market participants might respond to a monetary policy initiative may need to reference past behavior during a period only roughly comparable to the current situation. Some critics have argued that such an approach to policy is too undisciplined--judgmental, seemingly discretionary, and difficult to explain. The Federal Reserve should, some conclude, attempt to be more formal in its operations by tying its actions solely to the prescriptions of a formal policy rule. That any approach along these lines would lead to an improvement in economic performance, however, is highly doubtful. Our problem is not the complexity of our models but the far greater complexity of a world economy whose underlying linkages appear to be in a continual state of flux. Rules by their nature are simple, and when significant and shifting uncertainties exist in the economic environment, they cannot substitute for risk-management paradigms, which are far better suited to policymaking. Were we to introduce an interest rate rule, how would we judge the meaning of a rule that posits a rate far above or below the current rate? Should policymakers adjust the current rate to that suggested by the rule? Should we conclude that this deviation is normal variance and disregard the signal? Or should we assume that the parameters of the rule are misspecified and adjust them to fit the current rate? Given errors in our underlying data, coupled with normal variance, we might not know the correct course of action for a considerable time. Partly for these reasons, the prescriptions of formal interest rate rules are best viewed only as helpful adjuncts to policy, as indeed many proponents of policy rules have suggested. * * * In summary then, monetary policy based on risk management appears to be the most useful regime by which to conduct policy. The increasingly intricate economic and financial linkages in our global economy, in my judgment, compel such a conclusion. Over the next couple of days, we will have the opportunity to consider in greater detail some important changes in our economic and financial systems and their implications for the conduct of monetary policy. As always, I look forward to an engaging discussion. 
 BIS Review 36/2003 1 Ewart Williams: The Central Bank and preparations for integrated supervision Address by Mr Ewart Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, at a Breakfast Seminar hosted by the Association of Trinidad and Tobago Insurance Companies and the Trinidad and Tobago Insurance Institute, Port of Spain, 8 July 2003. *      *      * Let me first thank the Executive of the Association of Trinidad and Tobago Insurance Companies (ATTIC), the Trinidad and Tobago Insurance Institute (TTII), as well as the entire membership for the invitation to address you at this Breakfast Meeting. I would hope that this is the start of a process of dialogue and consultation between the Central Bank, earmarked to become the regulator, and all the stakeholders in the industry. This (cid:147)integrated supervision project(cid:148) which essentially focuses on bringing the insurance companies and pension funds under the supervisory authority of the Central Bank is in principle part of a larger strategy geared towards reinforcing safety and soundness while at the same time preparing our financial system to play a pivotal role in the future development of the economy. This broader financial sector strategy involves, inter alia, improving the regulatory framework governing mutual funds and credit unions, strengthening the Securities and Exchange Commission and building an efficient capital market that would mobilize and channel savings into long term investment. The planning for the Integrated Supervision Project started several years ago and was supported by a team of Canadian Consultants (Lawrie Savage and Associates) who worked closely with the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance and major stakeholders in the Insurance Industry. But all this is by way of background. What I would like to do this morning is: (i) Take some time to explain the rationale behind the impending shift of supervisory authority for the insurance industry from the Office of the Supervisor of Insurance (OSI) to the Central Bank; (ii) Tell you what we have been doing in preparation for this shift; and (iii) Clarify what you can expect from us. You should know that very many countries, both developed and developing, have moved to integrate their specialised regulatory agencies into a single entity. In a few cases the single entity has been outside the Central Bank; the best known of these cases is the United Kingdom which has a Financial Services Authority (FSA) which regulates all financial institutions. The FSA is however separate and apart from the Bank of England. There is a variant of this model, for instance in Canada and Australia, where the supervision of the banking and insurance sector is done by one regulatory agency outside the Central Bank, but where there are other regulatory agencies for other financial sub-sectors. In Jamaica, the Central Bank continues to regulate and supervise the commercial banks and non-banks, but the rest of the financial system is supervised by a separate entity, the Financial Services Commission (FSC). Our Government has indicated that bringing the insurance industry and pension funds within the regulatory ambit of the Central Bank is a first phase and that over the longer term consideration is to be given to a Super Regulatory Agency which will supervise all financial services (credit unions, the securities industry etc.). What is the rationale for a single regulatory entity? (i) The increasing complexity of the financial services industry, as evidenced by the emergence of financial conglomerates, requires a strong institution to supervise the conglomerate as a whole, rather than a series of agencies supervising parts of the complex. (ii) Many products and services offered to consumers by the insurance industry (or the securities industry, for that matter) are becoming difficult to distinguish from those offered by deposit taking institutions. Accordingly, integrated supervision avoids the different regulatory treatment of similar products: it eliminates gaps in consumer protection and reduces the scope for regulatory arbitrage. 
 2 BIS Review 36/2003 (iii) Trinidad and Tobago, like most other developing countries is unfortunately short on human capital. The creation of a single agency avoids the problem of spreading our limited human resources too thinly among different specialized agencies. In addition to these reasons, the Central Bank sees integrated supervision as a way of facilitating the task of maintaining the soundness of the financial system. Recent examples worldwide have shown that weaknesses or breakdowns in the financial system, occurring at various points in the chain can lead to widespread economic crisis. We don(cid:146)t have to look too far: we have as ample evidence the case of Jamaica, where the collapse of the financial system in the mid 1990(cid:146)s is estimated to have cost taxpayers some 10% of GDP. In discussing some of the factors leading up to the financial crisis in Jamaica, the Chairman of FINSAC (the government agency charged with resolving the crisis) pointed to the country(cid:146)s indigenous financial sector entrepreneurs whom he thought were, (and I quote): (cid:1)(cid:2)too eager to get rich; (cid:1)(cid:2)too bullish in risking other people(cid:146)s money; (cid:1)(cid:2)too eager to start at the top; (cid:1)(cid:2)too competitive with one another in demonstrating the trappings of success, reflected in the rush to form larger and more complex groups; and (cid:1)(cid:2)too prone to bend prudential norms and regulations. The FINSAC head also blamed the crisis on Jamaica(cid:146)s failure to adequately regulate and supervise the financial sector. He noted, in particular, that the Office of the Superintendent of Insurance, was not adequately staffed and as a department within the Ministry of Finance did not appear to have the stature needed to deal (cid:147)at eye level(cid:148) with the moguls of the insurance industry. This was the Jamaican situation in the 1990s. It may not be our present circumstance, but let(cid:146)s be frank, we have our own skeletons and we should learn from the Jamaican experience and seek to put our house in order. In the context of the integrated supervision project conducted by the Lawrie Savage group, diagnostic studies on several insurance companies were conducted. The data obtained from these studies, as well as information from the Office of the Supervisor of Insurance, suggest that while several companies operate in conformity with the statutory requirements, there are too many cases, similar to the Jamaican example, where the prudential norms and regulatory requirements are flouted. The evidence suggests that there are far too many cases of chronic statutory fund deficits, late filing of returns, inadequate reinsurance and other areas of non-compliance. The diagnostic studies also indicate that the investment strategy of some companies requires stricter regulatory attention, in part because of limited portfolio diversification and related party transactions. The latest Insurance Industry Report makes reference to the need for companies to upgrade corporate governance and risk management structures. It also identifies market conduct in the industry as another matter of concern. In this regard, there are clearly too many instances of inadequate and delayed settlement of legitimate claims of policyholders as well as questionable, if not, unfair and deceptive marketing practices. The capacity of intermediaries to competently fulfill their role is also an issue that reportedly comes up with some frequency. Specifically, there is a perception that the training of intermediaries does not always keep pace with the evolution of products offered by some companies. These are but some of the issues that call for stronger regulation and more focused supervision. And so, what are we doing? As you know, Cabinet has approved that the supervision of insurance companies and pension funds be integrated with that of banking institutions under the authority of the existing Bank Inspection Department of the Central Bank. The legislation to effect this transfer is currently being finalized and is expected to be presented to Parliament by the end of July or early August. In the meantime preparations for the transfer are proceeding apace. 
 BIS Review 36/2003 3 Internal re-organisation (cid:1)(cid:2)A new structure in the Bank Inspection Department has been adopted to deal with these expanded supervisory responsibilities. (cid:1)(cid:2)The staff of our Bank Inspection Department has been increased, through the recruitment of new graduates with finance and accounting qualifications. This cadre of recruits has undergone intensive training in insurance supervision. {Incidentally, experience has shown that people who have worked in the insurance industry make the best insurance supervisors and regulators, so be on notice that we are in the market for suitable insurance staff.} (cid:1)(cid:2)We intend to supplement our domestic resources with senior-level technical assistance from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, Canada. Insurance supervision is a highly technical and involved business and the Canadians are recognized to have developed a high level of expertise in this area. We are in the process of incorporating some of the staff of the Office of the Supervisor of Insurance of the Ministry of Finance into the Bank Inspection Department of the Central Bank. A major focus of the Central Bank will be preparing for the updating of the Insurance Act (1980) Because of rapid financial sector innovation, the Central Bank is in the process of introducing amendments to the Financial Institutions Act (FIA) to strengthen the Bank(cid:146)s ability to effectively regulate and supervise the deposit taking institutions - for example, to deal with the new realities of increased cross-border lending; to conduct consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates; and generally, to strengthen the hand of the regulator to ensure compliance. It is exactly the same thing that we need to do with the insurance industry. The current insurance legislation (the Insurance Act 1980) was framed at a time when insurance companies operated in an entirely different environment. Proposals put forward to amend this legislation during the 1990(cid:146)s, to keep pace with industry changes, were not enacted for various reasons. In our view, there is now urgent need for new insurance legislation, to deal with the reality of the current day industry and to give the Central Bank, as regulator, the required level of authority and empowerment to act effectively to strengthen and ensure the safety and soundness of the insurance sector. The new legislation should also bring the supervisory framework in Trinidad and Tobago into closer compliance with international insurance core principles, in the context of a local environment. A first draft of new insurance legislation was prepared last year by the Canadian consultants, (Lawrie Savage and Associates) with local legal support. There is much disagreement as to the amount of industry input in the draft and there is also disagreement about the opportunity that was provided for local stakeholders(cid:146) comment. My understanding is that the local industry has several issues with the draft and that a Working Committee of ATTIC is in the process of articulating these concerns and making recommendations. I gave this commitment to the Executive of ATTIC, when we met at the Central Bank a couple of months ago and I am repeating the commitment again - that the Central Bank would work closely with the industry, through ATTIC, to formulate legislation that is appropriate to the local environment, that is feasible to implement, but also and very importantly, that is in line with international best practices. We cannot be marching towards developed country status and acquiesce into outdated financial sector legislation befitting the 1980(cid:146)s. We are ready to begin to work with ATTIC on this new legislation, as soon as the working group is ready with its comments. I(cid:146)m sure that, as reasonable people, we will arrive at the best insurance legislation for Trinidad and Tobago. In terms of the need to adopt international best practices, we feel strongly that the new legislation should cover a number of critical areas including: (cid:1)(cid:2)adequate minimum capital requirements (cid:1)(cid:2)modern standards of corporate governance (cid:1)(cid:2)restrictions on related party transactions (cid:1)(cid:2)new standards of market conduct (cid:1)(cid:2)corporate transactions (mergers, transfers of business, etc.) 
 4 BIS Review 36/2003 (cid:1)(cid:2)financial reporting and records (cid:1)(cid:2)enhanced powers for the Supervisor (cid:1)(cid:2)clear exit rules Let me turn to the kinds of changes that could be expected under the new supervisory regime When the transfer of supervisory authority is effected, supervision will continue to be on the basis of the existing Insurance Act. However, we envisage several significant changes in our operational approach. Firstly, on-site examinations and continuous monitoring would supplement the current of off-site reporting and (cid:147)hands-off(cid:148) supervision. It is important to note that under the current legislation the OSI had the authority to do on-site supervision, but no inspections have ever taken place, partly because of resource constraints. The Central Bank staff has the experience with on-site supervision of the commercial banks for several years, and training has been provided to the new staff that has been recruited to work in insurance supervision. We intend to make supervisory insurance training an on-going activity. Secondly, while supervision will continue to involve the monitoring of legal compliance and critical performance ratios, as we currently do with the commercial banks, we intend to incorporate the risk-based approach into our operational policies and procedures vis-(cid:224)-vis the insurance industry. I am certain that many insurance companies have already incorporated risk management techniques in their operations and are very familiar with the approach. In summary, as regulator, our approach will be to identify areas of higher risk in each institution(cid:146)s operations and to work with the management to reduce these risks to acceptable levels. The risk-based supervisory approach is recognized to be ideal for identifying problems at an early stage rather than attempting to fix them after they have developed. This approach will place focus on corporate governance requiring the Board of Directors and Senior Management to take full responsibility that their corporations operate in accordance with sound business and financial practices. I would like to emphasise that with the risk-based approach our supervisory teams will need to have access to senior management to discuss business strategy and future plans. That(cid:146)s what we currently do with the banks and that(cid:146)s what we would expect to do with the insurance companies. Procedures and policy manuals to allow for risk-based supervision and regulatory compliance are being finalized. The Central Bank is also developing new prudential and solvency requirements for the insurance industry that conform to best practice. We plan to engage the industry in consultations on these matters. We propose to commence these on-site visits soon after assuming our responsibilities and after we have conducted a number of outreach sessions so that the industry is prepared for the process. Obviously, with some thirty (30) insurance companies we would need to start with a small carefully selected sample. As we currently do with the commercial banks, the findings of each on-site examination will be documented in a formal report which will be discussed with the management of the institution before we finalize and submit to the Minister of Finance. The report will also include recommendations for correcting the deficiencies identified, within specified timeframes. In closing, let me re-affirm that we at the Central Bank are looking forward to the challenge that the transfer of supervisory responsibility will surely bring. We are committed to working with the insurance industry in an atmosphere of understanding and mutual respect, to have integrated supervision implemented in an effective manner that benefits the industry and the economy as a whole. Our mission is the same as yours: we want an industry that adequately satisfies the expectations of policy holders: that instills confidence and respect: that contributes to the strengthening of savings and investment, in the interest of long term economic viability. Let me assure you that the objective of the Central Bank as regulator is not to stand in the way of structural changes in the industry. Insurance companies - like all other firms in the financial sector - need to respond constructively to changing conditions; this could mean more mergers, more product innovation and the taking on of new risks. 
 BIS Review 36/2003 5 Well-managed institutions in strong financial condition should have great freedom. The Central Bank will give weak companies time to manage themselves back to financial health and will also develop appropriate exit strategies for those which can no longer be viable. I invite the stakeholders in the industry - ATTIC, TTII, the Brokers Association - to work with the Central Bank to meet these objectives. It(cid:146)s in all our interest to have strong and effective regulation that meets international standards. Stakeholders can and should bring peer pressure to bear on companies that do not play by the rules or flaunt best practices, since a few non-compliant operations can present industry-wide risks or even threaten the stability of the financial system. Thanks again for inviting me. 
 BIS Review 36/2003 1 Bimal Jalan: Exchange rate management - an emerging consensus? Address by Dr Bimal Jalan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 14th National Assembly of the Forex Association of India, Mumbai, 14 August 2003. *      *      * I am very happy to be here with you on the occasion of the 14th National Assembly. This annual gathering of our Forex specialists is a very special occasion for everyone interested in the evolution of forex market in India - not only the dealers and market participants, but also the RBI, Government and outside experts interested in appropriate macro-economic management for higher growth and the greater good of our people. It provides all of us with an opportunity to review recent developments in forex markets against the background of global developments in a fast changing world economic scenario and modify our own policy and approach. I am, therefore, delighted to be with you once again. As you know, RBI is in regular touch, formally and informally, with your association to review market developments. My senior colleagues and I have also benefited from your advice and, as you are aware, a large number of measures have now been put in place to liberalise our regulations in respect of foreign exchange transactions. With your permission, today, on this special occasion, I would like to deal briefly with some of the longer term policy issues in respect of exchange rate and reserves management. Several of these issues have also been debated in various international fora. In the context of upsurge in our reserves in recent years and the appreciating trend in the external value of the rupee, there has also been considerable domestic discussion of these issues. You will recall that the last time I had addressed your Association was in December 2000 - nearly 2‰ years ago - on the occasion of the 21st Asia Pacific Forex Congress. That meeting was taking place against the background of the Asian crisis in 1997-98. The Asian region had just come out of the forex crisis of a very destabilising kind. I had used that occasion to review the on-going debate on management of the external sector, particularly the appropriate exchange rate systems, the appropriate intervention policy, and the foreign exchange reserve policy. Soon after the Asian crisis, these subjects had figured very prominently in the discussions on International Financial Architecture in various fora, such as IMF, the World bank, G20, Financial Stability Forum and the Bank for International Settlements. At that time, while reviewing the state of the debate, I had mentioned that a worldwide consensus on several issues was still evolving. Today, while (cid:147)consensus(cid:148) may be too strong a word, I believe that there is a fair degree of convergence in the dominant international opinion among experts and various specialised institutions on many of these issues. Let me summarise some of the main conclusions which have emerged in the last 2 or 3 years on the management of the external sector. Once again, I should emphasise that, given widely different economies of the world that we are talking about, there is no global consensus as such or unity of views. However, at present, as I see it, there is certainly a (cid:147)dominant(cid:148) view of what is right and appropriate, which is increasingly commanding international acceptance. Thus, on the question of the appropriate exchange rate regime, a fixed exchange rate regime (even with a Currency Board) is clearly out of favour. The Brazilian and Argentinian crisis, after the Asian crisis, came as a rude shock. Even strong Currency Board type arrangements of a fixed peg vis-(cid:224)-vis dollar were found to be unviable. You will recall that, soon after the Asian crisis, the widely accepted theoretical position was that a country had the choice of either giving up monetary independence and setting up a Currency Board or giving up the stable currency objective and letting the exchange rate float freely so that monetary policy could then be directed to the objectives of inflation control. There is a shift in this paradigm. The possibility of having a viable fixed rate mechanism has been generally discarded, and the dominant view now is that, for most countries floating or flexible rates are the only sustainable way of having a less crisis-prone exchange rate regime. In regard to the desirable degree of flexibility in exchange rates, opinions and practices vary. But a completely (cid:147)free(cid:148) float, without intervention, is clearly out of favour except perhaps in respect of a few global or reserve currencies. And, in respect of these currencies also (say, Euro and Dollar), concerns are expressed at the highest levels if the movement is sharp in either direction - recently, for example, when Euro was strengthening at a fast pace. Studies by the IMF and several experts also show that by far, the most common exchange rate regime adopted by countries, including industrial countries, is not 
 2 BIS Review 36/2003 a free float. Most of the countries have adopted intermediate regimes of various types, such as, managed floats with no pre-announced path, and independent floats with foreign exchange intervention moderating the rate of change and preventing undue fluctuations. By and large, barring a few, countries have (cid:147)managed(cid:148) floats and Central Banks intervene periodically. This has also been true of industrial countries. In the past, the U.S., the EU and the U.K. have also intervened at one time or another. Thus, irrespective of the pure theoretical position in favour of a free float, the external value of the currency continues to be a matter of concern to most countries, and most central banks. The reason why intervention by most central banks in forex markets has become necessary from time to time is primarily because of two reasons. A fundamental change that has taken place in recent years is the importance of capital flows in determining exchange rate movements as against trade deficits and economic growth, which were important in the earlier days. The latter do matter, but only over a period of time. Capital flows, on the other hand, have become the primary determinants of exchange rate movements on a day-to-day basis. Secondly, unlike trade flows, capital flows in (cid:147)gross(cid:148) terms which affect exchange rate can be several times higher than (cid:147)net(cid:148) flows on any day. These are also much more sensitive to what everybody else is saying or doing than is the case with foreign trade or economic growth. Therefore, herding becomes unavoidable. I am sure you will agree that all dealers prefer to be wrong with everyone else rather than being wrong alone! A related issue, which is a corollary of the prevalent intermediate regimes in respect of exchange rates, concerns the need, if any, for foreign exchange reserves. In a regime of free float, it could be argued that there was really no need for reserves. If demand for foreign exchange is higher than supply, exchange rates will depreciate and equilibrate demand and supply over time. If supply exceeded demand, exchange rates will appreciate and sooner or later, the two will equalise at some price. However, today in the light of volatility induced by capital flows and the self-fulfilling expectations that this can generate, there is now a growing consensus that emerging market countries should, as a matter of policy, maintain (cid:147)adequate(cid:148) reserves. How adequacy is to be defined is also becoming clearer. Earlier, the rule used to be defined in terms of number of months of imports. Now, increasingly it is felt that reserves should at least be sufficient to cover likely variations in capital flows or the (cid:147)liquidity-at-risk(cid:148). (However, there is as yet no consensus on the upper limit for reserves. Even after an (cid:147)adequate(cid:148) level is reached, reserves may continue to increase if capital inflows are strong and central banks decide to intervene in order to moderate the degree of appreciation.) To sum up, it seems that the debate on appropriate policies relating to forex markets has now converged around some generally accepted views. Among these, as I mentioned are: (a) exchange rates should be flexible and not fixed or pegged; (b) countries should be able to intervene or manage exchange rates - to at least some degree - if movements are believed to be destablising in the short run; and (c) reserves should at least be sufficient to take care of fluctuations in capital flows and (cid:147)liquidity at risk(cid:148). Let me now briefly deal with some issues of practical importance in the management of forex markets in India, which have figured prominently in the media and expert commentary. I will first take up 2 or 3 matters which are rather straight-forward and on which our policy stance is also equally (cid:147)unambiguous(cid:148) and clear-cut. Then I will move to, and conclude with, a discussion of the appropriate exchange rate policy for India in the current situation. A frequently discussed question is about Capital Account Convertibility (CAS), i.e. when is India going to move to full CAC? As you are aware, we have already liberalized and deregulated a whole host of capital account transactions. It is probably fair to say that for most transactions which are required for business or personal convenience, the rupee is, for all practical purposes, convertible. In cases, where specific permission is required for transactions above a high monetary ceiling, this permission is also generally forthcoming. It is also the declared policy of the Government and the RBI to continue with this process of liberalization. In this sense, Capital Account Convertibility continues to be a desirable objective for all investment and business related transactions and India should be able to achieve this objective in not too distant a future. There are, however, two areas where we would need to be extremely cautious - one is unlimited access to short-term external commercial borrowing for meeting working capital and other domestic requirements. The other area concerns the question of providing unrestricted freedom to domestic residents to convert their domestic bank deposits and idle assets (such as, real estate), in response to market developments or exchange rate expectations. In respect of short-term external commercial borrowings, there is already a strong international consensus that emerging markets should keep such borrowings relatively small in relation to their total 
 BIS Review 36/2003 3 external debt or reserves. Many of the financial crises in the 1990s occurred because the short-term debt was excessive. When times were good, such debt was easily accessible. The position, however, changed dramatically in times of external pressure. All creditors who could redeem the debt did so within a very short period, causing extreme domestic financial vulnerability. The occurrence of such a possibility has to be avoided, and we would do well to continue with our policy of keeping access to short-term debt limited as a conscious policy at all times - good and bad. So far as the free convertibility of domestic assets by residents is concerned, the issues are somewhat more fundamental. It has to do with the differential impact of (cid:147)stock(cid:148) and (cid:147)flows(cid:148) in determining external vulnerability. The day-to-day movement in exchange rates is determined by (cid:147)flows(cid:148) of funds, i.e. by demand and supply of spot or forward transactions in the market. Now, suppose the exchange rate is depreciating unduly sharply (for whatever reasons) and is expected to continue to do so for the near future. Now, further suppose that domestic residents, therefore, decide - perfectly rationally and reasonably - that they should convert a part or whole of their stock of domestic assets from domestic currency to foreign currency. This will be financially desirable as the domestic value of their converted assets is expected to increase because of anticipated depreciation. And, if a large number of residents so decide simultaneously within a short period of time, as they may, this expectation would become self-fulfilling. A severe external crisis is then unavoidable. Consider India(cid:146)s case, for example. Today, our reserves are high and exchange rate movements are, by and large, orderly. Now, suppose there is an event which creates external uncertainty, as for example, what actually happened at the time of the Kargil or the imposition of sanctions after Pokhran, or the oil crises earlier. Domestic stock of bank deposits in rupees in India is presently close to US$ 290 billion, nearly three and a half times our total reserves. At the time of Kargil or Pokhran or the oil crises, the multiple of domestic deposits over reserves was in fact several times higher than now. One can imagine what would have had happened to our external situation, if within a very short period, domestic residents decided to rush to their neighbourhood banks and convert a significant part of these deposits into sterling, euro or dollar. No emerging market exchange rate system can cope with this kind of contingency. This may be an unlikely possibility today, but it must be factored in while deciding on a long term policy of free convertibility of (cid:147)stock(cid:148) of domestic assets. Incidentally, this kind of eventuality is less likely to occur in respect of industrial countries with international currencies such as Euro or Dollar, which are held by banks, corporates, and other entities as part of their long-term global asset portfolio (as distinguished from emerging market currencies in which banks and other intermediaries normally take a daily long or short position for purposes of currency trade). Another issue, which has figured prominently in the current debate, relates to foreign exchange reserves. As is well known, India(cid:146)s foreign exchange reserves have increased substantially in the past few years and are now among one of the largest in the world. The fact that most of the constituents of India(cid:146)s balance of payments are showing positive trends - on the current as well as capital accounts - is a reflection of the increasing competitiveness of the Indian economy and strong confidence of the international community in India(cid:146)s growth potential. For the first time after our Independence 56 years ago, the fragility of the balance of payments is no longer a concern of policy makers. This is a highly positive development and regarded as such by the country at large. Nevertheless, there are two concerns that have been expressed by expert commentators - one is about the (cid:147)cost(cid:148) of additional reserves, and second concerns the impact of (cid:147)arbitrage(cid:148) in inducing higher inflows. So far as the cost of additional reserves is concerned, it needs to be borne in mind that the bulk of additions to reserves in the recent period is on account of non-debt creating inflows. India(cid:146)s total external debt, including NRI (Non-Resident Indian) deposits, has increased relatively slowly as compared with the increase in reserves, particularly in the last couple of years. In fact, India pre-paid more than $ 3 billion of external debt earlier this year. It may also be mentioned that rates of interest paid on NRI deposits and multilateral loans in foreign currency are in line with or lower than prevailing international interest rates. On NRI rupee deposits, interest rates in the last couple of years have been in line with interest rates on deposits by residents, and are currently even lower than domestic interest rates. So far as other non-debt creating inflows (i.e., foreign direct investment, portfolio investment or remittances) are concerned, such inflows by their very nature are commercial in nature and enjoy the same returns and risks, including exchange rate risk, as any other form of domestic investment or remittance by residents. The cost to the country of such flows is the same whether they are added to reserves or are matched by equivalent foreign currency outflow on account of higher imports or investments abroad by 
 4 BIS Review 36/2003 residents. On the whole, under present conditions, it seems that the (cid:147)cost(cid:148) of additional reserves is really a non-issue from a broader macro-economic point of view. Indian interest rates have come down substantially in the last three or four years. They are, however, still higher than those prevailing in the U.S., Europe, U.K. or Japan. This provides an (cid:147)arbitrage(cid:148) opportunity to holder of liquid assets abroad, who may take advantage of higher domestic interest rates in India leading to a possible short-term upsurge in capital flows. However, there are several considerations, which indicate that (cid:147)arbitrage(cid:148) per se is unlikely to have been a primary factor in influencing remittances or investment decisions by NRIs or foreign entities in the recent period. Among these are: (cid:1)(cid:2)The minimum period of deposits by NRIs in Indian rupees is now one year, and the interest rate on such deposits is subject to a ceiling rate of 2.5 per cent over Libor. This is broadly in line with one-year forward premium on the dollar in the Indian market (interest rates on dollar deposits by NRIs are actually below Libor). (cid:1)(cid:2)Outside of NRI deposits, investments by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in debt funds is subject to an overall cap of only $ 1 billion in the aggregate. In other words, the possibility of arbitrage by FIIs in respect of pure debt funds is limited to this low figure of $ 1 billion (excluding investments in a mix of equity and debt funds). (cid:1)(cid:2)Interest rates and yields on liquid securities are highly variable abroad as well as in India, and the differential between the two rates can change very sharply within a short time depending on market expectations. It is interesting to note that the yield on 10 year Treasury bills in the U.S. had risen to about 4.4 per cent as compared with 5.6 per cent on Government bonds of similar maturity in India at the end of July 2003. Taking into account the forward premia on dollars and yield fluctuations, except for brief period, there is likely to be little incentive to send large amounts of capital to India merely to take advantage of the interest differential. On the whole, it is likely that external flows into India have been motivated by factors other than pure arbitrage. Figures on sources of reserve accretion available upto the end of last year (2002-03) confirm this view. It is also pertinent to note that domestic interest rates among industrial countries also vary considerably. For example, in Japan, they are close to zero. In the U.K., they are above 4 per cent, and in the U.S. about 1.5 per cent. There is no evidence that capital has been moving out of U.S. to U.K. or Europe merely on account of interest differential. Within a certain low range, capital flows are likely to be more influenced by outlook for growth and inflation than pure arbitrage even among industrial countries with full CAC. Another point which has been forcefully put forward by several experts in the context of rising reserves, is that India should use its reserves for increasing investment for further development of the country rather than keep them as liquid assets. It is argued that it is paradoxical for a developing country to have a current and capital account surplus, and thereby add to its reserves, rather than use foreign savings to enhance the rate of investment in the economy. In principle, this point is valid. There is no doubt that in our present situation, maximum support has to be given to increasing the level of investment, particularly in the infrastructure sector. It is for this reason that RBI in the recent period has been following a soft interest rate policy in an environment of low inflation. However, at the same time, it must be emphasized that there is very little that RBI, (or, for that matter, Government) can directly do to use additional reserves for investment. The equivalent rupee resources have already been released by the RBI to recipients of foreign exchange, and equivalent rupee liquidity has already been created. The decision on whether to invest, consume or deposit these additional rupee resources lies with recipients, and not with the RBI. By all means, let us urge them to invest, but there is not much of a case for pointing a finger at additional reserves as a (cid:147)cause(cid:148) of lower than desirable level of investment activity in the economy. Let me now come to my last point, which is of considerable present-day interest in India in the context of high and rising reserves, easy liquidity, low interest rates and the weakening dollar, i.e., what should be the correct or right policy stance for the management of exchange rate in India in the present environment? In RBI(cid:146)s periodic credit policy statements, as well as other public statements, RBI has highlighted the main pillars of its strategy for the management of the exchange rate. These are: RBI does not have a fixed (cid:147)target(cid:148) for the exchange rate which it tries to defend or pursue over time; RBI is prepared to intervene in the market to dampen excessive volatility as and when necessary; RBI(cid:146)s purchases or sales of foreign currency are undertaken through a number of banks and are generally 
 BIS Review 36/2003 5 discreete and smooth; and market operations and exchange rate movement should, in principle, be transaction-oriented rather than purely speculative in nature. It is perhaps fair to say that the actual results of the exchange rate policy followed by the RBI, since the Asian crisis in particular, have been highly positive so far. In addition to sharp increase in reserves and generally (cid:147)orderly(cid:148) movements in exchange rates with lower volatility, the confidence level of domestic and foreign investors in the Indian external sector policies is strong. India(cid:146)s policies have also been described by the IMF as being (cid:147)comparable to the global best practices(cid:148) in a recent study of 20 select industrial and developing countries. Interestingly, a leading global news agency, in an international journal, has recently described India(cid:146)s currency model as being (cid:147)ideal(cid:148) for Asia. India is now one of the very few developing countries which has set up its own clearing house for dollar-rupee transaction with the concurrence of the Federal Reserve System, New York. In the last few months, however, when the dollar has been depreciating against major currencies, and rupee has been appreciating against the dollar (albeit slowly), a number of suggestions have been made by experts and others calling for a shift in RBI(cid:146)s exchange rate policies. There are, in the main, three alternative approaches that have been suggested for consideration: (cid:1)(cid:2)One view advanced by several distinguished economists, including Prof. Kenneth Rogoff of IMF during his recent visit to India, is that rupee should be allowed to appreciate freely in line with market trends. According to this view, there is no strong case for RBI(cid:146)s further intervention as reserves are already very high. RBI(cid:146)s purchases create substantial additional domestic liquidity, which may be destabilising in the long run. There is also no evidence, in their opinion, that unconstrained appreciation or volatility would affect growth prospects or lead to any other macro-economic problem. (cid:1)(cid:2)An exactly opposite view, which, among others, has been recently articulated by an important all-India industry association, is that RBI should intervene more aggressively in the market to further reduce the degree of appreciation. The main argument in favour of this view is that India must maintain its global (cid:147)competitiveness(cid:148), particularly in relation to China which has a fixed exchange rate with the dollar and whose currency has been depreciating along with it. (cid:1)(cid:2)A third view, which has been recently put forward by a leading economic journal, among others, is that RBI should pursue what it has referred to as a policy of (cid:147)calculated volatility(cid:148). It has been argued that the present policy of controlled volatility has provided virtually risk-less gain to market participants since the rupee has been expected to appreciate substantially and continuously over the past few months. According to this view, in order to prevent excessive capital inflows during this period, RBI should have allowed the exchange rate to (cid:147)overshoot(cid:148) quickly the targeted exchange rate of, say, Rs. 46.20 (or any other number) to, say, Rs. 45.50. Thereafter, it should have allowed the rupee to depreciate slowly, but not necessarily smoothly, to the above targeted number over a period of next few months. In essence, this proposal is akin to a policy of (announced or unannounced) fixed exchange rate within a wider band. The RBI welcomes the current debate. Reserves, at present, are certainly at a level which is more than enough to meet any foreseeable contingency. It is also clear that, in the present period, capital inflows and remittances have been strong, requiring continuous domestic liquidity management. In principle, therefore, it would be nice if an alternative viable exchange rate management system could be put in place which would avoid excessive build-up of reserves and domestic liquidity and, at the same time, maintain India(cid:146)s external competitiveness with low inflation and low interest rates. In theory, each of the above alternative approaches has some merit. However, it is not entirely clear that they can be put into practice without causing substantial instability or uncertainty and possible emergence of macro-economic problems which are worse than what they are trying to solve. An implicit assumption in two of the above alternatives is that there is a level at which, after initial fast appreciation, the exchange rate will either stabilise or turn around. A further implicit assumption is that the level (whatever it is) is either already known or will become known to the market as it is approached. RBI(cid:146)s past experience does not suggest that these assumptions are valid. It would be recalled that there have been periods when rupee exchange rates have been relatively more volatile and movements have been sharper. However, during periods of sharper appreciation, instead of inflows declining and demand for foreign currency rising, it was noticed that actual market behaviour was the 
 6 BIS Review 36/2003 opposite. The opposite was true during periods of sharp depreciation. Exchange rate expectations had their own momentum and were often self-fulfilling. There must, of course, be a level where these expectations will reverse. However, if that level, because of (cid:147)momentum(cid:148) trading in imperfect and thin markets happens to be significantly out of line with (cid:147)fundamentals(cid:148), considerable instability and substantial overvaluation (or under valuation) may result. Such an outcome may do more harm than good to continued confidence in a country(cid:146)s exchange rate system. The third suggestion to hold the rates at current levels, and not to allow it to appreciate any further, even if inflows are strong, is also likely to be unsustainable over any length of time. It virtually amounts to adopting a (cid:147)fixed(cid:148) or a near-fixed exchange rate system with a floor. Past experience suggests that this system can work well, as it did in East Asia prior to the crisis, when the economy is doing well and inflows are strong, but it comes under extreme pressure when there are unfavourable domestic or external developments. Abandonment of a system of (cid:147)fixed(cid:148) exchange rates (or a system with a known floor) then becomes unavoidable. Such a change, when it occurs under pressure, can result in considerable instability which is likely to be spread over a fairly long period. At the end of this process, the country then has no option but to revert to a more flexible exchange rate system. It is by no means a mere coincidence that all countries affected by external crises in the 1990s had a fixed or near-fixed exchange rate systems. China at present is an exception to the rule in view of its persistent trade surpluses over a long period combined with very high levels of foreign direct investment. It is not certain how long into the future this situation will prevail. In any case, China(cid:146)s special characteristics are difficult to replicate in other emerging markets with lower volume of trade and foreign investment. The desirability of maintaining the-overall competitiveness of an economy can hardly be questioned. However, the long-run competitiveness of an economy needs to be measured in relation to a multiple currency basket, and in relation to major trading partners over a reasonably long period of time. Exchange rate fluctuations among major currencies are now an everyday fact of life, and it is important for all entities with foreign exchange exposures to resort to (cid:147)hedging(cid:148) with appropriate risk management of assets and liabilities. On balance, the benefits of the suggested alternatives to the present system are not very clear. The present system is by no means an ideal one. However, like the old cliche about virtues of democracy, it is probably better in the long run than all the available alternatives. In view of behavioural and market complexities in this area, as well as multiple economic policy objectives, solutions which seem (cid:147)ex ante(cid:148) optimal may turn out to be disastrous (cid:147)ex post(cid:148) - after the event - as happened in Argentina recently and East Asia and Mexico some years ago. Nevertheless, as I said a while ago, RBI welcomes the present debate. As a contribution to this debate, I have tried to deal with some relevant issues, and indicate our present views on them. These views are, of course, subject to change in the light of domestic and international experience and further academic insights. We look forward to your deliberations and hope to benefit from them. 
Jarle Bergo: Crisis resolution and financial stability in Norway Speech by Mr Jarle Bergo, Deputy Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the 50th Anniversary of Bank Indonesia, Jakarta, 10 December, 2003. The references and the Charts in pdf can also be found on the website of the Norges Bank. *      *      * Yours excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.  It is a great pleasure to attend this important conference in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of Bank Indonesia, and have the opportunity to share our experience of handling a banking crisis with colleagues from South East Asia.  The banking crisis in Norway in the early 1990s was not as severe as the banking crises some of the Asian countries faced in the late 1990s or the one our neighbouring countries Sweden and Finland experienced. In 1991 - at the peak of our crisis - bank loan losses amounted to 2.8 per cent of GDP. In the same year non-performing loans accounted for 9 per cent of loans outstanding for the entire banking industry1. The corresponding figure for Indonesia was as high as 70 per cent, 33 per cent in Thailand, and 18 per cent in Sweden2.  Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that the Norwegian crisis was systemic; in 1991 three of the four largest banks and a number of smaller ones had failed or were in deep financial trouble.  In this relatively short presentation, I will concentrate on the main issues of the crisis and its resolution. Thus, not every stage in the development of the crisis will be recapitulated, or every step and detail in its resolution. Nor have I tried to reflect every nuance in the public debate, in the reports from parliamentary commissions and in research papers on the subject3. The views I put forward are my own and have been deliberately sharpened to promote discussion.  The most important characteristics of the resolution of the Norwegian crisis can be summarized as follows:  • The banks’ own collective guarantee funds handled the problems in the banking sector before the crisis became systemic.  • No blanket guarantee for the banks’ debts was provided by the government.  • No regulatory forebearance.  • No liquidity support to banks whose solvency was in doubt.  • A clear and transparent division of responsibility between the political authorities, the supervisory authority and the central bank was established early on.  • Government support was contingent on strict requirements being met, e.g. existing shareholders accepting a write-down to cover losses to the extent possible.  • No micro-management of the banks.  • Measures taken to prevent supported banks exploiting the situation vis-à-vis non-supported banks.  • No asset management companies or “bad banks”.  I shall comment on each of these issues, but before doing this let me briefly mention the background for the crisis:                                                        1  Source: Sandal (2004). 2  Source: Kane and Klingebiel (2002) and Norges Bank. 3  Interested readers are referred to Moe, Solheim and Vale (2004), Norwegian Official Reports (1992), Wilse (1995), and Stortinget (1998). Steigum (2004) sets out the macroeconomic background and implications of the banking crisis. BIS Review 58/2003 1 
During 1984 and 1985, the Norwegian banking system was deregulated. In this new environment, banks started to compete for market shares. We saw a huge increase in bank lending which, coupled with general optimism (oil!) and interest rates that were kept artificially low, created an economic boom. However, neither bank managers nor supervisors had much experience of banks operating in a competitive credit market, and did not pay sufficient attention to banks’ risk exposure.  A sharp fall in prices for our main export commodities, oil and gas, and the need to consolidate the economy after the boom and bring down rampant inflation, led to a recession in the late 1980s.  In short, deregulation, a lending boom, and an ensuing recession set the stage for increasing bank losses.  The Norwegian banking crisis evolved in two stages:  In the first stage from 1988 till 1990, several small and some medium banks failed.  From 1990 - 1991, the crisis became systemic. The three largest commercial banks, accounting for half of the market for credit to the domestic non-financial sector, were in deep trouble.  During the first stage of the crisis, the problems were mostly handled by the banks’ own guarantee funds. Membership in the funds is mandatory and the funds are financed ex ante by fees from the member banks.  These funds had a wider mandate than just paying out depositors at the closure of a failed bank. If liquidating the failed bank and paying out the depositors was considered a more costly alternative than recapitalizing the bank or providing guarantees or financial support to facilitate a take-over, the funds were free to do so.  However, by the end of 1990, bank-owned funds had effectively depleted almost all of their capital and it became apparent that the larger banks might also face problems. To make sure that there would still be a safety net present, the government established the Government Bank Insurance Fund - or GBIF - in early 1991. At the same time it was made clear that it was through this fund only that public money might be injected into failing banks. The central bank might provide liquidity support only once solvency was assured. The GBIF was given a specific grant by the Storting (parliament). The new fund could lend money to the banks’ own guarantee funds to enable them to recapitalize failing banks. Later, as the crisis escalated, the GBIF was permitted to recapitalize the banks directly.  In both cases, strict conditions were attached.  Most often these included:  • the management and board of directors of the bank were replaced  • the existing share capital was written down to cover losses to the fullest extent possible  • the bank’s operating costs were reduced and some of its activities downsized  • measures were taken to restrain growth in the bank’s total assets.  An example of the conditions that were imposed can be found in chart 8. These conditions were of course rather unattractive to bank managers, board members and shareholders. And that was part of the objective; the management of a troubled bank should have a strong incentive to try other solutions before approaching the GBIF. For those that had to resort to the GBIF, an important aim was to force them onto a sounder track of business.  Curbing the activities of banks receiving capital from the GBIF also implied that there was no competitive advantage for these banks over rival banks that were not receiving this kind of support.  In addition, the value of the existing share capital in the bank would be written down according to the bank’s losses. In cases where the losses exceeded the existing share capital, the entire capital would be written down to zero. Such decisions would normally have to be made by the banks’ General Meetings. In order to avoid a stalemate if a majority at the meeting objected to the decision, the Storting had one month earlier made an amendment to the Commercial Bank Act. This amendment entitled the government by Royal Decree to write down the share capital of a bank against losses in the audited interim accounts, if the shareholders’ General Meeting did not do so. This authority was used in two instances where shareholders refused to write down a bank’s shares as required by GBIF. Shareholders in one bank brought the case to the courts, but lost.  2 BIS Review 58/2003 
That shareholders in this way were forced to take a bank’s losses before tax payers’ money was put on the table, was to my mind imperative in order to muster the necessary political support and acceptance among the electorate for the rescue operations. It is hard to imagine that it would at all have been possible to support the banks if the old managers and shareholders were allowed to maintain their stakes in a failed bank.  The conditions attached to the capital injections from the Government Bank Insurance Fund were explicitly set out in a written agreement between the bank and the GBIF. This agreement was made public. The bank was required to report regularly to the fund on the fulfilment of the terms of the agreement.  The GBIF was headed by a decision-making board of experts and its operations were carried out at a distance from the political authorities. However, the GBIF kept in close contact with the financial supervisors and the central bank. The central bank also played a part as lender of last resort once the banks had been recapitalized. General assurances were given that the central bank would provide liquidity support to sound financial institutions (including non-banks). However, the banks generally managed to keep their funding, and did not have to resort to the central bank to any extraordinary extent.  Before GBIF injected capital into crisis-stricken banks, efforts were made to attract private investors. However, these efforts did not succeed. Experience shows that in times of recession and high uncertainty investors will be extremely reluctant to take on risk. Under these circumstances, the government was the only source available to support the financial system. In a way, the government became the “owner of last resort”.  In light of the high level of uncertainty, the funding of the GBIF was regarded as expenses in the fiscal accounts, not as an investment. In retrospect, however, capital supplied by the government to the problem banks proved to yield a reasonable positive return. Hence, it might have been a profitable investment for private investors, although with a huge risk ex ante.  To counteract the generally low supply of equity capital during the banking crisis, a separate Government Bank Investment Fund was set up. The Fund was intended to take part in equity emissions at (non-problem) banks on commercial terms. Certain other forms of general support to the banking industry were also provided.  At its peak, the share of state ownership in the banking sector was close to 60 percent.  Unlike many other countries dealing with a banking crisis, Norway did not set up a separate asset management company - or “bad bank” - to handle problem loans. There were several reasons why we chose not to do this:  • In none of the problem banks in Norway was the ratio of non-performing loans considered to be of such magnitude that it would require so much attention from the management of the bank that it would distract them from their main goal - to bring the bank back to profitability.  • The banks themselves knew their borrowers best and had experience in working out defaulted loans. Handling such loans will always be part of a large bank’s business, and transferring employees with this expertise to a separate company might have left the banks more vulnerable when they encountered new problem loans.  • Setting up an asset management company and transferring bad loans from the banks would have required complicated accounting and legal work. In particular it would have been very difficult to find a fair price at which the loans should be transferred.  • The responsibility of handling the problem loans should remain with those who had the most to gain from a successful handling - the banks.  • Last but not the least; such an asset management company would have had to be financed by government money. Thus, more taxpayers’ money would have been put at risk.  However, there was nothing to prevent the banks themselves, alone or jointly, establishing subsidiaries to handle the bad loans. None chose to do so.  BIS Review 58/2003 3 
Nor did the Norwegian authorities issue a blanket guarantee for the banks’ liabilities. Such a guarantee can create moral hazard problems and actually lead to more bank problems in the future4. In addition, it was not considered proper for the government to take on an open-ended and not budgeted liability. Nevertheless, when the crisis emerged, it was made clear both by the Minister of Finance and by Norges Bank that measures necessary to bolster confidence in our financial system would be taken. No assurances were given that individual banks would be rescued. In this respect, it was probably a blessing that there was no government ownership in commercial banks before the crisis. In the end however, only two small banks were shut down and depositors paid back through the banks’ guarantee funds.  By late 1993 - one year after Norway left the peg to the ECU and started to lower the interest rate - the crisis was effectively over and banks had started to earn normal profits. Banks in general came out of the crisis much leaner and more efficient than before.  The discounted value of the gross fiscal costs of the resolution of the Norwegian crisis resolution is estimated at 2.9 per cent of GDP as of year end 1993. At the same time, the net fiscal costs - adjusted for the value of the government’s shares in the banks - were estimated at 0.8 per cent of GDP5. As referred to above, for the whole period up to the present a positive return was achieved on the capital invested.  It might be interesting to compare fiscal costs in Norway to fiscal costs in Sweden which had a crisis of similar size relative to the size of the economy. Looking at simple non-discounted sums, gross fiscal costs for Sweden were 3.6 per cent of GDP in 1997. For Norway, the comparable figure was only 2 per cent6. Part of this difference can probably be traced back to Sweden’s use of government-financed asset management companies as part of their crisis resolution.  However, during a banking crisis there are important costs to society in addition to the pure fiscal costs. Some attempts have been made to estimate the cumulative effects of the banking crisis on Norway’s GDP. These estimates vary considerably from a low of 9.8 per cent of GDP to a high of 27.1 per cent7. This wide variation illustrates the methodological difficulties involved in isolating the effects of the banking crisis per se.  No doubt the economic costs of the crisis - however measured - would have been far larger if the problem banks had been forced to close. Insured depositors might not have lost that much - although this is questionable - but the situation for borrowers might have been serious if they had been forced to repay their loans early. Given the state of the Norwegian economy at that time, finding a new bank willing to extend sufficient credit would no doubt have been difficult - we would most probably have experienced a severe credit crunch that deepened the recession8. The main purpose of the rescue operations was to prevent such a scenario from becoming reality.  Banks receiving a capital injection from the government were able to continue their normal bank lending and other banking operations. Empirical studies indicate that the credit conditions of firms borrowing from these troubled banks were no worse than for borrowers at non-crisis banks.9  In 1994, the government started to sell its shares in the banks. At present the government has a substantial share in only one of the three banks it took over during the crisis. The two others are now subsidiaries of a Danish and a Nordic banking group respectively. Fears of a foreign take-over, also of the largest commercial bank, has - at least so far - led the government to opt for remaining an important owner.  When the government as part of a crisis resolution steps in as an owner of last resort, the intention is usually to get out of this position once the bank has proved to be profitable again. This is probably                                                       4  Cf. Kane and Klingebiel (2002). 5  Source: St.meld. 39 (1993-94). 6  Source: For Sweden: Jennergren and Näslund (1998).

They identify a substantial impact on U.S. real estate activity from this supply shock. 9  See Ongena, Smith and Michalsen (2003) and Vale (2002). 4 BIS Review 58/2003 
BIS Review 58/2003 5 good advice, but there is a delicate balance between restoring private ownership quickly and trying to recover as much as possible of the government’s fiscal costs.  The Norwegian banking crisis was handled swiftly and transparently and at relatively low cost to the taxpayers. Furthermore, the banks that came out of the crisis had trimmed their operating costs and established much better systems to evaluate credit risks.  In one respect, we were rather lucky compared to others. The crisis built up gradually, so there was time to assess the situation and strengthen the defences of the financial system before the crisis became systemic. The banks’ equity capital provided the first line of defence and the banks’ collective guarantee funds the second when bank losses started to soar. The third line of defence - the Government Bank Insurance Fund - was only established when it was evident that the first and second lines of defence did not hold, but it was nevertheless established in time.  By and large most scholars seem to agree that the resolution of the crisis in Norway was fairly successful. But even if it was, right there and then, there is no guarantee that the same recipe will be successful in future or in other countries. In recognition of this and to avoid moral hazard, the law establishing the Government Bank Insurance Fund has now been repealed and the Fund has ceased its operations. Even if government capital injections in the large problem banks were the right resolution method in the early 1990s, it is far from evident that such a rescue operation would be the right method should a large bank fail in the future. However, I think it is possible to identify some principles that should be adhered to in order to increase the chances of success. The focus must be on saving the financial system, not the individual bank. With regard to the way failed banks are handled, the division of responsibilities between various parts of government must be clear, as it was ten years ago. As then, owners should be the first in line to shoulder losses. Similarly, the board and top management responsible for the failure of a bank should not be allowed to continue.  Hopefully we have all, bankers and authorities alike, learnt from the crisis. At the central bank, we have strengthened our surveillance of the soundness of our financial system (macro-prudential supervision). There is also an extensive exchange of information with the supervisors in the Banking Insurance and Securities Commission. Twice a year, Norges Bank publishes its financial stability report where the risks to the present and future solvency of financial institutions in Norway are assessed. The aim is to detect the first signs of banking problems more quickly and possibly prevent them from escalating into a crisis. However, the financial system is evolving rapidly. Tomorrow’s problems could easily be different from the past.  Today, a large part of our banking industry is part of Nordic banking groups. This raises the question of whether a model for crisis resolution only based on national considerations would work. In light of this challenge, Nordic central banks have issued a memorandum of understanding setting out principles for the establishment of a structure for crisis management and the handling of information if a pan-Nordic bank should have problems. Nevertheless, the emergence of multinational banking groups raises the question of whether some banks may be “too big to save”.  Another difference from the early 1990s is the government’s one-third ownership in the largest bank. In terms of crisis resolution, this is most probably a further complication.  Banking crises have occurred at irregular intervals as long as banks have existed. And it could happen again. We need to be vigilant and alert in our macro prudential supervision, and willing to consider new approaches in crisis resolution to lessen the impact of any new financial crisis.  Thank you for your attention.  
Peter Nicholl: Bosnia and Herzegovina - progress and partnership Comments by Mr Peter Nicholl, Governor of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the second annual business conference, London, 9 December 2003. *      *      * I would like to welcome all of you to this conference and thank you for attending.  I will cover four topics in my presentation. The first will be the Central Bank of BH and the roles it plays in maintaining financial stability in BH. The second will be the significant improvements that have occurred in the banking sector in BH over the last three years. The third will be the changes that lie ahead of the BH financial sector in the immediate future, and I will finish with some brief comments on the economic outlook. The central bank (CBBH) • The CBBH commenced its operations on 11 August 1997 so it is still quite a young organization. • It is a state level institution, which means it is the only monetary authority in BH and operates over the whole country through five offices. It has 265 staff. • The CBBH law specifies clearly the functions that the CBBH must carry out and also sets a number of limitations on its operations. • Subject to these legal requirements and restrictions, the CBBH is completely independent of political influence. Monetary policy • Monetary policy is the CBBH’s most important function. • The CBBH operates monetary policy through a strict currency board arrangement, which is stipulated in the CBBH law. • There were three main reasons for the choice of a currency board for BH’s monetary policy:  (a) It provided a firm nominal anchor in the form of a fixed exchange rate in a situation where there was significant economic instability; (b) It removed discretion in a situation where there was considerable difficulty in establishing institutions and making political decisions; (c) Currency boards had been established in some other eastern European countries and were working well. The currency board • The three essential features of the BH currency board are: (a) A fixed exchange rate specified in the law; (b) Full foreign exchange backing for all the KM liabilities of the central bank; (c) Full convertibility of the CBBH’s KM liabilities into the anchor currency. The fixed exchange rate The initial exchange rate was set at 1 KM = 1 Deutschmark (the Bosnian currency is called the Convertible Marka). The choice of the DM as the anchor currency for the BH currency board was an BIS Review 58/2003 1 
easy one. The DM had long been a very stable currency and it was already widely used and trusted in BH. When the DM was replaced by the euro, the CBBH law was changed to make the euro the anchor currency for the BH Currency Board. The new exchange rate was specified in the CBBH law at exactly the same rate as the DM had been linked to the euro. i.e., 1KM = 0.51129 euros. This means that the exchange rate of the KM has been unchanged since the CBBH commenced its operations. The transition from the DM to the euro as the anchor currency went very smoothly and the impacts on the KM and the currency board were very positive.  Full foreign exchange backing The KM liabilities of the CBBH, which are the KM currency in circulation and the deposits of the BH commercial banks at the CBBH, have to be fully backed in convertible foreign assets. As our liabilities are tied to the euro, we hold most of our reserves in euros in order to avoid taking any exchange rate risk. The table below shows that the CBBH has maintained this full foreign exchange backing for the KM since 1998 and we had ‘free reserves’ of KM 148 million at the end of October, 2003. Table 1 CBBH foreign reserves End of period in KM millions Date net foreign reserves monetary liabilities free reserves  Dec 1997 144.1 160.3 –16.2 Dec 1998 283.3 253.9 29.4 Dec 1999 865.7 836.7  29.0 Dec 2000 1021.2 973.2 48.0 Dec 2001 2666.6 2591.6 75.0 Dec 2002 2463.2 2345.1 118.1 June 2003 2266.1 2123.0 143.1 Oct 2003 2603.1 2455.4 148.1 Nov 2003 2634.1 n.a. n.a. This table also illustrates the way in which the KM gradually substituted for the other currencies that were in use in BH thus leading to a steady increase in the CBBH balance sheet from 1997 to 2000. This trend accelerated during the euro conversion period in late 2001 and early 2002. In all, the CBBH sent DM 4.3 billion of DM banknotes back to Germany from Bosnia during this conversion period and the CBBH’s foreign reserves more than doubled over a four month period. Our foreign reserves fell during 2002 and the first half of 2003 from the peak they reached at the end of 2001. Most of the fall was in the level of commercial bank deposits at the CBBH and came about mainly because banks were expanding their domestic credit rapidly and, as a consequence, they reduced the level of deposits they held at the CBBH. The fall in the level of foreign reserves has been reversed in the last few months, primarily because of changes we made to the reserve requirement system for banks. Our foreign reserve holdings are now back over KM 2.6 billion and are close to the peak level achieved during the euro changeover period. The CBBH’s net foreign reserves represent around three and a half months of import coverage, which is a ‘comfortable’ level. Full convertibility As the following table shows, the KM has been a convertible currency within BH in practice as well as in name. 2 BIS Review 58/2003 
Table 2 Net KM issued from 11/8/97 to 25/11/03 KM billion KM issued to BH banks KM purchased from BH banks net KM issued 12.097 9.851w 2.246 The success of the currency board arrangements The currency board has been a very successful type of monetary policy for BH: • The KM has been a stable currency against the DM and the euro since it was introduced. • Inflation in BH is now low and stable. Table 3 Inflation in BH Retail price index, annual % growth Year ended Federation of BH Republika Srpska  BH average  Dec 2000 4.0 16.1 8.0 Dec 2001 0.3 2.2 0.9 Dec 2002 –0.7 2.4 0.3 Sept 2003 0.5 1.9 0.9  • KM use has risen steadily in BH and the KM is now the dominant transactions currency in all parts of the country (euros are generally accepted too, at least for larger transaction).  • The proportion of bank deposits denominated in KM is also growing, though more than 50% are still denominated in foreign currency. • The KM has remained fully convertible in BH since it was introduced. • The stability of the KM has been an important element in increasing the level of foreign direct investment coming into BH. Table 4 Foreign direct investment into BH  In KM m. period Foreign Direct Investment 1998 117.4 1999 324.5 2000 310.1 2001 274.1 2002 604.3 2002q1 and 2 261.9 2003q1 and 2  247.8  We think that these figures actually understate the amount of foreign investment that has come into BH in the last few years. The CBBH recently initiated a survey of 800-900 companies in order to try and get more up-to-date and accurate data on foreign investment into BH. BIS Review 58/2003 3 
The currency board will continue The Presidency of BH has announced that the Currency Board Arrangements will continue as one of the major features of macro-economic policy in BH. This is also the policy of the state and entity governments as set out in the Letter of Intent they have agreed with the IMF as part of the Stand-by negotiations with the Fund.  The most important reason for this is that the policy has produced major economic and social benefits. Secondly, the citizens of BH have faced many financial traumas in the past. They therefore value a stable currency and the currency board consequently has a high level of public support within BH. Finally, the long term goal of BH policy is to take the economy closer to and eventually into Europe. The KM is already tied to the euro. It is therefore sensible to maintain this link. The exit strategy for BH from the currency board will therefore be the eventual adoption of the euro as the currency of BH.  New board and governor of the CBBH The CBBH law said that after the first six years of operations of the CBBH, a new Board of five Bosnian citizens would be appointed by the Presidency and that one of those five board members would be appointed Governor. This was an important transition period for the CBBH and had the potential to introduce a degree of uncertainty and possible instability. The six year date passed on 11 August, 2003. The changes have been implemented very smoothly. The Presidency appointed a new Board in April. Three of the five members already had extensive CBBH experience. With the support of the Presidency, the Board has appointed the new Governor. The new Governor is actually the old Governor. I have been reappointed until the end of 2004. In order for this to be possible under the CBBH Law, the Government of BH has accorded me Bosnian citizenship, which I regard as a great honor.  In addition, the Presidency and the CBBH Board have already agreed on and appointed the person who will become Governor from 1 January, 2005. He is Kemal Kozarić, one of the current Vice Governors.  The decisions taken by the presidency on the CBBH are very positive because: • They were taken early thus avoiding any uncertainty; • They provide a high degree of continuity in the management of the CBBH; • They have looked well ahead, thus assisting a smooth transition to the new Governor in 2005.  Banking sector The second area I want to focus on in my address is the commercial banking sector. BH has an improving banking sector. The reform in the banking sector has gone further and faster than reform in any other sector of the economy. Confidence has come back and depositors are now prepared to put their savings in the banks rather than keep them at home in foreign cash under the mattress. Bank lending also grew very rapidly last year and is continuing to rise strongly this year, though at a somewhat slower rate. The strong growth in bank credit led the CBBH in June, 2003 to take its first ever monetary policy action. The only monetary policy instrument the CBBH currently has is a reserve requirement that we apply to commercial bank deposits. A reserve requirement has been in place since we commenced operations in 1997. But we made a number of significant changes to the way in which it was implemented in June: • The reserve requirement had previously been applied only to KM deposits. It is now applied to all deposits, thus more than doubling the base. • Banks could previously meet their reserve requirement either by holding KM banknotes in their vaults of having KM deposits at the CBBH. Now, the reserve requirement can only be met by deposits at the CBBH. • Previously, banks’ excess deposits at the CBBH were not remunerated. Now, the CBBH pays an overnight interest rate on banks’ total deposits at the CBBH. 4 BIS Review 58/2003 
• The ratio level was reduced from 10% to 5%. But because of the other changes, the effect of this was an increase in the level of reserve deposits banks had to hold at the CBBH. Competition in the banking sector is now very real, helped by the arrival of some good foreign banks. Proportionately, foreign investment in the banking sector has been higher than in any other sector in BH. Table 5 Commercial bank deposits and lending  Annual percentage change deposits lending Date Business Households Total Business Households Total Dec98 26 63 21 13 105 20 Dec99 18 –9 10 2 8 –5 Dec00 –3 29 8 3 43 8 Dec01 26 177 69 1 77 11 Dec02 9 12 13 4 114 28 Sept03  10 11 12 8 30 15  Bank interest rates on lending have fallen substantially under the pressure of increased competition, but are still relatively high. Comprehensive data on interest rates was not collected prior to 2002 but most bank lending rates prior to 2001 would have been over 20%. They have fallen steadily since that time and the average short term lending rate in August 2003 was 10.43% and the average long term lending rate was 9.33%. June this year was the first time that this interest data shifted into single digit interest rates since we started collecting the data. I expect this downward trend in interest rates to continue. I will briefly list the main changes that have brought this improvement in the BH banking sector about: Payments system reform The cash payments system has been unified with the KM becoming the dominant, and almost the sole, currency in use in BH. In the non-cash payments area, the old state-owned centralized system that had a monopoly was closed in early 2001. It has been replaced with a modern European-type system with two clearing houses, an RTGS one and a giro one, owned and operated by the Central Bank. Payments are being conducted by the commercial banks. The suppliers we used had put similar systems into place in nine other European countries. But it was done more quickly in BH than anywhere else showing that it is possible to implement large, technical projects in BH successfully. It has been operating smoothly and effectively since 5 January 2001. Minimum capital requirements These requirements have been substantially increased through a series of steps from an initial KM 2.5 million to KM 15 million from the beginning of 2003. This has forced banks to merge or find strategic partners. This, plus increased competition, has led to a sharp reduction in the number of banks in BH. In 1997, there were 76 registered banks in BH in 1997 but most of them were extremely small. At present there are 38 registered banks in BH. But consolidation with the BH banking system has already gone further than this number indicates. For example, around 65% of total deposits are already in the four largest bank groups and the largest 10 banks have around 85% of total deposits. The number of registered banks will therefore reduce further over the next year as consolidation continues. BIS Review 58/2003 5 
Inter-entity banking It became possible in 2001 for a bank registered in one entity to operate branches in the other entity. Most of the larger banks are already doing so and more will follow. We can say that in the banking sector, BH now has a single economic space. Deposit insurance A deposit insurance scheme was started in 2001. It covers deposits in approved banks up to KM 5,000. This is also helping return citizens’ confidence to the banks that qualify. Initially, two agencies were established, one in each entity. But in 2002, they were merged into a State Deposit Insurance Agency. At present, 18 banks have met the standards required to be a member of the DIA. But all banks will need to meet these standards in the near future or face the risk of losing their banking license. Foreign banks A number of foreign banks have commenced operations in BH, particularly in the last two years. Increased foreign competition has already been very good for the BH economy. It has given depositors more choice and it has forced the local banks to improve the range and quality of the services they provide in order to survive.  Privatization of government owned banks Progress in bank privatization was initially very slow but accelerated markedly in 2002. The process of privatization is now complete in the RS but there are still some small state-owned banks in the Federation. These latter two trends, foreign entry and privatization, have led to a substantial shift in ownership in the BH banking sector towards private ownership and, in particular, foreign private ownership. Table 6 Capital structure in BH banking sector (%)  31.12.00 31.12.01 31.12.02 31.6.03 State capital  47 19 10 10 Private capital:  53 81 90 90 Domestic  na 25 23 23 Foreign  na1 56 67 67 1  The data isn’t available but the % of foreign ownership would have been low.  In short, the BH banking system is looking more and more like the banking system you see in other European countries. The BH banking system has still not completed its transition to becoming a modern European type banking system but it is well on the way and I think most people will be surprised by how quickly the banking system will continue to change and improve. The main things that will slow down the transition are problems in the legal and regulatory frameworks in BH that make it difficult for banks to take and use collateral for lending. This is where the reform focus now needs to be concentrated. Future initiatives in the BH financial sector BH now has a sound central bank and a stable currency and a rapidly improving commercial banking sector. Now that the BH financial system has a firm base, the challenges for the next two years are to maintain financial stability and to develop the capital and securities markets so as to broaden the range of financial services available to savers and investors in BH. I will briefly list some of the initiatives that are underway: 6 BIS Review 58/2003 
National capital markets council (NCMC) I have recently formed a NCMC in order to develop a broadly based strategy for the next stages of financial market development in BH. The Council includes representatives from state and entity governments, regulatory authorities and market participants. All organizations that I invited to join agreed to do so and are participating enthusiastically. This is a very positive start for the process of capital market development. Sovereign credit rating The Council of Ministers has decided that BH should seek its first sovereign credit rating and has asked the CBBH to administer the project. The credit rating should be available by April, 2004. The present international perception of BH is often very negative. We believe having a published rating will improve the knowledge about BH and the perceptions many potential investors currently have. Securities market Work is currently underway to draft a Securities Law and to develop selling, registry and settlement processes for a securities market in BH. It has not yet been decided whether the first securities will be issued by the State Government, the entity governments or the CBBH - or all of them. But the legal and administrative work will be done to allow any or all of those organizations to issue securities in 2004. Stock exchanges Two stock exchanges have been established in BH but both are very small. This is the case with most of the stock exchanges established in the region. The positive development is that seven of the eight stock exchanges in fry have entered into a data sharing program. At its launch they said that this is just the first step on the way to shared trading. There is apparently interest in joining this group from some stock exchanges outside the fry region. So the exchanges are moving towards some form of regional stock exchange, which in my view is the only feasible and sensible option for BH and the other countries in the region. Banking supervision Banking supervision in BH is based on the Basle principles. Banking supervision is currently carried out by entity agencies, with the CBBH having a coordinating role. There is good cooperation among the three institutions and this was recently formalized by the signing of a memorandum of understanding. The banking system in BH is now essentially a single country-wide system. Because of this, banking supervision is likely to move under the umbrella of the CBBH during 2004. Harmonization with the EU standards and regulations In all areas in financial market developments (as in all other areas), we are trying to ensure that the things we introduce are consistent with EU standards and regulations.  The economic outlook There are two things that make it difficult to predict the economic outlook in BH with precision. The first is that BH is going through so many transitions simultaneously that the economic numbers can move through very large ranges. Second, the economic outlook depends crucially on an acceleration of the economic, regulatory and legal reform processes in BH. Forecasts based on the status-quo as compared to those based on an accelerated reform path will be very different. In fact, unless the regulatory, legal and tax systems are changed, and changed quickly and substantially, BH will have a very difficult future.  The environment for private investment has improved but it is still far too complicated. This applies to local as well as foreign investment. This is where the attention of BH politicians and international consultants and advisors needs to be directed. The macroeconomic situation in BH is a stable one. It is the areas of regulatory, tax and legal system reform that will determine the future of BH. BIS Review 58/2003 7 
8 BIS Review 58/2003 I am an optimist and believe that we will see a combination of continued macro-economic stability and accelerated micro-economic and legal reform. On this basis, I would expect inflation to remain stable at around current levels, economic growth rates to be at least 6-7 percent per annum in nominal terms (5% real) and the Balance of Payments situation to gradually improve. There are still risks attached to investing in BH. But there are also many opportunities. Though BH is a small country, it is very strategically located with free market access to a very large European market. It has a well educated labor force. Given these two factors and the high degree of macro-economic stability in BH, I believe the balance between risk and opportunity now favors opportunity. I take your presence at this conference as a very encouraging sign for BH. 
Jean-Pierre Roth: Economic activity and monetary policy in Switzerland Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 12 December 2003. *      *      * The National Bank has decided to leave the target range for the three-month Libor rate unchanged at 0.0%-0.75%. For the time being, the three-month Libor is to be kept around 0.25%. In the past two years, we reacted to the decline in economic activity and the upward trend of the Swiss franc by considerably relaxing our monetary policy. Now the signs of an economic recovery in Switzerland are intensifying. The upswing is not yet assured, though. At the same time, the inflation potential is small. For this reason, we are adhering to our expansionary monetary policy and are keeping down the attractiveness of Swiss franc investments. We estimate that the economy will grow by slightly over 1.5% in 2004, while a moderate decline in economic activity is expected for the current year. If monetary policy remains unchanged, average annual inflation is likely to amount to 0.4% in the coming year, to 1.0% in 2005 and to 2.3% in 2006. We are of the opinion that price stability can be maintained by tightening monetary policy at a later point in time.  In the following, I shall first focus on economic activity in Switzerland and our new inflation forecast. This will be followed by a discussion of monetary policy. Finally, I shall elaborate on the new National Bank Law. Economic activity In Switzerland, a turnaround in economic development emerged in the third quarter of 2003. Real GDP exceeded the previous quarter’s level for the first time since the third quarter 2002. Nevertheless, it still fell short of its year-earlier level. The Swiss economy recovered largely in line with our expectations as communicated in our September assessment of the situation. The recovery is attributable to the pickup in global economic activity, low interest rates and generally more favourable exchange rate conditions. This benefited primarily exports, which rose markedly in the third quarter. Equipment investment, too, picked up slightly following a long phase of decline. Private and government consumption continued to have a stabilising effect. The economic situation in Switzerland should improve further in the next few months. We are expecting exports to continue developing favourably, coupled with a robust increase in equipment investment. In this way, the economic upswing in Switzerland will become increasingly broad-based and strengthened. In the course of 2004, unemployment should also fall, leading to a pickup in private consumption. On average, a moderate decline in economic activity will be recorded in the current year, while for 2004, as already stated, we expect the economy to grow by slightly over 1.5%. This will, however, not yet suffice to close the production gap. Production capacities will therefore still not be fully utilised in the coming year. Even though the overall prospects have clearly improved, the situation in a number of industries remains difficult. There is still a risk that the economic upswing in our country may be short-lived. A delay in the global economic recovery in the next few quarters, an unfavourable development in the financial markets or growing geopolitical tensions could jeopardise the economic pickup in Switzerland. Overall, however, the cyclical risks today are significantly more balanced than even a few months ago. It can thus not be ruled out that the recovery will set in faster than we expect. Inflation forecast I shall now turn to the latest development in inflation and our new inflation forecast. Annual inflation (inflation rate compared with previous year) measured by the national consumer price index has shown extremely stable development for some time. In August, it rose by 0.2 percentage points to 0.5%, where it remained until November. This stability is attributable to the evenly spread price increases for domestic goods. Inflation on imported goods has been distinctly more volatile in the wake of fluctuating oil prices. The core inflation rate calculated by the National Bank currently amounts to 0.6%. BIS Review 58/2003 1 
The graph shows our inflation forecast of September 2003 (the dash-dotted green curve in the graph) as well as the new forecast of December 2003 (dashed red curve). The assumptions on which the new forecast rests differ in various respects from those in September. For one thing, growth in the United States will be markedly higher in the current year than anticipated three months ago. With the present fiscal stimulus no longer a factor, however, economic growth is likely to slow down distinctly again next year but should remain robust. We still anticipate an upswing in the EU in the coming year. It is probable, however, that it will take slightly longer to close the output gap than we assumed as recently as September. Inflationary pressure from abroad will thus remain moderate although inflation in other countries will not recede as markedly either in the coming year as we expected three months ago. Furthermore, we anticipate a decline in the price of oil to approximately USD 25 per barrel in the course of 2004. On the assumption that the three-month Libor rate will remain stable at 0.25% during the next three years, inflation should average 0.4% in 2004, 1.0% in 2005 and 2.3% in 2006. The inflation trend according to the new forecast will exceed the September forecast until mid-2005. Until the end of 2004, inflation is likely to remain fairly stable at around 0.5% and to fluctuate only slightly due to basis effects. The new forecast shows that the threat of negative inflation rates has diminished. This is the result of an improvement in the global economy and of the less marked decline in inflation abroad, as also of the weaker Swiss franc vis-à-vis the euro. As from the beginning of 2005, inflation will show a rising trend due to the expansionary monetary policy we took as an assumption. In mid-2005, it will reach 1%, in mid-2006 2% and near the end of 2006 a rate of 3%. This increase is a little flatter than forecast in September. It rests on the notion that in the next few years the output gap will narrow somewhat more slowly than predicted in September due to the productivity gains the upswing is expected to bring. From mid-2006 onwards, forecast inflation will no longer lie within the range that the National Bank equates with price stability. It must, however, be noted that, as always, our forecast is based on an unchanged three-month Libor rate, i.e. on the assumption that monetary policy will remain as expansive as now during the next three years. It is also important to understand that the uncertainty of the forecast increases with the length of the forecasting horizon. Continuation of expansionary monetary policy In the past two years, we have changed over to a strongly expansionary monetary policy. In so doing, we have reacted rapidly and unequivocally to the deterioration in the economic situation and the upward pressure on the Swiss franc. The favourable development of inflation provided us with the necessary leeway for the interest rate cuts we implemented. Between March and July, the Swiss franc weakened considerably vis-à-vis the euro, and the economy is gradually beginning to gain momentum again. The expansionary monetary policy was accompanied by growing monetary aggregates. The strong increase in the money stocks, does not, however, present a significant risk for price stability at the present time. For one thing, credit creation by the banks is continuing to be slow-moving. For another, the growth of the money stocks is considerably influenced by portfolio shifts, which are likely to be reversed once economic activity accelerates and interest rates begin to rise. We shall, however, continue to keep a careful eye on this development. As already stated, there are still certain risks that the economic development will not be sustained. The upswing in Switzerland should not be jeopardised by a premature changeover to a more restrictive monetary policy. We shall therefore continue our expansionary monetary policy and in this way further bolster the economic recovery. We are convinced that we shall have sufficient time to keep inflation within the bounds of price stability by tightening monetary policy at a later point in time. Should a possible marked appreciation of the Swiss franc vis-à-vis the euro threaten to cause an undesirable tightening of monetary conditions, we would again take decisive action. 2 BIS Review 58/2003 
  Inflation Forecast December 2003 with Libor at 0.25% 2003 2004 2005 2006 Annual average inflation in % 0.6 0.4 1.0 2.3  Inflation forecast of December 2003 New National Bank Law in the making On 3 October, the two Federal Chambers passed the new National Bank Law. We are very happy with the course of the parliamentary debate: only minor amendments were made to the draft of the Federal Council. The deadline for a referendum is 22 January 2004. If no referendum is sought, we assume that the Federal Council will put the new Law into force on 30 April 2004, i.e. the date of our Annual General Meeting. The new Law will modernise the legal framework of the National Bank. It lays down the mandate of the Swiss National Bank in detail, guarantees the SNB independence in its decision-making, regulates its accountability vis-à-vis the Federal Council and Parliament and strengthens the supervisory powers of the Bank Council. The latter will no longer consist of 40 members as at present; it will comprise only 11 members, six of whom are elected by the Federal Council and five by the SNB’s Annual General Meeting. The new Bank Council will be constituted on the day of our Annual General Meeting. The new Law extends the National Bank’s room for manoeuvre on the operational level. Until now, the Law laid down exactly what assets the SNB was permitted to invest in and what securities were eligible as collateral in Lombard business. In future, the National Bank will be responsible for making these decisions itself. At the time when the new Law enters into force, we shall publish two directives. One will spell out the technical preconditions for our monetary operations; the other will set out how we shall use our extended investment policy scope. My colleague, Philipp Hildebrand, in his address will present our first ideas on this subject. The new Law vests specific responsibilities in the SNB with respect to the oversight of payment and securities settlement systems. Up to now, our oversight of the SIC interbank payment system was based on a contractual relationship. As from next year, our responsibilities in this domain will be based on the Law and will extend to the oversight of all major payment and settlement systems. My colleague, Niklaus Blattner, will discuss this subject in more detail in his remarks. The new Law also provides that the SNB shall issue implementing regulations in the area of minimum reserves, statistics and the oversight of payment and settlement systems. The draft of an ordinance has already been submitted to the interested parties for consultation. In the field of minimum reserves and statistics we intend in principle to take up the provisions already existing in the Federal Law on Banks and Savings Banks and the Federal Law on Investment Funds. As regards the oversight of BIS Review 58/2003 3 
4 BIS Review 58/2003 payment and settlement systems, we are advancing into totally new territory, where for the time being only the main principles have been defined. This implies pioneering work in the implementation. 
Vepa Kamesam: Retail banking - challenges ahead in distribution channels in urban/rural India Address by Shri Vepa Kamesam, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Twenty-Fifth Bank Economists' Conference - 2003, Mumbai, 12 December 2003. *      *      * The promise of lower transaction costs, increased sales productivity, and more convenient service has lured banks into setting up new delivery channels. Earlier, vast brick and mortar branch network has been considered as an inherent advantage of established banks and new entrants were at huge disadvantage vis-à-vis the established players in terms of customer reach. However, post 1990s new players are effectively taking on the branch network advantage of the established players by optimally leveraging technology and cost-effective delivery channels.  The goal for banks’ senior management is to turn today’s “all things to all people” branch network into highly differentiated system for delivery of multiple products. The foundation for creating such delivery channels is superior insights into customer behaviour. These can come in many forms, but at their most basic they entail understanding customer needs for the delivery of different products, how these needs vary by customer types (including small businesses), current customer behaviour (especially as it relates to channel usage), and customer profitability. It is this multifaceted understanding of customers that yields actionable implications for distribution strategy. Although banks may invest heavily in new delivery channels, the success and sustainability of these channels critically lie in the ability to convert that investment into lower distribution costs. The steps to be followed in making a new distribution channel successful: a) Understand customers’ current channel/transaction behaviour and their underlying attitude;  b) Use sophisticated experimental customer research to assess the economic impact of tactics designed to change that behaviour; c) Develop an integrated channel migration plan which blends economic and non-economic incentives to ensure that right initiatives are targeted at the right customers; d) Protect sales effectiveness by utilizing the ability of non-branch channels to select amongst prospects and differentiate the marketing message; e) Design non-branch channels to emphasize personalized interaction to counteract decreased loyalty among remote customers; f) Develop tracking mechanisms to allow you to assess and revise your migration strategy on an ongoing basis.  Turning our attention to delivery channels used by banks in India, in comparison with their international counterparts, it is observed that the banks are yet to exploit the delivery channels to the maximum extent technology permits. Increase in off-site delivery channels has led to new product development, speed of transaction processing and reduction in transaction costs. In India the major issue about new technology related delivery channels is their impact on the processing of information, which lies at the core of banking business. Inspite of their advantages, reliance on technology based delivery channels often exacerbates traditional risks: operational risk (since it requires changes in procedures), reputational risk (if the bank fails to deliver secure, accurate and timely service) and legal risk (uncertainty about which legislation applies to e-banking transactions), besides emergence of other risks (business and credit risks). ATMs still remain the most successful delivery channel followed by telephone banking and internet banking. With about 9000 off-site and on-site ATMs installed, banks are effectively reaching out to a large customer base at a substantially lower cost. Typically, it costs close to Rs.50 per transaction if conducted in a branch and the same if done through ATM costs about Rs.15. In order to reduce the cost of transaction banks have started out-sourcing and sharing of ATM services and this trend will gather momentum in near future. As this delivery channel gains mass acceptability and is user friendly, the bank can use it to cross-sell its as well as others’ products. For example, banks have already started dispensing railway tickets, movie tickets through their ATMs. In future a bank’s ATM would function like a kiosk delivering more of non-cash transactions, thereby simultaneously reducing the fixed and operating cost of ATM.  BIS Review 57/2003 1 
2 BIS Review 57/2003 Internet Banking-an emerging delivery channel-offers significant cost advantage to banks. A net-based transaction costs the bank only around Rs. 4 and costs per transaction are even lower than those of an ATM, mainly due to savings on prohibitive real estate costs. Internet Banking has failed to take off due to a combination of psychological, legal, technological and socio-economic factors. Lack of critical mass of early adopters, lack of a strong trust environment, slowness in adoption of the internet, low penetration of PCs and access to internet are some of the impediments in the adoption of internet banking in India. With drastic fall in cell phone tariff and emergence of seamless connectivity between fixed and mobile lines, mobile banking is set to emerge as one of the cost-effective delivery channels in near future. Toll-free-numbers would also gain popularity as an important delivery channel. Although banks abroad are using call centre as a delivery channel for some time, banks in India have just begun to exploit it as an effective non-branch delivery channel. The bankers will have to take a comprehensive view about their delivery channels. Till now delivery channels were viewed in terms of cost and technology. Delivery channels were devised focussing mainly on time and place advantage to the customers. However, with the continuing advances in wireless technology, flexibility in delivery channel device would be the forte of banks. Successful adoption of wireless technology would help banks to offer not only any time, anywhere, but also any device banking. Further, banks will have to build integrated delivery channels with both vertical and horizontal integration. In order to do so the banks should install an enabling and compatible multi-channel platform which should support and seamlessly integrate both the existing and future delivery channels.  In today’s distributed computing environments, retail users sign onto many different applications and systems including email, networks, databases and Web servers each typically requiring its own security procedure. The more systems users must navigate, the more IDs and passwords they must remember. Systems should be developed in such a way that a customer can use his ATM card and his own ATM PIN (Personal Identification Number) for customer authentication in a Web transaction, which is normally not done in a Web-based transaction or in any other delivery channel. The process cycle of the above single ‘Signon’ should be that once the customer initiates the transaction by entering the PIN from any of the delivery channels, the PIN entered by the customer is verified with the PIN details of the customer and once the verification yields a positive response the customer will be allowed to perform the transaction. The PIN, which the user enters to perform the transaction, should be a unique PIN that can be used by the customer to perform the transaction across any delivery channel. In short, the banks should have a comprehensive system which will allow them to deliver dynamic end-to-end customer service that can reshape customer base, maximise cross-selling opportunities and generate a positive ROI (Return on Investment) in the changing business economy. 
R Basant Roi: Introduction of government securities at the stock exchange of Mauritius Address by Mr R Basant Roi, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the official launching ceremony for introduction of government securities at the stock exchange of Mauritius, Port Louis, 12 December 2003. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen  Good afternoon  It is a great pleasure to address you this afternoon on the occasion of the Official Launching Ceremony for the introduction of Government securities at the Stock Exchange of Mauritius. It is a greater pleasure still to see that Government securities have finally found their way to the Stock Exchange after several timid attempts made in the past.  Indeed the Bank of Mauritius has been striving for more than a decade to develop a secondary market for Government papers. In November 1992 when the Bank started with the weekly auctioning of Treasury bills a strategy for the development of a secondary market was devised. It remained a paper-strategy and did not find its way through. In February 1994, the Bank made a second attempt. A Secondary Market Cell was set up in-house with a view to kicking-off, with some determination, the development of a secondary market for Government papers. This in-house Cell was initially expected to play a market-making role. Commercial banks did not respond positively to the initiative. The market did not take off. Brokers were eventually invited as participants to play a decisive role in the endeavour. The then strategy of the Bank was not well received. It was not appealing to brokers. As a result of miscarriages, the in-house Secondary Market Cell laboured in routine operations.  In December 1998, the Bank of Mauritius started with the sale of Treasury bills over-the-counter to individuals and non-financial corporations. One of the important objectives of this initiative was to let individuals from all strata of the population familiarize themselves with Treasury bills as an investment instrument. This initiative triggered competition for deposit resources in the banking industry. Individual investors derived some experience with Treasury bills as an investment instrument. The sale of bills over-the-counter by the Bank was a success. Investment in the bills reached a peak of over Rs4 billion. Some 11,000 individuals and financial corporations invested in the bills.  Pursuing its objective to eventually take Government papers for trading on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius, the Bank of Mauritius established, effective 1 February 2002, a Primary Dealer System. At the weekly auctions for Treasury bills four banks, the Mauritius Commercial Bank Ltd., State Bank of Mauritius Ltd, HSBC, and Barclays Bank Plc., were appointed primary dealers. The Bank of Mauritius had decided that traditional bidders for bills at the weekly auctions would be gradually cropped out. Between February 2002 and November 2003 transactions by Primary Dealers with banks amounted to Rs1.9 billion. Their transactions with Corporate bodies amounted Rs10.8 billion. With individuals their transactions amounted to Rs1.6 billion. These give a total amount of over Rs14 billion worth of bills transacted by Primary Dealers. This value of transactions in bills reflects the potential that exists for the trading of Government papers on the Stock Exchange.  So far the number of eligible bidders at the weekly auctions held at the Bank of Mauritius that are not primary dealers has been reduced from around 250 to 11. Over time only the Primary dealers will be eligible to bid at the weekly auctions. Institutional investors like the National Pension Fund, the National Savings Fund and all the remaining banks and other financial institutions will be required to purchase Government papers on the secondary market. This would definitely require major changes in the investment decision-making process within these organizations. They would stand to gain in the medium-term.  Sometime in May last I initiated discussions with Mr. Sunil Benimadhu, Mr. Vipin Mahabeersingh and Mr. Chota Moollan at the Bank of Mauritius on our intention to sell Treasury bills through brokers on the Stock Exchange. Several meetings were since held with myself, the Managing Director and the staff of the Financial Markets Department of the Bank of Mauritius. Discussions were held with stock brokers also. A set of rules and procedures has been defined and was submitted for approval by the Financial Services Commission.  BIS Review 57/2003 1 
2 BIS Review 57/2003 Some six weeks back I had a stimulative exchange of views with the Honourable Minister Sushil Khusiram on this project. The swiftness with which the Honourable Minister made Regulations to that effect reflects his personal commitment and determination for the development of the market for Government papers. I am thankful to him for having supported this initiative.  With hindsight the decision to sell Treasury bills over-the-counter at the Bank of Mauritius was a decision taken in the right direction. I am happy to see that finally the trading of bills will soon take-off on solid foundation. The Stock Exchange of Mauritius, the Central Depository & Settlement Co. and the brokers have put in lots of efforts in the project and I am confident that it will not suffer the miscarriages of the past. Should the Stock Exchange and the brokers require any further assistance from the Bank of Mauritius we will be glad to do so. May I wish all the stakeholders the very best of success.  
Toshihiko Fukui: Recent economic and financial developments in Japan Speech by Mr Toshihiko Fukui, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting in Fukuoka, 8 December 2003. *      *      * I.  The current economic situation and the route to sustainable growth  Largely in line with the standard scenario in the Outlook and Risk Assessment of the Economy and Prices published at the end of October, Japan’s economy is starting to recover gradually, after a period of generally flat economic activity that lasted up until around summer. With corporate earnings improving, business fixed investment continues its gradual recovery. Against the backdrop of an improvement in overseas economies, exports, which had been flat until summer, have started to turn upward. Production, whose recovery had been somewhat delayed due to the unusually cool summer, is starting to increase recently.  The fact that the rise in exports and business fixed investment has led to a recovery in production suggests that cyclical momentum for a recovery is kicking in, and that the Japanese economy is at last settling onto a recovery path.  From the second half of fiscal 2003 through fiscal 2004, a moderate recovery is expected to continue. Exports and production are likely to continue increasing against the background of high growth in the United States and Asia, particularly in China, with a recovery in global demand for IT-related goods. In Europe, it is becoming more apparent that the economy has bottomed out. There is a greater probability that these increases in exports and production will promote further business fixed investment along with the improvement in corporate earnings.  The pace of the recovery will most likely be contained to a moderate clip, considering ongoing structural adjustment pressures as well as not so favorable prospects for employment and income. The corporate sector, especially non-manufacturing, is still suffering from excess debt. With no clear signs of improvement in employment and income, personal consumption is expected to continue following a generally flat trend. It will be quite some time before we can eliminate the word “moderate” from the description of the current recovery.  After decreasing constantly for five and a half years, the consumer price index excluding fresh food, which we refer to as the core CPI, increased by 0.1 percent year-on-year in October. This was partly due to a hike in rice prices caused by the unusually cool summer, in addition to factors such as the rise in medical treatment costs and the tobacco tax.  Although the core CPI may fluctuate due to temporary factors, its underlying trend is expected to be for a slight decline during the rest of fiscal 2003 and throughout fiscal 2004 since aggregate demand is projected to remain short of potential supply capacity.  Naturally, this standard scenario entails various uncertainties, or what we term risk factors. Among them, we pay particular attention to the global demand for IT-related goods, the U.S. economy, the domestic financial system, and financial market developments. These risk factors may cause the Japanese economy to deviate from the standard scenario laid out in the Outlook and Risk Assessment, either upward or downward.  To overcome deflation and return to a sustainable growth path, a cyclical recovery alone is not sufficient. Structural problems must be dealt with, and expectations of higher growth must be formed. We need to address excess debt in the corporate sector and weakness in the financial system. We need to raise expectations of growth among firms and households, who seek for new value added, so that these may be translated into brisker spending.  In the corporate sector, steady efforts have been made, stretching over more than 10 years, to solve problems such as excess debt and labor. In fact, large manufacturers have largely succeeded in eradicating these excesses. As break-even points have been lowered, the ratio of current profits to sales for such firms has improved to its highest level since the bursting of the bubble.  Some manufacturers are aggressively pursuing improvements in productivity by investing in newly growing businesses and constructing a more efficient international division of labor. Spread of such movements throughout the corporate sector, including to non-manufacturers and to small and BIS Review 57/2003 1 
medium-sized firms, is one of the key factors to enhancing expectations of growth generally and reinvigorating Japan’s economy.  II. Conduct of monetary policy  The Bank of Japan is continuing to provide ample liquidity, targeting an outstanding balance of current account deposits at the Bank under its quantitative easing policy. Since the beginning of the year, the target has been significantly raised twice, in April and May, in light of risk factors such as the war in Iraq and severe acute respiratory syndrome.  Furthermore, in October, the Bank raised the upper limit of the range for the target balance of current account deposits. This was intended to reinforce the nascent recovery by enhancing the flexibility of money market operations when providing liquidity to the market. With the economy in an incipient recovery phase with its concomitant uncertainties, there is the potential for subtle fluctuations in the expectations of market participants and changes in funding needs. The Bank has sought to respond flexibly in its market operations to any possible changes of these sorts, so that it can reinforce the current stirrings of recovery.  The outstanding balance of current account deposits now stands around 30 trillion yen, having risen from around 20 trillion yen at the beginning of the year. The Bank conducts market operations centering on this balance by carefully monitoring daily market conditions.  In order to help the effects of monetary easing through the provision of ample liquidity to permeate the whole economy, the Bank is taking measures to strengthen the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in corporate finance. In August, the Bank began the purchase of asset-backed securities collateralized by assets mainly related to small and medium-sized firms. The Bank recently decided to accept syndicated loans as eligible collateral.  In addition to their immediate monetary policy implications, these measures will also contribute, over the long run, to establishing a new shape for corporate finance, better compatible with Japan’s future economy. We hope that our initiatives will act as a trigger, spurring the private sector to explore various new market-based funding channels to supplement the traditional bank lending channel.  III.  Enhancing transparency in the conduct of monetary policy  There are two points that are of pivotal importance when conducting monetary policy. One is to implement effective policy in a timely manner. The other is to provide the public with a lucid explanation and promote their understanding of the Bank’s evaluation of economic and price developments as well as the thinking upon which it bases its policy decisions.  The new Bank of Japan Law stipulates that the Bank, which has been given independence to conduct monetary policy at it own discretion, must make efforts to be more accountable for its decision. We think that the greater the public understanding of the thinking behind monetary policy, the more effective that monetary policy will be.  Bearing these points in mind, the Bank made two major decisions to enhance the transparency of monetary policy at the Monetary Policy Meeting in October.  First, measures were taken to provide the public with a lucid explanation of the Bank’s evaluation of economic and price developments in a timely manner. In addition to the semiannual report on the Outlook and Risk Assessment of the Economy and Prices in April and October, the Bank decided to carry out interim assessments of economic and price developments in January and July, and to release the result of its discussions accordingly. These interim assessments are designed to investigate possible deviations of economic and price developments from the standard scenario presented in the Outlook and Risk Assessment three months before.  Second, the Bank published a more detailed description of its commitment to maintaining the quantitative easing policy. The Bank had already committed to maintaining the current policy until the core CPI registers a stable year-on-year rate of increase of zero percent or above. In October, it decided to clarify the meaning of the phrase “registers stably a zero percent or an increase year-on-year” in a more concrete manner.  Specifically, quantitative easing will be continued until the following two conditions are met.  2 BIS Review 57/2003 
First, not only must the most recently published core CPI register a year-on-year rate of increase of zero percent or above, but this tendency must be confirmed over a few months.  Second, the year-on-year rate of increase in the prospective core CPI must not be expected to register zero percent or below. In other words, the majority of Policy Board members need to make the forecast that the core CPI will register a year-on-year rate of increase greater than zero percent during the forecasting period. This forecasting period is roughly a year starting from April in the April Outlook and Risk Assessment, and roughly a year and a half, which is the second half of the current financial year starting from October and the whole of the next financial year ending in March, in the October Outlook and Risk Assessment.  The above two conditions are necessary conditions. However, we have also announced that there may be cases when the Bank will judge it appropriate to continue with quantitative easing even if these conditions are fulfilled.  Since its announcement, we have received a few questions about this detailed description of the commitment. Let me answer two major questions.  The first question is why the Bank does not carry out interim assessments of economic and price developments every month. Since the economy is changing constantly, perhaps, theoretically speaking, we should carry out the interim assessments every month, or even every week.  Against this theoretical possibility, we judge it appropriate that the Outlook and Risk Assessment and interim assessments should be released roughly every three months in light of their objective to present a basic view of how the economy will develop over a reasonable period of time. We cannot revise the basic view about the economy and prices in an appropriate manner without sufficient accumulation of critical data. Also we may confuse the market if we release assessments based on insufficient data or if we change our assessments too frequently. Actually, many central banks abroad release their monetary policy reports or inflation reports every three months.  This does not, of course, imply that the Bank will make policy changes only every three months. Although conducting the basic evaluation roughly every three months, we need to closely examine the ever-changing state of the economy and prices and to carefully deliberate on the need for policy changes at every Monetary Policy Meeting. As has always been the case, if the need arises, the Bank will adjust its policy in a timely and appropriate manner, regardless of the frequency and timing of the release of the Outlook and Risk Assessment and interim assessments.  The second question concerns the risk that more detailed description of the commitment to maintaining the quantitative easing policy may affect the Bank’s ability to conduct monetary policy in a flexible and timely manner in future. It may be natural to ask this question, because it is extremely unusual for a central bank to link its future policy conduct to a particular economic indicator, such as the core CPI in the case of Japan.  While paying due attention to this kind of risk, we have come to the conclusion that, with a number of obstacles still confronting Japan’s economy as it seeks to overcome deflation and settle onto a more solid recovery path, such a detailed description of the commitment is necessary at the current time. This detailed description is a manifestation of our strong determination regarding the future conduct of monetary policy.  IV. Current state of the financial system  On the whole, the current state of the financial system in Japan remains severe. It should be noted, however, that at some financial institutions, especially major banks, efforts to improve financial conditions have gradually begun to bear fruit.  For the financial year ending in September, profitability improved significantly at all major banks, except for Resona Group, which received an injection of public funds. This was mostly thanks to successful reductions by all major banks of losses from nonperforming loan disposals, on a year-on-year basis at the end of September 2003. These reductions were partly due to large capital increases and higher provisioning in the previous financial year ending in March 2003. After registering a record high at the end of March 2002, the amount outstanding of nonperforming loans continued to decrease as progress was made in the removal of nonperforming loans from balance sheets.  BIS Review 57/2003 3 
Major banks improved stability of their profitability by reducing their shareholdings, which had been blamed for large fluctuations in profits. In fact, banks’ shareholdings had decreased to levels well below Tier 1 capital at the end of September.  To strengthen profitability, major banks made efforts in cutting costs and increasing fee incomes. These efforts have gradually begun to be reflected in their financial results.  Moving on to conditions surrounding regional financial institutions, let me first touch on the recent case of Ashikaga Bank. Last month, Ashikaga Bank informed the government that it had negative net worth at the end of September, and that there was a risk of suspending repayment of deposits. Considering the significant financial role played by Ashikaga Bank in the region, including Tochigi Prefecture, the government judged that a serious disruption of the financial system in the region might occur if no measures were taken. The Prime Minister summoned the Financial System Management Council, of which I am a member, and decided upon the temporary nationalization of Ashikaga Bank, pursuant to Article 102 of the Deposit Insurance Law at the end of last month.  As a temporarily nationalized bank, Ashikaga Bank will continue normal operations, and all of the bank’s obligations, including deposits and interbank borrowings, will be met smoothly. A new management team will carry out appropriate business operations, while seeking to transfer its business to an assuming financial institution as soon as possible. As part of this process, the Bank of Japan will provide liquidity, including the extension of special loans pursuant to Article 38 of the Bank of Japan Law if necessary.  Fortunately, at present, no other regional financial institution faces conditions of comparable severity. In fact, financial statement at the end of September 2003 showed improvements at more than a few regional financial institutions as losses from the disposal of nonperforming loans were reduced.  Regional financial institutions, however, seem to lag behind major banks in addressing tasks, such as appropriately evaluating the economic value of nonperforming loans, making provisions accordingly, and working toward corporate revitalization. While land prices continue to decline, small and medium-sized nonmanufacturing firms, which dominate regional economies, find their business recovering only too gradually. In these difficult circumstances, it is increasingly hoped that regional financial institutions will play an active role. We at the Bank will do as much as we can to support their efforts in this regard, through supervision and other means, whenever the occasion presents itself.  V. Issues for 2004  2004 is the final year of preparation for the removal of blanket protection of demand deposits in April 2005. This removal, in my view, should not be perceived simply as an adjustment of the extent to which deposit insurance protection is applicable. Rather, it should be recognized as the last hurdle before the management of financial institutions becomes truly independent from regulatory authorities.  At the end of March 2005, major banks are expected to reduce their nonperforming loan ratios to about half autumn 2002 levels. At the same time, the Industrial Revitalization Corporation of Japan will cease its purchase of loan assets. From April 2005, fixed asset impairment accounting rules will be introduced.  Firms continue to strengthen their business structures and competitiveness. Initiatives based on the private sector’s creativity and vitality will be the driving force for Japan to achieve steady economic growth under global competition.  Together with firms, financial institutions also play an important role in supporting the Japanese economy. Dynamic expansion of the economy will not be possible if financial institutions remain dependent on regulatory authorities and generous safety nets. Not only firms but also financial institutions will be confronted with frequent new entries to and withdrawals from the market, as well as consolidation and reorganization in their respective industries. This makes it all the more critical for financial institutions to demonstrate their firm intention to stand on their own feet, and enhance their credibility in the market.  In this regard, let me point out some of the major tasks to be addressed in 2004. In order to achieve reform of the economic structure and a sound financial system more rapidly, financial institutions, especially major banks, must work harder with firms to revitalize the corporate sector, while expediting the disposal of nonperforming loans. It is true that some financial institutions have already established subsidiaries specializing in corporate revitalization. Further efforts, however, are still required in areas 4 BIS Review 57/2003 
BIS Review 57/2003 5 such as the more effective use of the Industrial Revitalization Corporation of Japan and the Resolution and Collection Corporation.  In corporate revitalization, regional financial institutions basically face the same problems as major banks. There are more than a few borrower firms with competitive technology and expertise, which find it difficult to improve profitability because of the financial legacy of past borrowing. For this reason, the strategically important issues that many regional financial institutions address include the provision of detailed consultation services to borrower firms, the extension of greater assistance to borrower firms, and the prompt realization of business revival. We hope that their efforts will bear fruit.  Financial institutions also have an important role to play in helping the corporate sector to develop the new businesses that will underpin Japan’s future economy, while at the same time supporting ailing business firms. Regional financial institutions in particular are expected to play an active role in generating new businesses in their region. We observe the first shoots of new regional businesses in a variety of areas: biotechnology and other advanced technologies, new industrial clusters linked to recycling and other environment-related technologies, as well as regional city revival, sightseeing, medical care, and nursing services.  To strengthen such trends, regional financial institutions are expected to play a new role in their regions. In this regard, the thinking behind their business decision-making in the past needs to be radically overhauled. For example, decisions about whether or not to assume particular risks should be based on a close examination of the nature of projects at hand rather than depending unduly on traditional collateral or guarantee-based methods. They should also raise their levels of expertise at providing advisory services relating to the smooth management of projects. This in turn will lead to the revitalization of regional financial institutions themselves.  Once the blanket protection of demand deposits is removed, financial institutions will no longer be able to count on support from the authorities. In principle, they will have to rely entirely on their own intellectual resources and creativity in dealing with the tasks facing them, including the nonperforming loan problem.  It is conceivable, however, that there may be financial institutions, which are keen to rebuild their financial base, but which may not be able to strengthen their capital positions within the limited time frame without outside assistance. To deal with this possibility, injections of public funds which may be executed without reference to systemic risk should be considered apart from the measure stipulated in Article 102 of the Deposit Insurance Law.  I am aware of a variety of learned opinions calling for caution in establishing another system of capital injections. Bearing these opinions in mind, I hope that we will somehow manage to find a way to design an appropriate new framework - one that will function as the last public support to the efforts of the private sector.  In closing, let me reiterate our determination to support the efforts of the private sector and to exert ourselves to the full to achieve sustainable growth.  
Villy Bergström: Can we be best again? The importance of capital formation for long-term growth Speech by Mr Villy Bergström, Deputy Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, at a meeting in Kiruna, 8 December 2003. *      *      * I would like to begin by thanking you for the invitation to come here and speak before the local group of the Center for Business and Policy Studies.  I intend to speak today about the factors that affect a country’s long-term growth capacity. To this end, I will focus on the role played in this regard by capital formation, but will also discuss other important factors such as changes in both the labour supply and the age structure of the population in the coming years. Like many other countries, Sweden is facing the problem of an ageing population. This is going to place a greater burden on the public finances and will entail increased demands on the working population to forgo consumption in favour of supporting the elderly. Meanwhile, labour force growth in Sweden will be slower in the years ahead. Moreover, the rate of net investment in Sweden is low in comparison to previous periods. This affects Sweden’s long-term growth capacity and thereby also the prosperity of people in general. It is these topics that I shall be concentrating on in my speech today. But allow me first to begin with a few words about the Riksbank’s role in this context. The Riksbank has little opportunity to influence Sweden’s long-term growth capacity As everyone knows, one of the Riksbank’s statutory remits is to promote price stability. A large part of the Riksbank’s operations revolve around this remit. In order to be successful in this regard, it is important that the process of wage formation works well and that both the central and local governments manage their finances in a responsible manner. Relatively stable inflation in recent years and expectations of future inflation around the Riksbank’s target of 2 per cent indicate that the Bank has been successful in its conduct of monetary policy in recent years. This success has been largely attributable to increased stability in economic policy in general; in particular, fiscal policy has been governed by a ceiling for central government expenditure and a surplus target for the public finances. Furthermore, partly as a result of greater credibility for the Riksbank’s inflation target, the social partners have managed to halve the rate of wage increases from the levels that were common in the 1970s and 1980s. These circumstances have formed the environment in which the Riksbank has acted in recent years.  The very point of giving the Riksbank’s objective of price stability high priority in economic policy is that a stable economic environment fosters economic growth and high employment. The experiences from the beginning of the 1970s and 20 years thereafter indicate that high inflation, devaluations that fuelled economic growth followed by austerity measures to prevent overheating, entailed weak productivity growth and a drop in the standard of living compared with other industrialised nations. The Riksbank can help to create a favourable environment for rapid economic growth but the growth itself must come from other sources than monetary policy. Nevertheless, the Riksbank has every reason to take an interest in these sources of economic growth since fast growth facilitates the Riksbank’s task. This task involves tightening or easing monetary policy to regulate demand, so that it keeps even pace with our country’s growth capacity. In that way inflation is stabilised. A higher potential rate of growth allows scope for higher aggregate demand without giving rise to inflationary pressures. Long-term growth and demand The Riksbank distinguishes between two concepts of growth: potential growth and demand-driven growth. Potential growth is the rate of growth that is sustainable in the long term, taking account of resource growth in the economy and how effectively these resources are employed. Thus, you could say that potential growth is determined by a combination of labour force growth, investment activity and scientific and technological progress. The latter determines how efficiently the labour force and capital can be utilised. None of these fundamental factors can be influenced by the Riksbank other than temporarily. The Riksbank’s work is, however, affected by potential growth. The higher the BIS Review 56/2003 1 
long-term sustainable rate of growth, the easier it is for us to balance aggregate demand in the economy so that it coincides with what is available for household consumption, business investment and the needs of the public sector. So monetary policy cannot raise the potential growth rate but, in a worst case scenario, as we witnessed during the 1970s and 1980s, it can worsen our chances of attaining a high potential growth rate by affecting demand in the economy in the wrong way. Consequently, on an abstract level, the “formula” for economic growth is very simple. It is the weighted sum of labour force growth and capital growth as well as technological progress.   However, when we compare growth between different countries, it is not that interesting to note that a country has high growth because its labour force is growing fast. It is the standard of living that is of interest and this does not have to improve just because the population and labour force are growing. The important issue instead is how quickly a country’s production grows per capita and this leads us into concepts such as productivity in a broad sense. For productivity is just that - production per capita. It can be measured per inhabitant, per employee or per hour worked. The concepts are closely related. One interesting observation is that the United States’ rapid growth in recent years has been attributable mainly to high labour force growth. Productivity in the United States, however, has not been faster than in Sweden. During the first half of the 1990s, Swedish productivity growth was among the most vigorous in the world, which resulted in increased prosperity for Swedish citizens. During the 1950s and 1960s, productivity growth in Sweden increased further. This was partly due to considerable reconstruction needs following the Second World War and the robust demand that resulted from this. In addition, trade was liberalised during this period which led to stiffer competition, and - most of all - capital formation was rapid. The favourable productivity growth during these years furthered Sweden’s prosperity. In 1970, Sweden was in fourth place in the OECD league in terms of GDP per capita, which means that it was one of the four richest countries in the world. During the period that followed, however, productivity growth was appreciably slower and it is widely known that the 1970s and 1980s were bad periods for Sweden. Today, Sweden finds itself in 17th place in the OECD league and is below the average for industrialised countries. What caused this decline then? It may be relevant to look at the reasons behind Sweden’s weak growth during the 20 years up to the mid 1990s. These are mistakes that we need to avoid in the future.  When I discuss this unsuccessful period in Sweden I will mainly focus on productivity since it is the measure that determines our standard of living. We then have to somewhat modify the growth formula that I mentioned earlier. The basic growth mechanism for our standard of living, i.e. labour productivity, now becomes the weighted sum of capital growth per capita and technological progress. Given a constant age structure of the population, and an evenly balanced age pyramid, the basic formula for growth in the standard of living can also be expressed as the weighted sum of capital growth per employee and technological progress (a complication that I will return to later is that the age structure is not constant). Capital formation contributed to lower productivity growth in Sweden Why did it go badly for Sweden during the 1970s and 1980s? First, it should be noted that the majority of industrialised nations suffered a drop in productivity growth from the beginning of the 1970s. This was due to the supply shock associated with the first oil crisis, when the price of oil tripled, followed by a second oil crisis at the end of the 1970s when the price once again increased threefold but this time from a higher level. As we know, the price of oil affects many parts of the economy. Oil is used as energy for transport and heating purposes and its price therefore has a direct impact on the costs of these. Moreover, firms’ costs are affected since oil products are often used as intermediate inputs in, for example, different plastic products. So all countries encountered problems due to the oil supply shock, but productivity growth declined more in Sweden than in other countries.  Many explanations have been put forward for this. Social benefits were improved during this time. Compensation for sick leave was raised and the qualifying day was abolished. Furthermore, legislation was introduced for job security and co-determination in the workplace. Many believe that firms’ costs rose and that production was disrupted by sick leave and other kinds of leaves of absence that had also been introduced. These factors are difficult to assess but it is likely that they contributed. At the same time as the oil price shock, the Swedish economy was also hit by a domestic cost crisis which resulted in a decline in production. In spite of this, firms retained employees to a greater extent than in other countries, which led to lower growth in labour productivity.  2 BIS Review 56/2003 
Moreover, in the mid 1970s, there were dramatic changes in capital formation, which undoubtedly explain some of the slowdown in productivity growth. Of course, this capital growth is in turn the result of a variety of economic conditions for enterprise and the public sector, including those mentioned earlier. For the most part we speak about investment activity in our country in gross terms. This concept also includes such investment that is needed to replace the depreciation that occurs during all production. When we exclude the part of gross investment that is made to compensate for this depreciation, we are left with net investment. Net investment is the new additions to the capital that is already employed in production in the form of plant, machinery and buildings. So, as regards net investment, in other words the contribution to capital formation, this was more than halved as a percentage of GDP in the mid 1970s. This meant two things.  First, capital growth per employee, or per hour worked, fell. For a number of years, investment dropped so much that capital per employee in the business sector actually declined. In other words, each employee worked with less capital. In order to illustrate what capital per employee means, we can take an extreme example, namely what a lone worker can accomplish when digging with a spade and iron bar compared with a hydraulic excavator. The latter represents considerably more capital per employee than just digging with a spade, as well as substantially less physical effort for the worker. Therefore, we should expect productivity growth to fall when capital per employee declines.   But there is also another indirect effect. With new capital, new technology is introduced into the production process. Investment is the means for putting new technology and research into practical production. Through investment, new methods and new technology are ushered into production processes. For this reason, we should expect less technological progress in production when capital formation falls. An excavator is so much more than a large number of spades; it represents entirely new technology that affects the whole production process.   Figure 1 shows that capital formation, net investment as a percentage of GDP, fell in the mid 1970s - from around 15 per cent of GDP to about 5 per cent. So growth in capital per employee was slower from the mid 1970s, and new technology was not employed to the same extent as before. Such a dramatic change has to have consequences. This is evident in the bottom curve showing the current account, which was almost always in deficit during the 20 years after 1975 because Sweden’s saving declined even more than investment. It was only during the first half of the 1990s that a surplus was restored, as a result of a weaker krona, higher capital formation and even higher saving. Figure1.

In order to illustrate the importance of the lower capital formation, I have compiled productivity data from the period when the marked change took place (see Table 1). In the 1980s, the lower capital growth had been established. Capital per employee - capital intensity - had been more than halved both in industry and in the business sector as a whole. Productivity growth followed this trend and was more than halved from the high growth levels of the 1960s. This means that the value of the work performed decreased, as did the scope for higher real wages.  Table 1. Capital intensity and productivity growth  Industry   Business sector   Capital/ employee Productivity Capital/ employee Productivity 1963-70  8.3% 7.6% 6.5% 5.3% 1970-80  6.3% 3.4% 6.2% 3.2% 1980-86  2.8% 3.2% 3.0% 2.0% Source: Own calculations  The previous diagram also shows that the level of capital formation in relation to our total resources that we had during the 1960s has not returned but that the fluctuations have been larger after the mid 1970s. On average we have remained at approximately one-third of the level of resources that we previously had allocated to new capital. One difference is that saving has increased, but not investment. This means that we are exporting capital. Despite a continuation of relatively low capital formation, the weak trend seen in total Swedish labour productivity in recent years was broken during the first half of the 1990s when productivity growth increased. But it was other factors than capital formation that contributed to this. Among other things, the economic crisis at the beginning of the 1990s led to substantial rationalisation measures and the winding up of low-productivity operations, which resulted in increased productivity growth but also high unemployment. During the same period, there was also a shift in Swedish economic policy in order to create conditions for more sustainable long-term economic growth. This shift in fiscal and monetary policy led to increased stability and predictability, which most likely enhanced the efficiency of the economy. Moreover, the tax and social security systems were reformed. Sweden’s entry into the EU’s single market together with the deregulation of several important markets also entailed stiffer competition. Furthermore, the faster growth in the private sector compared to the public sector, as well as the evolution of the ICT sector during the second half of the 1990s, most likely contributed to higher productivity growth. Against the background of the lower capital formation since the 1970s, however, it is worth asking what the prospects for Swedish growth are in the years ahead. Will we be able to regain any of our previously prominent position as a comparatively rich industrialised nation? What does the low level of capital formation imply for Sweden’s chances of recapturing the leading position it had among industrialised nations at the beginning of the 1970s? It is important here to note that the structure of the business sector has changed. The industrial sector as a whole, including the basic industries, such as mining, ironworks and steelworks, and paper and pulp, have decreased as a proportion of GDP in favour of the expanding services industries. Basic industries’ share has fallen from 6.5 per cent of GDP in 1970 to just over 4 per cent today, while service production in the business sector has increased from approximately 30 per cent of GDP to just over 40 per cent during the same period. We have therefore moved further and further away from capital-intensive production to production that is more dependent on human capital than heavy plant and machinery. Another factor to take into account is the decline in housing construction, which has also contributed to the drop in the figures for capital formation. However, housing construction does not have the same importance for productivity growth as industrial investment, for example. This means that the dramatic decline in capital formation does not have to imply an equivalent fall in productivity growth. Nevertheless, I still have the impression that we are focusing less on capital formation than before. This is indicated by the fact that structural change is currently relatively limited. 4 BIS Review 56/2003 
The labour supply Permit me now to discuss the other component that determines a country’s long-term growth capacity besides productivity, namely the labour supply. This is determined by the number of people in work and the number of hours they work. The number of hours worked rose during the years after the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. This was partly due to greater demand for labour, to a rise in the working age population (20-64 years) and relatively low numbers on sick leave. The trend in the number of hours worked has been broken in recent years, however. This is because the total number of people on sick leave has risen in Sweden since 1997-1998. According to the most common measurement methods, Sweden has the highest incidence of sick leave in the EU. There has also been an increase in work absence due to holiday and other leaves of absence as well as a decrease in overtime and additional working hours. Meanwhile, the labour market has not made satisfactory use of the immigrant population in Sweden. The employment rate among this group has been markedly lower than among native Swedes. In addition, according to Statistics Sweden, population growth in the years ahead will be less favourable from a labour force perspective than it has been up to now. The number of people of working age will indeed continue to rise but by an increasingly smaller amount. This is because the number of people entering retirement in the years ahead will rise sharply. In particular, large numbers of the 1940s generation will start to retire in a few years. This could have a negative impact on potential growth.   Over the coming 10-year period, the number of people over 65 years of age is estimated to rise by 270 000 - some 1.6 per cent per year on average. Between 2012 and 2030, this group will increase by around 1.3 per cent per year. The number of people of working age is forecast to rise by 170 000 over the coming 10-year period, i.e. by only approximately 0.3 per cent per year. Between 2012 and 2030, the increase in the working age population is estimated to average 0.05 per cent per year, which in effect amounts to stagnation. In all, this means that measures will need to be taken to boost the supply of labour in the years ahead. These could be achieved by reducing the numbers on sick leave and if fewer people were to take early retirement. The trend also implies greater demands on people to enter working life at an earlier age and on increased labour force participation among the elderly. Moreover, we currently have an unutilised labour force reserve in the form of our immigrant population. The employment rate among this group averages about 30 per cent lower than that of native Swedes. Measures to improve integration of immigrants into the labour market could make a positive contribution to the labour supply. For example, growth in the number of hours worked could be 0.4 percentage points higher per year up to 2008 if the Government’s target of halving sick leave were to be attained. Furthermore, if the labour reserve represented by our immigrant population were to be utilised, the number of hours worked could rise further. If this reserve were to be utilised to the same extent as native Swedes, the number of hours worked could rise an additional 0.1 percentage points. This would have a positive impact on potential growth. Heavier burden on the public finances As I mentioned initially, it is important that monetary policy and the wage formation process are efficient and that the central and local governments manage their finances in a satisfactory way. The change in the population’s age structure in the years ahead is not only a challenge to future potential growth. It also has other implications.  For instance, the population trend means that the proportion of people that are 65 years or older will increase from 17 per cent today to 23 per cent in 2030. At the same time, the working age population will decrease from 59 to 54 per cent during the same period. This implies that the working age population in Sweden will have to support an increasingly large proportion of both the young and elderly. At present, each person of working age supports 0.70 people that do not work - in other words, the young and old. By 2030, it is forecast that each person of working age will have to support 0.84 people, which represents a rise in the dependency burden of 20 per cent. The whole increase in the dependency burden is due to the retirement of large numbers from specific generations, the 1940s generation in the years 2005-2015 and the 1960s generation in the years around 2030, at the same time as average life expectancy is expected to increase. So if we only take the elderly into account, BIS Review 56/2003 5 
each person of working age today supports 0.29 people that are 65 years or older. By 2030, this is forecast to have risen to 0.42. So the problems we are seeing today with the public sector’s financing are a trifle compared with what awaits us if nothing is done. The population’s age structure will entail great demands on welfare services and thereby a heavier burden on the public finances. In addition, a smaller supply of labour and a resultant lower level of production will mean a drop in receipts for the Government.  However, the problems would increase even in the event of even population growth. The structural shift implied by an ever larger production of services is also a problem in this context. Workers in the services sector demand the same wage as other parts of the population despite considerably slower productivity growth compared with the industrial sector, which is exposed to competition. The latter is undergoing constant rationalisation through an increasing ratio of capital per employee - something that is not quite as feasible in the services sector. This means that the relative price of services is increasing over time, which is a particularly large problem when services, like in Sweden, are largely provided by the public sector and financed via taxes. The wage rises that are being driven forward by the high-productivity industrial sector are spreading to services and could entail consequent increases in prices and taxes.  Allow me finally to touch upon an overlooked industrial sector in Swedish business - basic industries.  Basic industries - a good example. In the public debate during the 1990s on the New Economy, it was often claimed that the old industrial society had had its day and that traditional industry would suffer the same fate as agriculture. Basic industries, which are roughly composed of the iron and steel industry, paper and wood product industry and mining, have indeed declined in significance in recent decades, especially for employment, but are still important for net exports. While the rise and fall of the ICT sector during a number of years has taken centre stage in the debate, an evolution has long been under way within other industry. For it is in non-ICT industries that much of the gains afforded by the new technology have been achieved and will be able to be achieved.  Basic industries have undergone marked structural change. For example, average production capacity per mill in the forestry sector has increased eight times for paper manufacture and six times for the manufacture of pulp in the past 40 years. The small mills have been closed down and there is now a substantial concentration of companies. The exploitation of economies of scale as well as stricter environmental standards have forced companies to invest on a large scale. Sweden currently accounts for about 3 per cent of paper manufacture in the world and 9 per cent of exports. Almost 85 per cent of the production of paper and pulp is exported. It is true that the mining industry is not as big as it once was. Its value added today accounts for just over 1 per cent of the total value added in industry. But after a period of stagnation at the beginning of the 1990s, net exports of ore increased at the end of the same decade to account for approximately 2 per cent of total net exports of industrial products. LKAB accounts for approximately 4 per cent of world trade in iron ore, and Swedish companies hold a dominant position in Europe in terms of production of iron, silver and lead.1  In spite of competition from countries with considerably faster-growing forests and cheaper ore, as well as the fact that technology in some areas has become easier to transfer between countries, the basic industries have survived several crises over the years. The reason for this and for the fact that basic industries are still relatively important today is probably that the owners of industry and its executive management have been quick to assimilate new technology and have constantly sought to refine and create a niche for their businesses. They have substituted labour for capital at a fast rate (see Figure 2) . Sweden’s biggest paper and pulp mill, Husum outside Örnsköldsvik, is run by 113 people per shift, while Boliden’s opencast mine, Maurliden, employs around 12 people when the mine is in operation.                                                       1  Svensk Basindustri , Ds 2001:63 (Basic industries in Sweden, Ds 2001:63) 6 BIS Review 56/2003

The contrast is striking compared with the rusting steel-industry and the problem-ridden forestry industry in the United States where attempts have been made to circumvent the necessary adjustment by way of import tariffs.  While Swedish industry as a whole lost just under 20 per cent of its world market shares in relation to other OECD countries between 1970 and 1990, basic industries recovered towards the end of the 1980s. Basic industries also outperformed other industry in terms of productivity, with vigorous productivity growth in particular during the second half of the 1980s. In the iron and steel industry, for example, productivity rose sharply between 1977 and 1984, reflecting extensive rationalisation measures especially as regards the manufacture of merchant steel. As I said earlier, Swedish capital formation as a percentage of GDP was halved in the mid 1970s. Thus, factors other than a good supply of cheap real capital have been behind the favourable development of basic industries. Our country has specialised in capital-intensive process industry based on inexpensive energy and a good supply of raw materials, notably wood. Thus, the driving force has mainly been the supply of energy and raw materials rather than cheap real capital. Another important factor is growth in total factor productivity. This is a result of technological progress and essentially measures how much production can rise during a given period without needing to increase labour and capital. Total factor productivity depends in turn on how many resources the country and industry invest in R&D. In 12 of 19 industrial sectors, R&D intensity is higher in Sweden than in the other OECD countries. Relative R&D intensity is particularly high - that is R&D compared with corresponding sectors in other countries - in basic industries, i.e. in the steel and paper industry. Besides a cheap supply of energy and raw materials, the success of basic industries is also due to the relatively sharp focus on R&D compared with other countries. Figure 3 shows that productivity in the paper and pulp industry is a result of internally generated technological progress as opposed to closures of weak units, which is predominant in other sectors.

The Figure does not show a complete breakdown of productivity and therefore does not sum up to 100. A full breakdown would also include covariance terms. See, for example, Foster, Haltiwangerand Krizan(1998), Bureau of Census, USA. Sources: StatisticsSweden and the Riksbank  Overall, the standard of living in Sweden has dropped in comparison with other countries because the country’s total factor productivity has lagged behind. We have fallen from a leading position in terms of standard of living to being a relatively poor industrialised nation with a below average income per capita among OECD countries. Our fall behind in total factor productivity is evident in industries such as engineering and chemicals while our basic industries have performed well. It could be said that since relative R&D expenses have been especially high in our basic industries, it has helped to ‘conserve’ the traditional industrial structure. It has even been claimed that our standard of living lags behind that of other countries because we have locked the factors of production into traditional basic industries. This is wrong of course. The alternative conclusion is that if Swedish business as a whole had been as alert to developments as the basic industries, and invested as much in R&D compared with other countries, Sweden would not have declined into relative poverty. Conclusions - well, can we be best again? Growth is now in the focus of the public debate in Sweden. It is important that we re-establish a relatively high standard of living and cope with the unfavourable consequences of our population trend - not least for the sake of our public finances. Moreover, if we succeed in our work to create high potential growth, the Riksbank would be able to refrain from tightening monetary policy in times of low growth. It is vital that we lay the foundations to enable an increase in the labour supply in the years ahead. First, it is important to create conditions that enable our immigrant population to work. It is also important that economic policy is focused on finding ways to reduce the distortional effects of the tax and benefit system, not least as regards people’s willingness to work and the motivation of entrepreneurs to start up new businesses within all Swedish industries.  It is mainly an increase in productivity that lays the foundations for long-term growth. Thus, a fundamental precondition for success is to re-establish a high rate of capital formation and thereby the introduction of new technology. But we do not primarily need to increase saving, since we have a substantial current account surplus. Investment in Sweden could replace capital exports. The evolution of basic industries also demonstrates that investment in R&D has the potential to yield considerable productivity gains and that old industrial sectors do not have to be written off. Therefore, it is important that we do not lose our traditionally successful basic industries and only focus on ICT and biotechnology, not to mention the so-called creative industries. Our basic industries 8 BIS Review 56/2003 
BIS Review 56/2003 9 have demonstrated their staying power; they have coped with major structural change and are growing steadily. They are also the industries in Swedish business that, compared with their counterparts in other countries, have come furthest in terms of technological level, productivity and innovation. So there is also scope for an expansion of the capital-intensive basic industries.   Allow me to conclude by saying that we certainly have the potential to be among the best again. But it will require diligence, enterprise, increased investment and a healthier population. It took 20 years to go from being one of the richest countries to being a comparatively poor industrialised nation. Productivity will have to improve a few tenths of one per cent more than in other countries year in and year out for a couple of decades. So it will take an equivalent period of persistent effort to regain a leading position.  Thank you. 
Jürgen Stark: Ten years of Maastricht - currency union leading to political union? Lecture by Dr Jürgen Stark, Vice President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the 17th European Finance Convention, London, 2 December 2003. *      *      * I The Treaty on European Union - better known as the Maastricht Treaty - entered into force ten years ago on 1 November 1993. The then 12 EC member states launched at that time an innovative and unique approach to creating in Europe an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).  This was only the latest step in a far-reaching process of economic integration initiated 50 years ago. Back then, it soon became clear that the time was not ripe for political integration. The pragmatic path which was being followed went from economic to monetary integration. The wider political purpose of establishing in Europe an area of peace and prosperity has been served well by this approach, despite all major and minor setbacks.  EMU brought about a profound transformation within the international monetary system. Sovereign countries showed their determination to hand over one of the major instruments of macroeconomic policy making to a supranational institution. The historical dimension of this political project is undisputed. Europe - at least continental Europe - has fundamentally changed with the creation of EMU and the consequential introduction of the euro.  The project has weathered many storms in the past ten years. However, thundery clouds are still lingering. It is obvious that not everybody has fully grasped all the ramifications of this project. The damage done by the legally dubious abeyance of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) constitutes a real institutional crisis.  This politically short-sighted decision is a regrettable step backwards in the European integration process and shows the talent of some politicians to increase the already impressive number of challenges ahead. But no one should forget where we came from and what has been achieved already. Right now, we are actually in the process of establishing a Constitution for Europe. Something we already have in the monetary field. Maastricht has in fact established a stability-oriented monetary constitution. On the other hand, the purpose of the Convention’s draft Constitutional Treaty, which is being discussed by the Intergovernmental Conference, is to replace and modify the content of the existing treaties. The Constitutional Treaty seeks to establish more efficient structures. The whole decision-making process is intended to become more transparent and comprehensible. This will strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the EU, a step which is also necessary in view of the upcoming enlargement with its increase in diversity and complexity within the Union. It is therefore not a further integrative step but rather a consolidation of the existing institutional framework. Changes to the institutional framework of EMU were not originally intended, but these now seem to be on the agenda. The ECB and the euro area central banks have voiced their opinion. It is now up to the Intergovernmental Conference to decide if a change in the European stability consensus is in the interest of Europe’s citizens. I do not intend to comment on whether the UK should join the euro area or not. When the UK requests that it be allowed to move to the third stage, the Council of the EU will have to decide if the necessary conditions - that is to say, the convergence criteria - have been fulfilled.  II Europe has changed. It should not be confused with the Europe of ten or twenty years ago. The process leading up to the final stage of EMU has especially helped the countries with an unstable track record to reduce inflation rates, interest rates and fiscal deficits. The appeal of being part of EMU has certainly been helpful and has released an impressive amount of energy. What have been the key characteristics, the main achievements of Maastricht? BIS Review 56/2003 1 
A medium-term-oriented macroeconomic policy framework based on sustainable economic convergence with two distinct features: 1. an independent system of European central banks with the supranational European Central Bank and the primary objective of maintaining price stability 2. a fiscal institutional framework which - if properly applied - is meant to ensure fiscal discipline and which has the goal of preserving the sustainability of public finance. Is that enough? Have we achieved these worthy and courageous objectives? Where would we like to go? And in which direction should we go? The expectations of EMU were manifold. There were many sceptical voices which did not believe that a “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy was appropriate for such a heterogeneous area.  Convergence was seen to be insufficient, and the criteria of an optimal currency area not fulfilled. The proponents of this view saw monetary union only as the last crowning step of economic integration. Furthermore, experience has shown that all attempts in the past to establish a currency without a state have failed.  The optimistic view focused more on the advantages of greater price transparency, the removal of exchange-rate-induced planning uncertainties and the lower transaction costs in intra-euro-area trade. The euro was seen as the next logical step to complete the single market. EMU was expected to serve as a catalyst for further economic reforms and political integration. Who was right?  After almost five years of EMU one has to acknowledge that neither the positive nor the negative extremes have become true. However, the institutional framework currently faces a crucial stress test.  The Eurosystem’s monetary policy has managed to gain credibility and to build up confidence despite quite a number of challenges. This could not be taken for granted given the fact that there were no blueprints to fall back on. The centralised monetary policy and the decentralised but closely co-ordinated economic and budgetary policies constitute a rather demanding regime.  The Eurosystem at least has proved that it is up to the task. The ECB is endowed with an unambiguous mandate and has developed a strategy in accordance with the latest insights into monetary theory and practical experience. Even the severe criticism of Anglo-Saxon economists and media has become less ardent recently. The monetary policy strategy is increasingly understood or at least better respected by market participants. Long-term inflation expectations have been close to and mostly below the ECB definition of price stability of 2%. The economic rationale behind the mandate and strategy is the generally accepted principle that price stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make to improving economic prospects and raising living standards. How this translates into a monetary policy strategy depends, of course, on the structural preconditions. It concerns the manner in which the complex transmission mechanism works its way through from monetary policy decisions to the economy in general and the price level in particular. A very important influencing factor in this respect is whether investment decisions are influenced more strongly by developments in long-term or in short-term interest rates.  The two-pillar approach has proved to be the appropriate strategy for the euro area. It avoids creating unnecessary volatility in financial and real markets through its medium-term orientation, thus recognising that monetary policy does not have the instruments to fine-tune the economy. The prominent role of monetary growth acknowledges that money matters. This is by no means an outdated concept and is a lesson which I would like to stress considering the recent experiences of stock and housing market bubbles.  And the track record?  The ECB, together with the national central banks in the Eurosystem, has delivered. It is fair to say that the credibility test has been passed so far. Average inflation over the past five years has been close to 2%. The implementation of the single monetary policy has been conducted quite smoothly from the outset. The logistical endeavours linked to the cash changeover from the national currencies to the euro were a success, and the euro banknotes and coins were readily accepted by market participants.  However, EMU did not create the expected impetus for further political integration. The intergovernmental nature of the police and judicial co-operation and the so-called common foreign and 2 BIS Review 56/2003 
security policy have not been decisively strengthened since the inception of EMU. On the contrary, this year has shown that we are quite some way from a “common” European foreign policy.  Owing to the asymmetrical nature of Maastricht, other economic policy areas still remain largely decentralised. There is, however, economic policy coordination through the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Stability and Growth Pact.  Nobody seriously challenges the need for budgetary rules in a currency union with supranational monetary policy and national budgetary policies. Both policies are linked in the medium to long term. Lasting monetary stability needs sound and reliable public finances. The pact was designed to sustain the confidence of the public and financial markets in the euro.  The pact was, in fact, the answer to monetary union without a political union, just like a virtual European finance minister.  III What has to be done?  The economic rationale clearly and unambiguously calls for retaining medium-term-oriented fiscal policy rules. It is not about applying a mechanistic procedure. Stability and growth go hand in hand. There is no trade-off between these goals; instead, they are mutually reinforcing. The structural growth obstacles of euro-area countries cannot be solved with monetary policy nor with expansionary fiscal policy measures. Further damaging the pact would expose the policy regime of EMU to a very severe endurance test with tensions between the member states owing to the free-rider problematic. Furthermore, the open budgetary flank increases the likelihood of tensions between politicians and the central bank.  I am not surprised that the financial markets have so far reacted rather moderately to the ECOFIN decision. What weighs most are the medium to long-term effects on credibility and on the functioning of the institutional setting of economic and monetary union.  The decision of the ECOFIN Council threatens to break the political consensus of the Maastricht Treaty. Signing the Maastricht Treaty has limited the national sovereignty of fiscal policy. The Treaty is primary international law and contains inter alia: • the commitment of member states to avoid excessive deficits • the 3% threshold • an early warning procedure • the provision to give notice to a member state to take measures to reduce the deficit within a specified time limit • the right to impose fines if a member state fails to comply. The Stability and Growth Pact fleshed out these provisions and streamlined the procedures at the same time. Contrary to appearance, the Stability and Growth Pact is not a non-committal statement of political purpose but secondary EU law. Permanently fumbling with the pact is a clear sign that political authorities in many member countries were only vaguely aware of the implication of EMU on fiscal policy leeway.  The pact is a decisive element of the institutional framework of the monetary union. Treaty and pact already resemble a partial political union.  The technical preconditions for the functioning of EMU are in place. If properly applied, this will suffice for the time being. In the medium to long term, however, additional political back-up will be indispensable.   EMU has tied the participating countries permanently together. National policy choices have become a matter of concern for all. For the lasting success of the politically decentralised monetary union  1. it is crucial to implement structural reforms, thus lifting member countries on to a higher growth path 2. it is crucial to overcome integration and adjustment fatigue BIS Review 56/2003 3 
4 BIS Review 56/2003 3. it is crucial to embrace reality and accept the fact that national sovereignty in fiscal policy is limited in a monetary union 4. it is crucial to accept the constituting principle of all democracies, the rule of law, which lays down the primacy of law over policy  5. it is crucial to adhere to the stability consensus of Maastricht which is additionally put in question by disregarding the suggestions of the ECB and the central banks of the euro area to refine the Convention’s proposal. It will be necessary to reconcile the “ever closer union” with the “ever wider union”. Today we are further away from a political union than we were when the euro was introduced five years ago. Regarding the co-ordination of budgetary policies, we are even thrown back to intergovernmental co-operation.  It will be necessary to reconcile the negotiations on the Constitution for Europe with the damage done to the political stability consensus of Maastricht.  It is in the European and in the national interest to solve the institutional crises.  We must put a stop to incurring excessive debt because we are living at the expense of future generations. Sustainable growth can be achieved only on the basis of stability and sound public finance.  We must put a stop to the process of aggravating the credibility crises which strangles a sustainable European recovery. We must put a stop to the disintegrating forces which allege victories by organised majorities over reason. I cannot comprehend how such  behaviour - I am not willing to call it a system - can be expected to work in an enlarged union with 25 member states. I do hope that the suspension of the rules and procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact is only temporary.  I do hope that Europe develops the political will and leadership to return to a rule-based system. 
I J Macfarlane: Overview of the Australian economy  Opening statement by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, Brisbane, 8 December 2003. *      *      * Mr Chairman, it is a pleasure to be here today in front of your Committee again, and I am very pleased that we have been able to meet in Brisbane for the first time. As you know, we take these hearings very seriously because they enable Parliament, through its representatives on the Committee, to question the Reserve Bank in depth and in public. As usual I will make some introductory remarks in which I will focus on three subjects: • how the situation has changed since the statement I gave to this Committee in June;  • how our forecasts have evolved;  • the background to our monetary policy actions.  1.  June and Now Calendar year 2003 was an unusual one for the world economy. In the first half, prospects for world growth looked doubtful, with the most extreme uncertainty being concentrated in mid-year. If you remember, this is when talk of possible deflation in the United States reached its peak, and the US authorities gave the impression that they needed lower interest rates and a lower US dollar to help them through. In Europe, economic activity was weakening, and Asia received a temporary knock-back from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. At that time, virtually all the central banks of note - the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the Fed), the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of Canada, etc. - reduced interest rates, and I indicated to this Committee that if things did not improve, we might also have to do so. In the event, we did not because we witnessed one of the sharpest turnarounds in economic prospects any of us has seen. While in the June quarter most major countries, including many in Asia, saw declines in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), by the September quarter they were all growing strongly. The weakness we had seen in the June quarter turned out to be a ‘false signal’. In financial markets, bond yields rose sharply, share prices continued to rise, and various prices connected with international trade, such as commodity prices and transport prices, also rose. Talk of deflation ceased and the short-lived bout of monetary easing stopped. Business and consumer confidence indicators around the world rose back to levels consistent with reasonable economic growth. At the same time as perceptions of the world economy were being raised, the general run of economic indicators in Australia continued to improve, particularly employment, retail sales, construction activity and business and consumer confidence. Prospects for farm production also picked up sharply following widespread rain, even though it was not uniform across the country. Economic conditions here and abroad had returned to something relatively normal and, as a consequence, we judged that we no longer needed such an expansionary setting of monetary policy: interest rates were raised accordingly in November and December. 2.  Forecasts At this point, I will follow my usual practice by discussing the forecasts I gave you at the previous meeting, then adding some new ones for the coming calendar year. When we last met in June, I said that we expected GDP to grow by 3 per cent in real terms over the course of 2003. With three quarters of the year behind us, we now expect that the figure will come in a little higher, at about 3½ per cent. The thing to notice, however, is the big difference between the two halves of the year, with growth in the first half being at an annual rate of 2 per cent, and growth in the second half expected to be at an annual rate of around 5 per cent. The other thing to notice is that growth of domestic demand (Gross National Expenditure - GNE) through 2003, at 5 per cent, is again expected to be well above the figure of 3½ per cent for GDP. BIS Review 56/2003 1 
Over the course of 2004, we expect GDP to grow by 4 per cent. The profile of growth, however, is unlikely to be smooth. It would not surprise us if the four-quarter-ended growth rate of GDP reached 4½ per cent in mid 2004 due to the effects of the sharp rise in farm GDP, before returning to 4 per cent by end year. If the world economy continues to surprise on the strong side, as it has in recent months, our GDP growth could be even higher. On inflation, we said last time that we expected the CPI to increase by 2½ per cent over calendar 2003. We now think it will be a little lower at 2¼ per cent, largely due to the exchange rate being higher than assumed in our earlier forecast. Over the course of 2004, we expect the CPI to increase by 2 per cent, but in mid 2004 it could well be below that because the maximum effects of the higher Australian dollar could be being felt then. As we stated in our quarterly statement, this expectation implies that the profile of inflation will exhibit a shallow U-shape - falling from its present 2½ per cent to below 2 per cent in mid 2004, but then rising back to 2 per cent by end 2004, 2½ per cent by mid 2005, and continuing under upward pressure thereafter. Of course, it is difficult to be precise about these things, especially since future levels of the exchange rate will play a major role. I will say more about this later. 3. Monetary Policy As I outlined at the start of these remarks, with growth in the world economy getting back to normal, and growth in the Australian economy also getting back to normal, or slightly above it, we could no longer see a justification for Australian interest rates being clearly below normal. That is, the major reason for the two increases in interest rates this quarter is the same as I gave to this Committee 18 months ago in late May 2002 when talking about the tightening then. Another way of putting this is to say that if we had maintained the low level of interest rates we had at the beginning of 2002, there would have been a gradual build-up in inflationary pressures as the growth rates of the world and Australian economies rose through 2003, 2004 and beyond. Interest rates were just too low for an economy that was growing that well. As it turned out, this process of returning interest rates to more normal levels has been a gradual one. Two increases in interest rates were made in mid-2002, then there was a 16-month gap to the next two increases. I have explained in the previous two meetings of this Committee why that long gap occurred. It is clear that, despite our best endeavours to explain ourselves, a number of people think that the Bank tightened to cool down the property market. In fact, I have more than once received unsolicited advice that it would be better for us to explain our action in this way because people could more easily identify with it. The overheated property market is something that people can see around them; it is much more concrete than such concepts as inflation-targeting or returning interest rates to normal. However, such an approach would not be consistent with the truth. For a start, signs of overheating in the housing market were clearly evident through the second half of 2002 and all through 2003, yet the Bank did not change monetary policy. It was only when it became clear that good economic growth had returned both globally and domestically that rates were raised. I have often stressed that monetary policy has to be set taking into account the average of all the parts of the economy, not to what is happening in one sector. Of course, if a sector is overheated, it may push up the average for the economy, and in that way exert a disproportionate influence. It is also true that, historically, borrowing for housing purposes has been one of the more interest-sensitive sectors, and so it may have been more affected than other sectors by the previous low level of interest rates and it may respond more than other sectors to the recent increases. But that does not mean we singled it out. We have also been accused of setting monetary policy in relation to the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets, and ignoring the rest of the country. This clearly cannot be true in the case of the recent tightenings, as house prices in Sydney and Melbourne are growing less quickly than in other states; in fact, housing prices in some parts of these cities are already falling. In Australia we have conducted monetary policy by using an inflation-targeting regime for about a decade now. It has been a very successful regime in that it has delivered (along with various other reforms) the longest period of uninterrupted good economic growth in the post war period, at a rate exceeding that of all other significant developed economies. It has concentrated our minds at the Reserve Bank in that we have been very conscious of our need to deliver the results to which we have committed. Over the 10-year period, inflation has averaged 2.4 per cent. By acting early on monetary policy to keep inflation in check, we have avoided large swings in interest rates and thereby allowed the economy to prosper.  2 BIS Review 56/2003 
BIS Review 56/2003 3 As you are aware, our target is a relatively flexible one in that we aim to achieve an average rate of somewhere between 2 and 3 per cent. It is that average by which we should be judged, or made accountable. But there are some observers who think that the system should be more prescriptive than this and there should be some strict rule which should determine our actions. For example, a few people still think we should aim to keep inflation between 2 and 3 per cent at all times. This is a clear misinterpretation of our system because it fails to realise that it is the average we are interested in. On a number of occasions, inflation has been above 3 per cent and below 2 per cent. In fact, about 45 per cent of the time it has been outside the 2 to 3 per cent range, and we have not regarded this as a failure of policy. Since our objective is to achieve an average inflation rate, there are multiple paths for inflation which are consistent with meeting our medium-term objective. We wish to choose the one which best satisfies the other obligations contained in our Act, which I summarise as achieving sustainable growth in income and employment. We are not simplistically committed to achieving the minimum possible variability in the inflation rate, or even hitting the target at some fixed period ahead, such as two years. Another approach sometimes put to us is to say that we should raise interest rates if, and only if, our forecast for inflation is above 3 per cent, and lower them if, and only if, it is below 2 per cent. Again, this is a misinterpretation of how the system works. It also ignores the complications and uncertainties involved in economic forecasting. The forecast horizon relevant for policy today is at least two, or even three, years. We can be relatively confident about forecasts for the first half of that horizon, as much of what is going to happen over that period is already set in place. But we can be less confident about the forecasts for the second half. The situation is particularly uncertain when, as is the case at present, the direction of inflation is expected to change during the forecast period. Since this type of forecast is so hard to make, we, like a number of other central banks, do not wish to lead the public to believe we can do this with much precision. In fact, we tend to appeal to the balance of risks around the central forecast in order to convey our message. In last month’s quarterly statement we said that the balance of risks was shifting to the upside, which was meant to indicate that inflation was on an upward trajectory through the course of the second year. We also drew attention to the fact that domestic price pressures were increasing, as shown by the fact that the rate of increase in the prices of ‘non-internationally traded goods and services’ had increased from 2 per cent to 4 per cent over the past few years. That does not mean that inflation will rise to 4 per cent once the exchange rate effects have worn off, but at least a significant part of the economy will be influenced by this figure. In summary, I want to assure the Committee that the Bank remains committed to the inflation targeting framework and that the decisions taken over the past 18 months have been fully consistent with that framework. It does not seem plausible to us to argue that the Bank could have been confident of meeting its inflation commitments if interest rates had been held at 30-year lows in the face of the pick up in the international and domestic economies that is currently under way. Finally, let me end by updating you on a few developments in the payments policy reforms. Since we last met, the challenges brought against the Reserve Bank’s reforms to credit card schemes by MasterCard and Visa were dismissed by the Federal Court. Both schemes subsequently appealed, but Visa has withdrawn its appeal. The new interchange fees for Bankcard, MasterCard and Visa came into effect at the end of October, almost halving the fees. The Reserve Bank is monitoring the flow through of this to merchant service fees. The data are still being gathered, but anecdotal evidence suggests that merchants are starting to see a reduction in the merchant service fees they pay to banks. There have been several developments in other payments streams, and I will be happy to answer questions on those when they arise, but I am aware that I have already taken a fair amount of your time, so I will finish at this point. 
K J Udeshi: India’s potential in the banking and financial sector Inaugural address by Ms K J Udeshi, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Conference on Banking and Trade Finance, organised by the International Chamber of Commerce, New Delhi, 9 December 2003. *      *      * Mr. Kanwar, Mr. Kiefer, and distinguished participants in the conference, I am indeed privileged to be invited to inaugurate this conference and especially so, as this is the first time that the International Chamber of Commerce Banking Commission Meeting is taking place in India. The contribution made by ICC in standardization is well-known but perhaps what is not so well-known is that the ICC also contributes to making business policy by publishing policy statements and reports and laying down guidelines, goals and rules. This conference would, therefore, provide a forum for interaction between Indian bankers and corporates and their counterparts from other parts of the world. It is also an excellent opportunity to project India’s potential in the banking and financial sector. Kudos to Mr. Kanwar for having arranged this conference in India. The Indian financial sector reforms launched a decade ago have transformed the operating environment of the financial sector from an administered regime to a competitive market based system. The reforms are an on-going process. There is increasing evidence of strong inter-linkages between markets. In the macro economic and financial spheres, inflation has been contained, external debt indicators have vastly improved, the exchange rate is flexible and the country is free of financial repression. The trade account is open and India has become much more integrated with the world economy. The economy has also become more resilient to shocks, both domestic and external.  The Indian economy has emerged as one of the fastest growing emerging market economies and the Indian banking sector is perceived, as being the best performer in Asia. The RBI has been at the forefront of upgrading the risk systems of the Indian banking system. It is, in fact, heartening to report that the risk capabilities of our banks have improved systematically over the past decade. The robustness of the banking sector is witnessed by a consistent rise in Return on Equity, strong earnings momentum, improved loan book quality and unrealized gains on treasury portfolios. There are some structural factors that could drive credit growth, namely, the emergence of consumer loans, the shrinking of spreads on alternate assets and a higher risk appetite because of stronger foreclosure norms and statutory support for enforcement of creditor rights.  The Reserve Bank has initiated a host of measures for the creation of a competitive environment and improve efficiency in the process of financial intermediation.  It is important that banks continue to adequately finance activities that are of crucial importance to growth. The fostering of entrepreneurship in new industrial activities, in the emerging services sector and other non traditional activities, will all require proactive financing. It may be of interest to the ICC Banking Commission that India has been closely associated with various standard setting bodies and has been taking active part in the work of several key international institutions devoted to the task of developing and promoting implementation of financial standards and codes. Although we are not a member of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), we were one of the countries specially requested to help its Task Force on the Implementation of Standards and subsequently, the Follow Up Group on Incentives for Implementation of Standards.  The Reserve Bank’s Standing Committee on International Financial Standards and Codes (Chairman: Dr. Y.V. Reddy) has assessed Indian regulations against international best practices in order to facilitate positioning of international financial standards and codes in relevant areas of the financial system in India and to guide the overall process of implementation of appropriate changes in respect of various segments of the financial system. India is one of the countries that has sought participation in the joint IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP). As part of the Reports on Observances of Standards and Codes (ROSCs), India’s compliance in respect of standards and codes has already been assessed in respect of six codes, viz., Monetary and Financial Policy Transparency, Fiscal Transparency, Banking Supervision, Securities Market Regulation, Payment and Settlement System and Corporate Governance. Currently, assessment is being undertaken with regard to Special Data Dissemination Standards. BIS Review 56/2003 1 
The Narasimham Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (1998) had observed that a legal framework that clearly defines the rights and liabilities of parties to contracts and provides for speedy resolution of dispute is a sine qua non for efficient trade and commerce, especially for financial intermediation. Several legislative initiatives have been undertaken in the banking and financial sector.  The bills introduced in Parliament for amendment of the Banking Regulation Act will encourage foreign banks to set up subsidiaries and attract foreign investors. Historically, foreign banks have always been allowed to operate in India and have enjoyed national treatment and a level-playing field. With a view to developing trade and payment relationship, we have encouraged foreign banks from other countries which did not have historic links to establish branches in India. I may add that the WTO commitments on banking services has been fulfilled.  A critical issue of increasing international concern is the question of money laundering. The impact of money laundering is now beginning to extend from economic crimes to international terrorism. As financial transactions grow more complex, it becomes more difficult for banks to maintain a customer profile. The challenge, therefore, is to ensure that banks know their customers without hindering the smooth flow of financial transactions.  The Reserve Bank has issued several guidelines to banks and non-banking financial companies to implement the `Know Your Customer’ principle. The basic aim is to prevent banks being unwittingly used as the channel of funds derived from criminal activity or financing terrorism. The guidelines relate to identification of depositors and institution of systems and procedures to control financial frauds, identify money laundering and suspicious activities and scrutinize / monitor large-value cash transactions. In India, recognizing the paramount role of exports in the overall growth process of the economy, the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India have, over time, taken several measures to ensure adequate flow of credit towards export related activities. The important measures include rationalisation and liberalization of export credit interest rates, flexibility in repayment/pre-payment of pre-shipment credit, simplification of procedures relating to exports (like direct dispatch of shipping documents and enhancement in normal period for realization of export proceeds), flexibility to banks to source foreign currency funds for granting pre-shipment credit in foreign currency (PCFC) and export bill rediscounting (EBR), scheme and introduction of a transparent reporting system for export credit interest rates. At present, exporters have the option to avail of pre-shipment and post-shipment credit in foreign currency from banks in India. In order to encourage competition among banks and also to increase flow of credit to the export sector, the Reserve Bank of India has liberalized interest rates on local currency export credit effective May 1, 2003 for pre-shipment credit above 180 days and post-shipment credit above 90 days. In the context of globalization, however, what one needs to keep in mind is that even though finance is a critical ingredient of production, what matters even more is the demand for the product and its competitiveness on quality considerations. Finance can only act as a facilitator when these two preconditions are satisfied. This is vindicated by the recent surge in growth of exports of automotive components and C.D. Roms. The initiative with regard to the setting up of an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in the banking sector for the benefit of the exporters and importers bears mentioning. EDI provides several benefits to the corporates such as operational efficiencies and cost savings by elimination of paperwork, logistical benefits by better scheduling and reduced stockholding etc., and strategic benefits through competitive and advantage and access to new markets. Under the EDI project, one of the major benefits for the exporters is that the RBI has abolished GR forms for export transactions. The exporters can now fill up a common Statutory Declaration Form (SDF) for the customs from where the data relevant to the banks and the RBI can be extracted. Presently, EDI is working at 23 ports covering 80 per cent of exports. Under the EDI project, bank branches at 114 export intensive centers identified by the Ministry of Commerce are to be provided connectivity with the customs authorities.  The Reserve Bank has provided the enabling conditions for promotion of trade and investment, both domestic and international, by ensuring adequate liquidity, a competitive interest rate regime measures to encourage decentralized decision making and ease procedures in the credit delivery systems and most importantly financial stability in the midst of a world economy beset by uncertainty and recessionary trends. It is now necessary for market participants to have enough confidence to make investment decisions.  2 BIS Review 56/2003 
BIS Review 56/2003 3 The Reserve Bank, on its part, would continue to ensure financial stability, strengthening of prudential norms with the strategy of convergence of international best practice, consistent with our specific needs, as also progressive strengthening of the supervisory framework. Accordingly, the focus of our policy initiatives would be on streamlining banking operations in order to reduce transaction costs, infusing flexibility into the system, upgrading risk management systems, enhancing the level of compliance by banks with accounting standards, operationalising consolidated accounting practices and last and most important of all, providing the public with a financial system they can trust. While there is substantial progress in the financial sector reforms initiated in 1991, the accent at the present time is an implementation of the reforms at the grass roots level. In this context, the endeavour is to facilitate ease of transactions by the common persons, further broadening of the consultative process and continued emphasis on the institutional capacity to support growth consistent with stability. Furthermore, the credit delivery system is being strengthened to ensure that financing gaps do not constrain the acceleration of growth.  Governor, Dr. Y.V.Reddy, as part of the Mid-Term Review of Monetary and Credit Policy for the Year 2003-04 has announced a number of initiatives to bring about a significant and enduring improvement in the functioning of the financial system. The financial Sector now takes increasing challenges and complexities in the context of globalization and risk management. A Standing Technical Advisory Committee on Financial Regulation has been set up by the Governor which, through a consultative process, will endeavour to simplify and rationalize the regulatory regime to move towards a clear and unambiguous framework. In another initiative, Standing Committee on Procedures and Performance Audit on Public Services provided by the RBI is being set up to bench mark the current level of service and to enhance the timeliness and quality of these services. The Committee will also coordinate with the Ad hoc Committee on Customer Services being set up by each bank. These initiatives would, it is expected, bring about a significant improvement in customer service in the financial sector. The central objective of financial reforms is to attain a significant improvement in the efficiency of financial intermediation and the endeavour of the RBI would be to provide a regulatory framework in which economic agents can perform their activities in an optimal manner. In this endeavour, the RBI would approach issues in a collaborative manner, and in this, seek the hand of market participants.  I wish your deliberations all success. 
R Basant Roi: Present challenges of monetary policy in Mauritius  Address by Mr R Basant Roi, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the annual dinner with major economic stakeholders, Sugar Beach Resort, 28 November 2003. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen  Good evening  I am pleased to welcome you to the Bank of Mauritius Annual Dinner.  Right from the year I set the tradition of holding an annual dinner with the major economic stakeholders in the country I focused mostly on regulatory and supervisory issues in my addresses. Intentionally, I chose certain regulatory and supervisory issues as the leading themes of my addresses for reasons that I strongly believe should be clearer by now.  Tonight I shall briefly outline the present challenges of our monetary policy in the context of an external environment characterized by uncertainties. Before I proceed with the main theme of my address let me reiterate a few remarks I made in the post February 2003 months this year. The perceptions that emerged in the wake of the discovery of a fraud at the Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) inevitably make it compelling that I should re-emphasize some of the remarks. The guiding principle of any regulatory and supervisory authority in any economic and financial system is to first and foremost attempt to save troubled financial institutions. The legal frameworks of regulatory and supervisory authorities are designed to promote financial stability rather than to jeopardize financial stability. This is what is envisioned in the Bank of Mauritius and the Banking Acts. The Acts are an instrument that empowers the Bank of Mauritius to promote and sustain monetary and financial stability. Regulatory and supervisory authorities the world over do not use any of the provisions of their laws to defeat the very objective of the laws. Arbitrary decisions motivated by emotional or even personal considerations should be set aside in favour of a genuinely professional approach of sustaining the soundness of banks in situations similar to the one the Mauritius Commercial Bank found itself in. The regulatory and supervisory authority cannot but exercise its independence of mind. Without being presumptuous the MCB/NPF case was handled by the Bank of Mauritius in a manner that best serves the interests of our financial sector and of our economy. I should like to re-underline that supervision of banks is control and procedure oriented and not transaction oriented. Viewed in the light of determined steps taken by the MCB in the realm of risk management along with a number of other prudential measures taken in the months after the discovery of the fraud, the MCB/NPF case is expected to be over soon as far as the Bank of Mauritius is concerned. Regulatory issues relating to the Worldcom and Enron scandals in the US were dealt with and settled within a few months. Our banking industry is blessed in having to surmount only one tyranny: adverse publicity motivated by considerations that go beyond acceptable norms of conduct. The Bank of Mauritius will ensure that the steps taken by the MCB to fully revamp its internal controls and procedures are carried through to the finish and that internal controls are appropriately exercised and procedures are strictly followed. Suffice it to say that the MCB/NPF episode, despite the traumas associated with it, serves a good lesson to our financial industry.  Having said that let me turn to the main theme of my address tonight. As I explained in April last at a Seminar a full appreciation of the Bank’s monetary policy stance requires a perspective stretching beyond a few months or even beyond a single year. A few months or even a year is rather a short time to really gauge what monetary policies of central banks can accomplish on a lasting basis. Monetary policy tends to impact on economies with a long and variable lag. Unforeseen events having undesirable consequences for economies can take place in minutes. Predictability of the course of monetary policy is disturbed in such circumstances.  Policies in the post World War II were quite predictable. They were predictable because of the steady economic performance of the leading economies of the world in the context of a remarkably stable international socio-political and economic and financial environment. Central banks and governments all over the world enjoyed full sovereignty in policy making. In sharp contrast, the international socio-political and economic context is far from being that predictable today. Additionally, in the wake of financial liberalization across the world, with an estimated US$1.2 trillion being traded daily, capital moves in and out of countries with a remarkable ease and at a speed never witnessed before. The BIS Review 55/2003 1 
monetary policy stance of one country affects the monetary policy of another and in this process part of our sovereignty in monetary policy-making is thus lost. Central bankers necessarily have to constantly watch their radar screens and determine for themselves how to steer their monetary policy in the best interest of their economies. “The manner in which central bankers must operate can be compared to the decisions people make whenever they cross the street. If there is no traffic, there is little risk, and pedestrians don’t need to worry about the speed with which they cross the street. But if the road is heavy with fast moving traffic, it’s a different story, and safety demands that pedestrians wait until they are confident they can make it to the other side. The same holds true for central bank governors.”  The introduction of the Euro, the September 11 attacks that impacted seriously on the US economy which is an importer of the last resort, the ever growing instability in the Middle East, the disagreements over trade policies and tendencies for countries to resort to protectionist measures in one form or the other, volatility in the exchange rates of major currencies in the international exchanges as well as the weak performance of most economies across the world have not made monetary policy making here and abroad a plain sailing endeavour. Successive years of uncertainties intensified by events beyond the control of central banks have increasingly blurred visibility. Central banks have to constantly chart a safe way forward in this world of unexpected twists and turns of events.  Five years ago, substantial capital outflows triggered by a loss of confidence in the rupee had brought down the foreign reserves of the Bank of Mauritius to unacceptable levels. The rapid weakening of the Euro in the international exchanges following its introduction in January 1999 translated into a significant appreciation of the rupee. And that appreciation of the rupee was a quick reversal of the preceding three years of rapid depreciation of the rupee. The mood of pessimism that emerged in the wake of the September 11 attacks brought down the world economy to the throes of deflation. Central banks around the world effected a series of cuts in interest rates in a bid to revitalize their respective economies. Notwithstanding the policies adopted by central banks, the leading world economies entered a period of balance sheet recession in recent years. In the wake of drastic fall in equity prices, many companies the world over could no longer afford to maximize profits. They chose to restructure their balance sheets for corporate governance so demanded. However, the household sector continued to save money and the business community almost stopped borrowing money even at low rates of interest. This is a peculiar situation or rather a fallacy of composition problem that exacerbated the recessionary trend in the world economy. Monetary policy becomes much less effective when only few companies are willing to borrow in this type of a recession. Fiscal policy takes over as an absolutely important instrument to boost up aggregate demand as well as to keep money supply from shrinking.  In such troubled waters the navigational hazard is impaired visibility, which is quite often the case. Monetary policy judgments become a question of balancing risks more so in a small open economy like ours with all its vulnerabilities. Observers from outside the walls of the central banks may find monetary policy making a mechanical process as described in textbooks hardly realizing that in such circumstances policy decisions are more about weighing probabilities. This is an area in policy making where even thinking people do differ in the judgments regarding the course of policy actions. I cannot claim divine insight. Nor do I think anyone of us here may claim having been gifted with such an insight. However, it would be surprising if all of us always agreed in the judgments. When everyone agrees with each other all the time no one is really thinking enough. Criticisms of the Bank of Mauritius policy stance are profoundly appreciated so long as the criticisms are educated criticisms.  The hazard posed by troubled waters abroad and the third party threat to the competitiveness of our Export Processing Zone has rendered the conduct of our monetary policy quite a puzzling exercise. Basically, the conduct of monetary policy in recent years has aimed at bringing down the rate of inflation. The informal inflation targeting approach of monetary policy making has paid good dividends. The average inflation rate in the first five years of the 1990s was 6.8 per cent, 6.1 per cent in the second half of the 1990s and 5.2 per cent in the last five years. For the current year the rate of inflation is forecast at close to 4 per cent. Clearly, the tendency is for the rate of inflation to either post a further marginal decline or to stay at the current rate of around 4 per cent. That excessive monetary tightening could adversely affect growth performance of our economy is a consideration that is well borne in mind.  The successive cuts in interest rate like in several other countries have induced borrowings but not to the desired extent. The pace of bank credit expansion is currently subdued. Some corporate bodies are borrowing in foreign currencies substituting for borrowings in rupees. While the rates of interest on 2 BIS Review 55/2003 
foreign borrowings are lower compared to the rates of interest charged by local banks, borrowers need to be mindful of the risks involved. Risks associated with external borrowings could turn out to be high. With the upside risk of inflation being minimal in the foreseeable and the need for re-aligning interest rate parity being felt in order to prevent a built up of short-term foreign liabilities, the Bank of Mauritius effected a further cut in the rate of interest yesterday.  Against a backdrop of four successive years of surpluses recorded in the current account of our balance of payments and less than buoyant aggregate demand in the economy, the Bank faces a policy dilemma. The market is flushed with liquidity for quite sometime. Excess supply of foreign exchange has given rise to a situation of excess rupee liquidity. In the last two years the Bank of Mauritius purchased foreign currencies on the domestic market for an amount equivalent to over US$500 million. The rupee counterpart of the purchases amounted to around Rs14 billion that has ultimately landed in the balance sheet of the Bank of Mauritius as well as in the balance sheet of Government. The interest burden on this rupee counterpart of the foreign currencies purchased by the Bank is indeed heavy. To what extent the Bank can keep buying foreign currencies on the market remains a complex policy question should the considered view that the current exchange rate level have to be maintained.  Given the volatility of exchange rates on the international foreign exchange markets should we take the exchange rate of the rupee as a given price to us ignoring all considerations regarding domestic economic fundamentals? Economics textbooks teach us that in a market economy, the invisible hands of the market promote economic efficiency. Do we systematically take what the international financial markets decide as given to us despite the common belief that the invisible hands of the market often suffer from arthritis? Sometime back a Council member of the European Central Bank likened the behaviour of currency markets to herds that all ran in the same direction. He had this to say, “I have met a lot of sheep who know they are running in the wrong direction. But they only want to run in the opposite direction if they are certain the rest of the herd will follow.” The problem is how best the determination of the exchange rate of the rupee in our foreign exchange market reconciles domestic economic fundamentals with what the international financial markets dictate to us. The Bank’s policy concern is about the need for stemming excessive foreign exchange inflows while sustaining the current exchange rate levels. This is a policy dilemma not only specific to Mauritius but also to giant economies like China and others. The Bank of Mauritius has but only one instrument to strike an appropriate balance and that is interest rate.  In the last 30 months the Bank of Mauritius reduced interest rate on 9 occasions. The Lombard rate was reduced step by step from 12.5 per cent to 9.75 per cent. The Prime lending rates of banks fell from 11 per cent to 8.5 per cent; it will be further reduced as a result of yesterday’s cut. However, borrowers with default risk pay a premium over the Prime lending rates of banks. The higher the default risk the higher is the premium. Monetary policy has its limits; it cannot influence the premium in either direction. In this policy scenario savers face the vicissitudes of interest rate not only in Mauritius but the world over. Our household sector has traditionally placed its savings with banks. Risk averse investors, particularly those depending on their pensions for a living, have not had the benefit of risk-free investment avenues. In December 1998 the Bank of Mauritius started with the sale of Treasury bills over-the-counter to individuals. Over Rs4 billion from more than 11,000 individual investors were soaked up by the Bank of Mauritius. Evidently the market for Government debt instruments has a growth potential in Mauritius.  The sale of bills was subsequently suspended in view of our decision to develop a secondary market for Government debt instruments. There have been many requests from the public to the Bank of Mauritius for the regular sales of Treasury bills over-the-counter. Though helpful as a rudimentary method of conducting open market operations in a less developed market, the sale of Treasury bills over-the-counter by the Bank of Mauritius is not the way forward. We have decided that Treasury bills and over time other Government debt instruments be traded on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius. Our Stock Exchange has good operating characteristics for trading in Government papers. We expect the market to eventually develop into a bond market with an efficient system of good price discovery. The Bank of Mauritius, the Stock Exchange of Mauritius and Stockbrokers have made united efforts to start trading sometime in the next few weeks. The Stock Exchange of Mauritius and stockbrokers will come up with more details this December.  The Bank of Mauritius has a keen interest in the development of the market for Government debt instruments. Such a market would provide the Bank with a good medium for the conduct of its monetary policy.  BIS Review 55/2003 3 
4 BIS Review 55/2003 Ladies and gentlemen, my address tonight is based on a decision to make the monetary policy stance of the Bank of Mauritius increasingly more transparent. It is an adopted practice among central banks in most countries to move for transparency in the area of monetary policy making. I for one do really believe in it and will move further in this direction. Before concluding may I say that the Bank of Mauritius will live up to the challenges of monetary policy in the years ahead. In an uncertain external environment the Bank has so far charted the best possible course to support non-inflationary growth. The Bank will pursue the course in the same spirit.  May I on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Mauritius and on my own behalf wish you and your family Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year.  
Philipp M Hildebrand: Asset management at central banks - a special case? Speech by Mr Philipp M Hildebrand, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the University of St Gallen, St Gallen, 5 December 2003. The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * Summary Next to monetary policy, the management of international reserves is another important task of the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Since its obligations cannot be defined precisely, there can be no exact determination as to the optimal level of a country’s international reserves. In accordance with the buffer stock model, the level of international reserves should be determined - just as one would choose an appropriate insurance - based on the likelihood of a crisis, on their contribution to managing or avoiding the crisis as well as on the opportunity costs implied in holding reserves. Both the insights derived from this model and from international comparison have shown that Switzerland holds a reasonable level of international reserves. The long-term development of these reserves should be based on a set of clear goals, as is the case in Switzerland with the growth of nominal GDP as a strategic benchmark. In defining its investment policy, the SNB takes into account safety, liquidity, and performance. The new National Bank Law will enable the SNB to better adapt its investment profile to its needs, which ought to lower the opportunity costs implied in holding reserves. As investment activity is becoming increasingly complex, so are the demands of corporate governance. In conformity with the private financial sector, central banks - the SNB counts itself among them - have professionalised their investment and risk control processes and improved their accountability toward the public. With increased professionalism, particularly as a result of applying the mark-to-market principle, the SNB’s profits are more volatile than in the past, however. In order to safeguard the independence of monetary policy and so as not to restrict investment policy, the SNB’s annual profit distribution - as already spelled out in the message of the Federal Council on the new National Bank Law - must remain a variable residual amount in the long term and must not be tied to any specific purpose.

European Central Bank: Press conference - introductory statement Introductory statement by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, and Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 4 December 2003. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Following a comprehensive economic and monetary analysis, we concluded that the monetary policy stance remains appropriate to preserve price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, we left the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their low levels. While annual inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around 2% over the coming months, a gradual and limited decline should take place later on. We also noted that the economic recovery in the euro area has started and that confidence has strengthened further. We will continue to carefully monitor all developments that might affect our medium-term assessment of risks to price stability. We also discussed the potential implications of the deeply regrettable developments at the ECOFIN Council meeting on 25 November. As we already stressed in our statement on the same day, these developments risk undermining the credibility of the institutional framework and the confidence in sound public finances of Member States across the euro area. Let me add that a credible fiscal framework is key not only to stability but also to growth, and is a precondition for low risk premia in financial markets to be preserved.  I shall now explain our assessment in more detail. In the context of our economic analysis, the latest data releases confirmed that economic activity in the euro area has picked up. Real GDP growth in the third quarter reflects the strong momentum of the world economy, which we assume will continue next year.  We expect that domestic demand will start improving. Private consumption should be supported by positive terms-of-trade effects due to the past appreciation of the euro. With the usual lag, it should also profit from an increase in employment growth. Business investment is expected to recover gradually, mainly helped by an expansion of external demand, the low level of interest rates and generally favourable financing conditions. Moreover, it should increasingly benefit from the adjustment efforts of the corporate sector to enhance productivity and profitability.  Taken together, we look forward to a gradual recovery in euro area economic growth over the next quarters, leading to a broader and stronger upswing in the course of next year and the year after. The risks to this scenario appear to be balanced. Over a longer horizon, we remain concerned about the sustainability of global economic growth being undermined by external imbalances in some parts of the world economy.  Concerning prices, the latest information is in line with earlier expectations. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in November, following a rate of 2.0% in October. Similar rates have prevailed for most of this year and this inertia of inflation rates at around 2% is likely to continue in the coming months. Due to adverse food price developments, the evolution of oil prices and planned increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, inflation rates will fall neither as quickly nor as strongly as was expected earlier in the year.  However, when assessing price trends over the medium term, a number of factors should dampen inflationary pressures. First, given the past appreciation of the euro, import prices should contribute to this effect. Second, domestic cost pressures should remain moderate. In particular, wage growth should be contained in the context of a recovery which, for the time being, is expected to remain gradual. Provided that wage moderation can be preserved, which is indispensable for fostering employment, a cyclical recovery in productivity tends to dampen growth in unit labour costs, which has thus far been relatively high when judged against the weakness of the economy.  Overall, these views are also reflected in recently released forecasts and seem to be in line with survey data and financial market expectations. Accordingly, there is a rather broad consensus on the main scenario. At the same time, this outlook for price stability is conditional on quite a number of assumptions, such as those on global developments, oil prices, exchange rates, wage developments BIS Review 55/2003 1 
2 BIS Review 55/2003 and fiscal measures. Therefore, elements of risk to the outlook for price stability need to be kept in mind. In this respect, we noted that financial market indicators for inflation expectations have shown some upward momentum over recent months. While technical factors might also have played a role in the movement of these indicators, and other indicators have remained broadly unchanged, inflation expectations warrant close monitoring. Turning to the monetary analysis, M3 growth has been very strong over the past two years, reflecting portfolio shifts, precautionary savings and the low level of interest rates. The low level of interest rates has also supported the growth of credit demand. In our assessment, the accumulation of excess liquidity is not of concern for price stability at the current juncture, given that, for the time being, the economic recovery is only gradual. However, should high excess liquidity continue to prevail once there is a significant strengthening of economic activity, it could lead to inflationary pressures in the medium term. We will therefore continue to carefully examine monetary developments. In summary, the economic analysis indicates that the main scenario for price developments in the medium term continues to be in line with our definition of price stability. This picture is confirmed by cross-checking with the monetary analysis.  Turning to fiscal policies, I have already mentioned that we expressed deep regret following the ECOFIN Council meeting on 25 November. Furthermore, we stressed our support of the Commission's views on the ECOFIN Council's Conclusions. We also took note of the commitments made by France and Germany to correct their excessive deficits as rapidly as possible and at the latest by 2005. Moreover, we noted that the ECOFIN Council stands ready to take a decision under Article 104(9), on the basis of the Commission recommendation, should the two governments fail to act in accordance with their own commitments. We strongly urge the governments concerned to live up to their responsibilities. Confidence in the soundness of public finances is essential for sustainable growth in consumption and investment. The overall fiscal framework of the Stability and Growth Pact remains of central importance and should be fully respected. The same applies to the requirement to avoid excessive deficits, laid down in Article 104 of the Treaty, and to the reference values of 3% and 60% for the deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios respectively, specified in the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty. These are the foundations for trust and confidence in EMU.  Trust and confidence are also crucial in the context of structural reform. Enhancing the competitiveness of the euro area, in particular in labour and product markets, increasing the efficiency of the tax systems and ensuring the sustainability of social security schemes all foster a better allocation and utilisation of capital and human resources. There is no doubt that measures in these respects improve the growth perspectives of the euro area. However, in order to foster confidence in the shorter term, convincing assurance must be given that these challenges are indeed being tackled in a decisive manner and that clear action is being taken. While some progress has been made, the Governing Council strongly encourages governments to accelerate the implementation of structural reforms and also calls upon social partners to fully commit themselves to the objective of making the euro area a more dynamic and innovative economy.  We are now at your disposal for questions.

Introduction Recent global developments have significantly transformed the environment in which monetary policy operates. This has thrown up opportunities as well as challenges. Globalisation has expanded economic interdependence and interaction of countries greatly. This has created the need for greater coordination in terms of the design of appropriate institutional architecture as well as standardisation reflected in the adoption of similar monetary policy approaches. It has also been associated with a dramatic lowering of inflation worldwide. Central banks have seized these opportunities to bring about institutional reforms to enhance accountability, and hence, credibility of monetary policy making. They have had to hone their technical and specialist management skills to acquire adequate competence to deal with the emerging complexities of financial markets. The more recent evolution of the global economy has accentuated the challenges that face monetary authorities. Increasingly, monetary policy decisions have to be made in an environment of heightened uncertainty. Structural changes associated with globalisation have increased the uncertainty in interpreting macroeconomic indicators regarding the state of the economy. Another form of uncertainty stems from the strategic interaction between private agents and monetary policy authorities and, in particular, the role of expectations in the monetary transmission mechanism. Financial markets, driven by massive cross-border capital flows and the information technology revolution, immediately transfer the valuation of risks associated with uncertainty across the globe and this can lead to contagion. Indeed, global interdependence is marked by common shocks and a “confidence channel” rapidly transmits these shocks to various parts of the world. All this has rendered the conduct of monetary policy extremely complex in such an environment of interdependent risks. Therefore, even though monetary policy is conducted towards achieving domestic objectives, central banks have to follow developments carefully across the world. More than ever before, the choice of monetary arrangements depends on the choices that other countries make (Meltzer, 1997). In my lecture today, I propose to dwell upon the uncertainties that characterise the monetary policy environment, the underlying macroeconomic conditions in which monetary policy has to be set, the process of inflation and the changing institutional response to the commitment to price stability, the role of capital flows and what the future holds in store. Against this backdrop, I hope to shed some light on the emerging discussion among central bankers about the course of monetary policy that is of greater relevance to developing countries such as ours. II. The setting: global economic situation The growing internationalisation of monetary policy has been brought into sharp focus by the synchronised global downturn since the late 1990s. In response, monetary authorities all over the world have made concerted efforts to ease their policy stance significantly. The US has powered the world economy during the last 7-8 years and has been responsible for about 60 per cent of world growth. Despite bursting of the stock market bubble, a rash of corporate governance problems and the IT bubble, US has been the main engine of world growth in recent years and has been partly responsible for the recovery of Asian countries after the 1997 crisis. In the bargain, the US accumulated twin deficits - current account deficit (CAD) of five per cent, and fiscal deficit of six per cent (a sharp turnaround from a surplus of 1.2 per cent in 2000). With the emergence of such an imbalance in the US, other regions in the world have to exhibit an equal and opposite imbalance of their own. Ironically, it is the developing countries of Asia who are funding the CAD of the US and exhibiting surplus. The central banks of Asia are financing roughly 3-3.5 per cent of the CAD of the US and most of its fiscal deficit, as compared to the earlier situation where it was private sector flows that BIS Review 54/2003 1 
were funding these deficits. In view of the difficulties in monetary management that the situation entails, this situation is clearly not sustainable indefinitely. There are no short-cut solutions since the problems are deep, structural and inter-dependent: hence these cannot be solved through independent or unilateral action. For example, difficult structural reforms are necessary in the Euro area; much more structural reforms are required in Japan, particularly in the financial sector; India has a large fiscal deficit problem, and China cannot afford a major appreciation. Hence, relatively coordinated medium term action is called for among the major economies of the world. Unilateral action by any country is unlikely to solve its own problems. Recent months have seen the emerging signs of a recovery in economic activity, particularly in the US, Japan and emerging Asia. In the US, the pace of growth has picked up, assisted by expansionary macroeconomic policies and supportive financial conditions. Equity and bond markets have responded with optimism to prospects of recovery with investor interest returning to technology stocks more rapidly than to other sectors. In Japan, there are stronger signs in the third quarter that a cyclical upswing is underway, led by industrial activity and exports. In the UK and Australia, signs of recovery are clearly evident with rising household spending reflected in retail price inflation, prompting monetary authorities in these two countries to raise key policy interest rates against inflation surprises. China continues to grow at a remarkably strong pace while activity in other parts of Asia is bouncing back from the effects of SARS. There is nevertheless considerable uncertainty regarding the durability of the pick-up. In the US, labour markets remain sluggish and significant excess capacity persists. Moreover, the substantial support provided to consumption by tax cuts is unlikely to be sustained. Despite the prospects of stronger growth, Japan continues to experience deflation. The ongoing concerns relating to structural weaknesses in the financial system remain. In contrast to the rest of the world, the euro area remains conspicuously weak although there are tentative signs of a modest recovery in recent months. Household demand remains sluggish and the unemployment rate for the area as a whole has risen. The burden of adjustment to the global slowdown has been highly asymmetric and this raises the risks associated with sustaining the recovery. The US has been virtually alone among the OECD countries in pursuing an aggressive and flexible countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy - cuts in policy interest rates have been the largest and the swing in structural government balance from a surplus of 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2000 to a deficit of 5.1 per cent in 2003 is the largest in three decades. Global growth will continue to be led by the US, but significant downside risks could emanate from the emergence of the record current account and fiscal deficits of the US. While the depreciation of the US dollar has so far been relatively orderly, further and substantial depreciation remains a danger to global recovery in the shadow of the twin deficits. History suggests that even an orderly adjustment in key exchange rates is likely to be associated with a slowdown in US growth - and, if growth in the rest of the world remains weak, in global growth as well (IMF, 2003). The continuing dependence of the world on the US heightens the risks of disorderly adjustment, particularly if it translates into an off-setting appreciation of the euro. In contrast to the mid-1980s, when the US ran current account deficits of similar order as in 2003, neither Europe nor Japan is in a position today to pick up the slack. Looking ahead, it is unlikely that the US can provide the degree of support to the global economy that it has in the past. In particular, high fiscal deficits would offset the longer-term benefits of tax cuts and rising debt service burdens in the household sector will curb future consumption spending. In the euro area, whereas monetary policy can be adjudged to have been successful in an inflation targeting framework, the economic slowdown has been deep and prolonged, with GDP declining in the second quarter of 2003. The largest economies - Germany, France, the Netherlands and Italy - are in recession with high levels of unemployment. The unemployment rate is 8.8 per cent for the euro area as a whole and even higher in some individual countries: 13.2 per cent in Belgium, 9.7 per cent in France, 10.5 per cent in Germany, 8.5 per cent in Italy and 11.4 per cent in Spain. Despite some recent improvement in expectations, household and business confidence remains depressed. The poor performance of Germany, in particular, threatens to hold back the region’s recovery. Corporate balance sheets are still adjusting to the bursting of the asset price bubble of the late 1990s and this is holding down investment spending. Exports have been adversely affected by weak external demand as well as the substantial appreciation of the euro over the past two years. Monetary policy has been accommodative but different inflation and unemployment rates in different countries blur the effectiveness of the common monetary policy. A more activist approach is warranted especially when downside risks to individual countries have potentially area-wide spillovers. Although Germany and France are expected to post fiscal deficits above 4 per cent of GDP in 2003, the scope for countercyclical fiscal policy is limited by the Stability and Growth Pact. Structural reforms hold the key 2 BIS Review 54/2003 
to improving Europe’s economic performance, including further liberalisation of labour and product markets, pension reforms and offsetting measures to deal with the aging population. In Japan, macroeconomic performance during 2003 has exceeded expectations alongside an improved external environment and upturn in equity markets. The outlook remains overcast with deflationary pressures and persistent weakness in the financial sector. The possibility of declines in equity or bond prices, a sustained appreciation of the Yen and rising public debt remain dangers to a durable recovery. More rapid and bolder reforms in the financial sector are needed to address the large overhang of non-performing loans and the poor quality of capital in the banking sector. Financial sector measures need to be complemented by corporate restructuring. Quantitative easing of monetary policy has kept short-term interest rates at zero, but has not been aggressive enough to end deflation. The build-up of public debt and pressures from population aging necessitate a medium-term strategy to impart sustainability to fiscal policy. Overall, global macroeconomic imbalances and the associated misalignment of the G-3 currencies remain the most serious threat to a broad-based and robust recovery. This has implications for the pattern of capital flows. In contrast to preceding years, the US current account deficit has been financed primarily by sale of government and corporate paper rather than equity inflows. The bulk of these investments has been by central banks, particularly those in Asia. This is clearly unsustainable and adjustments will be needed to achieve medium-term stability. An eventual narrowing of the US current account deficit will require emerging economies to share in the adjustment to prevent an undue burden on the euro area. A current issue of concern is the practice of greater flexibility in the exchange rate regimes of these countries, and the resulting efforts on the real economy. Studies have shown that greater volatility in developing countries’ real exchange rates has been associated with greater misalignment in G-3 countries with disruptive effect on both trade and finance channels. This emerges as a major source of uncertainty for the conduct of monetary policy. The current imbalances in the world where Asian countries are financing Western countries, particularly, the US could have their roots in longer term demographic imbalances. The long-term demographics facing the world, which have an effect on the savings rate are not encouraging. The demographics in Europe, Japan and the US are against high saving rates. The median ages in Japan, Europe and the US are 4l, 40 and 35 years, respectively. Current trends indicate that the median age in Japan will increase to 50 by 2025. The situation in the US may not turn adverse due to their flexible immigration policies. Within Asia, India and China can expect their savings rate to increase further, given that the private savings of these two countries are among the highest in the world, and in view of their favourable demographics over the next 20 years. Countries like India and China, which account for a large proportion of world population, also have low urbanisation levels of 30 to 35 per cent and will be moving to 50 to 55 per cent in the next 20 to 30 years. This would necessitate higher infrastructure investment requiring higher capital inflows and a higher current account deficit. Thus, if the Asian countries are to run large capital account surpluses and current account deficits, the situation in the US and Europe would meet reversal. The issue is to try to comprehend what would be required for this macro reversal to occur. The current demographic trends in Europe and Japan are not sustainable. In the future, they may not be able to afford the pension system and social security as they exist now. The only solution in Europe seems to be US type of immigration policies towards labour market reforms. Currently, this is not possible because of high unemployment. III. Inflation: what is going on In this brief overview of the global economic situation today, I have tried to indicate that global imbalances are inter-related and how monetary policy making in countries like ours has become that much more difficult on a day-to-day basis. The most notable achievement in recent years has been the substantial success in almost all countries in reducing inflation to the lowest level in several decades. Sustained inflation is a relatively modern phenomenon. Until World War I, the international experience was one of long-run price stability. Following the turbulence of the inter-war period, the Second World War and the Korean War of the early 1950s, the Vietnam war of the 1960s and early 1970s, inflation gradually increased from the late 1960s, party as a result of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. The massive oil price hike of 1973 stepped up global inflation to double-digits in the US and Western Europe. There was a huge transfer of resources to the Middle East from the rest of the world including Asia. The lasting consequence of this development of the 1970s has been the migration of workers from countries like ours who are now remitting back large sums of money on a sustained basis. BIS Review 54/2003 3 
Although inflation abated in 1978, it rose to double-digit levels again by the end of 1979 following the second oil shock. Inflation finally broke in 1982, under the impact of aggressive disinflationary policies. The 1980s were marked by strong and widespread efforts to restore reasonable price stability through a combination of tight monetary policy, fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. The reduction in inflation, facilitated by a significant decline in oil prices, set the stage for a robust economic recovery that continued till the end of the 1980s. Another inflation episode in 1989-90 due to the hardening of oil prices was met with aggressive monetary policy action which enabled a cooling-off by 1991 at the cost of a much shallower recession than the early 1980s. Since then, the world has been going through one of the longest phases of low inflation in post-World War II history. The decline in inflation is evident across countries at different stages of development. It has been most spectacular in developing countries where inflation fell from 31 per cent in early 1980s to under 6 per cent in 2000-03. In Latin America and the countries in transition where inflation averaged 230 per cent and 360 per cent, respectively, during 1990-94, it is projected at around 10 per cent in 2003. Out of 184 members of the IMF, 44 countries had inflation greater than 40 per cent in 1992. In 2003, this number has fallen to 3. For industrial countries, inflation, currently at around 2 per cent, has fallen below the lows of the 1950s. Arguably, deflation threatens more countries today than does high inflation. What has brought about this significant decline in inflation globally? A significant strand in the literature points to institutional changes in the conduct of monetary policy - independent central banks, increased transparency, greater accountability through contractual frameworks, and greater coordination between monetary and fiscal authorities - which has enhanced the reputation of monetary authorities and increased public credibility in their ability to deliver low inflation. An equally influential body of work, however, suggests that monetary authorities have just been lucky and that there are other factors at work such as increased level of competition due to the forces of globalisation, successful fiscal consolidation in developed countries, particularly in the context of the Maastricht Treaty, and structural changes in the global economy in which productivity has a major role to play and the rising prominence of the new economy. Have central banks been lucky or good? Perhaps a bit of both (Rogoff, 2003). While the evidence on either side is still evolving, the current assessment is that it is unlikely that there will be a reversal of the current trend in inflation. It is important, however, to introspect a little further in order to understand the dynamics of low inflation and its future compatibility with monetary policy in an international setting. An important factor that might have contributed to the lowering of inflation is productivity growth. Although productivity growth in Europe may not have been as high as it has been in the United States, the disinflationary effects of such productivity growth in one region get transmitted across borders through increased competition in a globalised world, operating through lowering of price mark-ups and erosion of monopoly pricing power through the expansion of cross border trade. Increased competition has made prices more flexible in their response to real activity, thereby reducing the incentive for monetary policy to be expansionary. This has reinforced credibility in the commitment of monetary policy’s containing inflation (Rogoff, op cit). Despite growing globalisation and synchronisation of business cycles, the most striking change over the past three decades has been the moderation of volatility in GDP growth in most G-7 countries and this could also have contributed to lowering inflation (Stock and Watson, 2003). A number of factors are at work. First, the services sector, which is less susceptible to volatility than manufacturing, has increased its share in output. Second, inventory management has improved. Third, financial markets have provided households with easier access to credit. In the US, the sector that witnessed greatest reduction in volatility is housing. Moreover, there have been fewer oil supply and price disruptions as well as smaller productivity shocks in the 1980s and 1990s than during the 1960s and 1970s. Although only a small part of the moderation in output volatility is attributed to monetary policy, this is hotly debated. For instance, it is widely believed that monetary policy in the US has been successful in implementing anticipatory non-inflationary policies and has focused on sustainable long-term real rates of interest (De Long, 2003). A significant increase in the flexibility of the US economy to smoothen shocks as a result of deregulation, technology, better inventory management and flexible labour markets has enabled it to absorb shocks. The manner in which a shock is defined is critical. The perception of a smaller shock is really ‘net shock’ i.e. gross shock minus what has been absorbed. Thus, events like September 11 can be measured only in a net sense. Moreover, in an integrated world, it would be difficult to distinguish between exogenity and endogeneity; for instance, an increase in oil prices could very well be treated as endogenous. 4 BIS Review 54/2003 
Yet another set of forces operating on inflation emanates from technological change. Advances in architecture and engineering as well as development of lighter but stronger materials has resulted in “downsized” output, requiring more technology sophisticated input. This process has accelerated in the recent decades with the advent of the semi-conductor, the micro-processor, the computer and satellite. The impact of technological change is evident in the huge expansion of the money value of output and trade but not in tonnage. As a consequence, material intensity of production has declined reflecting, as Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan (1998) noted, “the substitution, in effect, of ideas for physical matter in the creation of economic value”. This has contributed to the secular decline in commodity prices. In fact, a long-run trend decline in commodity prices over the last 140 years shows little evidence of reversal. Concerns over increasing commodity price volatility around this declining trend have, however, increasingly engaged monetary policy attention in the short-run. A significant strand in the literature credits changes in the institutional and operating framework of monetary policy with the success in achieving low inflation. After the experience of sustained inflation of the 1960s and 1970s, the objective of inflation control became stronger, and the movement of inflation targeting emerged. Massive cross-border capital flows, globalisation of financial markets and the information technology revolution have combined to alter significantly the choice of instruments of monetary policy, operational settings, lag structures and transmission mechanisms. In particular, these forces have led to the progressive erosion of the traditional anchors of monetary policy. In general, there has been a waning of the importance of intermediate targets. Even as monetary authorities deal with this difficult transition, several countries have radically altered the institutional architecture of monetary policy, including increased independence of the monetary authority, clarity of rules and responsibilities and constrained discretion. About 22 countries have adopted policy regimes with inflation as the single target of monetary policy. Indeed, inflation targeting is quickly emerging as orthodoxy in the design of monetary policy. The ongoing slowdown in global economic activity and the threat of deflation has, however, weakened its analytical edifice. Although the practice of inflation targeting is associated with a lowering of inflation, the jury is still out on the extent to which inflation targeting policies have actually contributed to the reductions in inflation that has occurred. Moreover, too low inflation, which is being observed today, is not just a disincentive for production decisions; it also delays consumer spending at a time when it could have been critical for triggering the upturn. It imparts inflexibility to labour markets, causing unemployment and deepening the slowdown. Signals from financial prices get blurred and this leads to misallocation of resources. In this context, the recent experience with inflation targeting as a framework for monetary policy warrants a close and hard scrutiny. The fixation with short-run price stability or ‘inflation nutting’, to borrow a term from Mervyn King, Governor, Bank of England can easily lead to neglect of important signs of macroeconomic and financial imbalances. Moreover, there is no available empirical evidence to suggest that inflation targeting improves economic performance. In the euro area, for instance, setting the inflation target at close to 2 per cent is associated with weakening economic activity. This got pronounced in the second quarter of 2003 when real GDP declined, accompanied by large scale unemployment and the threat of deflation in the larger constituents. Furthermore, the relevance of a single inflation target for a large economy, in particular, can be debated. The inflation target for the euro area suffers from the problems of a ‘one size fits all’ monetary policy. Regional disparities warrant different short-run monetary policy approaches to its objectives. A certain amount of target flexibility and balancing of conflicting objectives are unavoidable in the real world, particularly that of emerging market economies (Eichengreen, 2002). Indeed, there is a growing sense that by the time the current phase of global business cycle has run itself out, inflation targeting may not have stood the test of time. High and sustained growth of the economy in conjunction with low inflation is the central concern of monetary policy. The rate of inflation chosen as the policy objective has to be consistent with the desired rate of output and employment growth. An inappropriate choice can lead to losses of macroeconomic welfare. Monetary authorities have to continually contend with the short-run trade-off between growth and inflation. The problem is compounded by the fact that the association between growth and inflation is non-linear. At some low rates, inflation could operate in a manner that assists in bringing back unemployed resources into the economy and be beneficial or, at worst, neutral to growth. At higher levels, inflation is inimical to growth. There are also very low levels of inflation that are associated with no growth or even deflation. How low should the policy choice of inflation be or what is the threshold rate of inflation, if there is one, which is associated with the absence of harmful effects of growth, therefore, becomes a key question. There have been various studies that have attempted to estimate threshold inflation rates. They suggest that the threshold inflation rate depends upon a number of factors such as the structure of the economy, past inflation history, the degree of BIS Review 54/2003 5 
indexation, and inflation expectations. Some studies suggest that the threshold inflation for developed and developing countries fall in the ranges of 1-3 per cent and 7-11 per cent, respectively (Khan and Senhadji, 2000). An abiding problem with cross-country studies, however, is the risk of being influenced by extreme values since samples include countries with inflation as low as one per cent and as high as 200 per cent and even higher. The estimation of such inflation threshold rates, therefore, needs to be done for each country separately (Rangarajan, 1998), in order to understand the behaviour of the economy in relation to inflation. A major source of uncertainty in conducting monetary policy is the lack of a clear understanding of the inflationary process as it has unfolded in recent years. This has obscured a proper assessment of the nature of shocks impacting on the economy and the resulting risks to price stability. Variations in the timeliness and reliability of inflation indicators, uncertainty surrounding unobservable indicators like potential output and gaps in the intrinsic knowledge of the central banks about the state of the economy complicate the making of monetary policy. Knowledge of the relationship between inflation and its determinants remains limited (ECB, 2001). Even if there were a consensus on a suitable model, considerable uncertainty would remain regarding the strength of the structural relationships within the model. An even more fundamental problem is that parameters may vary over time as a result of structural changes in the economy. This presumably explains why no central bank uses a formal model to derive its actual policies; for the foreseeable future, models will be an aid to judgement rather than a substitute for judgement (Feldstein, 2003). The simple principle of inflation targeting thus is also not so simple and, poses problems for monetary policy making in developing countries. IV. The prime mover: international capital flows Global capital flows impact the conduct of monetary policy on a daily basis. The problem, however, is that capital flows have followed a boom-bust pattern. Net capital flows are currently limping back from the severe retrenchment imposed by the Asian financial crisis, which brought to an end the most dramatic surge of capital flows in post-World War II history. It is only in the recent period, particularly in 2003, that conditions for rejuvenation of capital flows are improving. Large swings in capital flows are observed not only in the short term but there have been long term patterns as well. A major surge in capital flows started around the 1870s and continued till the first World War. The flows were mainly between the so-called developed countries - from the core countries of Western Europe to peripheral Europe and overseas European settlements - and in the form of foreign investment, with more than two-thirds comprising portfolio inflows. This era, which coincided with the operation of the classical gold standard, is widely regarded as the high watermark of capital mobility. The boom ended with the first World War. A brief restoration of the gold standard was shattered by the Great Depression and the ensuing period up to the early 1940s was characterised by modest flows to the then emerging market economies for development finance. Capital controls were widespread in the attempt to maintain gold parities and international finance became fragmented by bilateral trade agreements. In the post-World War II period up to the 1970s, controls spread and intensified. International capital flows were primarily among industrial economies. The US removed restrictions on capital outflows in 1974-75 while Germany retained controls over inflows until the late 1970s. The UK maintained controls until 1979 and Japan completed liberalisation of the capital account in 1980. Developing countries persevered with controls with some Latin American countries embarking on flawed liberalisation as part of exchange rate-based stabilisation programmes in the mid-1970s. In the period since 1973, dramatic changes set in. Private capital flows to developing countries were renewed as commercial banks furiously recycled oil surpluses. Asia and Latin America received the maximum share. Developing country debt exploded, rising at a compound annual rate of 24 per cent (World Bank, 2003) until the debt crisis of 1982 burst the bubble. Capital flows to developing countries slowed down substantially but did not dry up. Between 1983 and 1989, they fell to less than a third of their level in 1977-82. A generalised risk aversion to developing country debt dominated international financial markets and developed countries turned into attractive destinations. By the end of the 1980s, direct investment inflows to developing countries were only one-eighth of flows to developed countries; portfolio flows to developing countries were virtually non-existent. During the 1980s and the 1990s, several developing countries in Asia undertook capital account liberalisation as part of unilateral financial deregulation, often in the face of large external surpluses. In general, the period from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s was characterised by removal of official restrictions on financial markets and wider market-oriented reforms in both mature and emerging market economies. The most dramatic 6 BIS Review 54/2003 
move towards capital account liberalisation occurred among the continental members of the European Union. Investor confidence returned to the developing world in the early 1990s in the aftermath of the Brady Plan. Net capital flows surged to pre-1914 levels by 1996, temporarily slowed by the EMS crisis of 1992. The impact of the Mexican crisis of 1994 was absorbed by the large mobilisation of official financing which acted as a buffer. The composition of flows altered significantly, with private flows exceeding the official flows by the end of the 1980s. Whereas in the 1970s bank lending was the dominant component of capital flows to emerging markets, starting in the early 1990s, equity and bond investors became dominant. Over the last decade, portfolio investment exceeded bank lending in eight years. The range of investors purchasing emerging market securities broadened. Specialised investors such as hedge funds and mutual funds accounted for the bulk of portfolio inflows up to mid-1990s. In the subsequent years, pension funds, insurance companies and other institutional investors increased their presence in emerging markets. Although portfolio flows became important, it was FDI which accounted for the bulk of private capital flows to emerging market economies, going through a 6-fold jump between 1990 and 1997. International bank lending to developing countries increased sharply in this period, and was most pronounced in Asia, followed by Eastern Europe and Latin America. Much of the increase in bank lending was in the form of short-term claims, particularly on Asia. In the late 1990s, capital flows to developing countries received severe shocks - first from the Asian crisis of 1997-98, then by the turmoil in global fixed income markets, and more recently by the collapse of the Argentine currency board peg in 2001 and the spate of corporate failures and accounting irregularities in 2002. Net flows to developing countries declined almost continuously after 1997. The fall was particularly sharp in the form of bank lending and bonds, reflecting uncertainty and risk aversion. In 2002, net capital flows fell again, remaining far below the 1997 peak. Flows to Latin America reached their lowest level in a decade. Flows to Asia began a hesitant recovery with new bank lending exceeding repayments for the first time in five years. Global FDI inflows, down by 41 per cent in 2001, fell by another 21 per cent in 2002, attributable to weak economic growth, large sell-offs in equity markets, and a plunge in cross-border mergers and acquisitions. The USA and the UK accounted for more than half of the fall. Flows to Asia were held up by China. Despite the global uncertainties, conditions for capital flows have improved in 2003. Sell-offs in international bond markets in June and July reflected upward revisions in investors’ expectations about growth prospects. Spillovers to credit and equity markets were limited. Emerging markets, in general, outperformed the mature markets. Some positive aspects of the roller-coaster of the last decade are: a steady consolidation of external debt by developing countries cushioned by the resilience of FDI, and the growth of local-currency bond markets as an innovation to manage credit risk. The experience of living with capital flows since the 1970s has fundamentally altered the context of development finance. It has also brought about a drastic revision in the manner in which monetary policy is conducted. In particular, there is a dramatic shift in the still unsettled debate on the determinants of the exchange rate and the choice of the appropriate exchange rate regime, although the weight of opinion is clearly in favour of a flexible regime. According to conventional wisdom, it was trade flows which were the key determinants of exchange rate movements. Consequently, the degree of openness to international trade, price and non-price competitiveness and factors which determined market shares abroad were thought to have a crucial bearing on the level and the movement of the exchange rate. In more recent times, with the tail of mobile capital accounts wagging the dog of the balance of payments, the importance of capital flows in determining the exchange rate movements has increased considerably, rendering some of the earlier guideposts of monetary policy formulation possibly anachronistic. On a day-to-day basis, it is capital flows which influence the exchange rate and interest rate arithmetic of the financial markets. Instead of the real factors underlying trade competitiveness, it is expectations and reactions to news which drive capital flows and exchange rates, often out of alignment with fundamentals. Capital flows have been observed to cause overshooting of exchange rates as market participants act in concert while pricing information. Foreign exchange markets are prone to bandwagon effects. The effects of capital flows on the exchange rate are amplified by the fact that capital flows in ‘gross’ terms can be several times higher than the ‘net’ capital flows. The experience with capital flows has important lessons for the choice of the exchange rate regime. The advocacy for corner solutions - a fixed peg a la currency board without monetary policy independence or a freely floating exchange rate retaining discretionary conduct of monetary policy - is BIS Review 54/2003 7 
distinctly on the decline. The weight of experience seems to clearly be in favour of intermediate regimes with country-specific features, no targets for the level of the exchange rate, exchange market interventions to ensure orderly rate movements, and a combination of interest rates and exchange rate interventions to fight extreme market turbulence. In general, emerging market economies have accumulated massive foreign exchange reserves as a circuit-breaker for situations where unidirectional expectations become self-fulfilling. It is a combination of these strategies which will guide monetary authorities through the impossible trinity of a fixed exchange rate, open capital account and an independent monetary policy. Capital movements have rendered exchange rates significantly more volatile than before. For the majority of developing countries which continue to depend on export performance as a key to the health of the balance of payments, exchange rate volatility has had significant real effects in terms of fluctuations in employment and output and the distribution of activity between tradables and non-tradables. In the fiercely competitive trading environment where countries seek to expand market shares aggressively by paring down margins, even a small change in exchange rates can develop into significant and persistent real effects. For labour intensive export producers, volatility in exchange rate movements can easily translate into large losses of economic welfare. In the final analysis, the heightened exchange rate volatility of the era of capital flows has had adverse implications for all countries except the reserve currency economies. The latter have been experiencing exchange rate movements which are not in alignment with their macro imbalances and the danger of persisting currency misalignments looms large over all non-reserve currency economies. The issue dominating the conduct of monetary policy and exchange rate policy today in countries such as India and China is that of excess of capital inflows. Are these flows resulting from temporary global imbalances emanating from current economic policies and problems of the G-3 countries? Or do they reflect global changes of a more lasting nature. It is to the consideration of this issue that I now turn. V. Looking ahead: economic demographics Some recent research has focussed on the macroeconomic effects of demographic patterns (Joshi and Sanyal, 2003; UN, 2003). Over the next half-century, the population of the world will age faster than during the past half-century as fertility rates decline and life expectancy rises. The proportion of children (0-14 years) is expected to decline from 30 per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent in 2050 whereas the proportion of the aged (60+ years) will double, reaching 21 per cent of the total population by 2050. The phenomenon of global ageing is likely to be associated with a progressive decline in saving rates and growth. In the interregnum, regional patterns of global population ageing are expected to bring about fundamental alterations in saving-investment balances which would be reflected in the magnitude and direction of international capital flows with implications for the conduct of future monetary policy. In general, economies pass through three stages of demographic transition - (i) high youth dependency (large proportion of population in the 0-14 years group), (ii) rise in working age population (15-59 years) relative to youth dependency and (iii) rise in elderly dependency (60+ years) relative to working age population. The second stage is regarded as the most productive from the point of view of secular growth since it is associated with the highest rate of saving and work force growth relative to the other stages. So far, the more developed regions have been leading the process of population ageing and are likely to be deep into the third stage of demographic transition. In Europe, population ageing is most advanced and by 2050, this is projected to accelerate. Japan is currently the country with the oldest population; by 2050, it is expected to have the highest proportion of elderly people among industrialised nations (Government of Japan, 2003). Projections suggest a turning point between 2010 and 2030 when the European Union, North America and Japan will experience a substantial decline in saving rate relative to investment which would be reflected in current account deficits. These regions will switch to importing capital. Most of the high performers of East Asia and China are in the second stage of the demographic cycle. Elderly dependency is expected to double by 2025. Their working age populations will increase modestly and then shrink. These projections suggest that East Asia could increasingly become an important supplier of global savings up to 2025; however, rapid population ageing thereafter would reinforce rather than mitigate the inexorable decline of global saving. Increasingly it would be the moderate and the low performers among the developing countries which would emerge as exporters of international capital. India is entering the second stage of demographic transition and over the next half-century, a significant increase in both saving rates and share of working age population is 8 BIS Review 54/2003 
expected. The share of the labour force in population is expected to overtake the rest of Asia, including China, by 2030. In this scenario, the current phenomenon of overall surpluses in the balance of payments being run by several emerging market economies, including India, may not be a temporary one. The largest reserve holding countries (excluding gold) in the world are emerging market economies. Monetary authorities in these countries are grappling with the expansionary effects of net foreign assets on domestic monetary conditions. Faced with the loss of control over the monetary aggregates, interest rates and exchange rates, almost all of these countries are engaged in devising innovative methods of sterilisation to delay the inevitable sacrifice of discretion in the conduct of monetary policy and its globalisation. The emerging patterns of demography indicate that this source of uncertainty for monetary authorities could become more significant than before. The key challenge for macroeconomic policies would be to ensure that the anticipated expansion in saving in developing countries is productively utilised within the economy and not exported abroad. Accordingly, it is vital to ensure that the investment rate rises in close co-movement with the saving rate. Sustainable growth hinges around the existence of a critical minimum in terms of physical infrastructure. The acceleration of growth in the future requires massive investments to close the gaps between demand and supply in key infrastructural areas such as power, roads and highways, ports and telecommunication, cities and urban utilities. India, China and Indonesia, which account for more than a third of the world’s population can be expected to continue urbanising over the next 20 to 40 years. During this period, the investment demand for resources emanating from these countries related to urbanisation will assume larger magnitudes. The history of urbanization has been that countries that undergo such growth in levels of urbanization - from around 25 to 30 per cent to around 50 to 60 per cent - typically have to attract external savings to supplement their own to satisfy the massive financing needs for infrastructure investment during this period. If the conjecture regarding the course of demography and associated savings pattern that I have just posited are correct, it is unlikely that the current low inflationary scenario will continue in the medium term to long term. It is also possible that the current phenomenon of increasing savings rates in Asian countries like India and China does not continue to be valid over the next medium to long term. If that happens, there could again be a reversal of capital flows. There would then be tightening of liquidity in world capital markets with increased competition for resources. Thus, there is no assurance that the current trends of excess liquidity accompanied by low inflation will necessarily continue in the world. Recent experience tells us that such reversals can occur very rapidly. This will pose significant problems in the conduct of monetary policy for our countries in the years to come. The future growth strategy will also need to be more labour absorbing to accommodate the projected expansion in the work force. Reforms in the labour market, educational systems, pensions and medical care would gather importance within the overall intensification of structural reforms. Monetary policy would have to play an important role in bringing these forces together by ensuring appropriate real interest rates and low and stable inflation. VI. The emerging challenges to monetary policy There are many issues that are of relevance to emerging economies like India and Sri Lanka that are opening up. It would be useful to summarise some of these here. In a world of generalised uncertainty, monetary policy has lost its traditional moorings. As a consequence, the conduct of monetary policy has become increasingly complex. The determinants of exchange rate behaviour have altered dramatically. Earlier, factors affecting merchandise trade flows and the behaviour of goods market provided proximate guides for operating monetary policy. In this environment, a monetary policy principally targeting low inflation was relevant and commodity purchasing power parities seemed to offer a satisfactory explanation of exchange rate changes. Since the 1980s, vicissitudes of capital movements have shown up in volatility in exchange rate movements with major currencies moving far out of alignment of underlying purchasing power parities. On a day-to-day basis, it is capital flows which move exchange rates and account for much of their volatility. The impact of greater exchange rate volatility has been significantly different for reserve currency countries and for developing countries. For the former, mature and well-developed financial markets have absorbed the risks associated with large exchange rate fluctuations with negligible spillover on to real activity. Consequently, the central bank does not have to take care of these risks through its monetary policy operations. On the other hand, for the majority of developing countries, which are BIS Review 54/2003 9 
labour-intensive exporters, exchange rate volatility has had significant employment, output and distributional consequences, which can be large and persistent. All this has made the operation of monetary policy more difficult and complicated. For developing countries, in particular, considerations relating to maximising output and employment weigh equally upon monetary authorities as price stability. A crucial objective of the development strategy is to stabilise the fluctuations of output and employment. Accordingly, in developing countries, it is difficult to design future monetary policy frameworks with only inflation as a single-minded objective. Thus the operation of monetary policy has to take into account the risks that greater interest rate or exchange rate volatility entails for a wide range of participants in the economy. Both the fiscal and monetary authorities inevitably bear these risks. The choice of the exchange rate regimes in developing countries, therefore, reveals a preference for flexible exchange rates along with interventions to ensure orderly market activity, but without targeting any level of the exchange rate. There is interest in maintaining adequate international reserves and a readiness to move interest rates flexibly in the event of disorderly market conditions. It needs to be recognised that most developing countries are engaged in the process of development and integration of financial markets. Consequently, signals from the market get blurred by the degree of management which is unavoidable in this transition. The actual experience over the last two decades has been that with greater liberalization of the financial system, inflation has fallen and output volatility has moderated. Monetary policy has played an important role in taming inflation in the last two decades. A valuable lesson for an economy in the process of opening up is that increased globalization and competition has contributed predominantly towards containment of inflation. Thus countries’ perspective on inflation needs to be informed increasingly by world price trends, particularly in commodities of interest to them. With continued deregulation and globalisation, it is unlikely that there will be a reversal of the current trends in inflation. However, this is not to suggest that globalization is a solution for all problems. Any widespread relapses in the relatively favourable trends in globalization and deregulation, or relatively benign fiscal policies could reverse the achievement of recent years. An important consideration for reining inflationary expectations relates to the need to have clarity on price stability, effective communication, consistency in conduct of policy and transparency in explaining actions. Central banks should speak clearly to markets and listen to markets more carefully to ensure the intended objectives of policy. There have been some negatives from the process of globalization in the form of greater prominence of credit and asset price booms and increasing incidence of financial crisis. The wave of financial liberalization has raised the risks in the financial system. The key policy challenge for an emerging economy would be to put in place mutually supportive safeguards to ensure both monetary and financial stability. The most important lesson for us is that financial imbalances can build up even when inflation is low and hence monetary policy should have a slightly longer time horizon in terms of inflation. Apart from the above, there are merits to all countries in greater transparency, combining simple rules with discretion and effective communication. Orderly development of financial markets can make a big difference regarding the manner in which risks and shocks make an impact on the economy. A flexible exchange rate regime imparts greater flexibility in monetary policy to deal with shocks more efficiently. On the prudential side, it would imply strengthening further the macro-prudential orientation. Monetary policy and prudential regulation should, therefore, co-exist. Greater transparency and cooperation between monetary policy and supervision has been increasingly recognised the world over and has resulted in many central banks publishing financial stability reports. Although there is uncertainty about how economies operate and about monetary policy itself, uncertainty is no excuse for not pursuing price stability. In the pursuit of monetary goals, monetary policy authorities could adopt formal models and policy rules; informal target rules; or case-by-case decision making. In practice, no central bank relies exclusively on formal models to derive final policy. Models assist central banks to take judgments. Furthermore, as Greenspan recently commented, most of the formal models are vastly simplistic and despite efforts to quantify and capture more variables, they are inadequate. Their knowledge base is barely able to keep pace with the complexities of the world. The problem is not of the models but of the complexities of the world economy. An explicit numerical target is good for anchoring inflation but it comes at a cost. If the explicit inflation target cannot be achieved it weakens the credibility of the central bank. Thus it may not be appropriate to formulate monetary policy based on a simplistic inflation target or a single point inflexible point target as argued by many. The risks to the system can emanate from any variable, both exogenous and endogenous and policy makers response should be dynamic and contextual. Rules can, therefore, only be viewed as thoughtful adjuncts of policy but cannot be a substitute for risk paradigms. A case-10 BIS Review 54/2003 
BIS Review 54/2003 11 by-case approach provides a simplistic framework for analysis. Ultimately, a central bank has to judge the outcome of the policy choice and also take account of market expectations. A prudent central banker should expect a high probability of a small outcome in order to avoid a smaller probability of a high adverse outcome. To conclude, in a globalised world, it is not possible to formulate monetary policy independent of international developments. Monetary policy formulation has become more complex and interdependent. Continuous monitoring of financial markets, upgradation of technical skills at the central bank, flexibility and eternal watchfulness hold the key to making monetary policy matter in the evolving global environment. A key factor that guides the conduct of monetary policy is how to achieve the benefits of market integration while minimizing the risks of market instability. An integral component of central bank work is the development of financial markets that can increasingly shift the burden of risk mitigation and costs from the authorities to the markets. The adverse implications of excess volatility leading to financial crises are more severe for low-income countries. They can ill-afford the downside risks inherent in a financial sector collapse. Central banks need to take into account, among others, developments in the global economic situation, the international inflationary situation, interest rate situation, exchange rate movements and capital movements while formulating monetary policy. 
Eva Srejber: Financial delegation - how do I keep a check on those managing my money? Speech by Ms Eva Srejber, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to the Swedish Shareholders Association, Stockholm, 25 November 2003. *      *      * Introduction Let me begin by thanking you for the invitation to speak at the Swedish Shareholders Association. During the time at my disposal I intend to discuss the issue of what opportunities we savers have to ensure that our money is not used for purposes other than to improve our personal finances. This is a problem that has dogged us for quite some time and it has risen to the surface once again with the discussions on ownership of certain Swedish life insurance companies. What makes this question particularly interesting for the representative of a central bank are the further complications that can ensue if the general public loses confidence in those managing its savings. If this were to happen, it would affect more than just the savers. There is a risk that we would all be affected in the form of poorer economic growth. As confidence crises can arise in all forms of savings, regardless of whether this is via normal bank accounts, through direct purchases of shares or deposits in funds, I shall discuss the issue on a more general level and not focus on the present problems in the life insurance companies. Driving forces behind saving The deregulation of the financial markets that began in Sweden during the 1980s signified major changes for Swedish savers. Suddenly we had much greater rights to decide over our money ourselves and to take many of the savings decisions that were previously a central government monopoly. The rapid and innovative developments in the financial markets also gave savers greater opportunity to choose different types of savings. It is not surprising that during this time we have also seen a large increase in financial savings. The deregulation processes explain some of this. The tax reforms and the return to a low-inflation economy are other explanatory factors. However, the underlying trend is mainly due to demographic changes. As recently as in the 1980s, people invested the greater part of their savings in real assets, such as housing and durable consumption goods, as well as human capital, i.e. various forms of education. Since then, financial investments, whether in bank accounts or in various types of securities, have taken up a larger part of people’s savings. This change can be broadly explained by people adapting their consumption and thereby their savings according to different life phases. When they are young, their consumption usually exceeds their income. This is when people start a family, get an education, buy cars and houses or apartments. To cover all of this expenditure, most of us borrow money. As the years go by, incomes rise, enabling people to reap the fruit of investments in human capital, while they have already made their major investments. Their debts can now begin to be paid off and their financial savings can increase. One conclusion is that the larger the percentage of young people in relation to older people, the larger the savings in real assets. On the other hand, a country with a slightly older population has a relatively large percentage of financial savings. This description applies quite well to Sweden. Bearing in mind the need for change that population developments put onto the pension and welfare systems, it is also reasonable to assume that private financial savings will need to increase further in the near future. This is what will be required in future to be able to manage one’s finances after retirement. I discussed the link between this development and inflation in a speech I held on 19 November. Confidence forms the foundation When it comes to savings, most of us probably want to diversify as much as possible. Of course, we want to receive a good return on our savings, but at a reasonable risk level. We have also become more aware that it is net return, that is, the return after deductions for various charges, that determines how much our savings are worth. The demand for well-diversified savings at a relatively low cost has created the basis for the substantial expansion in passively-managed share index funds in recent years. Investments in these funds reflect the development of a given index, which means that active management becomes unnecessary. The fact that these funds have been so widely successful, at BIS Review 54/2003 1 
least on more developed markets, can be seen in the BIS report on institutional asset management presented last spring.1 As the report also shows, developments in the financial markets have opened up more exotic markets and sectors for our savings. Active management is more common on these markets, as the opportunities to pan for gold nuggets that will outperform the market average are considered greater here. This development has had great significance for the efficiency of the functions supplied by the financial sector. Here I am thinking of the possibilities for risk management and conversion of savings to risk capital for investment. The financial sector also has other important functions, but I will not be discussing them today. Diversification, as I mentioned earlier, is one example of how households can simply and relatively cheaply reduce risks in their savings. The increased confidence savers can feel through the diversification offered by various savings companies increases the flow of capital from savers to investors. As national boundaries are less distinct within the financial world, capital is able to move to where it is most useful, whether this is in Sweden or elsewhere in the world. Deregulation enables market forces to be utilised to a greater extent to allocate capital and manage risks. Once a society has taken this step, it must take the further step of ensuring that individual savers have confidence in the market actors. The possibility for the financial system to supply functions important to the economy in an efficient manner is based on the existence of such confidence. A glance in the rear-view mirror shows that this confidence cannot be taken for granted. What is happening in the life insurance companies now is a good example of this. Although the crisis is fairly limited, it clearly shows how fickle confidence can be. The amount of new savings in life insurance companies has been declining for some time now, but the scandals at Skandia have further fuelled savers’ mistrust. According to a survey by Sifo printed in Göteborgs-Posten newspaper on 2 November, three-quarters of the Swedish public lost confidence in life insurance companies after revelations of the scandals. Herd behaviour causes problems The risk of confidence problems arising in connection with financial delegation, that is to say, when I put the management of my savings in the hands of someone else, cannot be ignored. This is largely because all forms of financial delegation contain a potential conflict of interests. The person managing my savings may have quite different interest from me. One example is the herd behaviour observed among asset managers. To some extent, this is a question of rational behaviour based on the assets earning money on the charges paid by savers. It is important to be at least as good as the average to avoid losing the battle for savers’ money. Otherwise, it will be much more difficult to attract new savers. From this perspective, the cost of being poorer than average weighs heavier than the gain of being better than average. It will then be rational for asset managers to act in the same way as their counterparts. If everyone else buys IT shares, I as an asset manager will also have to buy them to avoid deviating too much from the rest. The major problem here is that this in turn could have a negative effect on the financial markets. It appears that this is the case. Herd behaviour has been highlighted as one of several possible reasons for the most recent stock market bubble and the ensuing crash. Large fluctuations in the financial markets make savings less secure. Well-diversified savings, for instance in a fund investing in both shares and debt securities, normally provides good protection against changes in share prices and interest rates, and people are aware of this now. On the other hand, it is less certain that they realise that the asset managers’ behaviour in itself can contribute to major fluctuations in the markets, which in turn makes well-diversified savings more risky than they ought to be. If the incentives programmes used to motivate individual asset managers are based on their success in relation to competitors, this can further reinforce negative herd behaviour. These problems can be aggravated by the construction of the index against which many asset managers are assessed. This is one aspect taken up in the BIS report I mentioned earlier. The weights used to calculate a company’s share in many of the most popular indices are based on the company’s market value. This tends to lead to overvalued companies being overrepresented in the                                                       1 Committee on Global Financial System, BIS, 2003, “Incentive structures in institutional asset management and their implications for financial markets”. 2 BIS Review 54/2003 
index. As asset managers’ opportunities to deviate from the index by underweighting overvalued companies is often very limited, the unavoidable result is that the manager may be forced to invest in companies that are considered overvalued. Naïve view of bonus programmes The remuneration structure for managers of listed companies is another potential source of a conflict of interests affecting savers. Linking senior management’s incomes to the development of the share price increases the probability that company management and shareholders will have the same interests. Senior managers will concentrate on increasing the value of the company, as this will give them higher income. The idea is that this will reduce the risk of senior managers occupying themselves with business that will not benefit the development of the company. This also benefits those who have invested their money in a savings company which has in turn invested in the company. The whole idea is, of course, based on the share price also reflecting some form of fundamentally expected change in value in the company. However, the corporate scandals in recent years show that it was naïve to link the bonus solely to the short-term development of the share price. This evidently gave less scrupulous senior managers an incentive to try to affect the share price through creative accounting or through dubious dealings in an attempt to affect the reported profits. If this type of bonus programme is to function, it will require much more sophisticated systems than merely linking the bonus to temporary changes in the share price. The bonus must be based on actual, sustainable improvements in the company’s results and it must have a ceiling. On the other hand, one can wonder why a good salary should not be considered enough incentive to do a good job. Whatever the circumstances, it can be observed that there is tremendous pressure from the general public and authorities to make changes. We should therefore be able to assume that improvements will be made, to reduce the risk of senior managers acting in a way detrimental to shareholders and those saving indirectly in the company’s shares. Ownership issue important but difficult Many people have pointed to the increase in institutional savings as the culprit in the bonus drama. The AP pension funds, the insurance companies and various types of asset management companies have tried to avoid taking on an active ownership role as far as possible. The reason given is that active ownership does not benefit savers. Active ownership costs money and also makes it more difficult to withdraw from a company one is dissatisfied with. The institutions have said they prefer to vote with their feet. If they are dissatisfied with a company, they quite simply sell their holdings in it. One consequence of this reluctance to exercise active ownership has been that more power has been transferred to company managers, who have been able to grant themselves unreasonable fringe benefits. The emergence of the institutional owner has also led to pronouncements about the advantages of the old, traditional family ownership. Personally, however, I am not entirely convinced that this is the best form of ownership. In Sweden this has meant that one owner has been able to control companies despite a very small capital contribution, what is known as pyramiding. As is the case with excessively powerful company managers, these owners can act in a way that does not benefit other shareholders. In Sweden the desire to control corporate groups has probably often been a more important driving force among some of the traditional owner families than an interest in increasing the worth of the shares. Personally, I believe that Sweden would benefit from more institutional investors electing to take an interest in ownership issues and how to check on those managing our savings. This would reduce the risk of expressions of avarice such as we have seen in ABB and Skandia. There are also signs that some institutions have begun to think along these lines. For instance, a couple of the AP funds have taken a fairly firm stand on ownership issues. However, it is important that we continue to discuss the role of institutional owners. A further potential conflict of interests can be found between shareholders and mutual fund participants in the bank-owned investment fund companies. According to Swedish law, an investment fund company shall be a limited liability company and act to maximise the value for shareholders. If shareholders’ interests and the interests of those contributing capital do not coincide, there are grounds for a conflict. One example is when a bank-owned investment fund owns shares in a BIS Review 54/2003 3 
company in which the bank in its turn has an interest as lender. If developments in this company motivate selling shares, and if this in turn could put at risk the capital the bank has lent to the company, there is a risk that the bank would try to influence the investment fund company to retain its shares. On the other hand, this risk should not be exaggerated. In Sweden the protagonists themselves, as well as Finansinspektionen (the Swedish financial advisory authority), have prevented the potential conflict from burgeoning. In addition, there is considerable incentive to act in a way that benefits savers. Bad deals would lead to a risk of savers selling their shares and perhaps most of all to a reduction in new savings. Dividend ban circumvented The conflicts of interest we have seen in the mutual life insurance companies are different from those that could arise in the bank-owned investment fund companies. This is because of the special construction of the life insurance companies. The surplus in the mutual insurance companies shall fall to the savers and thus may not be paid out as dividends. Despite this ban on paying out dividends, it is common for mutual life insurance companies to be tied to property and liability insurance companies. One may wonder why. Probably because there are other ways of earning money on savers in life insurance. It is usually the property and liability insurance company that manages the capital of the life insurance company and it certainly does not do this for free. Although Finansinspektionen has the task of examining whether the remuneration paid in these cases is reasonable, there is no regular procurement procedure for the management task and it is difficult to determine whether or not the contract benefits savers. As it is not possible to move their money, savers have no opportunity to take action if they are dissatisfied. The present discussions about Skandia have concerned whether it was right or wrong to sell the management contract to Den norske bank. However, the problem in this case is rather the fundamental contract that gave the property and liability insurance company the task of managing the life insurance company’s capital. It is also common that property and liability insurance companies handle the sales of the life insurance company’s insurance policies. This contract was not exposed to competition, either, which means that it is possible that the remuneration to the property and liability insurance company could be lower. There are a number of other examples of how money could have been transferred from the life insurance company to the property and liability insurance company. For instance, one could ask whether Skandia AB’s sale of property to Skandia Liv was really made at market prices. Folksam Liv granted loans to its sister property and liability insurance company that had the nature of risk capital. However, the interest on the loans appears to be lower than should be required for risk capital. The question is how this has been able to happen for so many years, without anyone reacting. We cannot blame it on ignorance of the problems. They have been brought up in various contexts over the years without this triggering any major discussion. Perhaps the current system has become so firmly established in our minds that we have been unable to see the actual risks. This has been the case for me. During the late 1980s I was on the board of directors of Försäkringsinspektionen (the Swedish private insurance supervisory service), but I cannot remember this issue being discussed, despite the fact that the problems were the same then as now. Everyone, from the government and Finansinspektionen to corporate management and consumer organisations, was aware of the problems. Despite this, very little has been done, apart from the introduction of the possibility to establish profit-making companies. Lock-in effects I have tried to give examples of conflicts in the savings chain that could have a negative effect on the value of savings. Such conflicts are inherent in all forms of financial delegation and are not, of course, limited to Sweden. The prevailing institutional structures in individual countries can lead to conflicts being expressed in different ways. But the fact that competition for savers’ money is not allowed to take full effect is probably an important factor in most cases. From an international perspective, it is difficult to claim that the supply of savings products in Sweden is too small. On the contrary, Sweden fares well in this type of comparison. Here the problem is rather that competition is curbed by various types of deadlock effects that stem from the old days of regulation in Sweden. 4 BIS Review 54/2003 
BIS Review 54/2003 5 The capital flow to the AP pension funds is safeguarded by legislation. Regardless of what we think of their management, there is little we can do to influence it. Formerly, the AP funds were used for political aims to subsidise house building by allowing them to buy housing bonds and treasury bonds below market rates. Fortunately, this is not the case today. Other parts of our pension savings have gone via collective agreements in the labour market to companies such as Alecta and AMF. We cannot influence the management of the money there either. Some life insurance and pension policies are in turn protected by taxation regulations. The premiums in the “P insurance policies” were made tax deductible in income tax returns, which together with the limited opportunity for transferring money meant that savings were locked in. There is also a lock-in effect with regard to savings in the investment fund companies attached to the banks. Reluctance to pay capital gains tax when selling mutual fund shares can make savers less willing to sell their shares, despite dissatisfaction with the fund growth. This is of course a problem that also affects those saving directly in equity. These various forms of lock-in effects have curbed competition in the savings market, which together with the obscure ownership in many limited companies, has probably been to the detriment of savers. A further problem that is of significance to competition concerns financial advice. In the United States there is a whole cadre of independent financial advisers who have no connection to the companies selling various savings products. This is not the case in Sweden. Here we still accept that our investment advice comes from the same people who then earn money on managing our savings. It is self-evident that such a close linking of these roles is far from ideal. Time for change So what shall we do? We must ensure that confidence can be maintained in the market participants. There is evidently a need to review the institutional framework regarding the mutual life insurance companies. It is not sufficient to have a general requirement for them to reorganise themselves. The government’s decision to appoint a commission to look into these problems is therefore a welcome one. Until this commission puts forward its proposals, it is important to ensure that people who abuse their positions should be replaced. This is precisely what has happened at Skandia. That is good. I think it illustrates that the market economy works. Even if people are upset over events in the life insurance companies, this should not need to entail widespread confidence crises. Some form of prevention can be achieved by pointing out the alternatives for efficiently-functioning, diversified savings offered in the market. Broad index funds with low fees are one example. It is also important to point out the need for serious financial advice independent of companies selling savings products. There should be a market for this in Sweden, even if it is expensive. However, releasing the entire potential competition in the savings market is not what would provide the best guarantee that savers’ capital will not be used for other purposes than improving savers’ finances. If we are to achieve this, the lock-in effects currently hampering competition must be broken. This in turn requires changes in tax regulations and better opportunities for insurance policyholders to move their money. I am aware that these are complicated issues. However, this does not make it any less important to deal with them as quickly as possible. Thank you. 
Lee Hsien Loong: Seizing the opportunities Address by Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore and Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the MAS Staff Seminar, Singapore, 18 November 2003. *      *      * I. Introduction We held our last Staff Seminar in October 2002 against a backdrop of weak global economic conditions and uncertainties in the Middle East. We anticipated then that MAS would have to manage within a riskier environment. And this turned out to be so. For us in Asia, the Iraq war and the SARS outbreak weakened business and consumer spending, and caused a major setback to the recovery of the regional economies. However, with the easing of geopolitical tensions and the containment of SARS, sentiments have rebounded and the outlook has brightened. We should now actively prepare ourselves to ride on the recovery and seize the opportunities that are emerging. II. Economic and financial landscape In the third quarter this year, the US economy expanded at a brisk annualized 7.2%, buoyed by rising productivity, strong investment and consumption. Economists are generally upbeat about US prospects for 2004. But they are concerned that in the longer term the US may not be able to drive the global economy, because of its large twin deficits, record household debt, and low personal savings. Europe is just starting to recover from two years of very weak growth. The Japanese economy has been surprisingly robust and the market is becoming more optimistic not just at the cyclical pickup, but also at better prospects for structural improvements. Asia is improving too, supported by easy monetary and fiscal policies and the more favourable outlook in the developed economies. Asian stock markets have been buoyant, and Asian merger and acquisition activities are on the rise. Investors are regaining interest in the region, as shown by strong capital inflows, particularly into equity markets. Growth is picking up. SARS failed to dent China’s growth, which is expected to reach 8% this year. South-east Asia is also looking up, especially Thailand which is expected to register 6% GDP growth this year.1 Malaysia has also recently projected its GDP to grow by 6% per annum for the next two years.2 The IMF believes that the world economy has turned the corner. Economic activity is expected to pick up strongly over the next 12 months, growing 3.2% next year, up from this year’s 2.3%.3 Likewise, the World Bank expects the East Asian economies to expand by 6.1% this year and by a more robust 6.7% next year.4 III.  Singapore’s economic and financial landscape Singapore’s economic and financial outlook In Singapore, following a dismal second quarter because of SARS, the economy rebounded strongly in the third quarter, posting a reassuring 17% quarter on quarter growth. With the improvement in the external environment, the outlook has improved considerably in the last quarter. We now expect the economy to grow between 0.5-1% this year. But we believe that in the short-term recovery will still be less vigorous, compared to previous cycles. This reflects the continuing restructuring in the Singapore economy, particularly in low-end manufacturing. However, both the manufacturing and services sectors appear poised to ride the recovery and next year we expect GDP growth to pick up to 3-5%.                                                       1 Source: Asian Development Bank. 2 The Business Times, 30 Oct 2003 “KL’s growth will average 6% in 2004-05: Mahathir”. 3 The Business Times, 24 Oct 2003 “Global economy bouncing back, says IMF”. 4 The Business Times, 5 Sep 2003 “East Asia will be fastest with 6.1% growth in 2003”. 
In the financial services sector, stock market activity reached record levels, with fund management and corporate finance activity also growing strongly. Following several negative quarters, the financial sector started growing again in the second and third quarters. As a result, growth in the first three quarters of this year averaged about 2.5%. The sector should register moderate growth for the rest of the year, and strengthen further into 2004. Prospects for Singapore’s financial centre What does the improved economic and financial outlook mean for Singapore’s financial sector? Back in 1998, when the Financial Sector Review Group was developing strategies for growing the financial sector, we thought that Singapore could become an international financial centre for certain activities, like London. For example, we were already the fourth largest FX centre in the world. We wanted to build on our strengths as a money market and treasury centre to become the debt hub for Asia. At the same time, in other respects we hoped to emulate Zurich. We could become the premier international asset management centre for Asia. After all, our well-respected regulatory, legal and accounting systems and stable socio-economic conditions had already made Singapore a location of choice for private wealth. After five years of promotion and development, we have achieved some encouraging results. The debt market has grown more than 3-fold since 1998. We have attracted some foreign issuers, and our own corporates have tapped international markets from here. However, we remain largely a market with domestic focus. We therefore need to do more to make our markets deeper, more liquid and internationally established. The prospects are good. Asian countries are now cooperating more closely to develop domestic bond markets. As corporates in our region expand their businesses to take advantage of the recovery, they will need more funding. We also see a clear trend towards more derivative products being structured here as investors look for better yields or protection. All these factors will help us to continue to grow our debt markets in size and sophistication as a major debt hub. In the equity market, the global trend five years ago seemed to be towards cross-border alliances and linkages. This has generally not worked out, except to a limited extent in Europe. Indeed, the last few years have been very difficult for stock markets world-wide. However, this year things seem to have turned. In Singapore, stock market activity reached record levels in recent months. Activity should stay strong, because of portfolio inflows in anticipation of the economic pickup next year. The increase in interest in the SGX and in listings on the exchange, from companies having substantial operations in China has been encouraging. There is also a new interest among regional exchanges to explore alliances with each other. We have maintained our position as a leading global FX centre, and this has opened up opportunities that were less apparent in 1998. One area is commodities trading. Financial institutions are now also major commodities players, with more financial products being structured based on commodity prices as the underlying risk. These structuring and trading teams are usually in the same business units as the FX experts, a number of whom are based in Singapore. In investment banking, for some time all the interest seemed concentrated in North East Asia. South Korea had recovered from the Asian financial crisis faster than the rest, and China was creating great excitement. However, strong investor interest in recent deals in Southeast Asia indicates a revival of regional M&A activity. Many Singapore firms have interest in expanding overseas, possibly through an acquisition strategy. With the economic recovery firms are likely to increase their capital expenditure, while countries will invest more in infrastructure and other big-ticket projects. This should foster further pickup in the syndicated loan market and Asian Dollar Market. One particularly successful area is wealth management, and its prospects remain good. In fund management, global mandates are now increasingly being managed out of Singapore. The industry is also expanding in breadth and depth. Beyond marketing and portfolio management, fund management firms are also locating regional functions such as trading, risk management and research in Singapore. More hedge funds are also setting up here, adding to the industry’s diversity. Private banking should continue its sterling performance, as Asia-Pacific is the fastest growing region for private banking in the world. According to Merrill Lynch, Asia-Pacific high net-worth individual wealth jumped 11% last year, supported by high savings rates and robust GDP growth in key regional economies such as China, South Korea and Australia. This figure could be an underestimate, given the low penetration of high net worth individuals in Asia by private banks. Bankers managing private 
wealth will be attracted to locations which enjoy political and social stability and possess well-respected regulatory, legal and accounting systems. Singapore has all these attributes and is well placed to become a premier centre for private banking business in Asia. Reputable and well regulated regimes like Singapore can provide a location of choice for investors and financial intermediaries alike, especially with the renewed emphasis on corporate governance and integrity after the excesses of the dotcom era. We can exploit this advantage to become a regional risk mitigation centre, for instance in the areas of clearing & settling OTC and exchange-traded products. The current outsourcing and off-shoring trend would also present opportunities for us. One estimate is that two million jobs would be created in lower-cost locations like India and China over the next 5 years. While we cannot compete with India and China on cost, we can compete for processing activities which are mission critical and of higher value-added. In the past year, major financial institutions have relocated higher-end middle and back-office operations here. These institutions take the view that Singapore’s developed infrastructure, reliability, and skilled manpower make us more suitable for these time-sensitive and mission-critical functions. In the banking sector, we have gone from 7 local banks to 3 over the last 5 years. Singapore banks have grown larger and stronger, and they are continuing to build up their regional footprints. As a regulator, MAS is happy that they have made progress strengthening management teams and building up risk management systems. Last year, one rating agency even ranked Singapore banks as being among the strongest not only in Asia but in the whole world.5 However, by international standards, the three local banking groups are still rather small, despite having made some regional acquisitions and undergone domestic consolidation. The largest of them, DBS Group, ranks only 96th in the world in terms of assets. The banks are also mainly Singapore banks, rather than regional players with strong presence in several countries. Possibilities for domestic growth are limited, other than by further consolidation. But countries in the region like India and Korea are opening up their financial sectors to foreign participation, and other regional and global players are starting to explore these opportunities. The local banks would be conscious of these industry trends. Does size matter to the local banks? There are differing views. One view is that it does, because economy of scale is increasingly important. The pursuit of size in the global financial industry has been underway for several years, and despite some less-than-successful mergers overseas, is still on-going. The most recent merger between Bank of America and FleetBoston Financial would create the second largest US bank with total assets of nearly US$1 trillion and operations across 34 countries. In this view, size also enables a bank to diversify across geography and products, which gives it a much stronger base. This is the way the industry is moving. If Singapore banks do not make it to be significant regional players, at least, then they risk being marginalised, and perhaps eventually being absorbed by other players. However, there are others who maintain the contrary view. They hold that size is not essential for banking or financial industry success. There exist successful smaller players who excel in particular markets or specialised areas of expertise, and Singapore banks can be among these. Furthermore, banks can only expand as fast as they can grow their business or assimilate new acquisitions. Over-rapid expansion can result in weaknesses and mistakes, and turn a small but strong operation into a large but vulnerable one. It is up to the Singapore banks and their shareholders to consider these opposing arguments and continually reassess their strategies. They will need to decide whether they need further scale to compete effectively, and if so whether it should be achieved through consolidation at home, expansion and acquisition abroad, or a combination of both. MAS cannot make this judgment for them, though the continued strength of our banking system depends on their making the right judgment call. Whatever the outcome, we need a core of strong local banks, as the stability of our financial system hinges on that. Overall, the prospects for our financial centre look good. Last year, employment fell slightly because of mergers, consolidation and the general economic weakness, but the worst seems to be behind us. More jobs are being created by the new activities that are being attracted here and by expansion in                                                       5 FitchRatings, The Singapore Banking System, 19 Apr 2002. 
established areas like wealth management. The financial sector will continue to be an important contributor to economic growth. IV.  Progress review of MAS’ 2003 business priorities Let us now briefly review how well MAS has achieved its business priorities over the past year before we focus on what we must do to grasp the opportunities arising from the financial services upturn. Managing within a riskier environment First, managing within a riskier environment. The financial industry is ever-changing - risk management practices are constantly being tested and challenged by new business models and financial products. The impact of these innovations on the safety and soundness of financial institutions, and on the resilience of the financial system is not always obvious. Regulators must continually seek to identify and manage new and evolving risks, without inhibiting the creativity and dynamism of the markets. As we continued to shift from one-size-fits-all to risk-focused supervision, we modified, adapted and updated specific supervisory practices and methodologies in line with industry developments. In the last year, we have taken steps to more clearly define (1) the objectives or desired outcomes of supervision, (2) the functions MAS performs directly or facilitates indirectly to achieve these outcomes, and (3) the principles that guide our supervisory approach. This will help us to steer through the environment of continuous change and greater uncertainty. We intend to publish the framework of our ideas on these issues. In all areas of supervision, we continue to build up our institutional knowledge. This includes understanding the key risk areas of individual institutions, and how they manage risks. We keep asking this fundamental question: What could go wrong with each institution that we supervise? Then we allocate appropriate supervisory resources, depending on the probability and potential impact of different mishaps. We are also making progress implementing risk-based capital requirements. The risk-based capital requirements for SGX member companies have taken effect in October. The models for insurers have been rigorously tested and will be implemented next year. In banking, where international risk-based capital standards already exist, MAS is working with local banks to prepare for Basel II. We are not going to prescribe the approaches for our banks to adopt, but we have encouraged them to put in place the more advanced risk management practices that would enable them to move to the internal ratings-based approaches if they chose to do so. To enhance risk management capabilities in institutions, we have also issued comprehensive guidelines on international best practices. We have recently completed the IMF/World Bank’s Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). According to the preliminary findings, the assessors have concluded that Singapore’s financial sector is robust with few short-term vulnerabilities. While we can take heart from the positive FSAP findings, we must not be complacent. We must remain vigilant to ensure continued confidence in our financial system. Strengthening partnership with industry Second, strengthening partnership with the industry. MAS has collaborated with the industry in several areas. We have embarked on a joint initiative with SGX to cultivate a stronger research-oriented environment in the stock-broking industry. We have also partnered banks to establish a cheque truncation system, and to include the Singapore Dollar as one of 11 global currencies in CLS (Continuous Linked Settlement). The participation in CLS eliminates FX settlement risk, and further consolidates Singapore’s position as a leading FX trading centre and a key node in the global financial system. Last year we formally adopted a policy of extensively consulting industry on new regulatory changes. Since January 2003, we have issued 17 consultation papers. The feedback from industry both here and abroad, has been useful in helping us formulate these changes. 
Deepening talent pool Third, deepening Singapore’s talent pool. As we move towards providing higher value-added services, we will face more intense competition for talent. We need to deepen our talent pool by training the local workforce whilst stepping up efforts to attract foreign talent with the requisite specialist skills. The industry needs professionals with market experience and skills to deal with the increasingly complex and volatile financial markets. To meet this demand, we need to enhance our training and development initiatives. Besides co-funding financial skills training under the Financial Sector Development Fund, we are actively promoting Singapore as a financial training hub. Discussions are now on-going with the newly established Wealth Management Institute and INSEAD as well as major institutions to develop corporate training centres and corporate universities. We would also like to build up Singapore’s financial research capabilities with an Asian and emerging market focus. We are currently exploring the possibility of establishing a financial research institute, in partnership with established financial research institutes worldwide. Enhancing market discipline To enhance market discipline, we have facilitated the establishment of industry-sponsored but independently-run complaints-handling processes and mechanisms for customers to settle disputes with banks and insurers. The banking industry now has a Consumer Mediation Unit and the insurance industry the Insurance Disputes Resolution Organisation (IDRO). Presently, we are working with the securities industry to study the feasibility of an industry-based dispute resolution scheme for the capital markets. Together with other government agencies, we launched a national financial education programme “MoneySENSE”, aimed at improving the basic financial literacy of consumers. The “For the Consumer” portal on MAS’ website provides a one-stop access to financial education materials, including consumer guides. V. MAS workplan for 2004 The past year has been a challenging one on many fronts, but MAS has made good progress in meeting its business priorities. With the global and regional economic recovery, many new opportunities will emerge. To capitalise on these opportunities, we have identified three key thrusts for our 2004 workplan. Enhancing our competitive operating environment The first thrust is to enhance our competitive operating environment. We aim to do so in the following areas. We will enhance the transparency of supervisory initiatives and policies. To improve financial institutions’ understanding of their statutory responsibilities, MAS will articulate more explicitly and systematically the intent of significant changes in legislation and regulation. We also intend to share best practices for compliance. We will also be reviewing our process for conducting monetary policy in light of the ongoing structural changes in the economy. We will be looking at how we make decisions, how we communicate the Monetary Policy Statement, how we implement the policy, as well as studying the transmission mechanism through which the exchange rate affects the real economy. Next, we will seek a judicious cost-benefit balance in our regulatory and supervisory work. MAS will not compromise the safety and soundness of individual institutions or systemic stability. But it will strive to supervise institutions without placing unnecessary regulatory burdens on well-managed individual institutions or inhibiting the innovation and dynamism of the financial sector. Compliance costs of supervisory actions will be commensurate with the risks posed by the individual institutions. We will seek consistency in applying equivalent prudential and market conduct standards to financial institutions conducting similar business activities that are subject to the same risks. Harmonising and integrating regulations and supervisory practices across financial activities will reduce opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. 
Working towards more win-win outcomes for Singapore and the region Second, we must work towards more win-win outcomes for Singapore and the region. The growth and development of Singapore depends on the health of the world economy, and the well-being of our neighbours and trading partners. As a hub and gateway in this region, Singapore benefits if the region is competitive and attractive to investors and new businesses. Southeast Asia must work together to make itself more attractive, especially with new opportunities and competition arising in North East Asia. Last month, ASEAN leaders agreed in Bali to build an ASEAN Economic Community by 2020 - a single market and production base with free flow of goods, services, investments, capital and skilled labour. Asian countries need to foster closer cooperation and integration between financial systems and markets in the region. This will facilitate the financing, and payment and settlement of intra-regional trade. It will also improve the working of capital markets, so that the businesses can raise the capital they need more conveniently and at lower cost. Asian countries are now making greater efforts in regional financial cooperation. When these succeed, they will hopefully spur countries to go further. They recently launched a USD Asian Bond Fund. Although this did not lead to any big bang, it underscored the interest among Asian economies to develop their capital markets. In consultation with the private sector, regional central banks are now working on a local currency ABF. As a financial centre, Singapore is well placed to seize opportunities as regional markets integrate. We will pursue a two-pronged strategy. First, we will actively participate in regional initiatives with the objective of making Singapore a key “interchange” in regional financial flows. Within ASEAN and ASEAN+3, Singapore is leading initiatives to strengthen capital market capacity-building efforts and foster greater cross-border collaboration among regional capital markets. We are advocating the adoption of international capital market standards and practices in ASEAN as an essential market foundation. We are realistic that the regional market will take some time to develop and accept that we cannot force the pace. But we need to stay engaged and strengthen our linkages with the major economies and emerging regions, to offer high value-added activities and secure our place as a key node in the region. On our own, we are already working to establish exchange linkages with major markets to enlarge market coverage out of Singapore. Second, we will work to take full advantage of the new FTAs currently being negotiated to create greater financial flows into Singapore, and to enable our financial institutions to access these markets. In our Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with India, we are exploring closer integration of our financial markets. Both countries stand to benefit if our financial sector players can operate seamlessly between the two markets. While there are many regulatory and other issues to be addressed, we see this as a unique opportunity for both India and Singapore. Empowering consumers to achieve fair dealing Third, we must empower consumers to achieve fair dealing. This will help us to develop a more informed and savvy consumer market, which is necessary to grow a vibrant financial sector. With liberalisation, there are now more channels for savings that entice investors with higher yields, such as bonds, equities, unit trusts, hedge funds, and insurance and annuity products. These products also carry higher risk. Has consumer sophistication risen in line with the complexity of financial products? As consumers seize new investment opportunities, how far should MAS safeguard their interests? MAS no longer practises merit-based regulation of products. It is neither feasible nor desirable for MAS to prescribe what consumers can or cannot invest in, how these products should be priced, or what terms and conditions should govern transactions. This would inhibit business enterprise, restrict consumer choice, and raise compliance costs. MAS cannot intervene in commercial disputes with individual institutions or arbitrate on contractual matters. Therefore, in 1997, we stated the rule should be “Caveat Emptor” - let the buyer beware, and watch out for his own interests. However, we have not left consumers entirely alone to fend for themselves. There may be an imbalance of power between consumers and financial institutions. Consumers may lack information and resources to participate confidently and knowledgeably in the marketplace. Thus, MAS has helped to empower consumers and to promote fair dealing by establishing a regulatory framework for 
increased information disclosure and sound market and business conduct standards. This regulatory regime requires offerors of investments to provide full, timely, accurate and meaningful disclosure of information to consumers, on a continuous basis. The intent is for consumers to make their own informed decisions. One objective of the “Money-SENSE” financial education programme is to equip consumers with the skills and tools to evaluate financial products, judge the risks involved and take responsibility for their actions. To address the issue of mis-selling and misrepresentation by financial intermediaries, MAS has facilitated the setting up of affordable and efficient channels for aggrieved consumers to seek recourse. This is necessary if market discipline is to work, and consumers are to receive fair dealing. With these channels in place, we aim to develop consumer self-reliance. Let me now illustrate these principles with two examples. My first example is the AIA Critical Year issue. This was a commercial dispute between AIA and policyholders, which had to be resolved bilaterally between them, whether through negotiations, industry-based dispute resolution mechanisms or the courts as a last resort. MAS could not intervene. But MAS had a responsibility to ensure that policyholders had full information of what AIA was offering them, what this was worth, and what other alternatives they had. MAS also had a strong interest in seeing IDRO, the industry based dispute resolution mechanism, work. Thus what MAS did was to ensure that information was disseminated promptly, accurately and adequately, so that policyholders could make a considered decision. We issued a policyholders’ guide to help affected policyholders understand their own policies and the options available to them. AIA was asked to issue a public statement to explain fully and clearly its support package and adjudication process. MAS also made it clear to the industry that if any dispute arose over the jurisdiction or authority of IDRO, it would have had to contemplate introducing statutory and regulatory mechanisms for dispute resolution. Full disclosure and working dispute resolution mechanisms are preconditions for a disclosure-based regime and self-reliance to work. The AIA dispute simmered for many months. Eventually AIA responded to the concerns of policyholders, including those raised by CASE on their behalf, by revising and substantially improving its offer. As this offer addressed many of the earlier concerns, MAS welcomed it publicly. This is one instructive example of how consumer or investor bodies, such as CASE, can play a useful role bringing together and articulating the common concerns of consumers. The second example is structured deposits. Structured deposits have become a popular new investment instrument providing the chance of higher returns than conventional fixed deposits, in exchange for the risk of lower returns if the bet turns out wrong. However, the calculation of returns and risks on such products may be complex. The average retail investor may not understand what the outcome depends on, much less judge the odds of things working out in his favour. Investors may also be misled by the assumption that, being deposits, such products are very safe. Nevertheless, MAS has not prohibited such structured deposits, because that would restrict investor choices and would benefit neither the industry nor the consumers. But under our disclosure-based philosophy, it is important that consumers understand exactly what they are buying. So MAS has proposed guidelines for full and meaningful disclosure of the risks involved, including reasonable illustrations of potential benefits, and clear explanations of any limits on returns. We have also required banks distributing such products to treat these as investment products rather than deposits which can be sold over-the-counter by bank tellers. These guidelines are currently under consultation. MAS will monitor how the market develops to see if further action is required. Going forward, we will produce educational materials to help consumers understand these products better. VI. Conclusion We stand on the threshold of a cyclical economic recovery amid profound structural changes to the global economy. For the first time, emerging economic powers, China and India, are thrusting themselves into the global economy. They are forcing a major reordering of the economic landscape, whether in terms of new competition for investments and exports, or new markets for products. Despite all the problems and complexities that Asia faces, this is the most dynamic region in the world. We need to continue to restructure the Singapore economy and move up the value chain of economic activities. Singapore will continue its role as an important financial centre despite the changing 
environment and challenges posed by China and India, and must find ways to benefit from these developments. Financial services will continue to be an area in which we have a competitive advantage. The economic recovery presents great growth potential. We need to position ourselves to capitalise on the opportunities. Market players must seek out and seize the business opportunities as they arise. They must continually reassess their strategies to remain competitive in this changing world, and more importantly, implement the good strategies vigorously to create new opportunities for themselves. MAS will continue to ensure the integrity of the financial sector, so that Singapore remains an attractive regional hub for financial sector activities. It will also adapt and respond to market developments to facilitate a more competitive operating environment. Together, MAS and the financial industry will navigate the winds of economic change and strengthen our position as a premier international financial centre. 
Pavel Racocha: Joining the EU - Impact on the financial sector of new member states Speech by Mr Pavel Racocha, member of the Board of the Czech National Bank, delivered at the conference entitled "The Single Market for Financial Services in the EU and Its Impact on Globalization", Sydney, 3 November 2003. *      *      * On May 1st, 2004, ten countries will join the European Union. Will the transition proceed smoothly? The main concern related to new countries joining the EU, from the point of view of the financial sector, is what impact the enlargement will have on the functioning of financial markets in new member states. Will competition in financial services increase and place a strain on institutions in accession countries or in the EU as well? Will there be visible impact at all? The new member states consist of eight former transition economies and of Malta and Cyprus. I will focus on developments in the transition countries, and especially in the Czech Republic, which I know best. I will also try to make reference to other accession countries to show that the results of developments over the last thirteen years, at least in the financial sector, are not so different.  This brief presentation cannot do more than deliver only a basic description of the past development of financial markets in the transition countries and of their current standing. Hopefully the data from this presentation can serve as background information for those interested in further studies. The financial sectors of the new Accession Countries have undergone huge and substantial reforms over last 13 years. When communism collapsed, there were no traces of a market economy, no free and legal entrepreneurial economic activity, and no institutions necessary for the functioning of a market economy. If we look at the transition economies - which represent 8 out of 10 acceding countries - today, we see a completely different picture. The basic institutions are in place and running (though sometimes slowly and not always predictably). The private part of the economy flourishes and is the symbol of a new and well functioning economy. How did this happen? And what happened to the financial sector? And what will be the impact of the accession to the EU on the financial sector, which in the accession countries is synonymous with the banking sector. In 1990, the average starting point for reforms in the former socialist countries, the situation in the financial sector was bleak. There were no services aside from basic banking and insurance functions. The banking sector was comprised of few specialized institutions, each of them a monopoly in its own area [one institution had monopoly on collecting deposits from the public, another institution provided all the foreign trade financing, and yet another institution was allowed to open accounts for individuals with foreign exchange incomes]. Then there was a monobank, the most important financial institution, which performed both functions, of a commercial bank and of the central bank [however skewed that could have been in the centrally planned economy]. We should also understand that commercial banking was not about evaluating loan applications and looking at projects’ fundamentals or clients’ credentials. In the former socialist countries, there was a State Planning Commission that decided how much of certain production would get produced and by whom. The role of the banks was limited only to finding funds for financing the planned production.  It is important to acknowledge the situation at the outset of economic and political reforms. This would also help us to understand some of the problems that the transition economies went through later on. Thirteen years ago there were basically no real banks, no capital markets, no experienced staff and no experienced management. In addition to that, there was no capital in the banks. The ratio of capital to banks’ assets was on average well below 1%. At the same time, there was a boom in entrepreneurial activities, with tens of thousands of new companies sprouting up. Their common characteristic was that they had no history, no experience, no capital, but great need for debt financing. On top of this, all the laws were changing, institutions [such as prudential banking supervision] were built only gradually, and the state as decisive owner in the banking sector was not up to its duties as good manager. As said above, the banking sector represented the crucial part of the financial sector of the country. Therefore, it was also the one to be hit the most seriously in the course of the economic reform, especially on the credit allocation side. On the contrary, deposits continued to grow despite the negative real interest rate.  BIS Review 53/2003 1 
The economic transformation included deregulation of most prices, thorough foreign trade reorientation [after the collapse of the Soviet Union], enterprise privatization, tax system changes, and foreign exchange liberalization. Given the depth of the economic transformation, the transition countries achieved relatively quickly a generally stable environment after the initial shock. This could be illustrated on the table describing developments in the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary in terms of inflation and GDP growth:  1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 CPI       Czech R. 52,0 12,7 18,2 10,2 7,98,610,0 6,82,54,0 4,1 0,6Poland 60,3 44,6 37,7 29,4 21,818,813,2 8,49,88,6 3,6 0,8Hungary 35,0 23,0 21,9 21,6 29,220,318,810,511,410,2 6,8 4,8GDP       Czech R. –11,6 –0,5 0,1 2,2 5,94,3–0,8–1,00,53,3 3,1 2,0Poland –7,0 2,6 3,8 5,2 7,06,06,84,84,14,0 1,0 1,4Hungary –11,9 –3,1 –0,6 2,9 1,51,34,64,94,25,2 3,8 3,3EIU Country data, national statistics As already mentioned, since the financial sector consisted mainly of the banking sector, the impact of economic reform was felt mainly by the banks. There was no alternative source of financing for corporations, so difficulties in the corporate sector were passed on directly to the banks. The situation was complicated more by the fact that the government owned some of the most important corporations, as well as the main banks. Political rationale preceded economics. In most of the countries, the privatization of most firms happened early in the transformation process. Banks were an exception to this, and in different countries, the approach to privatization of banks varied. In the Czech Republic, the privatization of banks had been delayed for several years due to the government’s belief that privatized banks would stop providing soft loans to strategically important firms. This fear was underlined by the experience with foreign banks that were entering the market since 1992 and cherry-picking their clients. After several years, the bad debt burden on banks’ balance sheets reached such a scale that government had to step in. Most of the debt ended up with a special governmental agency and the losses are being paid from the state budget. The cost of the bank clean-up in the Czech Republic is estimated at approximately 21% of GDP. In some other countries [Hungary, Poland], the privatization of banks proceeded quicker and the fiscal costs were substantially smaller [est. 6% for Poland, 13% for Hungary; in Szapáry, National Bank of Hungary, 2001].  Given what I have just described, the financial sector in the accession countries is nowadays in remarkably good shape. The banking sector is sound and stable, the role of non-banking intermediation is growing, and clients have access to most of the products and services they have in the EU countries.  Following table illustrates the importance of the banking sector in three major accession countries [Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland]: 2 BIS Review 53/2003

It could be also seen that despite the dominance of banks in all mentioned countries, the structure of other financial institutions differs significantly. This is the result of varying approaches to building these institutions. For instance, in the Czech Republic, we can see the smaller size of the investment business as a result of the quality of the capital markets, the lax regulation at the beginning of the transformation, and the subsequent and rather frequent occurrence of frauds in the past. The delayed start of pension reform has also contributed to this situation. The largest banking sector in the new member states is the Polish one, followed by the Czech and the Hungarian sectors. These three biggest countries account for more than 3/4 of the total new member states banking assets. The banking sector of all new member states is nevertheless very small in comparison with the EU market. The total banking sector assets in all new member states are only 345 USD billions at the end 2002 (thus just 31,5% of Citigroup, or 43,4% of Deutsche bank, or 45,5% of HSBC). 19Structure of ACs Banking Sector AssetsStructure of ACs Banking Sector Assets38%24%15%7%7%3%2%2%1%1%POLCZHUNCYPRSVKSLOLATLIT ESTMALTA* As of 31st Dec 2002, recalculated by market exchange rate BIS Review 53/2003 3 
A look at financial depth [as measured by banking sector assets to GDP] of individual markets in five accession countries [Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and Slovenia] shows that there is still significant space for growth of financial intermediation. Financial depth in the CR is the highest among the transition economies, but it is still significantly lower than in the EU [EU average 270%]. 7Financial Depth (Bank Assets/GDP in %)Financial Depth (Bank Assets/GDP in %)4050607080901001101201301996199719981999200020012002%CRHUNSVKPOLSLO Besides developments in banking, we can observe continuous growth also in non-banking financial intermediation [illustrated by Czech Republic]. In the Czech Republic, the share of non-banking financial intermediation on GDP increased over last two years from 19% to 21,7%. The highest increase was in the share of insurance companies and financial leasing institutions. However, the majority of these non-banking financial intermediators is controlled by financial groups headed by commercial banks. A relatively low share of investment companies and investment funds were negatively influenced by missing regulation and supervision in this field, however, there has been gradual improvement in recent years. In the area of pension funds we also witness gradual improvement caused mostly by government incentives, but we can expect quicker development if the government proceeds with intended pension reform. 10Increasing Role of NonIncreasing Role of Non--banking banking IntermediationIntermediation0,01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,09,01996199719981999200020012002Insurance C.Financial LeasingInvestment C.Pension FundsOtherCredit Unions1996199719981999200020012002Total21,217,918,620,019,020,621,7 4 BIS Review 53/2003 
The banking sector generally consists of previously state owned banks [since privatized to foreign banks], new banks established after 1990 as private institutions, and subsidiaries and branches of foreign banks. The approach to bank privatization differed in the new member states, but the results are now rather comparable. The banking sector is dominated by institutions governed by foreign banks [mainly from the EU], with exceptions being Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus. 9Role of Foreign BanksRole of Foreign Banks0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%ESTCRLITHSVK*POLLAT*HUN*MaltaSLOCyprusDomestic PrivateStateForeign* Percentage of foreign owned capital, other share of the assetscontrolled by foreigners Who are the main players in the market of the new member states?

As said above, the economic transformation had a large negative impact on balance sheets. Banks tended to lend to previously existing companies undergoing privatization that were faced with a sudden loss of foreign demand (mainly from Soviet Union) and had to restructure themselves by laying off a big part of their workforce. This proved to be a recipe for financial disaster. Financing of newly established companies with no track record, with business plans based more often on good intentions than on thorough analysis was no better. In addition, the political elite, who saw bank financing as the quintessential source of economic growth, encouraged this lending boom. Existing risks were widely disregarded. This inevitably led to a very grim situation in the banking sector, where many of the newly established banks collapsed under the burden of bad debts. The state-owned banks had to have their capital replenished by the government. Balance sheet cleaning was also one of the preconditions for banks’ successful privatization in the late 90’s. 12BS ProfitabilityBS Profitability-0,4-0,200,20,40,60,8119951996199719981999200020012002-2-1012345Gross profit/assets in %Net interestmargin in % Nowadays, the existing banks are well capitalized, the level of bad loans is relatively low and adequate provisions and reserves are made.

The legislative and regulatory framework has been already harmonized with the EU requirements. Special missions of experts from the EU countries have confirmed this in all of the new member states. However, the acqui communautaire are still developing and improving. This represents additional challenge for the new member states, since they must first adopt the existing rules, and also get ready for the coming changes.  The new member states are ready for application of Single Passport policy [it basically means that any bank from any EU country could provide services in the whole EU without additional licensing requirements.]. Since the domestic banking markets in the new member countries are competitive enough and have already a strong presence of foreign institutions, this should not lead to dramatic changes in lending in these countries.  Being a part of larger economic area, with banking sectors dominated by foreign institutions, will represent a new challenge for bank supervisors. The need for greater and more efficient cross-border cooperation will probably lead to changes in focus of the supervisory agencies.   After their accession to the EU, I do not expect any contagion effect among the Central European countries in case of difficulties of one of them. The institutional investors do not any longer view these countries as very coherent group. This assertion can be illustrated on developments of the exchange rate over the past two years. We can observe that the developments in the individual countries have little in common and the exchange rates followed paths reflecting domestic developments in the individual countries.

It is also expected that some of the most sophisticated risk management techniques will be done on group wide level and thus outside of the host country jurisdictions. There will be some risks and potential threats arising from the changes. But at this time, there is not a single specific risk that would threaten to disrupt the banking and financial services in the new member states after becoming part of the single market. Capital markets in the new member states were previously non-existent. In the Czech Republic, a capital market was developed as a “byproduct” of the voucher privatization. Introduction of regulation and supervision was delayed and the Securities and Exchange Commission was created only a few years after the market had existed.  The capital market is stagnating as a result of voucher privatization, during which the number of shares congested the market. This subsequently lead to large de-listing of the number of shares from the market (the number of shares traded now is 23 times smaller than in 1995, just after the voucher privatization). The market was also plagued by frauds and non-transparent behavior. The volumes and market capitalization has stagnated, 88,5% of total volume is concentrated into 5 shares. There has never been any IPO, and even the good companies are de-listed from the market after their privatization (such as Ceska Sporitelna, the largest Czech retail bank). Capital markets in some of the other new member states function arguably better than the Czech one, nevertheless their significance is also much less than in more developed countries. The aggregate equity market capitalization in all new member states represents less than 2% of market capitalization in the EU. The Warsaw Stock Exchange is the largest one in the region [40% of total]. 8 BIS Review 53/2003

It is evident that with limited share trading, there is not a very rosy future ahead. There are discussions about merging the markets in the region and possibly joining some European Stock Exchange. There are some speculations about the Stock Exchange in Vienna wanting to be the market for the region [Vienna is the second smallest SE in the EU.]. However, individual countries would prefer to either remain independent, or to cooperate more closely with some bigger partners - such as the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. As shown above, the financial sector is generally in good shape. There are some differences among the individual parts of the financial sector, but the main part [the banking sector] is as sound and BIS Review 53/2003 9 
strong as never before. This is due to several reasons, such as the improving legal environment, improving management, or even outright government financial assistance in the past. However, the greatest difference is due to the privatization to foreign banking institutions. These institutions have brought all the necessary components for successful long-term banking. The legislative and regulatory framework has been harmonized with the acqui communautaire. The harmonization has been confirmed by EC Peer reviews and by the multinational financial institutions (such as the IMF and World Bank during their FSAP process). Of course, there is still a lot of work to be done. The legislation and regulation shall be more streamlined, the area of law enforcement needs to function more efficiently, changes in accounting standards must be made. But these tasks are not related purely to the EU accession. They would have to be done under any circumstances.  The financial sectors in the new member states are functioning efficiently, and are stable and competitive. The majority of financial sectors are in foreign hands, well capitalized and well managed. Institutions from the EU are governing the largest financial institutions in the new member states. Introduction of the Single Passport policy will mean a change only de iure, not de facto. Foreign institutions that wanted to provide their services in the new member states are already present there. I do not expect any rush of new players to the new countries of the European Union. It is more probable that with increasing living standards of the population, the space for new financial products’ penetration will increase as well. I expect to see increased competition in this area, as already established institutions compete for new clients. It is unlikely that many new financial institutions will enter the market, because the market is already saturated, and players who had a strategic interest in Central Europe have already established themselves. Authorities from the new countries are already participating in committees and working groups established by the European Commission and European Central Bank, so that rules, as well as the policy thinking are being coordinated and harmonized. Challenges from the EU accession will therefore not represent any major risk. The problems and challenges that the new member states will face are not any different from those that are faced by the “old” member states, such as implementing the new Basle Capital Accord, implementing the IAS, increasing cross-border cooperation, monitoring activities of large complex financial groups, evaluating new complicated financial products, understanding risk transfer among different financial institutions. The transition will greatly benefit from the hard work that has been done during the economic transition and during the preparatory stages for the EU accession. It will be smooth and I do not expect any disruption of financial service in the new member states, or in the EU as a whole.  It could be said that the financial sector is already in the European Union. 26Useful linksUseful links•pavel.racocha@cnb.cz•www.cnb.czCzech NationalBank•www.nbp.plPolish National Bank•www.nbs.skSlovak National Bank•www.mnb.huHungarian National Bank•www.bis.orglinks to other national banks 10 BIS Review 53/2003 
Svein Gjedrem: The conduct of monetary policy Introductory statement by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at a hearing before the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs of the Storting (Norwegian parliament), Oslo, 1 December 2003.  Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. The statement is partly based on the assessments presented in “Report on monetary policy in 2003 - the first eight months” and Norges Bank’s Inflation Report 3/2003. The Charts in pdf can be found on the Norges Bank’s website. *      *      * I would like to thank the Storting for inviting Norges Bank to appear for the first time before this Committee to report and answer questions on monetary policy in connection with the Storting’s deliberations on the Government’s credit report. The mandate The operational target of monetary policy as defined by the Government is inflation of close to 2½ per cent over time. The target is symmetrical - it is equally important to avoid an inflation rate that is too low, as it is to avoid an inflation rate that is too high. The inflation target provides an anchor for economic agents’ expectations concerning future inflation. It provides an important basis for choices concerning saving, investment, budgets and wages. Households, businesses, public entities, employees and employers can base decisions on the assumption that inflation in Norway will be 2½ per cent over time. We have a very open economy with free capital movements. The krone exchange rate fluctuates from day to day. We do not have the instruments to fine-tune the krone exchange rate. Stable inflation expectations may nonetheless contribute to stabilising the exchange rate. Stability in the exchange rate and in exchange rate expectations over time are dependent on stable inflation expectations, which in turn depend on low and stable inflation. Norges Bank sets the interest rate so that future inflation will be equal to the inflation target of 2½ per cent. High demand for goods and services and labour shortages normally point to higher inflation. An increase in interest rates curbs demand and keeps inflation at bay. When demand is low and unemployment rises, inflation will tend to slow. Interest rates will then be reduced. The inflation target is therefore a vehicle for, not an obstacle to, monetary policy’s contribution to stabilising output and employment. This objective is also expressed in the Regulation on Monetary Policy. Normally, Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to achieving inflation of 2½ per cent at the two-year horizon. There are two reasons for this:  • Changes in the interest rate affect inflation with a lag.  • A reasonable balance is usually achieved between stabilising inflation on the one hand and smoothing fluctuations in output and employment on the other.  A rapid and pronounced change in the interest rate may be appropriate in cases where there is a risk that inflation may deviate considerably from the target over a longer period, or where heightening turbulence in financial markets or a cost- push shock resulting from wage negotiations indicates that confidence in monetary policy is in jeopardy. Financial market confidence in the inflation target provides Norges Bank with greater scope for promoting stability in output and employment through monetary policy. This scope will also increase as the inflation target is incorporated as an anchor for wage formation. We have also indicated that in the event of runaway overall credit growth and a sharp rise in property and house prices as well as equity prices, it may be necessary to reassess the time horizon. It would in general have been possible to achieve the inflation target at a horizon shorter than two years by changing the interest rate more rapidly and more markedly. This might, however, have a greater impact on output and employment. BIS Review 53/2003 1 
Norges Bank has based its monetary policy on flexible inflation targeting, where variability in output, employment and inflation are given weight. How do changes in the interest rate affect the economy? Norges Bank’s monetary policy instrument is the key rate. Norges Bank’s key rate affects short-term money market rates, and expectations concerning future developments in the key rate are decisive for banks’ deposit and lending rates and bond yields. It may be useful to distinguish between three channels through which monetary policy operates:  • The demand channel  • The exchange rate channel  • The expectations channel The effect on inflation of changes in interest rates occurs with a lag and may vary in intensity. In the time it takes for a change in interest rates to feed through, other factors will also have an impact resulting in changes in inflation and output. We cannot assume that the various relationships are entirely stable. As interest rates fall, household and municipal consumption and investment will tend to accelerate. This is because they have more money left over after servicing their debt and because borrowing is less expensive. Corporate finances are strengthened and investment may become more attractive. Higher demand leads to higher output and employment. Wage growth may pick up. Higher wage growth combined with higher profit margins will result in higher inflation. The effect of interest rate changes may be amplified because the interest rate also affects the krone exchange rate. When interest rates are lower, more people will borrow money and fewer will invest in NOK. Lower interest rates will thus normally lead to a depreciation of the krone. Imported goods will then become more expensive and inflation will accelerate. A weaker krone also boosts exports and improves profitability in Norwegian business and industry. The effect on the exchange rate of a change in interest rates will vary as themes and sentiments shift in the foreign exchange market. We believe that expectations play an important role when prices and wages are set. Expectations concerning future inflation and economic stability have considerable impact, not least in the foreign exchange market. Inflation expectations also influence wage demands and have an effect when companies adjust their prices. It may be difficult to form an opinion about how expectations are generated. Confidence in the inflation target may provide an anchor. Past inflation rates may also influence what we think inflation will be in the future. There is thus an interaction between inflation expectations and inflation. If there is confidence in monetary policy, expected inflation will be equal to or close to the inflation target. This contributes to stabilising inflation around the target. The expectations channel thus amplifies the effects of monetary policy. We therefore place considerable emphasis on ensuring that households, companies, the social partners and financial market participants are confident that inflation will remain low and stable. To the question of how high prices are expected to rise, companies, the social partners and others answer that they expect a rise of 2½ per cent over time. Financial market participants also expect future inflation to be 2½ per cent. This is reflected in developments in long-term bond yields. This indicates that monetary policy has underpinned confidence that future inflation will be 2½ per cent. Consumer price developments There were wide fluctuations in the Norwegian economy in the 1970s and 1980s. Economic developments were marked by high and variable inflation. The fixed exchange rate regime, which was introduced in 1986, reinstated monetary policy as an instrument of economic policy in Norway and laid the foundation for more stable economic developments later on. Inflation slowed gradually from the end of the 1980s and has been around 2½ per cent on average since then. The prolonged period of low and stable inflation has probably contributed to anchoring inflation expectations. 2 BIS Review 53/2003 
When the Government introduced flexible inflation targeting, it set a target for core inflation of 2½ per cent over time.1  Core inflation has slowed over the past 12 months and is now considerably below target. Stabilising developments in output and employment According to the mandate, one of the aims of monetary policy is to stabilise developments in output and employment. The economy grows over time. Output moves in waves. Actual output will be alternately above and below the long- term trend. The difference between trend output and actual output is called the output gap. Stabilising output means aiming to keep actual output close to trend level. We have had pronounced economic cycles in the Norwegian economy. The downturn at the beginning of the 1990s was followed by an upturn from 1993. This upturn peaked in 1998. The economy then shifted from an upturn with high growth rates to an expansion with lower growth but low unemployment, labour shortages in many sectors and strong growth in labour costs. In recent years, capacity utilisation has declined from a high level and is now on a par with the level prevailing in the years 1995-1997, before the rise in costs accelerated. Consumer price inflation in 2003 and the background for the deviation from the target In the years 1998-2002, the Norwegian economy was characterised by substantial labour shortages and a considerably higher rise in labour costs than among trading partners. Last year was the fifth consecutive year of very high annual growth. Wage growth was substantially higher than the level that over time is consistent with the inflation target and with normal productivity growth. Pay increases varied widely across the different groups. In Norges Bank’s view, there was therefore a substantial risk of new wage-wage spirals. Further rounds of such strong wage increases might have led to a decline in output and employment. Monetary policy was therefore tightened through an interest rate increase last summer while the krone remained strong. At the one-year horizon, the strong krone would push down inflation to below 2½ per cent, but subsequently the effects of strong wage growth would dominate. Last year, Norges Bank’s Executive Board struck a balance between the consideration of stable inflation developments in the short term and the consideration of stabilising developments in output and employment. Inflation was thus expected and intended to be low in 2003. In the October 2002 Inflation Report, inflation was projected to fall to 1¾ per cent in summer 2003. However, price developments are uncertain even six months to a year ahead. There was thus a possibility that inflation could fall even lower than projected, and be more than one percentage point below target. As from May 2003, core inflation (measured by the CPI-ATE) has been more than one percentage point below target. Average core inflation in 2003 is now projected at 1¼ per cent. The difference between the outcome and the projection thus proved nevertheless to be unusually wide, largely reflecting the fact that the economy was exposed to sizeable, unexpected disturbances. Inflation through 2003 has been pushed down in particular by the fall in prices for imported consumer goods. The low rise in imported price inflation is a consequence of the appreciation of the krone throughout 2002 and low inflation abroad. The rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services has also slowed somewhat. This is particularly the case for prices for domestically produced goods influenced by world market prices. Weaker than expected economic developments in 2003 The krone appreciated more in autumn 2002 and at the end of the year than assumed in our projections. This was related to unexpectedly weak developments in the global economy resulting in lower interest rates abroad and a wider interest rate differential between Norway and other countries.                                                       1  A measure of core inflation is the rise in consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE). BIS Review 53/2003 3 
Negative events such as the accounting scandals in large US companies, fears of terror, war in Iraq and the spread of SARS contributed to weak growth and low inflation in other countries. Developments in the international equity markets and the risk of higher oil prices also contributed to strengthening the krone. Changes in the economic outlook abroad are clearly reflected in developments in interest rate expectations. Interest rate expectations in the US have been adjusted downwards considerably since summer 2002. The same applies to Europe. Developments in interest rate expectations were a reflection of an ailing world economy. The situation has changed somewhat since the summer. A slightly more rapid rise in interest rates abroad is now expected. Fluctuations in the exchange rate and monetary policy easing Interest rate developments abroad have had substantial influence on the effect of interest rate setting in Norway. About 40 per cent of the appreciation of the krone from May 2000 to January 2003 can be explained by the increase in the interest rate differential between Norway and other countries. When the equity bubble burst in 2000, capital was moved from equities to interest-bearing securities, affecting capital flows and exchange rate movements. This shift in themes can explain 55 per cent of the appreciation of the krone. A third reason may have been high oil prices and fears that war and terror would disrupt the oil supply.2  While growth in the Norwegian economy stalled last winter, wage growth has moderated more rapidly than expected. This has had a considerable influence on the inflation outlook. The interest rate has been reduced by 4.5 percentage points, and the krone has appreciated by about 10 per cent. The interest rate reductions this year will make a significant contribution to bringing inflation back to target. In the short term, the effects will primarily be channelled through a weaker krone. In the somewhat longer term, the fall in interest rates will also lead to higher inflation than would otherwise have been the case through stronger demand in Norway. Inflation back on target at the two-year horizon We now expect inflation to move up and stabilise around the inflation target at the two-year horizon. Output and employment are picking up. In our projections, capacity utilisation is stable with an output gap, as calculated by Norges Bank, close to zero.3  Uncertainty associated with inflation projections Projections are uncertain. Experience of uncertainty surrounding inflation forecasts would indicate that when monetary policy is oriented towards reaching the target of 2½ per cent, inflation will remain within the interval of +/- 1 percentage point around the target in four out of five years. This is consistent with the experience of other countries with an inflation targeting regime. It should be noted, however, that this level of accuracy is based on a period of stable inflation in the OECD countries. The interest rate reductions and the fall in the krone exchange rate imply that inflation will gradually increase and will be considerably higher than the current level as early as next spring. After such a period of very low inflation as we have now witnessed, it is appropriate to be particularly vigilant in monetary policy in the event that inflation does not increase as projected.                                                       2  These estimates are uncertain and must therefore be interpreted with caution. The analysis of developments in the exchange rate from May 2000 to January 2003 is discussed in more detail in Bjørn Naug (2003): “Faktorer bak utviklingen i kronekursen – en empirisk analyse” (Factors underlying developments in the krone exchange rate – an empirical analysis), in Norges Bank’s Occasional Papers, no. 31 (Norwegian only). 3  These projections are discussed in more detail in Norges Bank’s Inflation Report 3/2003. The analyses are based on the technical assumption that the interest rate will move in line with expectations in financial and foreign exchange markets, implying that the interest rate will remain at the current level well into 2004. Thereafter, the interest rate in Norway is assumed to rise gradually in pace with interest rates in other countries. The forward exchange rate implies a moderate depreciation of the krone through the projection period. 4 BIS Review 53/2003 
Share of employment back at trend As mentioned earlier, developments in the output gap are a measure of output stability. Fluctuations in output are also reflected in changes in the share of the working age population that are employed. This share of employment has shown a rising trend since the early 1970s, and has been above trend since 1996. This year, it appears that the share of employment will be at about trend level. The exchange rate fluctuates Fluctuations in the krone exchange rate have become more pronounced since 1996 and are now more on a par with fluctuations in the currencies of other small economies with a floating exchange rate. The krone has fluctuated between 9.24 and 7.22 kroner to the euro/ecu since 1997. Norges Bank has not set a specific target for the level of the exchange rate. However, changes in the krone exchange rate are, of course, important in interest rate setting because they affect inflation and developments in activity. The response to a change in the exchange rate will depend on its expected impact on inflation, output and employment. This requires an evaluation of the reasons for and the duration of the change. Very short-term fluctuations in the krone exchange rate tend to have very limited effects on economic developments, while more long-lasting changes can have an impact. However, it is difficult to determine whether exchange rate changes are permanent or temporary. Long-term relationship between exchange rate and prices In the 1980s, the rise in prices in Norway was considerably higher than among trading partners. Measured in a common currency, prices are high, but they have over time remained fairly stable in relation to trading partners. The ratio of Norwegian to foreign prices today, converted to the same currency, is not substantially different from the average over the past 30 years. There is evidence to suggest that the exchange rate will contribute to cushioning changes in the price ratio.4 When inflation in Norway has been higher than among trading partners for a period, the krone has tended to depreciate. When there are expectations that inflation in Norway will develop approximately in line with other countries, the exchange rate will also normally return to its normal range in periods when the krone has been particularly strong or particularly weak. This relationship is the reason why stability in the exchange rate and in exchange rate expectations over time is dependent on stable inflation expectations, which in turn depend on low and stable inflation. Evidence indicates that an inflation target provides a sound anchor for exchange rate expectations. However, these expectations will also depend on fundamental conditions such as developments in government expenditure and revenues, productivity growth, oil prices and the terms of trade, excluding oil. Deterioration in competitiveness following several years of high wage growth High wage growth over several years has eroded the competitiveness of the Norwegian business sector. Last year, the effects of high wage growth were amplified by the changes in the krone exchange rate. Although the nominal krone exchange rate has depreciated this year, the competitiveness of Norwegian industries is still rather weak. The krone has now reverted to around the level prevailing in the mid-1990s, while labour costs in manufacturing rose by 13 per cent5 more than among our trading partners in the same period. The developments in the krone exchange rate proved to be reversible, but the loss of competitiveness and jobs caused by relatively high wage growth in Norway is difficult to recoup. A precondition for a considerable improvement in competitiveness is probably that real wage growth is lower than productivity growth in the business sector for a period. Experience shows that this occurs in periods when there is excess capacity in the economy. This means that changes in competitiveness over time                                                       4  Q.

However, with flexible inflation targeting, the social partners can normally expect low wage growth to have a greater impact on competitiveness because it can result in a weaker krone. In Norges Bank’s assessment, the outlook for the internationally exposed sector is brighter today than a year ago because the rise in costs has slowed markedly. As mentioned earlier, the decrease in wage growth has been of great importance in enabling us to reduce the key rate towards an international level. We expect inflation to pick up in the first half of 2004. Output and employment will probably grow somewhat more than trend. Again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to deliver this statement. 
Lars Heikensten: The Riksbank’s work on financial stability Speech by Mr Lars Heikensten, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Göteborgs University, Göteborg, 25 November 2003. *      *      * First a word of thanks for the invitation to address you today. I feel privileged to be speaking at a Felix Neubergh lecture.  In autumn 1992 a decision at very short notice was required of Sweden’s government and parliament: should they choose to support Swedish banks without really knowing how large the support might have to be, or risk a financial crisis with unforeseeable consequences for the Swedish economy? All the Swedish banks had incurred large loan losses. And regardless of how much a particular bank had lost, the international credit market had little confidence in the Swedish banking system. The banks faced severe financing problems that might ultimately have led to their failure and could have made it difficult in the shorter run for Swedish companies to cover their funding requirements. The decision was the only reasonable alternative - to rescue the Swedish banks. The government issued a general guarantee for the banks’ liabilities and set up an authority, Bankstödsnämnden, specifically to cope with the banks that were in serious difficulties. The government, explicitly supported by the opposition, acted just as vigorously and promptly as the situation required. But this did entail making a decision - on the basis of insufficient information about the causes and depth of the crisis - that could have burdened the government budget with at least a hundred billion kronor. That is an experience we do not wish to repeat. Sweden recovered from the crisis on that occasion and in many instances our way of resolving it has served as a model for other countries. The crisis also focused attention on the work for financial stability. With the growing complexity of payment systems and the financial sector’s expansion, financial stability has become an increasingly important issue for the Riksbank, as it has for other central banks around the world.  A review The bank crisis spawned a certain amount of self-criticism, not least in the Riksbank. In practice, the Bank had not backed up its function of promoting a safe and efficient payment system with any systematic analytical work. The problems that arose had taken the Riksbank, along with many others, by surprise. So we started to build up knowledge and an analytical capability in the field of stability. The work was initiated on a modest scale with just a handful of staff. It had a narrow focus on the early detection of weaknesses in the banking system that might lead to another bank crisis.  The Riksbank also decided to publish a report that would discuss the situation for bank sector stability. Internal reports had been produced earlier. In autumn 1997 the Riksbank accordingly presented its first more cohesive public analysis of financial stability. The new report was intended to signal the importance the Riksbank attached to work on stability and it also helped to focus and develop the internal efforts. The experience of work on the Inflation Report had been encouraging, so it seemed natural to build up the work on and communication about issues to do with stability in the same way. By launching the Financial Stability Report or, as it was called initially, the Financial Market Report, the Riksbank was the first central bank to issue a public account of its appraisal of financial system stability. Its example has been followed to date by about thirty other countries. Recurrent financial crises have made it clear that there will always be problems which the authorities are obliged to address in some way and it may therefore be of some assistance to have a clear, structured presentation of the approach to financial stability. This has led the International Monetary Fund, for example, to pay growing attention to these issues. Since 1999 the IMF and the World Bank are engaged in joint evaluations of national financial systems in what is called a Financial Sector Assessment Program. Matters to do with stability are also on the agenda almost every time I meet my colleagues from other countries. BIS Review 53/2003 1 
Principles for financial system oversight First I should perhaps reiterate what we mean by the financial system. It is the system that provides payment services, converts savings into financial resources for investment and consumption, and contributes facilities for managing risk. In other words, the financial system performs a number of important social functions. If any of these functions were to be disrupted, the social costs could be very high.  The damage inflicted by a disruption would probably be particularly great if it involved a vital component of the payment system. This is readily understood when one considers the enormous flow of payments. In Sweden, for instance, the payment system has a daily turnover of around SEK 500 billion, which means that the equivalent of our annual gross domestic product has to be handled in less than a week. Studies show, moreover, that in the past fifteen years there have been more than a dozen crises which cost the countries concerned at least 10 per cent of their GDP.  So there are good reasons for state supervision of the financial system. The Riksbank has a function here in that the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament) has made us accountable for promoting a safe and efficient payment system. A major ground for making us responsible for efficiency and stability is that, along with the banks, the Riksbank is a central player in the payment system and provides means of payments. The banks distribute notes and coins, keep transaction accounts linked to giro systems and operate credit card systems. The Riksbank in turn provides accounts in the payment system, RIX, that is available for large-value interbank payments.  The work on financial stability is undertaken in three main ways. One concerns the rules and regulations that set the bounds for the operations of financial companies. Another is the continuous surveillance of the system that is performed by Finansinspektionen (Sweden’s Financial Supervisory Authority) as well as by the Riksbank. Thirdly, the state needs to be able to manage any crises that nevertheless occur. The work on stability calls for highly developed cooperation between the Finance Ministry, Finansinspektionen and the Riksbank. The laws governing financial operations are enacted by the Riksdag, with the finance ministry as an important agent. More detailed regulations are issued by Finansinspektionen, which also monitors their observance. The Riksbank’s contribution to the work on rules and regulations consists in the first place of submitting opinions; in addition, the Bank participates in international efforts to develop the regulatory framework.  The role of the Riksbank in surveillance work is central and focuses on the functioning of the financial system as a whole and the risks that may arise. The identification of risks in the system as a whole means, moreover, that the individual institutions and the financial infrastructure have to be scrutinised.  It is primarily Finansinspektionen but to some extent also the Riksbank that need to keep a continuous eye on the individual banks. Due to the central functions of the banks, a crisis in the banking system might swiftly have serious consequences for the payment system as well as for the supply of credit.  But it is not just the significance of the banks in the payment system and as a source of credit that warrants their supervision. As The Economist wrote last spring, banks are “the most hazardous economic institutions known to man”. That may sound rather drastic but there is some truth to it. It is not that bankers are a tribe of irresponsible gamblers but that their much-needed function in the economy requires them to act in certain ways. Banking is essentially a matter of taking risks. A bank’s funds (its deposits or its loans from other banks) are liable to disappear at short notice, while realising assets takes longer.  Moreover, problems in one bank are liable to spread to other banks. This systemic risk exists because the banks have liabilities with each other in the form of loans or securities transactions and because they participate in the payment system. The similarity of their operations also means that problems elsewhere may hit the banks as a group. Contagious effects may occur, moreover, simply because people suspect that the banks are inter-connected.  To a growing extent, oversight of system stability calls for oversight of the financial infrastructure in the sense of the systems that are needed to effect payments and to trade in and deliver financial products. Bankgirocentralen is a case in point. If these systems function properly, there will be less risk of problems either spreading between the participants and from the financial markets, or arising because the system as such is disrupted.  The third aspect of surveillance work - crisis management - has to do with the possibility that the state needs to act to prevent a crisis from jeopardising system stability. In order to manage a crisis, the state 2 BIS Review 53/2003 
must be able to judge what the consequences will be if a distressed institution were to fail and, if these consequences are likely to be serious, what measures can be taken to mitigate them. The solution in some cases may be to contribute to an orderly closure, while in others it may be to provide financial support. An example of the latter is the general bank guarantee the state provided during Sweden’s bank crisis. In certain cases it may be up to the Riksbank to provide assistance with liquidity. If a bank’s problems were to be so serious that stability is threatened - and the bank is considered to be viable in the longer run - the Riksbank can grant credit on special terms and act as what is usually known as the lender of last resort.  The continuous surveillance and crisis management are closely connected with each other. Oversight is essential for the Riksbank’s ability to judge whether or not a crisis constitutes a threat to financial stability. Without a continuous analysis of the banks, it would be difficult to determine whether and how any support should be provided in a crisis.  The work on oversight and crisis management The Riksbank presents its analysis of system stability every six months in the Financial Stability Report. The Report basically aims to provide a picture of the Swedish banks’ ability to stand up to any disruptions. The purpose is to identify conceivable risks and present a sound analysis that influences the market’s participants. The task of the Riksbank can perhaps be described as to keep cool and restrain undue optimism when there seem to be no problems in an upward phase, and to fill in the picture, if necessary, in a downward phase to allay concern about serious loan losses.  The analysis concentrates on the four major Swedish banks because their size makes it likely that they are relevant for system stability. The failure of one of these banks might jeopardise stability, though this is by no means certain. The durability of the banks is dependent on a number of factors. The Riksbank analyses the main categories of borrower, developments in the bank groups and the financial infrastructure.  Borrowers are analysed in terms of the corporate and household sectors in general, with particular reference to levels of debt and the future ability to pay. The real-estate sector is considered separately because the companies here account for as much as one-third of the banks’ corporate lending. The prices of commercial properties and private housing are also analysed because they reflect the value of the collateral that is pledged for loans from banks and mortgage institutions. In that Swedish banks are expanding their operations in the other Nordic countries and the Baltic region, developments in those countries are becoming increasingly important for them. Borrowers abroad now account for approximately half of the banks’ total loan stock. The analysis of borrowers has therefore been extended abroad. The major bank groups are analysed in various respects. Profitability trends illustrate the ability of the banks to build up reserves for unexpected losses. Moreover, there is always the strategic risk that a bank with weak profitability will be tempted to try out new, bold lines of business in order to generate a higher return on equity.  The analysis of the banks’ credit portfolios can provide an indication of how loan losses are likely to develop in the coming year or two. Another aspect of the analysis is the banks’ liabilities. Traditional banking involves accepting deposits and using the funds for making loans. People’s growing propensity to save in other instruments than bank accounts has forced the banks to finance the growth of credit by borrowing in the capital market. The structure of bank funding provides an indication of the risks in bank liquidity. Monitoring this is perhaps the most difficult part in that the liquidity situation is liable to change very rapidly. If problems in one bank group spread to other players in the system via the banks’ mutual commitments, the payment system may be affected immediately. The Riksbank therefore keeps an eye on interbank exposures. Oversight of the infrastructure concentrates on the systems that are vital for the functioning of the financial market in Sweden. Besides RIX, the system for large-value payments provided by the Riksbank, these are primarily the central securities register (VPC), the Stockholm Stock Exchange and the clearing system for retail payments (Bakgirocentralen or BGC).  BIS Review 53/2003 3 
The Riksbank has also chosen to work on practical matters to do with risk management. These issues are invariably complex. Financial crises can arise at very short notice, not least on account of the massive payment flows and because banks tend to have a large element of short-term funding. The ongoing integration may have made things even more difficult.  The Riksbank has therefore built up an internal crisis organisation and clearly documented who does what in the event of a crisis, including those who are to be contacted and put in the picture, how the press is to be informed, and the legal consequences of various measures. Another important element in the work on readiness is regular crisis exercises.  Crisis management has also come to feature prominently in Sweden’s international profile. This has to do with our experiences as well as our basic stand on the importance of transparency. The Riksbank is leading Nordic and European working groups in this field. One of the articles in the latest Financial Stability Report that was published yesterday deals with the role of the Riksbank as lender of last resort. It discusses the principles that determine the situations in which the Riksbank can consider providing support for distressed banks and the terms for the support. Many other countries are reluctant to talk about these matters openly for fear that banks will be tempted to take greater risks. The Riksbank, on the other hand, sees openness as a means of deterring greater risk-taking. Clear game rules mean that the banks know more about what to expect.  Future stability work Much has been done with the Riksbank’s work on stability in the past seven years but it is not hard to pick out fields where there is room for improvement. The analysis of borrowers abroad will be enhanced. The Riksbank needs to acquire a better understanding of how the banks manage their liquidity, select sources of funding and the effects of this on their durability. The analysis of stability also needs to be supplemented with methods for stress tests, that is, ways of analysing the sensitivity of bank durability. To obtain further inspiration for the work of improving the analysis, the Riksbank has commissioned an external evaluation of the work on financial stability. This evaluation is in the hands of a trio representing the international research frontier, the central bank world and the Swedish bank sector. They will be bringing their individual perspectives to bear in a joint effort to evaluate the quality and focus of the work we have built up. We intend to publish their report and then issue invitations to a broad discussion on our work’s future direction.  In conclusion I would like to say something - without prejudicing the trio’s findings - about the issues that I believe will have growing importance in the future. A natural starting-point for such a discussion is to identify forces that will be driving future financial developments. Three of the main forces are: – growing cross-border integration in Europe, – more advanced risk management by the banks, and – more and more of a focus on aspects of efficiency. Consequences of European integration It is perhaps the increased international dependence that affects us most clearly. While the banking systems in Europe are still largely national, integrated systems have started to appear in certain regions. This trend seems to have come furthest in the Nordic-Baltic region but there are grounds for expecting greater integration elsewhere, too. As a result, national banking systems will become increasingly interdependent. This has a number of dimensions for the Riksbank’s work on stability. One component of our work consists in promoting integration by influencing the construction of rule systems. We do so out of a conviction that integration as such favours economic growth.  The current rule systems were not designed for an integrated European bank market that transcends national borders. Moreover, the common legislation takes integration into account to only a limited extent. In order to achieve an inner market for financial services, the EU is striving to produce as uniform a set of rules as possible for financial companies throughout the Union. Banks can then compete on equal terms and give rise to a common market with the most competitive enterprises.  4 BIS Review 53/2003 
The Riksbank supports this admirable ambition. But it is also important to avoid conceivable pitfalls that may hamper this development. One danger is that the rule system becomes excessively detailed, that harmonisation starts from the strictest existing system instead of proceeding from an entirely open discussion.  Integration also affects the regular supervision and oversight. The current principle is home-country supervision. In other words, a bank’s legal country of domicile is responsible for the supervision of the bank’s branch offices; a banking subsidiary, on the other hand, is supervised by the country in which the subsidiary is legally domiciled. But it is still the legal country of domicile of the parent bank that is responsible for supervision of the bank group as a whole.  This solution ought to work as long as the foreign operations of the banks are fairly modest. But what will happen when the banks’ foreign branches become systemically important? How much responsibility are the home countries willing to take for financial stability in the countries where foreign branches are located? And are the authorities in the latter countries prepared to relinquish the responsibility for an essential part of their financial system to the home country of the parent bank? These are not just abstract issues, as can be seen from the fact that Nordea, domiciled in Sweden, is now the largest bank in Finland and that Swedish banks own the major part of the banking systems in the Baltic states. Thus, it seems that the supervision of international bank groups could lead to problems of coordination and duplication. On the whole, there appears to be no lack of incentives to supervise cross-border banking operations. The problem is rather that in certain cases the rule system prevents the most active countries for exercising supervision, so that this is liable to fall between two stools. On the other hand, an excessively generous right to supervise can lead to the burden of supervision being unduly heavy for individual banks. That could hamper integration as well as efficiency. Formalising crisis management is more difficult than other parts of the work on stability. Discussing crisis management can be perceived as sensitive and troublesome because to some extent it concerns the state’s willingness to assist the financial sector with liquidity. The dividing line between whether or not this should be discussed openly often runs between countries that have experienced a financial crisis and those that have not. Those which have lived through a crisis are generally in favour of a transparent process. A clear-cut arrangement for the management of crises can be difficult to construct in advance.  It is hard to tell at present how these problems should be resolved. In principle there are two conceivable approaches. One involves continued cooperation on agreements, joint principles and regulatory frameworks. The other is to have more supranational management. It is probably a combination of the two that will be needed. The important thing today, however, is that a debate on these complex issues gets under way before we find ourselves in a situation where it is necessary instead to deal with them in an emergency. More advanced risk management Another factor that will probably affect future work on the supervision and oversight of stability is the banks’ increased possibilities of managing risks. The assessment of risks is one of banking’s traditional functions. Things have changed markedly in this respect since the mid 1990s. Technical progress and new financial theories have led to a refinement of the methods for and possibilities of measuring credit risks. This has been accompanied by facilities for trading risks with additional financial instruments in increasingly international markets. All this has enhanced the ability of the banks to manage risks. Banks in general - not just the largest international groups - have invested in new systems for risk management. The trend, which began earlier, has been accelerated by the new capital adequacy rules, Basel II, that have just been produced.  All the major banks in Sweden are working actively on these issues, partly because they are expected to result in a smaller capital requirement. For the Riksbank, it is of course not a decreased capital requirement as such that is relevant so much as the fact that the new rules make better allowance for the actual risk in different credits. Finansinspektionen has a central role here in ensuring that financial companies honour not just the letter but the spirit of the Basel rules. This in turn should lead to a more adequate pricing of risk and thereby a more efficient financial system. BIS Review 53/2003 5 
A problem that is being discussed in connection with recent methods for risk management and Basel II is the possibility of this development accentuating cyclical fluctuations in the economy. In that the basic idea behind Basel II is for the size of a bank’s capital to be dictated by the credit risk in its lending, it is possible that bank capital requirements and thereby the cost of credit will co-vary with the business cycle. The increased credit risk associated with an economic slowdown means that the banks need more capital. This, it is feared, might lead to a contraction of credit in downturns and an expansion in upward phases and thereby make cyclical fluctuations more pronounced.  There are some grounds for this criticism. Experience of business cycles has taught us that the large credit risks tend to be taken as the business cycle approaches a peak. However, the solution to such problems does not lie in opposing the new risk management techniques or Basel II. They will help to promote financial stability. But there is a need for the banks to find ways of handling any effects that arise from an accentuation of cyclical fluctuations. It is important for economic development that credit and venture capital are available even when business activity is cyclically low - and perhaps somewhat less so when activity is peaking.  Besides influencing how the banks handle their capital, the more advanced methods for risk management have led to the creation of new financial instruments. Two examples are securitisation and credit derivatives. This enables the banks to divest themselves of the credit risk in their loans by hedging in the credit derivatives market or by simply selling the risk through securitisation of the loans. The credit risks in the economy can then be spread over more agents. That is fundamentally favourable for financial stability and market efficiency. At the same time, the authorities must follow developments closely in order to understand where these credit risks end up. Their departure from the bank sector does not mean that they disappear from the economy; they turn up instead in a different form somewhere else, for instance in insurance companies or mutual funds. Do the new risk management facilities also mean that banking operations will take a different direction? Will banks try to slim their large illiquid balance sheets by selling off loans or securitising assets? And will that mean that they can no longer be described as the most hazardous economic institutions known to man?  This development has come further in the United States, where market financing is considerably more important than in Sweden or the rest of Europe. So what would a similar trend, where the current predominantly relation-based lending is replaced by market funding, imply for the cyclical supply of credit in Sweden? Stronger focus on aspects of efficiency A third driving-force that most clearly affects the financial system is the stronger focus on aspects of efficiency. Permit me to touch on this briefly. Improvements to the financial infrastructure in recent years have made this safer and more robust in various ways. For example, the settlement routines used by both BGC and VPC are considerably more secure that before. Every component of the infrastructure now has better solutions for continuity, which means that operations can be ensured even in connection with more extreme events.  Now that the most serious shortcomings have been rectified, the focus has shifted to enhancing efficiency in the given framework for safety. Considerable social gains are to be had by making the infrastructure more efficient. This applies to the central settlement systems and perhaps even more to the different payment instruments. Increased automation and a greater use of electronic payments instead of paper-based instruments and cash can generate large savings for society in general. Although they may amount to just a single krona or even less per transaction, the savings add up to a large amount because of all the payments that are required in a modern economy. Economies and greater efficiency have featured prominently in the banks’ activities in recent years. For the authorities it is always important to consider the conditions for competition and balance them against the forces for efficiency, such as economies of scale. It is also important to monitor developments to ensure that levels of risk do not rise again. Moreover, the Riksbank has been and is a major player in the payment system. We must also scrutinise this activity continuously to ensure that our approach does not impair economic efficiency in general. 6 BIS Review 53/2003 
BIS Review 53/2003 7 From what I have said about the future work it is hopefully clear that the financial markets are changing rapidly and present a development that is exciting in many ways. The Riksbank will continue to be a central player in this work. Talking about such issues feels natural at a university. Perhaps I have even succeeded in inspiring some of you to become involved in questions such as these and contribute to future developments. Thank you. 
Mark W Olson: Functional regulation and financial modernization Remarks by Mr Mark W Olson, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the annual meeting of the National Conference of Insurance Legislators, Santa Fe, New Mexico, 22 November 2003. *      *      * Introduction My thanks to the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL) for inviting me to speak to you today, and special thanks to my former senator, Cal Larson, for being my host. You’ve asked me to provide some thoughts on financial modernization and functional regulation, and to discuss more specifically how these issues may, from the perspective of the Federal Reserve Board, relate to insurance. I’d like to discuss first the importance of cooperation between the Federal Reserve System and state insurance supervisors. Then I’ll describe some of the lessons we at the Fed have learned as participants in the dual banking system. I hope that hearing about our experiences will be useful as you consider initiatives to enhance the state insurance supervisory system. My comments today are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of my fellow Board or Federal Open Market Committee members. Cooperation between the Federal Reserve and the state insurance supervisors The McCarran-Ferguson Act has long kept supervision of insurance within the exclusive domain of the states. For most of the past century, we - that is, the Federal Reserve and state insurance professionals - have traveled in completely different circles for practical reasons as well. The Federal Reserve has had very little to do with insurance issues because the banks and bank holding companies for which we are responsible have had little involvement in insurance. In fact, the federal legislation that charges the Federal Reserve with supervising bank holding companies - the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 - was enacted in large part to prevent the affiliation of one of the largest banks in this country with a large insurance underwriter. Congress went on to strengthen the separation of banking and insurance in 1982 with an amendment to that act generally prohibiting bank holding companies from engaging in insurance agency activities. At that point the insurance underwriting and sales activities of banking organizations were constrained to four limited categories: Banking organizations were permitted to underwrite and sell credit-related insurance; some state-chartered banks could engage in insurance sales under state law that either granted explicit permission or contained implicit authority for these activities; national banks could engage in insurance sales from small towns; and a limited number of bank holding companies were grandfathered and thus were allowed to continue insurance activities that they had started prior to enactment of the 1982 amendment. The historic statutory separation of banking and insurance was altered in 1999 when the Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act) and allowed well-managed and well-capitalized banks to affiliate with insurance underwriters and insurance agencies. That brings the Federal Reserve and state insurance professionals into the same circle. To date, about 630 bank holding companies have chosen to become financial holding companies, the vehicle under the GLB Act through which bank, insurance, and securities affiliations may take place. Of those, about 165 (more than 25 percent) use the new GLB Act authority to engage in insurance agency activities while only 26 (fewer than 5 percent) are engaged in underwriting insurance that is unrelated to credit. All of these companies must comply with state laws governing the sales and underwriting of insurance. The significant interest by banking organizations in selling insurance makes sense. The banking system is still dominated, in number, by small banking organizations. More than 90 percent of the banks in this country have total assets of less than $500 million each. Banks of all sizes have quite large branch networks - as of the end of last year there were almost 67,500 branches of the more than 7,800 commercial banks in this country. Entering the insurance market as an agent, not as an underwriter, fits naturally with the nature of banking as an industry dominated by smaller providers. BIS Review 52/2003 1 
More broadly, banking organizations have developed good networks and systems for delivering financial products to consumers - a business model that does not always require manufacture of the product. Insurance is increasingly viewed not just as a product that stands on its own, but as an important item on a menu of financial vehicles that help consumers create a portfolio of financial assets, manage their financial risks, and plan for their financial security. Many consumers prefer to make their financial decisions and purchase financial planning products at a single location that offers a full package of financial services. Thus, banking organizations are a natural alternative delivery system for insurance underwriters looking to expand their customer base. The affiliation of banks and insurance underwriters has been more modest. One large banking organization has affiliated with a large insurance underwriter, and one large insurance underwriter has acquired a small bank. In addition, several foreign banks with insurance operations abroad have begun to offer both insurance and banking products in the United States. Before the GLB Act, these foreign banking organizations were required to choose between operating as a bank in the United States or engaging in insurance activities in the United States; they generally could not do both. Whether the affiliation of insurance underwriters and banking organizations will become more common is unclear. Insurance underwriting involves a much larger commitment of resources than insurance sales and, apart from underwriting credit insurance, seems so far to have little synergy with banking. Banks and insurance companies so far seem not to have determined whether it makes business sense to mesh the manufacturing and distribution of insurance with the manufacturing and distribution of more traditional banking products. The experimentation has begun in ways you would expect. For example, insurance companies have long thought that the trust and fiduciary powers of banks would offer them an opportunity to manage insurance payouts and other assets of large estates. And a few banking organizations are experimenting with manufacturing the insurance products they deliver. These trial runs need time to work themselves out. What is important is that federal law no longer prevents the marketplace from evolving and the industry from experimenting. The result can only be beneficial to consumers. With these developments have come new supervisory challenges. As I mentioned earlier, we at the Federal Reserve have little expertise in supervising insurance companies. While some types of risks are common to both banking organizations and insurance companies, the products, business practices, and historical framework of the insurance industry are unique and outside our experience. Similarly, the risks and operations of banks and bank holding companies, which are in our area of expertise, are quite different from those typically seen in the domain of insurance supervisors. The obvious supervisory approach suggested by these different risks and regulatory schemes is cooperative functional regulation that matches supervisory expertise with the risks encountered by the regulated entity. This cooperation and a functional regulatory scheme are required by the GLB Act. But they also make good supervisory and business sense. It is crucial that supervisors talk to each other in order to understand the risks posed by functionally regulated entities, one to the other. It is also important that supervisors not overburden organizations with duplicative and conflicting regulation that destroys the very cost savings and consumer benefits of affiliation. Consequently, we do not examine insurance underwriters or the insurance agency business of bank holding companies. Instead, we defer to the appropriate state insurance authorities. We also rely on reports and other information that insurance companies provide to state insurance authorities to understand the activities and financial strength of the insurance company, rather than imposing our own reporting requirements on insurance companies. Importantly, we have established very successful partnerships with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and with many state insurance supervisors to enhance our mutual understanding of our supervisory frameworks and to facilitate the sharing of supervisory information and consumer complaints. To date, we have information-sharing agreements with nearly all of the states and the District of Columbia. While not all of these agreements have been spurred by an important affiliation that requires information sharing, the process of establishing these agreements has introduced us to the appropriate authorities in these states and begun a relationship that will improve our supervisory cooperation and effectiveness if difficulties develop down the road. It is important to have open lines of communication among supervisors and a framework and relationship with the states that prepare us to respond to developments as needed. 2 BIS Review 52/2003 
We are also working with the NAIC and the state insurance supervisors to compare supervisory approaches for identifying and resolving troubled organizations. Banks and insurance companies must comply with very different minimum capital requirements - requirements that are tailored to their businesses. It is important that in circumstances in which affiliated banks and insurance companies are experiencing financial stress, the bank and insurance supervisors be able to work cooperatively to resolve that stress without taking steps that help one regulated institution at the expense of the other. We think that efforts to understand each other’s supervisory tools and processes for identifying and resolving troubled institutions will allow functional regulators to work more effectively and cooperatively to find an early and effective solution to troubled institutions. To improve our own understanding of the issues developing in the insurance industry, we have also established resource centers at the Board and at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to monitor developments in the insurance industry. We particularly value the fruitful relationships that we have had with organizations such as the NAIC, which has welcomed our input and worked to help educate us on important insurance issues, and with various state insurance supervisors, who have fostered cross-training opportunities for us. State regulation of multi-state entities When Senator Neil Breslin, chairman of NCOIL’s State-Federal Relations Committee, testified earlier this month before the House Financial Services Committee, he identified several initiatives that the states are taking to address issues involving modernization of state insurance regulation. NCOIL is to be commended for initiating these efforts. While there are many structural differences between the banking and insurance industries, I would like to share with you the experience of the banking supervisors in maintaining a viable state banking supervision option in an increasingly interstate banking environment. Until the early 1980s, banks were prohibited by a combination of federal and state law from establishing branches, or even bank affiliates, across state lines. In the mid-1980s, several states began to experiment with interstate compacts that allowed banks to affiliate with banks in other states. By 1994, there was consensus that interstate banking was important enough to both banks and consumers that Congress repealed the federal prohibition on interstate affiliations and established a framework for interstate branching. At the same time, Congress greatly limited the ability of states to restrict interstate entry by out-of-state banks. As a result, the banking industry has flourished and customers have benefited. Banks can now provide products and services seamlessly to customers nationally, including customers that have wide geographic operations and customers that move geographically. And customers have gained the convenience afforded by banks that have a wide footprint of branches. At the same time, interstate expansion has posed challenges for us as supervisors. Although the Federal Reserve is not limited geographically, we partner in our supervisory efforts with state authorities that are constrained by state lines. Interstate expansion in a supervisory framework tied to state boundaries means that state-chartered banks that operate on an interstate basis face the possibility of regulation by their chartering state as well as by each state in which the bank establishes a branch office, plus an overarching federal supervisor. In addition to the potential for conflict and burdensome duplication that having multiple supervisors presents, state banks operating on a multistate basis must compete with nationally chartered banks that are supervised on a national basis by a single regulator. To meet this challenge, we have worked with the state supervisors to develop a more uniform and seamless approach to supervision. Under the auspices of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the various state banking supervisors have developed a protocol for cooperation in examining and collecting information from multistate banks. This protocol deals with examinations of two types. Responsibility for safety and soundness examinations rests with the chartering or “home” state for the bank. However, the protocol recognizes that the states into which a bank has branched - the so-called host states - also have a legitimate interest in monitoring the safety and soundness of banks that operate within their borders. Thus, it allows host states to conduct safety and soundness examinations of out-of-state banks that branch into the state. It contemplates however that the host state will conduct safety and soundness examinations only in emergency situations or as part of the examination conducted by the home-state supervisor. The protocol relies on robust information BIS Review 52/2003 3 
sharing and coordination between state supervisors and the federal banking agencies to take the place of these examinations. Responsibility for compliance with applicable consumer protection laws is divided among state supervisors, with each state supervisor responsible for monitoring compliance with local law by local offices. Examination for compliance with federal consumer laws in some instances is left to the federal banking agencies and in others is shared with state bank supervisors. In addition to building on the strength of our system of state bank supervisors, we realized that supervising large interstate operations requires different and significantly more sophisticated techniques than we employ for our smaller local banks. For example, our bank examination practices for many years focused on the review of a sizable number of individual loan files at each bank. This is an amazingly intrusive and time-consuming process. And it became increasingly obvious that as institutions grew in size, the technique was not practical on a large scale. Over time, we have had to develop more-sophisticated sampling techniques as well as methods for identifying and focusing our examinations on areas of greatest risk to the banking organization. We continue to review the policies and efforts that each bank employs to identify the risks it faces, to set and implement standards to address those risks, and to monitor the effectiveness of its risk-management practices. This approach involves the examination of policies and procedures and the review of statistics on loan default experiences for entire portfolios rather than large numbers of individual transactions. We are in the process of developing a more-sophisticated approach to capital as well. The current “Basel” capital standard was developed in 1988 through negotiations conducted by bank supervisory authorities under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlement in Basel, Switzerland. Current efforts to replace this capital accord with a new version (called Basel II) take a decidedly more risk-focused approach to measuring risk. The proposed approach would build on techniques used by the largest banks worldwide and should produce results that are much more consistent than the existing standard with market perceptions of risk. It would separate risks into their component parts and should give supervisors important new tools for evaluating not only the level of risk, but also the performance and responsiveness of bank management. Although the proposed standard will be a challenge to implement and enforce, it will also provide important and necessary incentives to managers of our largest institutions to adopt more-sophisticated practices for measuring and managing risk. We have also developed more risk-focused techniques for reviewing compliance with applicable consumer and other laws. At the same time, we - like the state insurance commissioners - have established consumer complaint divisions in each of the federal banking agencies to monitor and investigate individual consumer complaints. To be sure, our system of risk-focused supervision of banking organizations relies heavily on cooperation among multiple state and Federal supervisors, and it is not perfect. But it is working, and we think working effectively. State-chartered banks remain competitive and strong, and the asset share of state-chartered banks has remained relatively constant. While the banking industry’s continued consolidation is widely recognized and the total number of U.S. commercial banks continues to decline, less evident is the consistent chartering of new banks - roughly one new charter for every three consolidations. Seventy-five percent of these newly chartered banks are state banks. The state charter is apparently no less attractive than before banks gained new powers to expand nationwide. Certainly, we could not have postponed interstate banking until we had devised the perfect system for supervising it. The marketplace was moving, and we had to adjust our role to take account of that. The system we have developed in the banking arena is an evolutionary one, and one we will continue to work to improve. I know that you have been working hard at similar efforts in the insurance industry. I understand that here in Sante Fe, you have a number of important efforts underway, including proposals involving model laws that would govern Market Conduct Surveillance and Property and Casualty Insurance regulation. The institutions we supervise face the same challenges: competition on a growing number of fronts from unregulated entities, and consumers who are more sophisticated about choosing financial products. Regulated institutions must be allowed to respond to changes in the marketplace or they will not survive. Less-regulated institutions will prevail and in the process diminish the very protections that the regulations sought to preserve. At the same time, of course, we cannot forget that we are required 4 BIS Review 52/2003 
BIS Review 52/2003 5 by law to supervise the entities under our jurisdictions, to protect the public, and to preserve the strength of the financial system. To conclude, I will offer one final thought on the important subject of financial regulation and legislation. While we as regulators and legislators have the responsibility for setting and maintaining standards of safety and soundness for the benefit of consumers, we cannot ignore the power of market forces to cause the continual development of consumer financial products. Improvements in technology and consumer techno-literacy have prompted dramatic changes in all financial industries. Yet with all the changes we have seen, we are likely still in the early stages of realizing the full benefit of technological innovation. Our efforts as regulators and legislators will continue to be relevant only when they are consistent with these changing market forces. 
Lars Nyberg: Some Swedish experiences with financial stability surveillance  Speech by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, at the Bank Indonesia, Jakarta, 10 December 2003. *      *      * Introduction First of all I want to express my thanks to the Bank of Indonesia for inviting me to this conference. Financial stability - or the lack of it - is a very topical subject in the light of events in the past decades. Furthermore, financial stability issues seem to be strikingly similar between countries, whether they are big or small. It makes good sense, therefore, to have different central banks talk about their experiences. And, as always, the best experience comes from mistakes made. With this in mind, I shall tell you a little of how we in Sweden look at stability surveillance today. First, some background. Systemic stability came under serious threat during the Swedish banking crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. As was later the case in Indonesia, the risk of severe financial instability led to government intervention. A decision at very short notice was required of Sweden’s government and parliament in the autumn of 1992: Should they choose to support Swedish banks financially without really knowing how expensive the support might have to be, or should they risk a financial crisis with unforeseeable consequences for the Swedish economy? The decision that was taken was the only reasonable option - to rescue the Swedish banks. The government issued a general guarantee for the banks’ liabilities and set up a special Bank Support Authority to cope with the banks that were in serious difficulties. The government, explicitly supported by the opposition, acted just as vigorously and promptly as the situation required. But this did entail making a decision - on the basis of insufficient information about the causes and depth of the crisis - that could have burdened the government budget with at least 10 billion US dollars. Having to take such important decisions at short notice and without adequate information about the financial system is an experience we do not wish to repeat. The Riksbank is accountable to the Swedish parliament with regard to keeping a stable price level - our inflation target - but also with regard to promoting financial stability and a safe and efficient payment system. After the crises there was room for some self-criticism in this respect. In practice, we had not supported our stability target with any systematic analytical work on overall stability. To address this, we started to build up knowledge and analytical capability in the field of stability. By publishing a Financial Stability Report in 1997, we were among the first central banks to issue a periodic public account of our appraisal of financial system stability. Its example has been followed to date by about thirty other countries, including Indonesia. Today, interest in financial stability is well established. The crises during the 1990s revealed serious flaws not only in macroeconomic management but also, just as importantly, in the structure, regulation and operation of the financial system. Most major financial crises in various countries around the world emanated from overriding economic or financial problems rather than bank-specific issues. If these overriding problems had been identified at an earlier stage, the crises might have been prevented or at least their effects might have been reduced. Financial stability work Banks are the focus of all work on financial stability. This is because banks are the institutions that ensure the functioning of the payment system. We know from experience that if individuals and companies are unable to make ordinary payments, or if the credit function of society is disrupted, this may have disastrous effects on the economy. Insurance companies, finance companies, security brokers and other firms may also be important in society, but they are not critical to the system in the same way as banks. But banks are not only critical for stability. Their balance sheets also contain a built-in source of instability. Banks’ funding is generally short term in nature and can quickly disappear, while their assets have long maturities and cannot be realised as quickly. Should depositors and financiers lose confidence in a bank, it could face an acute liquidity crisis. Moreover, problems in one bank can spread to other banks. Banks have liabilities to one another due to loans and securities trading, or BIS Review 58/2003 1 
because they participate in the payment system. Contagion effects can also arise if other economic players suspect that there are connections between the banks. Banks can then encounter difficulties, even if the original suspicions were completely unfounded. Given this, the work on financial stability may be undertaken along three main strands. The first concerns the rules and regulations that set the bounds for the operations of financial institutions, notably banks. The second is the continuous surveillance of the system that is performed by the supervisory authority as well as by the central bank. Thirdly, there is the management of crises, since, unfortunately, we must assume that crises may occur and we must be prepared to handle them. I will discuss these three strands in turn, concentrating on the last two. 1. Regulatory framework First, of course, financial stability rests on a legal structure, which establishes the bounds for the operations of financial institutions. The parliament is responsible for legislation on financial operations, while the supervisory authority issues more detailed instructions. In many countries, including Sweden, the experiences of the 1990s have paved the way for a thorough review of the legal structure of the financial sector. In this context, it is worth noting that laws and regulations today to a great extent are developed through international negotiations such as in the Basel Committee and, for us in Europe, the EU. The role of the central bank in this process is the comfortable one of a knowledgeable observer, posing relevant questions in working groups and committees and pointing out inadequacies in suggested solutions. There is much to say about this process, but I shall have to leave it for a different occasion. 2. Day-to-day oversight The second strand of financial stability work is the day-to-day oversight. This may be described as resting on three pillars: • the first pillar is the supervision of individual banks, • the second pillar is the surveillance of systemic stability, • and the third pillar is payment system oversight. The first pillar is clearly the responsibility of the supervisors, whether they are a separate FSA or, as in many countries, a department within a central bank. The supervisors collect data from the banks, analyse these data and make on-site inspections. Prudential supervision performed by a competent authority must be the basis for all day-to-day oversight. The second pillar is the joint responsibility of the FSA and central bank. The division of responsibility is really one of perspective. While the FSA bases its work on individual institutions, the central bank looks at the banking system as a whole and attempts to assess the risks that could arise in it both in the short and the long run. Of course, there is overlap in the tasks of the FSA and the central bank, but it is often fruitful to approach a problem from somewhat different angles. Details are important, but looking at details you sometimes miss the overall picture. This, at least, is one conclusion we drew in Sweden from the experiences of the 1990s. The third pillar of oversight is the supervision of the financial infrastructure. This is a relatively new task derived from the complicated technical and legal systems that handle all financial transactions today. The infrastructure is of particular importance to the central bank, since we would most probably have to provide emergency liquidity assistance if anything went wrong. The infrastructure is dominated by the systems for clearing and settlement of payments. In Sweden, like in many other countries, we manage the large-value payment system in-house at the central bank.  But the infrastructure also includes the stock exchange, the derivatives exchange, the central securities depositary (CSD) and connected trading systems. Well-designed systems reduce the risk of contagion from the financial markets or between institutions. They also reduce the risk of the infrastructure itself causing problems through, for instance, operational disturbances. 2 BIS Review 58/2003 
The Financial Stability Report In Sweden, the main tool for addressing the oversight of systemic stability is the report on Financial Stability. The Report, in Sweden as well as in other countries, basically aims to provide a picture of the banks’ ability to stand up to any disruptions. Factors which might influence banks simultaneously are in focus, for instance the emergence and bursting of financial bubbles, excessive debt leverage in a certain economic sector or structural changes leading to reduced revenues or increased risks. The purpose is to identify conceivable risks and present an analysis that will influence the behaviour of market participants. A first and very relevant question is whether a stability report really would help to prevent a crisis. Will the financial sector read and listen to what the central bank has to say? Will this kind of moral suasion be sufficient? Could we have written a report in the late 1980s that would have made the banks see what they did not see? We do not know. But at least as long as managements have a memory of the last crisis, they are likely to listen. And if the crisis develops slowly, there are certainly things to be done. I shall return to this question when I talk about crisis management. Let me now turn to the main elements of a stability report as I see them. First, we look at the banks’ borrowers, because as long as they are healthy the banks usually are as well. Borrowers are analysed in terms of the corporate and household sectors in general, with particular reference to levels of debt and the future ability to pay. The real-estate sector is considered separately because lending to this sector is in most countries a major part of banks’ total lending. The prices of commercial properties and private housing are also analysed not least because they reflect the value of the major part of the collateral that is pledged for loans from banks and mortgage institutions. Insofar as your banks conduct activities in foreign countries, stability surveillance also needs to encompass developments in these countries to ensure that negative developments will not destabilise your banks. Second, the major banking groups are analysed in various respects. Profitability trends illustrate the ability of the banks to build up reserves for future unexpected losses. Moreover, there is always the strategic risk that a bank with weak profitability will be tempted to try out new, bold but risky lines of business in order to generate a higher return on equity. Our analysis of the banks’ credit portfolios provides an indication of how loan losses are likely to develop in the coming year or two. Another aspect of the analysis relates to banks’ liabilities. Traditional banking involves accepting deposits and using the funds for making loans. People’s growing propensity to save in other instruments than bank accounts has forced the banks to finance a major part of the growth in credit by borrowing, mostly short-term funds, in the capital market. The structure of bank funding provides an indication of the risks in bank liquidity. Monitoring this is perhaps the most difficult part since the liquidity situation is liable to change very rapidly. 3. Crisis prevention Turning to my last financial stability issue, that of crisis management, in my view this is mainly a question of being prepared. Or as prepared as possible, I should say, because how can you adequately prepare for the unknown? There are basically two types of crisis: a slow crisis and a fast crisis. By a fast crisis I mean single but severe events like fraud, major loan losses or general events that quickly lead to loss of market or creditor/depositor confidence. These cases call for quick action. Normally the central bank takes the lead because of its ability to provide emergency liquidity assistance and because of its access to updated information on the liquidity situation in the market. But close cooperation is required, especially with the supervisory authority, which has information on individual banks, and with the Ministry of Finance, if there is a need for solvency support. In my experience, there are many possibilities for such a process to fail. Misunderstood information, unclear leadership or conflicts of interest may delay the process until it is too late. The chances of solving a fast crisis increase enormously if all institutions involved have prepared for it, e.g. through crisis management drills. Such drills tend to uncover the shortcomings or conflicts that may prevent smooth cooperation when really needed. A slow crisis, on the other hand, may be detected but not always prevented by financial oversight. In a slowly developing crisis there is time to prepare action, which may even include new legislation, for instance on bank resolution. BIS Review 58/2003 3 
4 BIS Review 58/2003 To detect such a crisis may sound easy, but is in practice very difficult. For instance, when does a gradual increase in asset prices actually turn into an unsustainable bubble and no longer constitute a reflection of fundamental values? Look at the housing markets in some countries around the world right now. Are there bubbles and, if so, where are they?  Another problem is timing. At what point should the central bank sound the warning bell? By acting too early, we might add to the volatility in the market place and hence worsen the situation. Remember that the central bank will be held accountable for the negative repercussions of pricking the bubble, not only for the potential but less tangible benefits of having done so. By acting too late, on the other hand, we do not fulfil our mandate and a full-blown crisis might not be prevented. In addition to the problem of timing, there is the problem of selecting an appropriate response to the threat. The first line of defence is moral suasion, i.e. trying to convince the banks and other market participants to act in a proper fashion. The problem with moral suasion is that it may be difficult to calm a market that is rushing to new heights. Still, by publishing financial stability reports and issuing warnings to relevant parties, it should be possible to influence the public discussion. The second line of defence is prudential regulation. Discussions could be held with the supervisory authority and the Ministry of Finance on solutions, such as stricter formal regulations, calls for improved risk management systems or other conditions in order to strengthen banks. A good example is the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which, in a situation of unrealistic property prices, used its power to gradually lower the loan-to-value ratio of property collateral in order to limit bank lending. A third line of defence of course is the use of monetary policy, which in practice probably means raising interest rates to prick a bubble. This, in my view, should clearly be an option. But there are also some strong arguments against a central bank trying to respond to asset prices and credit expansion by changing its monetary policy stance. And there are certainly situations when it is unlikely to work. I shall have to leave this issue for now, however, or you will have to listen to me for another hour. Conclusion Let me conclude by saying that much has been done in the work on financial stability in the past years. Still, it is not hard to identify areas with room for improvement. The analysis of borrowers and other counterparties to banks in the home country, but also abroad, needs to be enhanced. Central banks need to acquire a better understanding of how the banks manage their liquidity, how they select their sources of funding and the effects this has on their resilience to disturbances. The analysis of stability also needs to be supplemented with methods for stress tests, that is, ways of analysing the sensitivity of banks to shocks. Another area that will prove challenging for both stability analysis and risk management preparedness in the future is the ongoing integration in Europe and, more generally, banks’ tendency to set up cross-border establishments in many countries. I see great scope for close international cooperation on these issues, both in terms of developing methods for analysis and for other aspects of stability surveillance and crisis management. I would like to thank the Bank of Indonesia once again for devoting an international conference to these important topics. Thank you! 
Niklaus Blattner: The task of overseeing payment and securities settlement systems Introductory remarks by Mr Niklaus Blattner, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 12 December 2003. *      *      * With the revised National Bank Law, the National Bank receives an explicit mandate to contribute to the stability of the financial system. This is, in particular, laid down specifically in the Law in the task of overseeing payment and securities settlement systems. Why does the National Bank oversee payment and securities settlement systems? By overseeing payment and securities settlement systems, the National Bank is supporting the security and efficiency of financial market infrastructures in Switzerland. In doing so, it is helping to ensure the stability of the financial system as a whole. This stability is essential to successful monetary policy in particular, and to the economic efficiency of Switzerland in general. The importance of a market economy’s financial system derives from the function that it fulfils. The financial system is responsible for the allocation of financial resources and risks, as well as intermediation between savers and investors. A financial system can be described as stable if it performs these tasks efficiently and its markets and institutions prove themselves to be shock-resistant. Another part of a stable financial system are secure financial market infrastructures. These include, specifically, payment systems and systems for the clearing and settlement of financial instruments (securities settlement systems). Deficient payment and securities settlement systems might potentially trigger a crisis in the system. An operational or technical system failure can delay transaction settlement so severely - or even prevent it for such a long period - that widespread credit or liquidity problems among financial institutions result. In particularly serious cases, the financial institutions concerned, and perhaps even the financial markets, are no longer able to perform their role in the economy or can do so to only a limited extent. Yet on the other hand, payment and securities settlement systems also play a major part in preventing the transfer of payment or delivery problems from one participant to the others. Such difficulties might also trigger a chain reaction which could jeopardise the entire system. This makes the architecture of payment and securities settlement systems all the more important, because it determines their capacity to limit the transfer of weaknesses. Secure and efficient financial market infrastructures are especially important to the Swiss economy, which has a large financial sector and generates significant payment flows. Their significance is illustrated by the relevant figures: every day, sums amounting to around 180 billion Swiss francs pass between financial institutions via Swiss Interbank Clearing System (SIC), Switzerland’s most important payment system. With a system of this scale it is easy to imagine that problems with the clearing or settlement of transactions might jeopardise the stability of the financial system as a whole. I would like here to outline how the Swiss National Bank can help to ensure more efficient and more reliable financial market infrastructures through its oversight of payment and securities settlement systems. I would, however, like to make one key point right away: state intervention in, or regulation of, financial market infrastructures is justified only if it must be assumed that the private sector will not necessarily perform these functions of its own accord in a manner that is best for the economy. In reality, when designing a system its operators and participants will probably consider the direct costs that they would bear themselves in the event of a system failure or the withdrawal of a participant. However, the remaining costs that are not borne directly by the parties involved in the event of a system crisis tend to be forgotten in management calculations. It cannot be ruled out, then, that operators and participants take less account of the security of a system than would be necessary from the perspective of the broader economy. It is a classic problem of market failure. The sense and purpose of overseeing payment and securities settlement systems is to give due consideration to the externalities that would be neglected by the private sector and to ensure that financial market infrastructures provide the optimum degree of reliability from the point of view of the national economy. BIS Review 58/2003 1 
The oversight of payment and securities settlement systems in practice In future, the National Bank will be taking a risk-oriented approach, i.e. we will deploy our resources in those specific areas in which the risks are particularly high. The National Bank Law stipulates a three-tier oversight process. The first tier is an obligation on the part of operators of payment and securities settlement systems to provide statistical information. The National Bank will use the data it collects to gain an overview of the breadth and importance of the systems and instruments for the clearing and settlement of payments and securities trades that are available in Switzerland. The second tier is a more wide-ranging disclosure obligation that is imposed upon the operators of securities settlement systems and those payment systems which process payments in excess of 25 billion Swiss francs a year. With payment systems of this size and larger, the National Bank will look in greater detail into the extent to which they might jeopardise the stability of the financial system. Finally, the National Bank Law provides for powers on the part of the National Bank to impose minimum requirements on systemically important financial market infrastructures as a third tier of oversight. Detailed implementation provisions for oversight will be laid down in an ordinance to be issued by the National Bank. In early November 2003, the National Bank submitted a consultation draft of this ordinance to interested parties. The draft itself can be found on our website. I would now like briefly to address three central points connected with oversight: which systems should be overseen by the National Bank? What minimum requirements should the operators of these systems fulfil? And finally: how will collaboration with other regulatory and supervisory authorities - especially the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (FBC) - be structured? Oversight focuses on systems which might constitute a threat to the stability of the Swiss financial system. The question of the systems to which this applies cannot be answered in precise terms. The ordinance lists a number of criteria that we will consider when assessing the systemic importance of an infrastructure. In addition to the type, number and monetary volume of the transactions that are cleared or settled via a system, the outcome of the assessment will depend, for example, on the other financial market infrastructures with which a system is linked, and whether or not the clearing and settlement of transactions can be diverted temporarily to another system in the event of a failure in the first system. The latter option alleviates the problem somewhat. Given these and other criteria, it can be assumed that the group of systems overseen by the National Bank will be composed first and foremost of those payment and securities settlement systems that are part of what is known as the Swiss value chain. These are the interbank payment system Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC), the SECOM securities settlement system and x-clear, the central counterparty. In addition, however, the multi-currency payment system Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS), which is used to settle foreign exchange transactions, may also be classified as systemically important. Closer investigation will reveal whether or not this group will be expanded to include yet more systems, such as that operated by Postfinance. The National Bank’s main points of reference in respect of the minimum requirements that the operators of these systems must fulfil are two internationally recognised standards: the “Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems” and the “Recommendations for Securities Settlement Systems”. Like the two standards just mentioned, the National Bank’s minimum requirements are target-oriented i.e. the system operator in question is largely free to determine how it will achieve the required state of affairs. The minimum requirements are aimed at two aspects of the reliability of payment and securities settlement systems in particular. The first of these relates to the technical and operational security of a system. The system itself may not be the cause of a crisis. Specific emphasis is placed on a lasting guarantee of virtually uninterrupted system availability. The regular review and testing of emergency plans and procedures is part of this. However, the minimum standards also call for measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data as well as the traceability of transactions. The second aspect of the minimum requirements concerns risk management and the architecture of payment and securities settlement systems, i.e. the rules and procedures by which transactions are cleared or settled. Structures must be in place to prevent weaknesses in the financial system, such as payment or delivery difficulties on the part of a system participant, spreading in an uncontrolled fashion to other participants. In this context, the focus is, for example, on requirements relating to the payment instruments used, the irrevocability of transactions that have already been settled (finality), and on instruments and procedures to limit credit and liquidity risks. 2 BIS Review 58/2003 
BIS Review 58/2003 3 Collaboration with other authorities The National Bank is not the only institution which actively endeavours to secure the stability of the financial system. There is also contact with other authorities. One of these points of contact arises from the fact that, for example, the operator of SECOM (SIS Sega Intersettle AG) holds a bank licence and is therefore subject to supervision by the FBC. The FBC will still be the regulatory body responsible for the institution itself, while the National Bank will handle the oversight of the system operated by this institution. A parallel situation exists in the case of x-clear, which is operated by SIS x-clear AG - also regulated, as a bank, by the FBC. The FBC and the National Bank coordinate their activities and avoid overlaps. A further point of contact with other authorities exists in the case of financial market infrastructures that are of systemic importance to Switzerland but are operated abroad and thus cannot be overseen directly by the National Bank. From the present perspective this applies in particular to the foreign exchange settlement system CLS. Here too, close collaboration between the primary supervisory authority, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the National Bank and the other central banks involved is essential. In addition, the National Bank is considering cooperating with private sector auditors. In the same way as the FBC, which works with private-sector auditors in conducting its supervisory activities, the National Bank intends to use a dual system in which certain examinations may be carried out by private auditing companies. There is a particular need for such an approach in those areas in which very specific specialist knowledge is required, such as in the assessment of information security. Concluding remarks Two further points in conclusion: firstly, it must be emphasised that the oversight of payment and securities settlement systems is a new task for the National Bank only where securities settlement is concerned. As the bank of banks, it already helps to shape financial market infrastructures and limit the systemic risks inherent in them. In both segments, however, the new Law gives the National Bank a more forceful range of instruments that will allow it to act more effectively and more transparently. Secondly, it would be wrong to assume that the explicit mandating of the National Bank to oversee payment and securities settlement systems is in response to any fundamental concerns about the reliability of Switzerland’s financial market infrastructures. On the contrary - we believe that the Swiss financial centre has infrastructures that function better than most and come out very well in an international comparison of security and efficiency. By overseeing payment and securities settlement systems, the National Bank is helping to ensure that it will remain so in the future. 
Philipp Hildebrand: The Swiss National Bank’s view of international financial markets against the background of trends in the United States Introductory remarks by Philipp Hildebrand, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 12 December 2003. *      *      * The past year was a turbulent one for the international financial markets, which were essentially influenced by trends in the US. During the first half of 2003, market developments were shaped by economic and deflation fears as well as by the war in Iraq. In this environment, equity markets reached an annual low in March. In June, bond market yields fell to their lowest level. The second half of the year saw an economic recovery in the US, which is now spreading to other economic regions as well. Capital markets Long-term yields on Swiss paper rose by approximately 60 basis points from their low in June to roughly 2.7%, approximately tracking yields in the euro area. In both cases, yields followed the US market very closely, albeit with modest fluctuations (see graph 1). Under the present economic conditions, the interest rate environment in Switzerland is still viewed as attractive by consumers. The high level of new fixed-rate mortgages is an indication of this sentiment. The higher Swiss yields reflect the improved economic outlook and not inflation expectations, which are modest given that there is still pronounced underutilisation of capacities. In contrast to capital market yields, money market yields were decidedly stable. The three-month Libor remained almost constant at 0.25%.  The global trend in capital market yields was chiefly determined by long-term yields in the US, which themselves were shaped by the recovery of the US economy. In the early summer, deflation fears had dragged the yield on ten-year US government bonds down to 3.1% - a level last reached at the end of the 1950s. In July and August, however, positive economic data pushed the yield right up to 4.6%. Convexity hedging was one of the factors contributing to the unusual scale of the turnaround. As interest rates fell in the early summer, the refinancing of existing mortgages - which is possible in the US at any time - had triggered extensive buying of government bonds. US investors holding substantial mortgage portfolios had to make these purchases in order to keep the residual maturities of their portfolios constant. When interest rates rose, therefore, the correction was similarly swift. In September, increasing doubts were voiced as to the sustainability of the economic upswing in the US: BIS Review 58/2003 1 
compared with earlier cycles, the essential element of an improving labour market was missing. This led to a consolidation on the capital markets even though the economic indicators remained largely positive. With the first signs of the US labour market recovering at the end of September, coupled with rapid growth in gross domestic product in the third quarter (8.2%), the strength of the economic revival in the US economy was confirmed. Just how sustained this pick-up proves to be will become evident in the coming months when the extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimuli weaken. Foreign exchange markets Fluctuations in the US dollar dominated the foreign exchange markets. After having lost considerable ground during the first half of the year, the greenback rebounded slightly by October amid growing signs of an acceleration of growth. Recently, the focus of market participants returned to the sustainability of the US recovery and the continued rise in America’s current account deficit. As a result, the dollar weakened again (see graph 2). Since the middle of the year, the Swiss franc has moved sideways against the euro. Heavier fluctuations were recorded vis-à-vis the dollar. With positive economic data emanating in the US from June onwards, the franc initially weakened before firming again as part of the general dollar consolidation witnessed since September. On the whole, the Swiss franc hardly registered any independent movements. It depreciated strongly during the first half of the year after our interest rate decision and has remained stable since the summer. In relation both to Switzerland’s 24 major trading partners and to the euro zone, the real exchange rate index of the Swiss franc is now slightly below its level at the beginning of 1999, i.e. at the time of the euro launch.  Gold market Owing to the more favourable economic situation, raw material prices continued the rise which had started in 2001. At over 400 USD/ounce, the gold price was at a seven-year high at the beginning of December. Because of the weak dollar, the gold price increase in francs was more modest. However, its peak of approximately 17,000 CHF/kg was still the highest for several years. The main reason for this rise was persistently modest hedging activity by gold producers. 2 BIS Review 58/2003 
Equity markets International equity markets exhibited a positive course overall, steadily making up lost ground after their mid-March low (see graph 3). As the equity environment began to present a perceptibly brighter picture, turnover also picked up. This, together with the more confident investor sentiment, reduced volatility. The ambitious profit expectations now reflected in share prices suggest that market players are optimistic about the economic situation and the corporate environment. To sum up, the financial markets are currently influenced by a complex interplay of factors: a globally synchronised economic recovery is taking place against a backdrop of external imbalances. An autonomous economic recovery outside of the US - underpinned, not least of all, by supply-side reforms - would help substantially to redress these imbalances.  Key features of the SNB’s future investment and risk control process The SNB’s investment activity is subordinated to monetary policy and is determined by the criteria of liquidity, risk and returns. The new National Bank Law will extend the SNB’s investment opportunities. The current National Bank Law (NBL) limits eligible investments to gold and fixed-interest securities, and eligible borrowers to states, international organisations and banks. Article 9 of the new NBL defines a wider scope of possible transactions. This allows the National Bank to further optimise the structure of its investments with a view to specific central bank needs. As part of this process, we are also evaluating the possibility of enlarging the investment universe. However, such an extension would raise a number of fundamental questions that will first need to be examined. Before the new law enters into force, we will establish and publish investment policy directives setting out how the Governing Board plans to make use of the extended investment policy scope. While our assets have already been managed largely in conformity with the principles of modern asset management, improvements were nevertheless called for. It was essential to bring our internal investment and risk control processes into line with the new legal framework. The opportunities for diversification brought about by additional investment instruments would, in principle, reduce the market risk of the investments. At the same time, though, the SNB would incur new risks, e.g. additional credit risks. In addition, corporate governance is to be enhanced. The primary goal is to segregate powers as far as possible: firstly between monetary policy and investment policy operations, secondly between investment strategy and its implementation through asset management, and thirdly between risk taking and risk controlling. There are limits to the principle of segregation of powers insofar as the Governing Board is responsible both for monetary policy and investment policy. Let me briefly outline our concept regarding the new investment process: BIS Review 58/2003 3 
4 BIS Review 58/2003 • The Bank Council approves the principles laid down for risk policy and the investment process.  • The Governing Board decides each year on the investment strategy based on the aforementioned criteria of liquidity, risk and returns.  • The organisational unit Asset Management, which is part of Department III, is responsible for the market-oriented implementation of this investment strategy. An investment committee chaired by the head of Asset Management makes the strategic investment decisions and sets the targets for each portfolio manager.  • A well-tested risk control process ensures that risk taking at the different levels is duly supervised.  Responsibilities and competencies are clearly assigned at all levels of the investment process. Performance at the different levels is assessed through the consistent use of benchmarks and the corresponding measurement techniques. The process described above is applied to the management not only of the international reserves but also of the proceeds from the sale of gold no longer needed for monetary policy purposes. How the gold reserves deemed “free” at the time are finally used will be a political decision. Managing these assets is not part of the SNB’s statutory mandate. Thanks to the new NBL and the SNB’s internal know-how, however, the Bank is well qualified to perform this task. 
Seung Park: The recent state of the Korean economy and the policy response Speech by Dr Seung Park, Governor of the Bank of Korea, at the Seoul Foreign Correspondent’s Club, Seoul, 16 December 2003. *      *      * Opening remarks Ladies and gentlemen,  Let me begin by expressing my deep thanks to Ms. Sohn, Jie-Ae, the President of Seoul Foreign Correspondent’s Club and other members for having invited me to address today’s gathering. Over the past half-century, correspondents of the Club have acquainted the entire world with Korea’s politics, economy, society, and culture. At times you praised and encouraged for Korea’s astonishing development. At others you criticized and advised about Korea’s outmoded practices not in keeping with global standards. In this way, you have contributed to Korea’s growth as a member of the international community.  Today I would like to brief you on the movements of the Korean economy over the past year, the prospects for the next year, and what needs to be done to achieve sustainable growth. I intend to focus especially on the desirability of North-South economic cooperation on the Korean peninsula.  Movements of Korean economy over the past year and policy initiatives  As all of you may well be aware, this year the Korean economy has been going through its most difficult period since overcoming the 1997 currency crisis.  In the early part of the year, geopolitical risks ran high over the war in Iraq and the North Korean nuclear issue while the world economic recovery was still awaited. Along with these woes, the spread of SARS greatly undermined consumer and business confidence. After that, the situation was worsened by production setbacks arising from labor disputes and the damage caused by Typhoon Maemi. Despite the now-evident recovery of the world economy and the matching improvement of exports, the household sector’s over-indebtedness and the inefficiency of the country’s social structure are acting to hinder the recovery of consumer and business confidence. As a result, Korea’s GDP growth is considered to have fallen from 6.3 percent last year to 2.9 percent this year.  On the front of prices and current account position, the picture is rather more satisfactory. Core inflation has been showing stable movements at around the 3 percent mark, the midpoint of its target range. The current account is expected to register a surplus of around 12 billion dollars for the year thanks to the briskness of exports.  In spite of price stability and a current account surplus, economic activity has remained in the doldrums. Thus the Bank of Korea lowered its call rate target by 50 basis points in all to support a recovery of economic activity, bringing it down in May and July from 4.25 percent to the current 3.75 percent. For its part, the government has expanded fiscal spending. It drew up supplementary budgets of 6.3 billion dollars(7.5 trillion won) in all during this year.  Prospects of Korean economy for the next year  Looking ahead, as the effects of this pump-priming policy become evident and the world economy, notably that of the United States, continues to show clear signs of recovery, we expect a gradual improvement in the Korean economy. In the third quarter, GDP growth already increased to 2.3 percent from the 1.9 percent of the second quarter. It is thought that the economy has now bottomed out and moved into a phase of mild recovery. Next year Korea’s GDP growth is expected to rise to 5.2 percent.  For its part, core inflation for the next year is anticipated to show stable movements at 2.8 percent. We are looking to see a current account surplus on a scale of around 6 billion dollars.  BIS Review 57/2003 1 
Changes in the growth environment and tasks for sustainable growth  If we judge the Korean economy only by the prospects for next year’s growth, prices and current account position, we might think that it has no serious problems.  Seen from a long-term perspective, however, the growth environment surrounding the Korean economy has been changing very fast. How appropriately we respond to these changes will be decisive for the future of the Korean economy.  These changes in the growth environment can largely be summarized under three headings. The first is the Korean economy’s shift from a low wage system to a high wage system. The second is the dynamic rise of the neighboring Chinese economy with its unlimited resources of low wage labors. And the third is that the Korean economy is inevitably exposed to the worldwide revolution of openness.  Due to the combined shock of three major changes, Korean companies and products that have grown up under the previous low wage and protectionalist framework are destined to lose much of their competitiveness.  Therefore, short-term pump-priming measurers are insufficient to sustain a solid growth path for the Korean economy in the long run. Heightening competitiveness through the structural reform I am about to describe is of over-riding importance.  Firstly, efforts for financial structural reform should be stepped up more than ever. It is true that Korean financial markets have developed greatly in terms of quality and quantity thanks to its drive for structural adjustment since the 1997 financial crisis. More recently, however, some new factors making for instability in financial markets have emerged. They include the worsening of management status in some credit card companies and investment trust companies, the rise in the overdue ratio on household loans, and the increase in number of individuals on the bank’s credit blacklist. Worse still, they act as a hindrance to economic growth, causing the shrinkage of consumer and business confidence. Therefore, it is important to resolve the problems posed by these destabilizing factors at an early stage through more intensive financial reform so that the Korean economy can enjoy continued growth.  Secondly, the problem of high costs, which is deeply rooted in all areas of Korean society, should be solved. The major high costs I would identify are the high housing cost caused by the steep rise in property prices, the high education cost caused by the fevered atmosphere of private tutoring institutes, and the high transportation cost caused by urban traffic congestion. These high costs consequently lead to high wages. Though the causes of these high social costs are varied and complicated, we can say the main factor lies in the development imbalance between the regions. For this reason, it is important to promote balanced development between the regions to solve the problems of these high costs. And in particular, it is highly necessary to devise countermeasures for easing the concentration of the population on Seoul and notably the Kangnam area.  Lastly, but not least, the problem of low social efficiency should be tackled. Typical examples of this low efficiency are immature labor-management relations, the influence of vested interest groups, the unproductive political structure, and the anti-globalization sentiment. These phenomena mainly arise from the underdevelopment of the structure of popular consciousness. Therefore, Korea should overcome them by reinforcing social leadership and steady efforts for the reform of consciousness. That is, Korea should shift in labor-management relations from a mind-set oriented toward conflict and confrontation to one focused on understanding and cooperation. And it should shift from a wearisome and unproductive political process to one that is constructive and productive, and from closed mental attitudes to outward-oriented ways of thinking.  The Importance of North-South economic cooperation on Korean peninsula  So far, I have outlined three paths to enhance the Korean economy’s competitiveness. However, they are all medium- or long-term tasks that will need a long time to bring to fruition.  So then, what can provide a short-term breakthrough for strengthening competitiveness? The answer is to promote North-South economic cooperation on the Korean peninsula.  North-South economic cooperation could open up a new path toward absorbing the impact on the Korean economy of its high wage costs, the dynamic rise of the Chinese economy, and the revolution of openness. North Korea offers very low production costs, particularly low-cost labor, and there is also the possibility of direct inland transport between the North and the South. It should also be 2 BIS Review 57/2003 
BIS Review 57/2003 3 relatively unproblematic for South Korea companies to locate operations there because of the shared language and historical traditions. In addition, people in the two halves of Korean peninsula have the sense of belonging to one and the same nation.  On the basis of these advantageous conditions, the combination of South Korean capital and technology and North Korean work force can lead to stronger competitiveness in the high-end information technology sector as well as, of course, the more labor intensive sectors.  Needless to say, the setting-up of brisk economic cooperation between the North and the South is also very important in terms of preparations for reunification. At the present time, North Korea is in great need of basic necessities because of the backwardness of its industrial facilities. If reunification were to take place without adequate preparations under these circumstances, huge number of North Korean people would flow into the South looking for work. This could turn into a national disaster.  For the timely prevention of such a situation, we need to narrow the economic gap between the two Koreas by stepping up investment in North Korea.  In this respect, a great deal depends on whether or not the industrial complex at Kaesong, the southernmost city of North Korea, proves a success. With the ground-breaking ceremony on June 30, the construction of the first stage of the Kaesong industrial complex is underway with a ticket of some 180 million dollars(200 billion won). Kaesong is a very important staging post on the road between Seoul and Pyongyang, and it is located only some 60 km north of Seoul. And it is understood that within the factory complex, the minimum wage will be only 57 dollars and 50 cents per month. The rate of tax will be very low. There are also guarantees that firms will have autonomy and flexibility in the management of locally-hired human resources. Consequently, many South Korean companies are planning to set up in the Kaesong industrial complex. Whether they succeed or not will provide a touchstone for future investment in North Korea and for economic cooperation between the two halves of the peninsula.  When we look at the overall picture of the relationship between North and South Korea, we can say that the thaw has now arrived, even though there remain some factors making for tension such as the North Korean nuclear issue. The proportion of the population on both sides who went through the horrors of the Korean War is declining rapidly and mutual hostility is easing. Meanwhile, bilateral exchanges and cooperation are constantly expanding in the academic, cultural and sporting areas as well as the humanitarian dimension. It is absolutely essential to reach a peaceful solution to the North Korean nuclear issue in order to sustain this desirable atmosphere and foster economic cooperation between the two Koreas. It is indispensable also for the firmer assurance of security throughout the Asian-Pacific region.  I would like to ask you as members of the fourth estate, to give your supportive cooperation so that progress can be made on the North Korean nuclear issue.  Closing remarks  As I have pointed out today, the Korean economy faces many difficult problems.  But as you have probably observed, Koreans have a long tradition of uniting as one in their efforts to overcome adversity. Korea brought about the “Miracle on the Han River”. It rose from the ashes of the Korean War and utter destitution to become a member of the so-called rich countries’ club of the OECD within less than half a century. Korea also offers a successful example of what can be achieved under the IMF’s structural adjustment program. Through bold structural reform, it was able to overcome, in a prudent manner, the foreign currency crisis that broke out in 1997, again exhibiting a characteristic dynamism.  For my part, I am convinced that Korea will again move on from the present difficult situation, drawing on the strong foundation built by such historical experiences and the sense of self-confidence that they have provided.  Thank you for listening so attentively.  
Y V Reddy: Towards globalization in the financial sector in India Inaugural address by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Twenty-Fifth Bank Economists' Conference - 2003, Mumbai, 11 December 2003. The references for the speech can be found on the website of the Reserve Bank of India. *      *      * Mr. Chairman, distinguished panelists, participants and friends, I am indeed very happy to be, once again, amongst friends - albeit in a slightly different capacity. All of you have been totally supportive to me and, I must express my deep sense of gratitude to you for the warm and affectionate welcome that you gave for my appointment. My address today is in the nature of sharing of some of my preliminary thought processes on the subject of globalisation and the financial sector. The presentation today starts with a framework for appreciating globalization and then provides some insights in the context of the financial sector, with special reference to banking. In the Indian context I would setout some of the initiatives by Reserve Bank of India, which are relevant to the issue of globalisation. Globalisation: a framework The concept of globalization, in the sense in which it is used now, can be traced to the phenomenon of nation states. Government-imposed restrictions on movement of goods, services, people and capital are less than a hundred years old; in fact, passports and visas and the whole gamut of restrictions are a feature of the late 19th Century and the first half of the 20th Century. The nation state put restrictions on its citizens in their involvement with other nation states in what was perceived as the collective self-nterest of its citizens. In the context of public policy relating to globalization, a critical issue is the trade-off between individual freedom and collective self-interest as also where the burden of proof lies, namely, with individuals or national authorities.  Globalisation has several dimensions arising out of what may be called the consequential enhanced connectivity among people across borders. While such enhanced connectivity is determined by three fundamental factors, viz., technology, taste and public policy, cross-border integration can have several aspects: cultural, social, political and economic. For purposes of this presentation, however, the focus is on economic integration. Broadly speaking, economic integration occurs through three channels, viz., movement of people, goods and services, and movements in capital and financial services. The most notable achievement of recent globalization is the freedom granted to some, if not all, from the tyranny of being rooted to a place and the opportunity to move and connect freely. For example, many Indians relatively from poorer sections have benefited by developments in Middle East while many talented professions gained from movement to UK and USA. At the same time, in reality, there are several economic as well as non-economic, especially cultural or emotional reasons for people not globalising. In regard to trade in or movement of goods and services across borders, there are two types of barriers, viz., what are described as natural and artificial. Natural barriers relate to various costs involved in transportation and information over distances. Artificial barriers are those that are related to public policy, such as, import restrictions by way of tariff or non-tariff barriers. The pace and nature of globalization will depend on the combined effect of technology and public policy, both at national and international levels. In regard to capital movement also, the interplay between technology and public policy becomes relevant. There are, however, some special characteristics of capital flows. These characteristics have highlighted the issue of what is described as contagion, namely, a country is affected by developments totally outside of its policy ambit though domestic policy may, to some extent, determine the degree of vulnerability to the contagion. In any case, cross-border flows of capital have wider macroeconomic implications, particularly in terms of the exchange rate that directly affects the costs and movement of people as well as goods and services; the conduct of monetary policy and the efficiency as well as stability of the financial system. Furthermore, capital flows by definition involve future liabilities or assets and could involve inter-generational equity issues. BIS Review 57/2003 1 
Developments in technology and innovation in financial services impact both domestic and cross-border transactions. The implications for public policy of such developments in the domestic area are on a different footing in the sense that domestic financial markets are in some ways subject to governmental regulation by national authorities while cross-border flows are not as susceptible to governmental regulation. Finally, in the context of cross-border capital flows, in the absence of procedures for dealing with international bankruptcy and facilities for the lender of last resort, the liabilities incurred on private account can devolve on public account. In brief, at this juncture, in respect of global economic integration through movement of capital, several risks devolve on domestic public authorities, especially in the case of developing countries.  Globalisation is a complex phenomenon and a process that is, perhaps, best managed by public policies. In managing the process, developing countries face challenges from a world order that is particularly burdensome on them. Yet, as many developing countries have demonstrated, it is possible for public policy to manage the process with a view to maximizing benefits to its citizens while minimizing risks. The nature of optimal integration, however, is highly country specific and contextual. On balance, there appears to be a greater advantage in well-managed and appropriate integration into the global process, which would imply not large-scale but more effective interventions by governments. In fact, markets do not and cannot exist in a vacuum, i.e., without some externally imposed rules and such order is a result of public policy. The poor, the vulnerable and the underprivileged will continue to be the responsibility of national governments and hence of concerns to public policy. Sound public policies at the national level in countries like ours are very critical in the current context of levels of development and extent of globalization. In brief, it is necessary to recognize that nation-states, as those still primarily responsible for social order in the communities in which people live, have a duty to manage the process of globalization. This challenge is particularly complex in the area of financial services, more so in the case of banks in the larger emerging economies. Globalisation in the context of the financial sector At the outset, it would be useful to consider the emerging picture of financial flows as per the latest data released by IMF in the context of increasing globalisation. For almost all the years from 1999, the current account balance of advanced economies has been negative and it is estimated to reach US 225 billion in the year 2004 from a positive of US $ 41 billion in 1998. The developing countries, which had a current account deficit of US $ 83 billion in 1998, are estimated to have a surplus balance of a projected US $ 28 billion in 2004. It is interesting to note that while globalization is expected to result in flows of capital from developed to developing countries, it is not clear whether the turn arounds in the current account deficits is a temporary phenomenon. The removal or attenuation of cross-border barriers to trade and capital flows renders assessment of international financial flows that much more difficult to capture in the data.  It is also interesting to consider the pattern of net capital flows to emerging market economies. While private net direct investment has been consistently positive and above US $ 100 billion since 1995 to 2003, private net portfolio investment which was positive in the years 1995 to 1999 is since negative in the rest of the years. The range during 1995-2003 has been from a positive US $ 83 billion to a negative of US $ 53 billion. It is, thus clear that both in terms of magnitude and stability, private direct investment seems to have a significant edge over portfolio investment.  On the quality of capital flows, it is interesting to note that at the end of 1997, the estimated share of Off-shore Financial Centres in the total of cross border assets stood at 54.2 per cent, as per a recent study by OECD discussed in the G-20 meeting in Mexico. The study mentions that inadequate access to bank information in such centres greatly facilitates money laundering, smuggling of goods, counterfeiting and financing terrorism, etc. In any approach to the policies relating to the financial integration, it may be useful to keep these facts in mind, particularly both quantitative and qualitative factors in such flows, particularly in the context of the banking sector.  As already mentioned, there is an increasing recognition of a distinction between trade integration and financial integration and this distinction has been recognized forcefully in a recent study made a few months ago by the IMF. The summary of the study reads as follows: “The empirical evidence has not established a definitive proof that financial integration has enhanced growth for developing countries. Furthermore, it may be associated with higher consumption volatility. Therefore, there may be value for 2 BIS Review 57/2003 
developing countries to experiment with different paces and strategies in pursuing financial integration. Empirical evidence does suggest that improving governance, in addition to sound macroeconomic frameworks and the development of domestic financial markets, should be an important element of such strategies. It might not be essential for a country to develop a full set of sound institutions matching the best practices in the world before embarking on financial integration. Doing so might strain the capacity of the country. An intermediate and more practical approach could be to focus on making progress on the core indicators noted above, namely transparency, control of corruption, rule of law, and financial supervisory capacity……..” Apart from this interesting research on the subject, on a judgemental basis, considering the cross-country experiences, it is possible to discern some disconnects between impressions and reality. Though many developing countries have adopted significant policy measures for financial integration with the rest of the world, capital flows both foreign direct investment and portfolio investment, are predominantly accounted for by a few countries which are not very high in terms of financial integration with rest of the world. In other words, de jure financial integration seems to be distinct from de facto integration. Furthermore, the way the financial markets as well as international financial institutions respond to economies requiring adjustment problems appear to be asymmetrical. The financial markets, in fact, tend to be far more pro-cyclical in the case of the emerging economies, thus making emerging economies subject to greater volatility in flows than the other countries. It is essential to recognise that the capacity of economic agents in developing economies, particularly poorer segments, to manage volatility in all prices, goods or forex are highly constrained and there is a legitimate role for non-volatility as a public good.  Globalization and the banking sector It is in this overall scenario, the policy relating to the financial services, and in particular banking, must be considered. It is interesting to note that WTO negotiations on financial services have been cautious and the commitments of many larger economies in the banking sector are rather particularly limited. In other words, in the context of issue of national ownership of financial intermediaries, banks appear to have a unique place in public policy. There are several noteworthy features of ownership and control of banks in all major economies - irrespective of whether they are developed or emerging. In almost all cases, banks are either widely held or have substantial State ownership. Furthermore, there are special conditions governing the extent of ownership, the nature of ownership and control, and transfers of such ownership or control through statutory backing. These are justified since the banks are admittedly special. The discussions in WTO on Commitments relating to opening of domestic banking sector to foreign banks/ownership reflects these concerns in most of the major economies. It is worth recalling what Sir Eddie George, the Governor of Bank of England had said on the subject banks being special: “they remain special in terms of the particular functions they perform - as the repository of the economy’s immediately available liquidity, as the core payments mechanism, and as the principal source of non-market finance to a large part of the economy. And they remain special in terms of the particular characteristics of their balance sheets, which are necessary to perform those functions - including the mismatch between their assets and liabilities which makes banks peculiarly vulnerable to systemic risk in the traditional sense of that term.” He is even more forthright in making it clear that treatment of banks can not be on par with non-banks. “On the other hand, I am not persuaded that the special public interest in banking activity extends to non-banking financial institutions, though different functional public interests in many cases clearly do.” Data clearly indicates that banks continue to play a pre-dominant role in financial intermediation in developing countries. This is understandable for several reasons viz. the savers’ eagerness for assured income; inadequate capacity to manage financial risks and the fact that the banking institutions in some sense and in different degrees, enjoy deposit insurance and either implicit or explicit guarantee of government. It is important to note that banking crisis invariably results in heavy costs to the Government, whether they are publicly owned, privately owned, domestically owned or foreign owned. The fiscal costs of banking crises are ownership-neutral. BIS Review 57/2003 3 
An important question in this context is whether the role of banks in financial integration in developed countries is different from that in the emerging market economies. It is useful to assess the significant differences in the structure of the banking industry in emerging vis-à-vis developed markets. In most emerging markets, banks assets comprise well over 80 per cent of total financial sector assets, whereas these figures are significantly lower in developed economies. In most emerging market economies, the five largest banks (usually domestic) account for over two-thirds of bank assets. These figures are much lower in developed economies. Another difference in the banking industry in developed and emerging economies is the degree of internationalisation of banking operations. Internationalisation defined as the share of foreign-owned banks as a percentage of total bank assets, tends to be much lower in emerging economies. This pattern is, however, not uniform within world regions.  Finally, a significant feature of banking in developed versus emerging economies, especially in recent years, has been the process of consolidation. The most notable difference between the consolidation process in developed and emerging markets is the overwhelming cross-border nature of mergers and acquisitions in the latter. In particular, cross-border merger activity in continental Europe and also between US and European institutions has been more of an exception rather than the rule. In contrast, there has been a sharp increase in foreign ownership of some emerging market banks due to process of privatisation often associated with crises.  An important difference in this context has been the role played by the authorities in the financial sector consolidation process. In mature markets, consolidation has been seen as a way of eliminating excess capacity and generating cost savings to the institution. In emerging markets, on the other, consolidation has been predominantly a way of resolving problems of financial distress, with the authorities playing a major role in the process.  Indian context While there has been a significant progress towards globalisation in the recent past and policy-wise, there have been impressive initiatives, the extent to which India is globalised is considerably at the lower end of the emerging economies. This indicates enormous opportunities but also challenges in terms of transition from a stage of low base. More importantly, the issue of financial integration and in particular the integration of banking sector has to be considered in terms of overall sequencing in this process of integration with the rest of the world. The overriding issue is not whether to globalise or not, but how best to manage the process of globalization, particularly with a view to accelerating the process at the current juncture where the global outlook on India and India’s confidence as well as competitiveness are strong. There is now a consensus among academicians and policy makers that trade liberalization should take precedence over financial liberalisation. Even in the context of financial liberalisation, the liberalisation in regard to borrowings in foreign currency should have a lower priority compared to all other capital flows. There is also consensus that the foreign currency exposures of households, corporate sectors and financial intermediaries should be assessed separately and in a continuous fashion to assess the gains as well as the vulnerabilities to the system. In particular, there is a greater recognition of the need to put in place appropriate prudential regulation in regard to the financial intermediaries insofar as foreign currency transactions are concerned in all emerging countries. There is virtual unanimity that the currency mismatches of financial intermediaries is a major source of downside risks of financial integration which can be mitigated by monitoring and regulations. Among the financial intermediaries, banks no doubt have a unique place. There is also a strong consensus, globally, on the importance of what have been described as preconditions for capital account convertibility - in particular on the fiscal front and efficiency of the financial sector.  In the context of maximising benefits of financial integration and minimising the risks, the link with conditions in the real sector cannot be lost sight of. In China, reforms in real sector preceded reforms in the financial sector and it was possibly the reason for some vulnerability of the latter. In India, reforms in financial sector started early in the reform cycle which imparts significant efficiency, and stability to the financial sector. The financial sector can add competitive strength and growth if reforms in the financial and real sectors keep apace. In other words, flexibility in product and factor markets play a part not only in capturing the gains from financial sector reform but also more generally from globalisation. A major agenda for reform at this juncture for us, given the impressive all-round confidence in the economy, relate to the structure and functioning of institutions and in particular the 4 BIS Review 57/2003 
high transaction costs prevalent in our systems. There are several dimensions to the transaction costs - ranging from legal provisions, judicial system, procedures, etc. to attitudes. It is proposed to mention a few measures being contemplated by RBI in this direction.  Some measures by RBI  At the outset it must be recognized that the improvements in efficiency of the financial sector in India, in particular banking sector have won the respect and admiration of most observers, including capital markets. The banking sector in India is poised for a quantum jump in productivity and scope for expansion in view of the competitive strengths acquired in Indian industry. Public sector banks have shown substantial improvements, though in view of their large presence and some institutional constraints, further progress in reform is desirable. The analysis in the Report on Trends and Progress of Banking in India a few weeks ago provides an excellent overview of problems, prospects, and areas for further reforms, and hence that will not be covered here. The ongoing efforts of RBI, in close co-ordination with Government and consultations with market participants, especially in moving up the policy as well as regulatory regimes to global standards, have been narrated in successive announcements on Monetary and Credit Policy statements by Dr. Rangarajan, Dr.Bimal Jalan, and most recently in the Mid-term Review. These narrations would indicate that RBI’s effort is to open up the economy, maximize benefits from globalization while minimizing risks and enable as well as equip banks to face global competition. This is an ongoing process and I believe we in India are better equipped now than ever before to globalise with a sense of confidence and pride. Having said this, it is useful to mention a few initiatives being considered by RBI at this juncture. Governor Jalan in his Inaugural address to this forum in January 2001, said - “The long term vision for India’s banking system to transform itself from being a domestic one to the global level may sound far fetched at present. However, it is not beyond our capacity provided we have the will and the determination”. It is interesting that this year, the subject chosen relates to globalization and perhaps I should enlist a few measures taken by RBI to demonstrate the will and determination to make our banking industry really global.  Consolidation  As mentioned by Governor Jalan in his address to this forum in 2002, “In financial systems worldwide, todays buzzwords are competition, consolidation and stability”. There has been impressive stability and considerable competition in India but the process of consolidation in banking industry has just commenced. The issue of consolidation has been addressed by the Narasimham Committee Report on Banking Sector Reforms (1998) but the issue in regard to policy is yet to be pursued vigorously. There are three aspects to consolidation viz. clear cut legal and regulatory regime governing consolidation, enabling policy framework especially where several banks are owned by Government, and market conditions that facilitate such consolidation, recognising that all mergers and acquisitions may not necessarily be in the interests of either the parties concerned or the system as a whole.  As regards the legal framework, the Reserve Bank is not very comfortable with lack of clear statutory provision regarding takeover of management of banks. In 1970, the Reserve Bank had issued directions to the banks requiring them to seek the Reserve Bank’s permission or acknowledgement before effecting any transfer of shares in favour of any person which would take the holding of shares to more than one per cent (subsequently raised to five per cent) of the total paid up capital of such banking company. Since shares are acquired first and then lodged for registration, the Reserve Bank’s directions create a somewhat piquant situation. To plug the gap, a Bill has now been introduced in the Parliament relating to banking regulation. The RBI’s proposals in this regard should reasonably take care of takeover of the management by one from another and Reserve Bank will have appropriate regulatory power to satisfy itself that persons proposing to acquire such shares are fit and proper persons.  The procedure for amalgamation of two banking companies under Section 44A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (the Act) is easy to follow and cost effective. After the two banking companies have passed the necessary resolution in their general meetings representing not less than two third value of the shareholding of each of the two banking companies, proposing for the amalgamation of one bank with another bank, such resolution containing scheme of amalgamation is submitted to the Reserve Bank for its sanction and if sanctioned, by an order in writing by the Reserve Bank, is binding not only on the banking company concerned, but also on all shareholders thereof. While sanctioning BIS Review 57/2003 5 
the scheme of amalgamation, the Reserve Bank takes into account the financial health of the two banking companies to ensure, inter alia, that after the amalgamation, the new entity will emerge as much stronger bank. The experience of the Reserve Bank has been by and large satisfactory in approving several schemes of amalgamation in the recent past. These provisions, however, do not apply to the banks in public sector, viz., the nationalised banks, State Bank of India and its subsidiary banks. As regards the nationalised banks, the Act authorises the Central Government, after consultation with Reserve Bank, to prepare or make a scheme, inter alia, for transfer of undertaking of a corresponding new bank (i.e. a nationalised bank) to another corresponding new bank or transfer of whole or part of any banking institution to a corresponding new bank. Under this procedure, the New Bank of India was amalgamated with Punjab National Bank but the experience in this regard was considered to be not altogether satisfactory. Unlike the sanction of schemes by the Reserve Bank under Section 44A of the Act, the scheme framed by the Central Government is required under Section 9(6) of the Nationalisation Act to be placed before the two Houses of Parliament. The State Bank of India Act, 1955, empowers the State Bank of India with the consent of the management of any banking institution (which would also include a banking company) to acquire the business, including the assets and liabilities of any bank. Under this provision, what is required is the consent of the concerned bank and the approval of the Reserve Bank and the sanction of such acquisition by the Central Government. Several banks were acquired by the State Bank of India by invoking this section. Section 23A of the Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976 (RRBs Act), empowers the Central Government, in consultation with the NABARD, concerned State Government and sponsored bank, to amalgamate two RRBs, by issue of notification in the official gazette, with such liabilities, duties and obligations as may be specified in the notification. As in the case of amalgamation of a nationalised bank under Section 9(2) of the Nationalisation Act, every notification under this section is also required to be laid before both the Houses of Parliament.  Of course, in the case of a banking company in financial distress and having been placed under the order of moratorium, on an application being made by the Reserve Bank to the Central Government under sub-section (2) of Section 45 of the Act, the Reserve Bank can frame a scheme of amalgamation for transferring the assets and liabilities of such distressed bank to a much better and stronger bank. Such a scheme framed by the Reserve Bank is required to be sanctioned by the Central Government and has to be notified in the official gazette. As in case of amalgamation sanctioned by the Central Government under the Nationalisation Act and RRBs Act, the notification issued for compulsory amalgamation under Section 45 of the Act is also required to be placed before the two Houses of Parliament.  One area of concern to the Reserve Bank is amalgamation of non-banking companies with banking companies as the law does not impose any obligation on the part of such non-banking company (for that matter, even of the concerned banking company) to seek the Reserve Bank’s regulatory approval before filing the scheme of amalgamation in the High Courts under Sections 391 of the Companies Act, 1956. To take care of these gaps, Reserve Bank has proposed some amendments to the legislation on Banking Regulation Act that amalgamation of a non-banking company with a banking company will be made by following the similar procedure which is applicable for amalgamation of two banking companies.  Payment system Payment and settlement systems in India have had a long history. The current predominant mode of funds settlement is through the clearing process - achieved by the functioning of about 1050 clearing houses in the country. These clearing houses function on the basis of the ‘Uniform Regulations and Rules for Bankers’ Clearing Houses’ (URR), a model regulation propounded by the Reserve Bank. Though the systems are predominantly confined to cheque clearing, many other types have also gained significance - such as electronic payment and settlement, securities settlement, and foreign exchange settlement. All these are regulated by their respective rules and procedures, as in the case of the Rules relating to Electronic Clearing Service (ECS), the Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) Regulations and the bye-laws relating to the operations of the systems of the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd.  6 BIS Review 57/2003 
The Bank for International Settlements, Basel, has formulated a set of ‘Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems’ which are the minimum requirements for a sound payment system. These requirements were also highlighted in the year 2000 by the Bhide Advisory Group which examined the International Standards and Codes relating to payment systems, from the perspective of conformity in the Indian context.  With the growing importance being ascribed towards payment and settlement systems the world over, and in view of their significance for financial stability, most central banks have set up an appropriate machinery to regulate and supervise such systems to provide for an explicit legal base for payment and settlement systems. In this background, a draft ‘Payment and Settlement Systems’ bill was prepared by the Reserve Bank and forwarded to the Government of India. In anticipation of the statutory changes, certain preliminary steps are proposed to be taken by the Reserve Bank to build the requisite infrastructure for having effective supervision over payment and settlement systems. A Board for Payment and Settlement Systems (BPSS) is proposed to be constituted soon. The Board would function in a manner similar to the Board for Financial Supervision. BPSS would provide policy directions in areas relating to regulation and supervision of payment and settlement systems, approval of payment systems, criteria for membership, various aspects relating to admission, continuation and denial of membership, handling of offences etc. This initiative would ensure that all the payment and settlement systems in the country are subject to good and efficient governance and that they adopt the best practices in risk management which is a prime requirement relating to a safe, secure and efficient payment and settlement systems. These arrangements should facilitate easy transition to a more formal statutory system. Rating of supervision  The supervision of banks is, on all accounts, becoming extremely complex. The supervisors are required to acquire technical skills, exhibit considerable judgements on systems and develop inter-institutional interactions on a continuing basis. While every effort is made by the Reserve Bank in this regard, there is considerable benefit in introducing a system of feedback from the supervised banks on the adequacy, appropriateness and quality of supervision. This would help in rating of our supervisory performance from time to time and obtain suggestions for improvements from a range of banks, large and small foreign and local. In the light of discussions in the RBI earlier this week, a decision has been taken to introduce such a system of feedback on supervision from the supervised on a regular and continuing basis. We expect to seek further guidance from Board for Financial Supervision, due to hold its meeting next week and finalise an ongoing system of feedback. It is hoped that with these arrangements, some of the unnecessary elements will be eliminated while enhancing quality of supervision particularly in terms of its utility to the supervised and result in overall reduction of transaction costs.  Users’ panel on regulatory instructions  A Standing Technical Committee on Financial Regulation has been constituted recently to advise on regulatory regimes administered by RBI. It is recognised that in spite of existing consultative process, several regulatory instructions, while laudable in their context are not clear or unambiguous in capturing operational issues at the implementation stage. On the basis of discussions in the RBI, it has been decided to prepare, in consultation with self regulatory organsiations, a Users’ Consultative Panel consisting of those incharge of compliance in the regulated institutions. The intention is to obtain feedback on regulations at the formulation stage to avoid ambiguities and operational glitches. The Reserve Bank will, from time to time, seek advice from select members of the panel to avoid burdening all officials in the regulated units. I would seek full co-operation from the banking industry in this regard.  Conclusions  In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the role of institutions and incentives in ensuring globalization that benefits all. The global giants in banking all over the world are manned by Indians, educated and trained in India. The best of technology for the most sophisticated banks in the world is provided by Indian companies and by Indians in foreign companies. Yet, banks in India do not as yet appear to be world class, though I have, no doubt, that our banks could well be on the anvil of being reckoned to be BIS Review 57/2003 7 
8 BIS Review 57/2003 on par with international banks. My submission is that, to reach global standards, and hopefully surpass them, we need to focus on legal, institutional and transactions aspects; and the RBI’s measures detailed today try to make a small beginning in addressing some of these issues. Let me thank the organizers for the opportunity and RBI looks forward to getting the benefit of your discussions in this Conference. 
Alan Greenspan: The widened trade deficit of recent years, in the context of a prolonged bout of job loss in the United States Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the World Affairs Council of Greater Dallas, Dallas, Texas, 11 December 2003.  *      *      * Interest in issues of trade, tariffs, and protectionism has ebbed and flowed in this country since our founding. The widened trade deficit of recent years, in the context of a prolonged bout of job loss, has again elevated cries of distress to special prominence.  The sensitivity of our economy to foreign competition does appear to have intensified recently as technological obsolescence has continued to foreshorten the expected profitable life of the nation’s capital stock. The more rapid turnover of our equipment and plant, as one might expect, is mirrored in an increased turnover of jobs. A million workers leave their jobs every week, two-fifths involuntarily, often in association with facilities that have been displaced or abandoned. A million, more or less, are also newly hired or returned from layoffs every week, in part as new facilities come on stream.  Related to this process, jobs in the United States have been perceived as migrating over the years, to low-wage Japan in the 1950s and 1960s, to low-wage Mexico in the 1990s, and most recently to low-wage China. Japan, of course, is no longer characterized by a low-wage workforce, and many in Mexico are now complaining of job losses to low-wage China.  In the United States, conceptual jobs, fostered by cutting-edge technologies, especially information technologies, are occupying an ever increasing share of the workforce and are gradually replacing work requiring manual skills. Those industries in which labor costs are a significant part of overall costs have been under increasing competition from foreign producers with labor costs, adjusted for productivity, less than ours.  This process is not new. For generations American ingenuity has been creating industries and jobs that never existed before, from vehicle assemblers to computer software engineers. With those jobs come new opportunities for workers with the necessary skills. In recent years, competition from abroad has risen to a point at which our lowest skilled workers are being priced out of the global labor market. This diminishing of opportunities for such workers is why retraining for new job skills that meet the evolving opportunities created by our economy has become so urgent in this country. A major source of such retraining has been our community colleges, which have proliferated over the past two decades.  We can usually identify somewhat in advance which tasks are most vulnerable to being displaced by foreign or domestic competition. But in economies on the forefront of technology, most new jobs are the consequence of innovation, which by its nature is not easily predictable. What we do know is that over the years, more than 94 percent of the workforce, on average, has been employed as markets matched idled workers seeking employment to new jobs. We can thus be confident that new jobs will displace old ones as they always have, but not without a high degree of pain for those in the job-losing segment of our massive job turnover.  The American economy has been in the forefront of what Joseph Schumpeter, the renowned Harvard professor, called “creative destruction,” the continuous scrapping of old technologies to make way for the new. Standards of living rise because the depreciation and other cash flows of industries employing older, increasingly obsolescent, technologies are marshaled, along with new savings, to finance the production of capital assets that almost always embody cutting-edge technologies. Workers migrate with the capital. This is the process by which wealth is created, incremental step by incremental step. It presupposes a continuous churning of an economy in which the new displaces the old, a process that brings both progress and stress.  Disoriented by the quickened pace of today’s competition, some in our society look back with nostalgia to the seemingly more tranquil years of the early post-World War II period, when tariff walls were perceived as providing job security from imports. Were we to yield to such selective nostalgia and shut out a large part, or all, of imports of manufactured goods and produce them ourselves, our overall standards of living would fall. In today’s flexible markets, our large, but finite, capital and labor resources are generally employed most effectively. Any diversion of resources from the market-guided activities would, of necessity, engender a less productive mix.  BIS Review 57/2003 1 
For the most part, we as a nation have not engaged in significant and widespread protectionism for more than five decades. The consequences of moving in that direction in today’s far more globalized financial world could be unexpectedly destabilizing. A likely fall in wage incomes and profits could lead, ironically, to a fall in jobs and job security in the shorter term. So, yes, we can shut out part or all foreign competition, but we would pay a price for doing so - perhaps a rather large price.  * * * I do not doubt that the vast majority of us would prefer to work in a less stressful, less competitive environment. Yet, in our roles as consumers, we seem to relentlessly seek the low product prices and high quality that are prominent features of our current frenetic economic structure. In particular, America’s discount retailers have responded by learning to profit as intermediaries between consumers and low-cost producers, whether located in Guangdong province in China or Peoria, Illinois.  Retailers who do not choose their suppliers with price and quality uppermost in mind risk finding themselves in liquidation. If a producer can offer quality at a lower price than the competition, retailers are pressed to respond because the consumer will otherwise shop at the retailer who does. Retailers are afforded little leeway in product sourcing.  If consumers are stern taskmasters of their marketplace, business purchasers of capital equipment and production materials inputs have taken the competitive paradigm a step further and applied it on a global scale. Understandably, as a consequence, trade discussions under the aegis of the World Trade Organization have become increasingly contentious. After four decades of more or less successful negotiations, the “low-hanging trade agreement fruit,” so to speak, has already been picked. Current trade negotiators, accordingly, now must grapple with the remaining, more difficult issues, such as intellectual property rights and agricultural subsidies. Debates over trade restrictions have understandably become far more confrontational than in earlier years.  For example, a strain of so-called conventional wisdom has attributed the weak labor market in the United States to the widening trade deficit, and a loss of jobs since the beginning of the recession of 2001 to low-priced competition from abroad (often deemed “unfair”) and increased foreign outsourcing on the part of corporate America. In fact, as Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Greg Mankiw recently pointed out, U.S. “job losses are ... more closely related to declines in domestic investment and weak exports than to import competition.”1 In addition, of course, increased productivity has enabled ongoing demand to be met with fewer workers.  Noteworthy is the singling out of a particular exchange rate, the Chinese renminbi, as a significant cause of American job loss. The renminbi is widely believed to be markedly undervalued, and it is claimed that a rise in the renminbi will slow exports from China to the United States, which according to some, will create increased job opportunities for Americans at home.  The story on trade and jobs, in my judgment, is a bit more complex, especially with respect to China, than this strain of conventional wisdom would lead one to believe. If the renminbi were to rise, presumably U.S. imports from China would fall as China loses competitive position to other low-wage economies. But would, for example, reduced imports of textiles from China induce increased output in American factories? Far more likely is that our imports from other low-wage countries would replace Chinese textiles.  Despite the very large surplus of China’s trade with the United States, overall Chinese trade is much closer to balance. Chinese exports, a majority of which are from foreign-owned firms or affiliates, many American, depend on purchases from East Asian companies that supply inputs to the products the Chinese sell to the United States and elsewhere. Emerging Asia used to manufacture many goods that were then directly exported to the United States. However, a growing fraction of these goods are now partially assembled with capital-intensive, high-value-added manufacturing in the rest of emerging Asia; exported to China, where final processing is done - typically with labor-intensive, lower-value-added manufacturing; and then exported to the United States. This situation implies a deterioration in the Chinese trade balance with the rest of emerging Asia, along with a growing surplus with the United States. In large part, the increase in China’s share of U.S. imports has come at the expense of other East Asian exporters.                                                        1  Statement to the Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives, October 30, 2003. 2 BIS Review 57/2003 
China’s imports overall have risen dramatically over this year, from approximately $25 billion per month a year ago to $33 billion per month more recently, as China has become a major consumer of the world’s commodities. Doubtless, part of the recent firmness in non-high-tech commodity prices is attributable to China’s voracious appetite for raw materials.  * * * A rise in the value of the renminbi would be unlikely to have much, if any, effect on aggregate employment in the United States, but a misaligned Chinese currency, if that is indeed the case, could have adverse effects on the global financial market and, hence, indirectly on U.S. output and jobs.  In order to maintain the tight relationship with the dollar initiated in the 1990s, the Chinese central bank has had to purchase large quantities of U.S. Treasury securities with renminbi. What is not clear is how much of the unquestioned current upward pressure on the renminbi results from underlying market forces, how much from capital inflows due to speculation on potential revaluation, and how much from capital controls that suppress Chinese residents’ demand for dollars.  No one truly knows whether easing or ending of capital controls would ease pressure on the currency without central bank intervention and, in the process, also eliminate inflows from speculation on a revaluation. Many in China, however, fear that an immediate ending of controls could induce capital outflows large enough to destabilize the nation’s fragile banking system. Others believe that decontrol, but at a gradual pace, could conceivably temper such concerns.  Central bank purchases of dollars, unless offset, threaten an excess of so-called high-powered money expansion and consequent overheating of the Chinese economy. The Chinese central bank this year has indeed offset, that is, sterilized, much of its heavy dollar purchases by reducing its loans to commercial banks, by selling bonds, and by increasing reserve requirements. But currency and commercial bank reserves have been rising enough to support a growth of the money supply well in excess of a 20 percent annual rate so far this year. Should this pattern continue, the central bank will be confronted with the choice of an overheated economy, with its potential recessionary consequences, or a curtailing of dollar asset purchases. The latter presumably would allow the renminbi to appreciate against the dollar.  China has become an important addition to the global trading system. A prosperous China will bring substantial positive benefits to the rest of the trading world. It is, thus, important to all of us that they succeed in navigating through their current economic and financial imbalances.  * * * The challenges represented by China’s large surplus with the United States and the efforts to repair a recent breach in the current round of trade negotiations have engaged the attention of policymakers worldwide. But these are subplots in a much larger debate about the benefits and costs of expanding globalization.  At the risk of oversimplification, I would separate the parties in that debate into three groups. First, there are those who believe that relatively unfettered capitalism is the only economic organization consistent with individual and political freedom. In a second group are those who accept capitalism as the only practical means to achieve higher standards of living but who are disturbed by the seeming incivility of many market practices and outcomes. In very broad terms, the prevalence with which one encounters allegations of incivility defines an important difference in economic views that distinguishes the United States from continental Europe - two peoples having deeply similar roots in political freedom and democracy.  A more pronounced distinction separates both of these groups from a third group, which views societal organization based on the profit motive and corporate culture as fundamentally immoral.  This group questions, in particular, whether the distribution of wealth that results from greater economic interactions among countries is, in some sense, “fair.” Here terms such as “exploitation,” “subversion of democratic choice,” and other value-charged notions dominate the debate. These terms too often substitute for a rigorous discussion of the difficult tradeoffs that we confront in advancing the economic welfare of our nations. Such an antipathy to “corporate culture” has sent tens of thousands into the streets to protest what they see as “exploitive capitalism” in its most visible form - the increased globalization of our economies.  As solutions to these alleged failures of globalization, dissidents frequently appear to favor politically imposed systems, employing the power of the state to override the outcomes arrived at through BIS Review 57/2003 3 
4 BIS Review 57/2003 voluntary exchange. The historical record of such approaches does not offer much encouragement. One would be hard pressed to cite examples of free and prosperous societies that suppressed the marketplace.  * * * Setting aside the arguments of the protesters, even among those committed to market-oriented economies, important differences remain about capitalism and the role of globalization. These differences are captured most clearly for me in a soliloquy attributed to a prominent European leader several years ago. He asked, “What is the market? It is the law of the jungle, the law of nature. And what is civilization? It is the struggle against nature.” While acknowledging the ability of competition to promote growth, many such observers, nonetheless, remain concerned that economic actors, to achieve that growth, are required to behave in a manner governed by the law of the jungle.  In contrast to these skeptical views, others argue for the ethical merits of market-driven outcomes posited on the value preferences of individuals as reflected in their choices in a free marketplace. The ultimate arbiter of an economy’s ethics is, or should be, the material welfare of the individuals in a society. The crux of the largely laissez-faire argument is that, because unencumbered competitive markets reflect the value preferences of consumers, the resulting price signals direct a nation’s savings into those capital assets that maximize the production of goods and services most valued by consumers. Wages, profits, and other sources of income are determined, for the most part, by how successfully the participants in an economy contribute to the welfare of consumers.  Clearly not all activities undertaken in markets are civil. Many, though legal, are decidedly unsavory. Violation of law and breaches of trust do undermine the efficiency of markets. But the legal foundations and the discipline of the marketplace are sufficiently rooted in a rule of law to limit these aberrations. It is instructive that despite the egregious breaches of trust in recent years by a number of the nation’s business and financial leaders, productivity, an important metric of corporate efficiency, has accelerated.  On net, vigorous economic competition over the years has produced a significant rise in the quality of life for the vast majority of the population in market-oriented economies, including those at the bottom of the income distribution.  The highly competitive free market paradigm, however, is viewed by many at the other end of the philosophical spectrum as obsessively materialistic and largely lacking in meaningful cultural values. This view gained adherents with the recent uncovering of much scandalous business behavior during the boom years of the 1990s.  But is there a simple tradeoff between civil conduct, as defined by those who find raw competitive behavior demeaning, and the quality of material life they, nonetheless, seek? It is not obvious that such a tradeoff exists in any meaningful sense when viewed from a longer-term perspective.  During the past century, for example, economic growth created resources far in excess of those required to maintain subsistence. That surplus in democratic capitalist societies has been, in large measure, employed to improve the quality of life along many dimensions. To cite a short list: (1) greater longevity, owing first to the widespread development of clean, potable water and later to rapid advances in medical technology; (2) a universal system of education that enabled greatly increased social mobility; (3) vastly improved conditions of work; and (4) the ability to enhance our environment by setting aside natural resources rather than having to employ them to sustain a minimum level of subsistence. At a fundamental level, Americans have used the substantial increases in wealth generated by our market-driven economy to purchase what many would view as greater civility.  * * * Debates on the pros and cons of market capitalism have waged for generations. The collapse of the Soviet empire, and with it central planning, has left market capitalism as the principal, but not universally revered, model of economic organization.  The vigorous debates on how economies should be organized and by what rules individuals’ trading should be governed surfaced most prominently in the latter part of the eighteenth century. Those debates appear destined to continue through the twenty-first century and presumably beyond.  
Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Concerns and considerations for the practical implementation of the New Basel Accord  Remarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the ICBI Risk Management 2003 Conference, Geneva, Switzerland, 2 December 2003. *      *      * I am pleased to participate in this conference on such an important subject as the proposed new Basel Accord. Your topical agenda and the expertise of your speakers are impressive, and I am sure that the discussions will provide new insights.  I have been asked to talk today about some of the issues associated with the practical implementation of Basel II. Before I start, let me reiterate that I remain optimistic that a new accord will emerge from the Basel Committee in a timely fashion, so that national review procedures can go forward. Although I will discuss concerns and considerations, these will not, in my judgment, threaten the basic momentum of the process.  Basel I  There is no better place to begin a discussion of some of the practical concerns and considerations of the new accord than at the beginning - with Basel I. Many have forgotten that the first accord had its origins in complaints that the globalization of banking had distorted competitive balance. Banks domiciled in jurisdictions whose supervisors required a more prudent level of capital perceived that they were disadvantaged, certainly in their home markets, by banks whose home supervisors were less aggressive in their minimum capital standards. Basel I was intended to level the playing field for banks that operated across national boundaries by establishing consistent standards on how minimum regulatory capital was to be determined in individual countries and what was to constitute capital.  We should not lose sight of the continuing imperative, both economic and political, to ensure that a revised accord is perceived by all to maintain a level playing field for banks operating not only across national boundaries but also domestically. I will return to this issue later.  Basel I - on which the world’s regulatory capital regime has been based for more than ten years - was a genuine step forward for most countries’ capital rules and a watershed for international cooperation among the world’s supervisors. But it is certainly clear to those of you at this meeting that globalization, technology, and innovation have accelerated so dramatically that Basel I cannot provide the industrial world’s largest and most-complex banking organizations with a regulatory capital requirement that reflects their underlying risk exposures. Basel I, with its modest risk sensitivity, treats most loans as if they come from one quality category. It ignores techniques that the largest banks have adopted to mitigate risk. It erroneously treats some transactions that only appear to reduce risk as if they in fact do. Its overly simple risk weights induce large banks to game the rules by shifting to the market those exposures that the market judges require less capital than the regulations do and by retaining exposures with a regulatory capital charge that is lower than the market perceives is necessary. Such capital arbitrage has greatly reduced the usefulness of regulatory capital ratios at the largest banks and provides little useful information to the public or the supervisor. For these institutions, the regulatory rules must be changed. This is the practical reality that bank supervisors face.  Change and Complexity, Flexibility and Comparability  This audience is well aware of the reality that I have just described. But a second practical problem is that no one likes change, at least change imposed on them. Change can be expensive and, worse, requires new constructs that have the potential for unintended implications. For this reason, more than any other, the development of Basel II has taken a long time. Not only are the issues complicated, but also the banks and their supervisors have engaged in a continuing conversation about this complexity and its implications. Both parties have shared a common goal of trying to develop a cost-efficient and workable system. On occasion they have differed on the tradeoffs between cost and complexity and between comparability and flexibility.  BIS Review 56/2003 1 
Another practical problem is that the world’s supervisors are trying to do more than develop a better risk-based capital standard. They are also trying to harness modern risk-measurement and risk management techniques to the regulatory system, and they are trying to construct a framework that can evolve as the science and the art of risk measurement and management evolve. I have previously called this evolutionary potential of Basel II its “evergreen” element, and I believe it is one of the many attractive features of the proposal.  Modern asset-pricing theory may have begun in academia, but its growth and application have quickly taken root in money, capital, and banking markets in new ways of thinking about risk, ways that essentially meant measuring risk in quantifiable ways. The largest banks, operating in multiple product and geographic markets, simply could not operate without applying the new evolving principles in measuring, shifting, and managing their risks.  Several implications follow. Harnessing large banks’ internal practices to the supervisory process implies that supervisors could use such cutting-edge risk measures to evaluate bank risk profiles and relate them to a truly risk-sensitive capital standard. It also suggests that a bank’s adoption of best-practice risk measurement and management could be used as a supervisor-imposed prerequisite for the application of the new capital standard; setting such a prerequisite would accelerate the development and adoption of these new techniques, which counterparties are increasingly demanding in any event. Stating the point more directly: Basel II is designed to harness the best new techniques but also to ensure their application by those banks that have been less aggressive in adopting them. That is, Basel II, at least in its more advanced form, is as much a proposal for strengthening risk management as it is a proposal for improving capital standards; these considerations are, as they should be, inseparable. That inseparability, in turn, as I will discuss later, is an important factor leading to the bifurcated application of Basel II proposed in the United States.  The use of the more advanced techniques does not go far enough for those sophisticated organizations that want to use their own models to estimate their own risk functions, particularly their estimates of portfolio correlation effects. Some are also concerned that the hard-wired risk functions and correlation parameters will prohibit better practices when they are available.  In my view, a full models regime could not, over the planning period for Basel II, produce capital charges that would be sufficiently comparable for a regulatory capital standard. Specifically, determinations of portfolio correlation effects tend to be as much art as science; and their subjectivity makes them difficult, if not impossible, to validate credibly. To ensure broad comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banks, therefore, the risk functions embedded in the internal risk-based (IRB) framework employ correlation parameters that are specified by the Basel Committee. In effect, we have sacrificed some flexibility and potential risk sensitivity for greater comparability. We have faced similar tradeoffs repeatedly during the development of the Basel II proposals, and in many ways one of the Basel Committee’s greatest challenges has been reaching consensus on the right balance between flexibility and comparability.  In addition, there is evidence that credit risk models at many large, complex banking organizations have not attained the sophistication and robustness that would be consistent with their use for regulatory capital. Although the state of the art is progressing rapidly, many banks still must resolve some fundamental questions and finish compiling sufficient data before they can adopt their own full credit models that produce reliable and accurate results.  Ultimately, Basel II proposes a capital standard that implies the need for reasonable comparability across banks and across boundaries to ensure the competitive balance to which I referred earlier. Nonetheless, looking beyond the current proposals, I believe that over time the regulatory capital functions we have hard-wired into Basel II, along with their embedded correlation assumptions, will give way to individual bank-developed models that are verifiable by supervisors. That development will probably be a central part of the evergreen process. But the time for individual bank models is not now, and I see no reason to hold up improving the regulatory capital regime until the state of the art permits that innovation. Until then, I think we have developed a workable balance between flexibility and comparability. As the old saying goes, the perfect should not be the enemy of the good.  Level Playing Fields: Treating Comparable Banks Comparably  Basel II, as I noted, tries to develop a standard so that banks’ risk exposures can be treated comparably. Such a standard is central to the required level playing field. But comparability requires not that all banks be treated the same but rather that comparable banks be treated comparably, 2 BIS Review 56/2003 
raising practical issues of definition, of unintended consequences in competitive markets, and of unavoidable differences in national regimes.  General Issues. As you know, Basel II proposes three options from which banks in national jurisdictions may choose - the standardized, the foundation, and the advanced internal risk-based (A-IRB) approaches. The increasing risk sensitivity of the three options has the potential for the application of different capital charges across banks for the same exposures and implies that banks with a more or less average mix of corporate and retail exposures may have reductions in their overall minimum regulatory capital requirements as they move across the three options. Any differences in regulatory capital charges have the potential to distort both national competitive positions, an issue for domestic authorities, and international competition, an issue for both national authorities and the Basel Committee.  In considering all of these issues, one must, of course, make a distinction among minimum regulatory capital based on regulatory rules; economic capital based on the bank’s own assessment of risk and capital needs; and actual capital held, which includes buffers above both the other capital measures for reasons varying from reduced cost of funding to counterparty demands and to desired contingency flexibility. Minimum regulatory capital is the lowest of the three capital “requirements,” and thus the degree to which it may or may not affect competition across banks is an important conceptual and practical issue involving, at bottom, the way the price of credit gets determined.  When all is said and done, the nations participating in the Basel Committee are now developing a proposal to establish a revised capital standard for banking organizations that compete across national boundaries. Basel I was negotiated on the same basis. After Basel I, all the participating nations nevertheless chose to apply the new standard to all the banking organizations under their jurisdiction. The Europeans and the Japanese apparently have made the same decision for the proposed Basel II. In contrast to Basel I, however, all banking organizations will be subject to Basel II, but each organization will choose among the three variants.  Application in the United States. The U.S. authorities have made a somewhat different decision. Consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Basel II proposal, the latest U.S. proposal states that all U.S. banking organizations with meaningful cross-border exposures - at least $10 billion - will be required to adopt Basel II. In addition, any banking organization with consolidated assets of at least $250 billion will similarly be required to adopt Basel II. If these criteria were applied today, about ten or so U.S. entities would meet one or both of these criteria and hence would be among the “core” group of U.S. banking organizations required to adopt Basel II. To be sure, the actual number of mandatory U.S. banks may change before actual implementation - and among them could be U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banking organizations that meet the core bank standards. In addition, we initially assumed that about ten other large entities might choose to opt in to Basel II; we now believe that number may well be an underestimate, but we are still in the process of surveying our larger banks to determine their plans.  Even the twenty banks counted currently as mandatory and opt-in would account, we estimate, for more than 99 percent of the foreign exposure of U.S. chartered banks and more than two-thirds of the domestic assets of these entities.  Any non-mandatory bank in the United States that can estimate the internal risk parameters for its credit exposures - that is, measure and manage its risk exposure to the satisfaction of the supervisor - may opt in to Basel II in the United States. But if a bank chooses not to meet this test or not to adopt Basel II, it will remain under the current, unchanged, capital regime.  Banks that are required or that choose to adopt the Basel II rules in the United States will have only one option: the A-IRB approach for credit risk and the advanced measurement approach (AMA) for operational risk. Neither the standardized and foundation approaches for credit risk nor the basic indicator and standardized approaches for operational risk will be available in the United States.  The authorities in the United States proposed the bifurcated application of Basel II (with one group under Basel II and most banks remaining under the current capital requirements) and rejected the trifurcated approach (with banks choosing for themselves among the three Basel II variants for credit risk, as well as three variants for operational risk), which looks to be preferred in other countries, for three basic reasons. First, Basel II, as I noted, requires that those adopting it apply it to their internationally active banks. The data to which I referred are evidence that the U.S. framework for applying Basel II would meet that test. Second, as I also noted earlier, Basel II capital requirements are intended not only to be more sensitive to risk but also to link that risk-sensitivity to a significant BIS Review 56/2003 3 
increase in the standards for risk measurement and management at larger banks. Only the A-IRB and the AMA approaches fully impose that prerequisite on the large entities. The U.S. authorities believe that the largest U.S. banking organizations should adopt best-practice risk measurement and management for reasons of safety and soundness. Third, Basel II is not without cost. Most of the thousands of U.S. banks that are neither in the core set nor in the likely opt-in set have operations that, in the U.S. authorities’ view, would not require the dramatic changes in credit risk measurement and management associated with either the A-IRB or the foundation approach. Additionally, the increased risk sensitivity of the standardized version seemed modest to us relative to the additional costs of system changes. Regarding operational risk, the arguments are even stronger that the AMA would impose undue burden on smaller banks. In short, Basel II does not seem to have a favorable cost-benefit ratio for most American banks.  The decision that most banks would remain under the current regime in the United States was also conditioned on some institutional facts that were perhaps not well known elsewhere. Minimum Basel I requirements are not the only capital regulations in the United States. They are supplemented by benefits established by statute for banks with higher tier 1 and tier 2 capital ratios and by legislatively imposed minimum tier 1 leverage ratios. In addition, statutory prompt corrective action has induced banks to carry buffer capital to avoid losing regulatory benefits that come with holding capital above regulatory minimums. Moreover, the market demands that our thousands of smaller banks hold substantial equity capital, an amount significantly above the minimum standards. Nearly 95 percent of U.S. small and medium-sized banks have capital ratios in excess of 10 percent and most likely would not be required to hold more under Basel II. U.S. supervision of these banks already includes substantial Pillar 2 elements, and of course, these banks operate almost totally within the United States.  The arguments that banks other than core banks, and especially the small and medium-sized banks, ought to be free to choose between Basel II and their current regulatory requirements seemed overwhelmingly convincing to us. That is, banks should be free to choose to bear the costs of implementation for the benefits of greater capital risk-sensitivity. Neither for international agreement nor for domestic supervisory reasons did imposing Basel II on all U.S. banks seem reasonable. But for international agreements and for domestic supervisory reasons it seems only reasonable for us to require nothing less than A-IRB and AMA for those banks that adopt Basel II.  Unintended Consequences and Competitive Distortions. Having made our bifurcated proposal in the United States, public comments and congressional oversight have made clear the purely domestic concern that banks remaining under the current regime, even though they avoid the costs of adoption, may be disadvantaged relative to Basel II banks. Specifically, the argument goes, Basel II will give the largest banks, if not a lower overall capital requirement, then lower capital charges on certain credits with which banks not adopting Basel II will have to compete. Focus has been placed on residential mortgages, small business loans, and credit cards. Concern has also been voiced that Basel II banks will use any newly created excess regulatory capital to acquire smaller banks, whose capital can be used more efficiently by the larger Basel II banks. In short, creating international competitive balance under Basel II carries the potential that domestic competitive balance will become distorted.  At bottom, these concerns raise empirical questions about how credit is priced, about the locus of competition, about the determinants of actual capital held, and about other matters. Questions have been raised in the comment and oversight process and these questions will have to be addressed. We are still reviewing the evidence presented to us, and Federal Reserve staff members are conducting empirical research on the issues that will be made public in the months ahead. We will need to review the available options for addressing any of these concerns that are supported by the evidence. These options include changes in U.S. Basel II rules, where national discretion is allowed; modifications to the proposed bifurcated application; and changes in the current capital regime in the United States. We will look seriously at each and all of these steps and will not be precluded from proposing any measure that we believe is necessary to ensure a level playing field in our domestic banking market. But first, as I noted, we must examine the evidence, just as other nations are undoubtedly reviewing the unintended consequences of a trifurcated application in their own markets.  Even though the objective is a level playing field internationally, the practical problem that differing supervisory regimes and procedures may distort international competitive positions remains. Frankly, the U.S. authorities hear arguments that some foreign supervisors have neither the resources nor the experience to apply the rules as rigorously as they anticipate will be the case in the United States. And foreign authorities have heard complaints from their banks about the competitive implications that will 4 BIS Review 56/2003 
be created by U.S. insistence on A-IRB and AMA treatment for their large U.S. subsidiaries that meet the cross-border or scale criteria to be core banks.  Real and perceived differential treatment existed under Basel I, and it will remain under Basel II. However, the Accord Implementation Group (AIG) in Basel, made up of line supervisors from member countries, has already had some success in trying to ensure similar - or at least consistent - treatments across national boundaries under the new proposal. Tensions in applications by different national authorities are a fact of life that we have to address when we can. The test is whether we will be better off and whether competition will be fairer under Basel II even though it is not perfect.  Level Playing Fields: Home and Host Issues  As I just said, treating comparable banks comparably within a national jurisdiction may have unintended consequences for foreign banks. U.S. subsidiary banks owned by foreign parent organizations will be subject to the same criteria as those for mandatory A-IRB banks in the United States. Others may feel it desirable to opt in to such versions for their U.S. operations. Such national treatment in the host country - treating comparable banks comparably - is reasonable, but it may create genuine operational complexities if these banks plan to use one of the other Basel II options in their home or in third countries.  For their part, the U.S. authorities have clearly stated that they will be flexible during a transition period so that the relevant foreign banks can more easily meet the required standards, but national treatment policies will apply. Discussions within the AIG on this issue - as well as bilateral discussions with affected banks and their supervisors - have been productive, and I think the associated problems will be addressed.  However, one issue appears to be particularly difficult in more than one jurisdiction: the allocation of capital for operational risk among the legal entities within and across jurisdictions. Problems do not come more practical than this. Operational risk is generally measured on a consolidated basis, often by business line. That diversification benefits exist on a consolidated basis suggests that operational risk estimated from the bottom up - by, say, legal entity - would not only be more difficult but might well add up to more than the total from the top down. The problem is only made more complicated by the understandable focus of supervisors in each jurisdiction on ensuring that the entities under their supervision are sufficiently capitalized to absorb risk. We have come a long way in global banking, with deference to home consolidated supervisors, but the legal entity supervisor still needs the assurance that capital is protecting risk in the individual unit.  Basel II is not going to succeed or fail on this practical problem or on similar problems - and this will certainly not be the last. Through the AIG a compromise will be developed on the issue of operational risk capital to ensure that capital is sufficient and is allocated in a reasonable way. Other issues, including home-host tensions, will be resolved in similar ways as the member countries hear comments, conduct analysis, and then seek out a viable compromise solution.  The Process  The practical give and take of discussions is exactly how the first and now the second capital accord have been and will be developed. We are at a critical stage of that process with changes in significant provisions being studied and modified. Examples are the shift in standard to unexpected loss only and the review of securitization, credit card, and credit risk mitigation, all of which are now being actively studied.  It may seem strange that this far into the process - approaching year six - that such changes are being made. These changes, however, show how seriously the Basel Committee and its participating national authorities regard the public comment process and benefit from the analysis of bankers and other interested parties. When analysis and evidence were put forward, the committee responded.  The United States is considerably through its review of public comments on its own advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR), and other countries are going through their own process of translating a consensus proposal into rules. The processes in the United States and in other nations may well bring up further proposals for change, provided that supportable arguments are forthcoming.  In the United States, after this next round of committee discussions, additional procedural steps still are required, with opportunity for comment at each stage, before a final rule is in place. To be clear, BIS Review 56/2003 5 
6 BIS Review 56/2003 the need for more procedural steps in the United States should not be taken as an indication of a lack of commitment to the Basel process. Rather, it is a sign of our attempt to develop these proposals on as transparent a basis as possible and to hear a wide range of comments. The Congress of the United States has also held hearings on the development of the new accord. The interest and oversight by our Congress in these discussions is appropriate and welcome, particularly for an undertaking as extensive as Basel II. The U.S. regulators appreciate the fact that we are able to operate as independent agencies but also realize that we have an obligation to keep the elected representatives informed of our progress in this major effort. Of course, it is expected that other countries and the European Union will be following their own procedures as well.  Overall, I have been impressed by the efficacy of the comment process and believe it offers an open forum for all parties to voice their opinions. Debate and discussion on such an important undertaking are essential, and they provide an opportunity for enhancements to the final product. The current proposal is better because the comments have elicited good ideas that have been seriously considered.  At the same time, we do need to ensure that momentum is maintained. In October, the committee members committed to work promptly to resolve outstanding issues by mid-2004. In January, the Basel Committee will meet to address further analysis of outstanding issues and review the timetable for completing and implementing the committee’s work on the accord. Using the agreement reached in the committee as a template, U.S. supervisors then plan to conduct another Quantitative Impact Study (QIS) to gauge more clearly the effect of the Basel proposals. We believe that we must carefully test the new proposal to determine its effects on individual institutions and to ascertain the need to fine-tune the proposal further, a process that could include recalibrating some of the risk-weight functions. Our sense is that other countries will be doing the same. Because timing is a function of the degree of changes required by the QIS, the U.S. agencies will then conduct a full notice of proposed rulemaking once again to seek and then evaluate public comments before adopting a final rule.  Conclusions  Basel I is no longer a viable supervisory tool for the large, complex banking organizations of the industrial world and needs to be replaced as soon as feasible by a new capital accord. The proposal being developed at Basel builds on best-practice risk- measurement and risk-management techniques and, at least in its advanced versions, is as much about ensuring that banks use such techniques as it is about a more risk-sensitive capital approach. Indeed, these considerations are two sides of the same coin.  Any complex change will induce opposition and concern, in part because of fear of change and comfort with the known rules, in part because of preference for other alternatives by those affected, and in part because of anxiety that it may upset current competitive positions. But Basel II builds upon modern techniques and is entirely consistent with the directions that both large banks and their counterparties are now moving. And it can use future advances to evolve into an even more flexible and sophisticated supervisory tool.  Basel I and the proposed Basel II are designed to provide a level competitive playing field for banking organizations meeting in international competition. And though proposed application procedures - both the bifurcated approach in the United States and the trifurcated approach in other countries - by and large maintain that objective, they may have the unintended consequence of distorting domestic competitive equity. The empirical analysis on whether they will, especially when banks maintain capital well in excess of regulatory minimums, is yet to be completed, but the authorities are required to investigate these concerns and adjust the proposal if the analysis requires it.  Tensions in cross-border applications exist and cannot be avoided in a world of national regulatory authorities, especially where separate legal entities exist within national jurisdictions that apply national treatment. The AIG has been successful so far in smoothing differences that may develop in cross-border application, but these will inevitably involve compromises on difficult issues.  
Bodil Nyboe Andersen: Recent financial and economic developments in Denmark Speech by Mrs Bodil Nyboe Andersen, Governor of the National Bank of Denmark, at the Annual Meeting of the Danish Bankers Association, Copenhagen, 3 December 2003.  *      *      * For twenty years the fixed-exchange-rate policy has been a cornerstone of economic policy in Denmark. It has won widespread acceptance from business, organisations, political players and the media. At the beginning of the 1980s, the Danish economy was caught in a vicious circle with high inflation, frequent devaluations and long-term interest rates at around twenty per cent. We had to break this circle and did it by getting public finances into shape, abolishing the cost-of-living adjustment and implementing a consistent fixed-exchange-rate policy. Later in the 1980s, a tax reform was introduced to limit the interest-deduction entitlement. These structural reforms were the basis for the stability-oriented economic policy pursued ever since. It has served Denmark well, and a virtuous circle has replaced the vicious circle. Danes do not question the value of the fixed-exchange-rate policy, but analysts in other countries sometimes perceive it as old-fashioned. Fixed-exchange-rate regimes are often the target of criticism and warnings in reports from international organisations and not least in academic literature. The general view in Denmark is that the fixed-exchange-rate regime has provided for very smooth sailing. Nevertheless, the two main points of criticism generally raised against fixed-exchange-rate regimes merit a closer look. The first point of criticism is that as history has shown, a fixed-exchange-rate policy is difficult to maintain because of its vulnerability to speculative attacks. It may be especially difficult to resist speculation being built up in anticipation of a devaluation of a currency. Globally, there are several examples of how speculative attacks have caused a fixed-exchange-rate regime to collapse. The most famous example is the withdrawal of sterling from the European Monetary System in September 1992. At the beginning of the 1990s Finland and Sweden were also forced to float their currencies and thus to abandon the fixed-exchange-rate policy. Finland, however, reverted to the fixed-exchange-rate policy in 1996 in preparation for introduction of the euro. In the years since the early 1980s, Denmark has experienced a number of currency crises, but the fixed-exchange-rate policy has remained intact. The most recent speculation against the Danish krone took place more than five years ago, and Denmark’s fixed-exchange-rate policy today enjoys unique credibility in the market. The present central rate vis-à-vis the euro represents a conversion of the exchange rate between the D-mark and Danish krone fixed in January 1987. Why could we weather the storms despite all the arguments that the system is so vulnerable? The short reply is that we have taken great pains to follow the “rules of the game”. First, we have used monetary policy solely to stabilise the exchange rate - whether or not the necessary interest rate was appropriate in relation to the domestic economic situation. Monetary policy has been earmarked for exchange-rate stabilisation. Second, it is just as important that fiscal policy has “come through” - to use a modern expression. Fiscal policy has been responsible for ensuring stable and credible macroeconomic development in the medium term. Adjustments have been made primarily in connection with the annual Finance Acts. Nevertheless, in isolated cases specific measures were required. The latest example is the Whitsun package of economic measures in 1998. The other main point of criticism of fixed-exchange-rate regimes is that a flexible exchange rate is necessary to shield the economy from external shocks. The same argument is used against participation in a monetary union. The hypothesis is that a flexible exchange rate allows such external disruptions to be reflected in the exchange rate.  BIS Review 56/2003 1 
Following the EMS crises at the beginning of the 1990s, a number of those countries which had to give in to speculative pressure chose to let their currencies float. This enabled them to use monetary policy - i.e. the interest rate - to stabilise domestic demand and thus inflation. A new inflation-management model was introduced in monetary policy, the so-called inflation targeting model. New Zealand and Canada had already applied this approach for some time. However, it was the Bank of England and Sveriges Riksbank that primarily developed the principles of this policy in close cooperation with academia. Central banks applying inflation targeting aim at influencing the economy by solely using the interest rate to keep inflation two years ahead within a defined interval, typically 2 or 2½ per cent plus/minus 1 per cent. The interest-rate decisions are taken by a committee based on economic projections, model calculations and personal assessments.  The ECB has a clear objective of price stability which is interpreted as an inflation rate below but close to two per cent. The ECB’s interest-rate decision is also based on economic projections and on an analysis of key economic indicators. The decision-making process is, however, not formalised to the same extent as in Sweden and the UK, for example.  The Federal Reserve System has a broader economic objective where inflation not necessarily takes centre stage. In 2001 Norway implemented an inflation-targeting regime. This happened gradually after the phasing out of the fixed-exchange-rate policy. Denmark is presently the only Nordic country to pursue a fixed-exchange-rate policy, as Finland now participates in the euro area.  It is worth examining whether this has led to more unstable inflation and growth in Denmark and Finland in recent years than in Sweden and Norway, which both have floating-exchange-rate regimes. To this end Danmarks Nationalbank has compared the development in the four Nordic countries after 1996. The results are published in an article in our Monetary Review to be published on 4 December. The comparison shows the course of inflation measured as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, HICP, that is a general and comparable measure of price development. The message emerging from the comparison is that the variability in both inflation and output has clearly been lower in Denmark than in the other countries. It shows that our fixed-exchange-rate policy has not been an obstacle to stable economic development. This is contrary to economic theory about this subject. The article presents possible explanations of this apparent contradiction. One explanation is that in reality, stability is not jeopardised by external shocks, but rather by internal shocks in the form of inappropriate economic-policy changes. History is rich in examples of how the wrong economic policy can lead to instability. A recent example is the Netherlands. For a long time the country seemed to perform extremely well and was praised for its strong economy. From the end of the 1990s until two years ago, the Netherlands experienced very high growth, which drove up inflation.  As a consequence, government budgets tended to improve, of course. But the Netherlands did not let this trend prevail so that the automatic stabilisers of fiscal policy could work freely. Instead, they introduced a set of “ground rules” whereby savings on the expenditure side were used for payment of other, new expenses, while half the revenue improvement could be used to reduce taxes. At first sight these rules looked convincing, but they were clearly procyclical. When the reversal came, performance declined rapidly. This year, negative growth of 3/4 per cent is expected. At the same time the Netherlands has tightened fiscal policy considerably, including significant expenditure cuts. This also reflects a procyclical approach, but the Dutch want to keep the budget deficit below three per cent in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. If only all euro area member states were as determined as the Netherlands. This example shows how succumbing to relaxation of fiscal policy in good times can lead to highly unstable development. The consequences of activist fiscal policy may be entirely different from what was expected. 2 BIS Review 56/2003 
In Denmark, changing governments have been well aware of the risk that economic policy could go off course - precisely because of the potential vulnerability of the fixed-exchange-rate policy. Therefore, in Denmark more than in most other countries, the watchword has been “stability-oriented economic policy”. And everyone has accepted that monetary policy in itself could not contribute to domestic stabilisation, as it was earmarked for stabilisation of the exchange rate. As mentioned, this increases the responsibility imposed on fiscal policy. Fiscal-policy “activism” has been avoided, and a largely neutral fiscal policy has been pursued. The shocks of frequent fiscal-policy changes have thus been avoided. The internationalisation of the financial sector and the EU’s single market for financial services have been key issues for many years. Many rules and regulations have been made to facilitate this development. The primary purpose has been to create a level playing field. Another purpose has been to facilitate cross-border activities. All this has contributed to making the financial markets more open and competitive and giving customers the advantages of a large market. In reality, large financial corporations have a national affiliation even if they have foreign ownership. They are mainly in contact with national authorities such as a country’s financial supervisory authority, central bank, deposit guarantee scheme and ministries. However, developments in the Nordic banking market in recent years indicate that we may be headed for integration of a magnitude that will significantly change the national relations. This will make it more difficult for the authorities to observe the traditional national borders. One very specific field where this will be evident in practice is statistics, as it applies the concepts “domestic” and “foreign”. If a financial group operating in several countries brings together certain activities in one country, it may cause strange shifts in the statistical information, which by no means indicate underlying changes in the transactions conducted. The statistics may no longer present an accurate picture. Such restructuring within cross-border groups will require a new approach from the statistical authorities. It will also pose a new problem to the supervisory authorities if one or more of the largest financial institutions become branches of foreign banks.  The deposit guarantee schemes, too, are fundamentally national and thus difficult to adapt to comprehensive cross-border activities.  And what is the role of the central bank if a branch of a foreign bank is so large that it has systemic importance and perhaps even is the largest retail bank?  In Financial Stability, published by Danmarks Nationalbank in the spring, we summarised the problem as follows: “Where a branch is as large as or larger than the home-country entity, or a branch in an individual host country is so large that it has systemic importance and could affect the financial stability of the host country, very close collaboration should be established between the authorities across national borders, irrespective of the home-country supervision”.  These issues are discussed intensively by the authorities of the Nordic countries. In Danmarks Nationalbank’s analyses of financial stability we have focused increasingly on the Nordic groups.  In practical terms, the Nordic central banks have prepared a Memorandum of Understanding, which is available on our website. It describes the arrangements for cooperation in case of a financial crisis in a Nordic banking group with subsidiaries in several Nordic countries.  Financial integration has advanced further in the Nordic countries than in the rest of the EU. Some of the features currently observed in the Nordic countries are beginning to show in the EU as well, and they will tend to strengthen after the enlargement of the EU with ten new member states. Therefore, the Nordic countries are spurring discussion of these issues at EU level. And the other countries are indeed very interested in learning more about the Nordic experience. Internationalisation also has other aspects. So far, Danmarks Nationalbank has issued government bonds via the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, but trading in government bonds is no longer a predominantly national matter. Danish government bonds are sold in large numbers to international investors. BIS Review 56/2003 3 
4 BIS Review 56/2003 In recent years, the international trading platform MTS has become the standard for trading in European government bonds. MTS is now used by 12 EU member states, and the international investment banks are using the system. To obtain the best possible prices on Danish government bonds we have chosen to move issuance to MTS, whereby more international investment banks have become primary dealers and active players in the market for Danish government bonds. This has intensified competition and at the same time modernised the market for government bonds. In the 1980s, Denmark was one of the first countries to introduce the option of electronic stock-exchange trading. Nevertheless, government bonds were traded mainly over the phone up to the introduction of MTS in November. The trading platform is now electronic, and the quality of price information available during the day has increased considerably. To consider the interests of small investors, Danmarks Nationalbank has concluded a special agreement with a number of Danish banks on quoting prices for small trades on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. This agreement entered into force recently and has given small investors the possibility to have their trades in government bonds executed directly on the Stock Exchange. As mentioned, the EU has for many years facilitated progress towards financial integration in order to create a single market for financial services. Recent years have shown that this development is well underway. However, the EU cannot plan such a development. Financial integration is driven by the markets. It is up to the authorities to respond to this development and if necessary adapt the rules to facilitate it.  
David Dodge: Past adjustments and future trends in the Canadian economy Remarks by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the London Chamber of Commerce, London, Ontario, 8 December 2003. *      *      * Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I’m happy to have this opportunity to visit the Forest City and to finally honour your long-standing invitation to address you. When giving a speech near the end of a year, it is common practice to look back over the past 12 months, consider what we have learned from the events and experiences of the year, and think a bit about what might lie ahead. I became Governor of the Bank of Canada in 2001 and, since that time, I have found myself saying at the end of each year, “Well, we won’t see another year like that again.” In 2001, we saw the bursting of the tech bubble and the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Last year, we had the fallout from Enron and other examples of corporate malfeasance, as well as the growing threat of war in the Middle East. And our currency dropped to an all-time low against the U.S. dollar. Not to be outdone, 2003 has also had more than its share of momentous events that had an impact on the Canadian economy. The list seems almost Biblical: war, pestilence, in the form of SARS and mad-cow disease, fires, floods, a hurricane, and a power outage. This year also brought another type of shock to keep Canadians preoccupied, and that is the sharp rise of our currency in foreign exchange markets. The Canadian dollar has jumped from under 64 cents U.S. at the start of the year to over 76 cents at the end of last week - an unprecedented movement. The Bank of Canada has closely followed the economic effects of all these events, including the rapid movement of the Canadian dollar. But to better understand what has happened in the economy over the past year or so, I will place my comments in the context of longer-term economic trends.  The Adjustments of the 1990s Let me start by recalling the state of our economy as the 1990s began. Although inflation had come down from the very high levels seen in the early 1980s, it was still quite high by today’s standards. Several approaches had been tried to bring about an environment of low, stable, and predictable inflation. These included wage and price controls and the targeting of the money supply. But none of these methods provided a suitable medium-term anchor for inflation expectations. This made it difficult for individuals and businesses to form long-range plans with any degree of certainty. On the fiscal side, the picture was pretty grim at the start of the 1990s and getting worse. Public sector deficits would eventually peak at around 8 per cent of Canada’s GDP, and public debt levels were continuing to mount. Clearly, the situation was not sustainable. Adjustments were urgently needed. The first of these adjustments came in 1991, when the Bank and the Government of Canada agreed to adopt a series of explicit inflation-control targets. The agreement called for an inflation target-defined in terms of the annual rate of increase of the consumer price index - that descended gradually to 2 per cent, the midpoint of a 1 to 3 per cent range. That initial agreement has been extended three times, with the latest agreement covering the period to the end of 2006. In each case, the midpoint of the inflation-control target range has been kept at 2 per cent.  This framework has worked well - better than might have been expected. By January 1992, inflation was already close to 2 per cent, and from the end of 1994 to today, inflation has averaged almost exactly 2 per cent. Moreover, not only has inflation fallen, it has become more stable. Indeed, the trend of inflation - as measured by what we call core inflation - has stayed within the target range almost continuously for the past 10 years.  Just as importantly, we found that, after a few years of inflation targeting, the inflation expectations of Canadians fell into line with the 2 per cent target. And expectations have remained close to the target in recent years. The point of all this is that we have been successful in using monetary policy to create an economic environment of low, stable, and predictable inflation. With a credible monetary policy, the whole nature BIS Review 56/2003 1 
of the inflation process has changed. Inflation itself has become more stable and, in turn, this has led to a more stable and better-functioning economy. The second big adjustment began in earnest around the middle of the 1990s. As I said before, at that time, Canada was facing an unsustainable fiscal situation. Compounding this immediate fiscal problem were the looming challenges posed by our aging population. Spending had to be put on a viable long-term course, and the ratio of public debt to GDP on a steady downward track. By the middle of the decade, governments - federal and provincial - had begun to take the painful steps to balance their books and reduce their debt burdens. It did not take long for the benefits of those tough decisions to materialize. In most jurisdictions, the vicious circle of rising deficits and debts became a virtuous circle of balanced budgets and falling debt burdens. This fiscal adjustment helped Canada’s economic policy credibility and reduced the risk premium that investors demanded on Canadian government bonds. Not only did lower interest rates reduce debt-servicing costs, they stimulated economic growth, which brought in more revenues for governments.  The federal government recently announced a sixth consecutive surplus in its budget. Our public pension plans are once again on a sound footing. The federal debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen to about 44 per cent, from close to 70 per cent at its peak. The ratio of total government liabilities to GDP has declined from a peak of about 100 per cent to about 80 per cent, according to the OECD. And Canada’s Triple-A credit rating has been restored.  I don’t mean to suggest that inflation targeting and fiscal adjustments were the only factors behind Canada’s overall improved economic performance. Of equal importance was the difficult restructuring that had to be done in the wake of free-trade agreements in the 1990s. Businesses and employees made some difficult adjustments. None of this was easy, but it did leave Canada’s economy in a better position to grow sustainably and to handle economic shocks. Our economic record over the past few years, even in the face of all the events I have mentioned, is testament to that. Now, let me talk about the role of the Canadian dollar in this long adjustment process. On a day-to-day basis, there are a number of factors that can drive movements in the value of the Canadian dollar in foreign exchange markets. But my intention is to stick to a discussion of long-term trends. From this perspective, there were really two major factors at work on the currency in the 1990s. Governments were cutting spending to address their fiscal problems, and that led to a reduction in domestic demand. On top of this, commodity prices were down sharply in the second half of the decade. Historically, there has been a fairly strong correlation between the prices of non-energy commodities and the external value of the Canadian dollar. In the face of these two factors, Canada’s floating exchange rate did its job as a “shock absorber” for the economy. How? Given the tight fiscal policy of the time, the lower dollar - in the context of an easing in monetary policy - played an appropriate role in encouraging foreign demand for Canadian products at a time when domestic demand was weak.  Further, while the lower currency cushioned the shock of falling commodity prices on resource producers, it also boosted the profitability of other sectors that were able to expand in the wake of free-trade agreements and strong foreign demand. This helped to facilitate the transfer of resources within the economy from sectors that were shrinking to those that were growing.  The depreciating Canadian dollar of the 1990s also changed the relative price of labour and capital. At the time, there was a fair bit of excess labour in the economy, because of the structural adjustments that were taking place. The lower dollar raised the cost of machinery and equipment relative to labour. And that made it easier for some of the labour that was released by the shrinking sectors of the economy to be absorbed by those that were growing. Future Trends in the Economy That’s a quick look back at the 1990s. So what can we expect in the future? What are the major issues that we will have to grapple with in the coming decades? What adjustments will be needed?  I don’t have a crystal ball, but a couple of issues seem fairly clear to me. As I already mentioned, the first important issue is demographics. The Canadian economy must prepare for the retirement of the baby boomers. Under current projections, Canada’s working-age population - those 15 to 64 years of age - will start to decline in about 15 years.  2 BIS Review 56/2003 
Given this demographic outlook, there are two points to be made. The first is that we need to continue to lower our ratio of public debt to GDP. This will help to ensure that Canada will be able to support its growing elderly population.  The second point is that we will need to make adjustments to help us deal with a labour force that will soon be shrinking in relative terms and, ultimately, in absolute terms as well. What kinds of adjustments? We will need to make sure that the older segment of the working-age population is not discouraged from participating in the labour force. But more importantly, we need to raise productivity if Canadians are to continue to enjoy rising incomes. It will not be easy to get those productivity gains. We will need to see greater investment in new, improved machinery and equipment. We will need to see more and better application of information and communications technology. We will need to ensure that our workers have the skills and receive the training they require to take advantage of productivity-enhancing technology. And we will need to improve business organization and practices, to fully exploit the potential of new technologies, and to minimize any barriers to their application in the workplace.  Raising productivity will also require a major effort to ensure that our microeconomic policies facilitate innovation and higher productivity in both the private and public sectors in Canada.  In thinking about our macroeconomic policies, we can’t assume that all the shocks are behind us. We have seen the buildup of economic imbalances recently, with large current account surpluses in Asia and a large current account deficit in the United States. And fiscal imbalances are growing in Europe and the United States.  So how can the Bank of Canada help to prepare for the challenges ahead? Most importantly, we must stick with the monetary policy framework that we built in the 1990s. That means keeping our commitment to low, stable, and predictable inflation. And it means that our floating exchange rate will continue to be an important part of our monetary policy framework. This framework will continue to help the economy adjust to changing economic circumstances, both at home and abroad.  Of course, exchange rates don’t always move as smoothly as desired or expected. Still, let me repeat what I have said many times before: having a floating exchange rate to facilitate economic adjustments is by far the best option for the Canadian economy.  Recent Economic Developments Let me now turn to the current economic situation, starting with the outlook for inflation. As we noted in our October Monetary Policy Report, we expect that Canada’s inflation rate will fall over the next few months. The core rate of inflation - a measure that removes the eight most volatile components of the consumer price index - will likely move down close to the bottom of our 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control range early next year, before starting to move back up towards 2 per cent.  On the Bank’s latest fixed announcement date last week, we decided to leave our key policy rate unchanged. In doing so, we noted a few developments that have altered our outlook since we published the Monetary Policy Report. Let me review some of them.  At the end of November, Statistics Canada released its national accounts data for the third quarter. These data showed that Canada’s economy had grown at an annualized rate of just 1.1 per cent in the third quarter, a rate that was well below expectations. What’s more, there were downward revisions to growth in previous quarters. This meant that, at the end of the third quarter, there was more excess capacity in the Canadian economy than we had anticipated. In the Monetary Policy Report, we said that we expected the economy to close its output gap and return to its level of full capacity by early 2005. Closing the output gap over that period would be consistent with inflation returning to the 2 per cent target by mid-2005. But because we now know that the output gap is larger than we had expected in October, we also know that the economy will have to grow at a faster rate during the fourth quarter and through 2004 to close that output gap by early 2005.  While growth earlier this year was disappointing, we are now seeing a number of encouraging signs suggesting that stronger growth will resume, beginning in the current quarter. I will mention three of those signs. First, while the overall growth rate in the third quarter was just 1.1 per cent, it should be noted that this figure was depressed because businesses met demand in large part from inventories. Final domestic demand grew quite strongly - by close to 6 per cent - thanks to healthy household BIS Review 56/2003 3 
4 BIS Review 56/2003 spending and rising business investment. This investment bodes well for higher future production. And, with continuing employment growth, we expect household spending to remain robust.  Second, the reduction in inventory investment is probably over. While this adjustment depressed growth in the third quarter, it should not do so in the fourth quarter. In fact, the completion of the inventory correction should contribute to growth in the fourth quarter. Third, Canada’s export sector should receive a boost from rising foreign demand, in particular, from the United States. Remember that the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of about 8 per cent in the third quarter, and Canadian exporters should see some benefit from this and from the continuing strong growth expected in the U.S. economy over the months ahead. Rising non-energy commodity prices should also be a boost to the economy. All told, the Canadian economy should be poised for solid growth ahead, beginning in the fourth quarter. We would expect economic growth in this quarter to be well above 4 per cent on an annualized basis. However - and let me stress this - the effect of the recent sharp appreciation of the Canadian dollar is a major uncertainty at this time. It is not clear to what extent the increase in foreign demand I have just mentioned will be offset by the effects of a stronger currency. Nor can we be sure that there is enough monetary stimulus in the economy to support the increases in household spending and business investment that would be required to return the economy to full capacity by early 2005. Some important economic data are expected between now and our next fixed announcement date, on 20 January. These should give us a better sense of how Canada’s export sector is doing, and how household spending went over the holiday season. We will be closely watching all the data ahead for evidence that the economy is growing at a rate solidly above the growth of potential.  Conclusion This past year, like the two years before it, was full of “interesting” economic challenges for Canada and the world. It is tempting to hope that next year will be somewhat less “interesting” and bring fewer challenges. But regardless of what next year brings, what is critical is that we keep our eyes on the longer-term horizon and focus on the challenges ahead. These challenges include adapting to shifting demographics, raising productivity, and getting our microeconomic policy framework right. At the Bank of Canada, we remain committed to the sound monetary policy framework that will help us rise to tomorrow’s challenges. And that’s good news for all of us, no matter what the coming years may bring. 
Panayotis Thomopoulos: The financial environment in Southeast Europe Speech by Mr Panayotis Thomopoulos, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Greece, at the Second International Banking Forum for the Southeast European Markets Economist Conference, Athens, 4 December 2003. *      *      * It is a great pleasure to address this Banking Forum at this juncture as I believe that the economies are turning the corner and can now start enjoying the benefits of stability and growth within the framework of closer ties with the European Union. After a difficult and hesitant start in the 1990s, there is now clear evidence that the transition economies of Southeastern Europe have improved their macroeconomic management and enhanced their financial systems so that they can look forward to sustained and high-quality growth. Greece, as the only member of the European Union in the region, has a clear interest in promoting the stability and growth of all our neighbors, and I can be proud that both the public and the private sectors of Greece have played a role in the emerging success story of Southeastern Europe. We see our neighbors' economies mainly as complementary to our own, not as competitors, and the many Greek businesses that are active in the region, especially in the financial sector, are proof of the increasing collaboration between my country and its neighbors. I believe that Greece will continue to make a positive contribution to the economies of the region, but, I must admit, that I draw comfort from the fact that Greece is now surrounded by open, dynamic economies, and I would add friendly countries. It would be an understatement to say that we have turned a page of our history. In effect, the collapse of communism ended not the thirty, or hundred years wars, but more than one thousand years of intrabalkan conflicts and Greece is fully supporting Balkan countries' E.U. membership, which would further strengthen the political and economic ties between all Balkan countries. Let me start with a short look at the international environment that the countries in Southeastern Europe are facing. The overall economic situation has improved significantly during the last few months. After months when expectations of a recovery were based mostly on so-called "soft data," like surveys of consumer and business confidence, we are now seeing real "hard data" that point to the resumption of growth in all the main regions of the world economy. All members of the EU have now emerged from recession, although the growth rate is not what we would have wished it to be. Growth in the eurozone should accelerate slowly, and within the next year the growth rate should gradually approach its potential, estimated at around 2 ? % per annum. The US, on the other hand, is growing fast, maybe too fast. Certainly, I do not wish to belittle the achievements of the American economy, especially its high productivity growth, but the continuation of the twin deficits are certainly a cause for concern, in that a sudden correction could have far-reaching implications for the international financial system. The US sees with benign neglect its twin deficits. On the one hand, it expects that continuing fast rate of growth would generate sufficient tax revenues over the medium term, which, in combination with the gradual phasing out of some tax relief measures, will reduce the deficit and, on the other hand, they expect the current balanced of payments correction to be realized via a devaluation of the US dollar, which would help the sustainability of the US recovery and generate higher profits in dollar terms from the US investments abroad. In summary, they don't expect an abrupt and substantial rise in interest rates, which would have had adverse effects both on the fiscal deficit and on consumer demand, thus precipitating a cyclical downturn. However, the European point of view, if I am allowed to summarize, is that an unsustainably fast growth rate, based on private and public borrowing is not good for anyone and the US cannot be an exception. The EU, and especially the eurozone, has played a constructive role in promoting a stable financial environment. The recent appreciation of the euro is an indication of the markets' confidence in our economies. I believe that a strong euro is good for Europe and the world, as it helps fight inflationary pressures and supports the confidence of consumers and producers. It is also clear that the eurozone cannot solve all the imbalances that threaten the stability of the international economy. I do not wish to enter the debate on whether the fiscal stimulus in the US was necessary two years ago, at the onset of the economic slowdown, but certainly it has to be reversed now as the US is growing at an unsustainable rate. At the same time, third countries, especially those in Asia, should contribute themselves by allowing market forces to play a greater role in the determination of their exchange rate, and by abandoning their mercantilistic attitudes. However I should mention that, there is an open debate whether a revaluation of the chinese renminbi is at present appropriate, given, on the one BIS Review 55/2003 1 
hand, the fact that it will make relatively small difference, as far as it concerns China's trade surplus, if the chinese wage expressed in US dollars from about 10% of the US or EU average wage rises to 15% or 20% as a result of the revaluation, and on the other hand, a revaluation could lead to a deterioration of the already Chinese banks' fragile conditions and would also make more expensive the acquisitions of Chinese factories, commercial sites, etc by foreign investors. One positive development that I cannot stress enough is the absence of any challenges to the financial stability in Europe and the US. Unlike the situation in the early 1990s, we have recently gone through a period of a prolonged and synchronized slowdown, made worse by geopolitical risks, with no major financial institution being impaired. There have been of course problems, especially in the European insurance sector, exacerbated by natural catastrophes, but all financial institutions have managed through. Undoubtedly, those who make mistakes, or are simply unfortunate, suffer in a market economy. Nonetheless, such problems, whenever they surfaced, were contained and did not have systemic repercussions that could threaten the macroeconomic stability of our economies. Indeed, in our E.U. economies we have long recognized the key role of the banking sector and its health has been a constant preoccupation of the authorities, especially of Central banks which, even those not directly involved in supervision, have a wider responsibility for the good functioning of the financial system as a whole and the payment systems. We have been building sound banks, which not only can withstand successfully cyclical pressures and other kinds of shocks, but also they bring crucial support to the economy when failures appear in other, less important, parts of the financial system. The bursting of the stock exchange bubbles and the subsequent substantial decline in their capitalization, in certain countries amounting to as much as 30 to 50% of GDP, produced relatively little damage and which was, moreover, contained thanks to the banking sector. Likewise, as a result also of what I would say, the least, "not very prudent policies" the significant losses of insurance and re-insurance companies in the last few years have been partly absorbed by the banking sector, which responded promptly to their needs for liquidity and capital injections. The banking sector in some countries has unwillingly assumed the responsibility for the well being of the financial sector as a whole, because it understands the danger of systemic risks, that can wreak havoc. I cannot pretend that there were not tensions here and there, or losses due to the write-offs of non-performing loans, to plummeting share values and to laying off costs, but only a few banks posted operating losses and, moreover, those, as a rule, were relatively small. Even today, after three years of a downturn, the capital adequacy ratio, has remained well above the minimum 8% in almost all cases, and for the E.U. as a whole the average is above 10%, which underlines the good health of the banking system. Moreover, it is expected that it will continue to improve as the recovery gets underway. Here, I wish to repeat the very positive role of Central banks, which, almost all were over more than 50 years, and many of them still are the supervisory authorities. Indeed, central banks succeeded in creating a competitive and sound banking system in Europe during the last fifteen years or so, during a period characterized by liberalization in financial markets and intense competition both within Europe and from the US banks. The lesson I draw is that with the help of their natural interlocutor, the central banks, the private sector has become more adept in dealing with risks and the supervisors have learned from the mistakes of the past and improved their vigilance. Looking ahead, the new prudential practices to be introduced under Basel II will further improve our ability to deal with financial risks and better tailor our prudential requirements to each market's special needs. Another positive development is the diminishing danger of contagion, as we have seen after Argentina's default, which did not lead to widespread withdrawal of funds from emerging markets. This is particularly significant for the emerging market economies in Southeastern Europe, which look to a greater integration in the world economy without the fear of being hit by a crisis that originates elsewhere. All this of course, provided they maintain healthy fundamentals. Turning now to the developments in the Southeastern Balkans themselves, the present situation is a far cry from the bleak picture at the early stages of transition, more than a decade ago. Apart from often-bloody conflicts, hyperinflation and financial stability seemed endemic in the region only a few years ago. Regarding the financial sector, starting from an initial position with practically no commercial banks, the countries in the region faced problems that were often beyond their administrative and regulatory capabilities. Financial institutions were reformed with insufficient regulation and unclear focus and expansion was associated with improprieties, scandals and fraudulent schemes during the early stages of transition. Therefore, the financial sector was unable to attract deposits and develop extensive client networks. Finally, state banks were compelled to carry a 2 BIS Review 55/2003 
high number of non-performing loans, which had been accumulated by the government subsidization programs to state run enterprises. The development of the financial sector was hampered at the beginning by inadequate macroeconomic management. Fiscal deficits were mostly excessive, and often monetized, and the inevitable outcome was high inflation. It is encouraging that in the last few years we can see clear evidence of maturity in economic management. The path to macroeconomic stabilization was different for every country. In the region we can now observe all types of monetary and exchange rate regimes, from formal euro-ization and currency boards linked to the euro, all the way to monetary targeting. This is proof, if proof was needed, that there is no single solution, to economic problems but that the policies of each country should be tailored to its specific needs. Going beyond the diversity of the region, at this point I would like to underline two characteristics of the financial system of practically all countries in the region, which are the result of their past, but will also shape their future developments. The first is extensive currency substitution. As a result of past inflation, but also because of the large numbers of people working abroad, foreign currencies, and especially the euro, play a large role and they have often become the main currency in use. One can gauge the degree of currency substitution by noting that in all countries in the region deposits in a foreign currency account for at least half of all bank deposits. One must add to this, money "kept under the mattress" and capital flight. Undoubtedly all these were a vote of no confidence in domestic policymakers. People showed their dissatisfaction with local financial institutions and monetary authorities by moving their savings abroad, or by using other, more stable currencies. This high degree of currency substitution can only be found in some Latin American countries and undermined the effectiveness of monetary policy. The ability of monetary authorities to extract seignorage was severely limited, and this is a partial justification of the high inflation rates. At the same time, monetary management became more difficult, as small shocks had a disproportionately big impact on inflation and the exchange rate. In some countries, namely Bulgaria, the extent of hyperinflation and currency substitution left little alternative to the authorities but to accept the reality and move to a hard peg in the form of a currency board linked initially to the Deutschemark and now to the euro. Similar regimes were also imposed on Bosnia, after the Dayton Accord, and Kosovo. The euro is an appropriate anchor for an exchange-rate-based policy in these countries, as they are closely integrated with the countries of the eurozone. Most of their transactions, not only trade-related, but also workers' remittances, official transfers and financial transactions are with countries of the eurozone. A measure of macroeconomic success is the receding level of currency substitution. In 2002, the last year for which we have full data, bank deposits in foreign currencies fell as a proportion of total deposits in all countries in the region, sometimes quite fast in countries with strong performance in the context of monetary or inflation targeting, with only one exception. This is indicative of a growing trust in the domestic currency and the effectiveness of stabilization. It is all the more important that this achievement should not be squandered, and that prudent macroeconomic policies should continue. Nonetheless, I would like to warn of possible problems, especially in those countries that have tied their exchange rate to the euro, one way or another. The weakness of the euro until last year undoubtedly helped both their growth performance and their external competitiveness. From now, in a period of strong euro they will have to rely more on domestic productivity gains and structural adjustments to maintain their growth rates. In addition, and as growth takes hold in advanced economies, countries in the region will have to adjust to interest rates higher than their current historically low levels. An area where much remains to be done is the area of developing an efficient and stable financial system. In this respect, the economies in the region lag behind the other transition economies that are due to join the EU next year. The public sector still controls a substantial part of the banking system, and there is an obvious need to continue the efforts to privatize the remaining state-controlled banks. As in most transition economies, state interference has not been a stabilizing factor, quite the opposite. State controlled banks have often lost substantial sums in politically-motivated investments and have contributed to systemic crises in all those countries. As in other transition economies, we can foresee that an increasing number of banks will been taken over or become affiliated with foreign ones. Setting aside nationalistic prejudices, I think this should be seen as a welcome development as a whole, provided the foreign entrants are strong and well-supervised financial institutions. In the acceding countries of Central Europe foreign banks already BIS Review 55/2003 3 
play a major role after the crises that hit those countries in the late 1990s, and the overall experience has been positive. (Foreign banks control more than 80% of the domestic market in a few central european acceding countries). Foreign banks bring with them many advantages, especially in the case of countries with a limited experience with sophisticated financial markets. At first, they have access to better know-how and technology. More importantly, they are mostly immune from political interference. While local participants are often intimidated or pressured to give loans to well-connected borrowers, foreign institutions generally feel stronger to resist such pressures. Also, foreign banks are considered "safer" by local depositors, who recognize that they are not manipulated by the political authorities, and who also understand that foreign banks are supervised by the more experienced supervisors at home. Finally, experience with other emerging markets shows that foreign banks are better able to withstand losses in cases something goes wrong. The international evidence shows that banks affiliated with ones from advanced economies have access to capital at lower cost than local ones and can be re-capitalized faster and more easily than the others. Of course, foreign banks may have its disadvantages. Foreign-owned financial institutions may lack understanding of how the local market works. Indeed, it has been noted that such banks often tend to concentrate on financing affiliates of foreign firms, or only large local firms. There is thus a danger that local small and medium enterprises may find their access to credit curtailed. There is also the possibility that foreign-owned banks will alter their credit based not on the local conditions, but on the conditions in their home economies. Indeed, in Greece we have observed that foreign banks have entered the market and subsequently they expanded or left in a haphazard way, not on the basis of local conditions or profitability, but mostly on the basis of wider strategies whether to expand globally or not. Formally, we can say that this increases the correlation of emerging markets with the outside world. Research shows that the operations of financial multinationals are becoming a major channel for the transmission of business cycles. For that reason, economies in the Southeastern Europe will find that their economies are more and more affected by what is happening in the rest of Europe than with what is happening locally. Although at times of local euphoria you may regret being held back by the European business cycle, over time the benefits of becoming tied to the more stable economy of the eurozone will become overwhelming. This is especially so for countries that are applying for EU membership. Greater synchronization with the European cycle will smooth their path towards full membership. Foreign ownership of banks will also allow a greater risk diversification than what might be achievable by small local banks whose whole portfolio is locally invested. Foreign banks can thus behave in a less risk-averse way than local ones. The issue of financial stability and proper supervision is very important for us, at the Bank of Greece, as Greek firms have invested heavily in our neighboring countries. In most of them Greece is among the five biggest suppliers of foreign direct investment. Of course, this has to some extent caused delocation of greek companies, with a negative impact on investment and employment in Greece over the short to medium-term, but for an economy growing at almost 4% p.a. since 1997 and with an investment GDP ratio of 24% delocation does not pose a serious threat to its long term performance. Looking at the data in preparation for this speech, I was amazed by the number of branches of Greek banks in our neighboring countries. This shows that Greek banks have entered planning to offer a wide range of services and they see their future closely linked to the evolution of the host economies. They are not entering in order to concentrate in just a few lucrative activities and offer services to other Greek firms. The positive effects of the presence of foreign banks predicted by theory are supported by the experience of Greek banks in the countries of Southeastern Europe. Greek banks are already well-established in Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia-Montenegro, Albania and FYROM, representing at least 20 percent of the banking system according to assets and in some of them their share is between one-third and two thirds. Overall, they are better capitalized than their competitors, something that could be expected as they have access to a more diversified source of funds. Their better capitalization allows them to take somewhat higher risks, as shown by the fact their loans to the private sector are generally a higher share of their assets than for the average bank. Although they take somewhat more risk, they are profitable overall, more than their average competitors. This signifies that Greek banks in the region have some comparative advantage, either in the form of access to capital markets, or because of superior organization and know-how, and good understanding of local conditions. 4 BIS Review 55/2003 
BIS Review 55/2003 5 While Greek banks play a major role in the neighboring economies, their exposure to these economies is generally small. For no Greek banks does the exposure to Southeastern Europe exceed 3 percent. This is simply a reflection of the different levels of development in Greece and nearby countries. The result is that while Greek banks face little risks from their exposure to these economies, they themselves are important for the stability of the financial system in the Balkans. In the Bank of Greece we are well aware of this, and we take our responsibilities to our neighbors very seriously indeed. As home country supervisors we recognize that our ability to exert prudential supervision has effects beyond Greek borders. In recent years we have signed several agreements, in the form of memoranda of understanding, and we are discussing some further ones with other supervisors in the region in order to enhance our ability to ensure the stability of the banks under our jurisdiction. What is needed, beyond formal agreements, is the confidential and frank exchange of all information among supervisors in order to identify problems early on, before they become threatening. In this era, we should also be vigilant to avoid abuses of the financial system for illegal activities, such as money laundering and terrorism financing. Of course, we take comfort from the fact that the Greek banks that have expanded in the Balkans are quite strong, well above the necessary prudential ratios. Actually, the fact that Greek banks have been able to retain a very high share of their local market is also an indication that they have some comparative advantages that allow them to thrive in an internationally competitive environment. I must admit that our interest in the stability and growth of our neighbors is to some extent a reflection of selfish instincts. We realize that strong and growing economies in this region are not only useful for the Greek economy, but also a prerequisite for the political stability of the Balkans. I mentioned before that the presence of foreign financial firms in the Southeastern Europe would transform their business cycles. But it works the other way round. Greece's orientation toward the dynamic economies in our region has helped us somewhat weather better than most the recent economic slowdown. In a very specific way, one can see the growing interlinkages in the Balkans as evidence of how trade in goods and financial services can help growth and stability. Looking ahead, the challenges for our neighbors remain formidable. Now that the first steps towards stabilization and growth have been taken, what lies ahead is the more difficult issues of managing an emerging economy. Top of their priorities I would like to put the improvement of their governance structures, the further deregulation and privatization and the strengthening of the respect for property rights. I should end by saying that they can count on our continued support. 
T T Mboweni: Recent economic developments Speech by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the dinner for Heads of Foreign Missions, Pretoria, 1 December 2003. *      *      * 1. Introduction Dean of Diplomatic Corps - Ambassador Alzubeidi Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Ambassadors and High Commissioners Representatives of: the United Nations System - Mr Ohiorhenuan The European Union - Ambassador Lake The International Labour Organisation - Dr Andoh  The World Bank - Mr Omar Foreign Affairs - DDG: Africa, Ambassador Mamabolo Management & Staff of the South African Reserve Bank Ladies & Gentlemen  As a relatively open developing economy, South Africa was again affected considerably by world economic conditions during the past year. The weak and fragile global economic recovery impacted on domestic economic growth, low world inflation contributed to a decline in domestic inflation and substantial financial inflows led to a further recovery in the external value of the rand. 2. International economic developments Global economic activity suffered a setback in the second half of 2002 when business confidence was detrimentally affected by revelations of corporate accounting malpractices, a further decline in stock exchange prices and a threat of war against Iraq. In the first half of 2003 equity prices began to rise somewhat and the war in Iraq was concluded without severely impacting on oil production. Yet the international economy continued to move at a sluggish pace, with the result that most analysts downgraded their initial forecasts for world growth in 2003. More recently there have been encouraging signs that the macroeconomic environment has improved somewhat. Production growth in the United States of 8,2 per cent in the third quarter of 2003 seems to confirm that the much-anticipated economic recovery is gaining momentum. This acceleration in the pace of growth impacted favourably on the demand for labour, causing the US unemployment rate to edge lower to 6 per cent in October 2003. The real gross domestic product of Japan also increased at stronger-than-expected rates during 2003, while growth in China remained high. A strong domestic demand, improved export performance and fiscal and monetary policies in the rest of Asia are expected to support growth in the rest of this continent. In contrast economic activity in the euro area was weaker than expected in the second quarter of 2003, but indicators for this region indicate that economic activity could firm somewhat in the coming months. Rising net exports and real exchange rate developments are expected to lead to a modest recovery in Latin America. Global inflation remains low and monetary and fiscal policies were eased in most advanced economies during the past two years. However, with the recent acceleration in economic growth, some authorities have begun with a less lenient policy stance. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of England have both recently increased their official central bank rates by 25 basis points. Both central banks cited the pickup in economic activity and increasing household borrowing as the main reasons for the tightening in their monetary policy. An important further characteristic of the global economic environment in the past two years has been a considerable weakening in the external value of the United States dollar. In particular during the current year this has affected the currencies of most developing countries because of substantial financial inflows into these countries. BIS Review 55/2003 1 
3.  Domestic production and expenditure Although domestic growth is expected to benefit from the improvement in the global economic environment in the coming months, the weakness in international economic growth impacted severely on domestic production. Having recorded a high rate of 5 per cent in the second quarter of 2002, real output growth in the South African economy slowed down progressively in the next four quarters to a mere ½ per cent in the second quarter of 2003. In the third quarter of 2003 the growth in production rose somewhat to an annualised rate of 1 per cent. This brought the increase in real gross domestic product to only 2 per cent in the first nine months of 2003 compared with the same period in the preceding year, i.e. to a considerably lower rate than the 3½ per cent attained in 2002 as a whole. As could be expected if world economic conditions are taken into consideration, this decline in domestic production was mainly the result of a decrease in the volume of net exports. The growth in South African exports has always been closely correlated with world demand for our goods, especially the demand for our minerals and metals. The recovery in the exchange rate of the rand also had a significant price effect on manufacturing exports to the rest of the world. At the same time it was accompanied by a rise in real imports to South Africa. Fortunately a considerable improvement in the terms of trade of the country related to a substantial increase in international commodity prices, softened the effect of a deterioration in the volume of net exports. As a consequence, the surplus on the current account of the balance of payments in 2002, changed to a deficit of approximately 1 per cent of gross domestic product in the first nine months of 2003. This relatively small deficit poses no threat for a recovery in domestic economic growth. Growth in domestic production during 2003 continued to be supported by domestic demand. Domestic final demand increased at a rate of 4 per cent in the first nine months of 2003 compared with the same period in the preceding year. This continued high growth in domestic final demand was the result of increases in consumption as well as fixed capital formation. The growth in real final consumption expenditure by households also remained strong throughout 2003. The sustained high growth in private consumption expenditure was underscored by a rise in real personal disposable income owing to recent salary and wage increases, a reduction in income tax rates and more recently the decrease in interest rates. To supplement the growth in their disposable income, households became more willing to incur debt. Consequently, households debt as a percentage of disposable income rose somewhat from 51 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2002 to 53 per cent in the third quarter of 2003. This level is still low compared to those of many other countries. The strong domestic demand was also supported by growth in real final consumption expenditure by general government at an annualised rate of about 4 per cent in the first three quarters of 2003. This was mainly due to government purchases of goods and services, while real spending on salary and wages of government employees was rather restrained. Expenditure on real gross fixed investment continued to be buoyant throughout the first nine months of 2003. Private business enterprises as well as the public sector increased their fixed capital outlays. The government and public corporations increased their capital expenditure on infrastructure expansion aimed at service delivery, while private business appeared to be making the most of conditions that favour expenditure on capital goods. Such conditions included an exchange rate conducive to importing goods, a lowering in the cost of borrowing, rising prices in international commodity markets and considerably more stability on the inflation front. The strong domestic final demand was unable to prevent a decline in manufacturing output. Having increased robustly in the first half of 2002, real manufacturing output started to grow at a slower rate in the second half of that year and then declined in the first nine months of 2003. This was mainly a reflection of lacklustre global growth trends and the recovery in the exchange rate of the rand. Most of the subsectors of manufacturing were affected by a low demand for exports and increased imports as a greater proportion of domestic demand was met by competitively priced imports. As could be expected, this had a marked effect on employment. 4.  Inflation and monetary policy The inflation outlook improved significantly during 2003. The twelve-month CPIX inflation fell from a peak of 11,3 per cent in October 2002 to below the upper boundary of the inflation target from September 2003. In October 2003 it even receded to below the mid-point of the target range when it reached 4,4 per cent. This achievement was underpinned by the sustained maintenance of prudent 2 BIS Review 55/2003 
monetary and fiscal policies together with the recovery in the international exchange value of the rand and a moderation in food price increases. As the inflation outlook improved, the monetary policy stance was adjusted on four occasions in 2003. The first reduction in the repo rate was only made in June 2003, but there were already clear signs that the inflation rate was moving towards the inflation target at the March meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. At the time of that meeting it was felt that upside risks limited any possible actions that the MPC could take. In particular, the commencement of the war in Iraq on the first day of the meeting had an important effect on the Committee's decision. As the uncertainties about the inflation outlook dissipated and it became increasingly apparent that most factors favoured the attainment of the inflation target in the next two years, the MPC started to lower interest rates. The repo rate was cut by 150 basis points in June, by 100 basis points in August and September, and again by 150 basis points in October. All in all, a total reduction of 500 basis points in a period of only five months. This was indeed an aggressive lowering of interest rates. Nominal rates are at levels last seen in the 1980s, but the difference is that the current and expected inflation rates are significantly lower than those observed in the 1980s. Although international and domestic economic conditions have allowed the MPC to reduce short-term interest rates in an aggressive manner, the overriding objective of the Reserve Bank remains the attainment of the inflation target. Achieving low inflation is not an end in itself. It is important because it is a prerequisite for sustainable high economic growth and employment creation. The current and more importantly the expected state of the domestic economy will always carry weight in the determination of monetary policy. 5. The exchange rate of the rand Of all the recent economic developments, the behaviour of the external value of the rand has attracted the most attention. The exchange rate of the rand has been very volatile during the past few years. After the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand had declined by 13 per cent in 2000 and 34 per cent in 2001, it increased by 24 per cent in 2002 and by nearly 25 per cent in the first eleven months of 2003. Such volatility in exchange rates seems to be a fact of life in most economies these days. Fluctuations in the external value of currencies are unavoidable in the current international monetary system of generally floating exchange rates. Even when currencies are pegged to another currency or to a basket of currencies, they still float against other currencies and fluctuate widely at times. Large fluctuations in the exchange rate of the rand are clearly not healthy for the economy. The uncertainty caused by these fluctuations makes investment and export planning extremely difficult. What may seem to be a profitable venture can turn out completely different with a substantial swing in the external value of the rand. The Reserve Bank would obviously prefer to have greater exchange rate stability, but as already indicated fluctuations in the exchange rate of the rand seems unavoidable. The Bank can only create an environment that favours exchange rate stability. One of the most important recent developments in this regard has been the improvement in the net open foreign currency position of the Reserve Bank. The oversold foreign currency position of the Bank has always been perceived as a source of exchange rate weakness and instability. The Bank's objective was therefore to eliminate this oversold position, which stood at US$23,2 billion at the end of September 1998. During the past year this objective was finally achieved in May. At the end of October a positive net open foreign currency position of US$2,7 billion was recorded. Having removed this perceived vulnerability, the price discovery process in the market for foreign exchange should now display a better two-way trading pattern. In an attempt to further improve the functioning of the South African market for foreign exchange, the Bank has shifted its focus to reducing its oversold forward book and to strengthening the official foreign exchange reserve position. Considerable success has been achieved in bringing the oversold forward book down to lower levels. The balance on the oversold forward book stood at US$2,3 billion at the end of October 2003, compared with US$6,9 billion at the end of December 2002. In the mean time, the official foreign exchange reserve position was also increased to a level of US$7,8 billion at the end of October 2003. BIS Review 55/2003 3 
4 BIS Review 55/2003 6.  Conclusion These improvements in the functioning of the foreign exchange market and the lower inflation rate should at least provide a basis for more stability in the value of the rand. However, the South African economy will always be affected considerably by developments in the rest of the world. Any weakness in the US dollar or any of the other major currencies will affect the exchange rate of the rand. Our focus can therefore only be to develop an environment favouring greater stability. Monetary policy will continue to focus on the objective of price stability. Fortunately the world economic outlook has recently improved considerably, which should assist in attaining higher domestic economic growth. In addition, the outlook for inflation looks good. Thank you.  
Toshihiko Fukui: Achieving sustainable growth Speech by Mr Toshihiko Fukui, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at a luncheon for the EU Ambassadors, Tokyo, 28 November 2003. *      *      * Today, I will talk about Japan's economic outlook and the conduct of monetary policy in pursuit of sustainable growth.  Japan's economy is starting to recover gradually. Exports and production are increasing. Corporate profits are rising, and business fixed investment is staging a modest recovery. The majority of the Bank of Japan's Policy Board members forecast real GDP growth of around two and a half percent in both fiscal 2003 and 2004.  Behind Japan's nascent economic recovery is the synchronized recovery of the world economy. The US economy is clearly on the rebound, European economies are showing signs of a moderate recovery, and closer to home, East Asian economies have regained their high growth paths after quickly overcoming the adverse impact of SARS.  Increasing interdependence between the United States, East Asian countries and Japan is one of the keys to achieving sustainable growth in Japan. For example, Japanese firms strategically incorporate China not only as a low-cost production center but also as a potentially huge consumer market for goods and services. This is underscored by the increasing amount of both exports to and imports from China. We also observe an increasingly important mechanism whereby, for example, a recovery in the US economy stimulates East Asian economies, and this in turn has a positive impact on Japan.  Looking at the domestic front, steady progress has been made in solving structural problems. The debt to sales ratio for all industries has declined from its peak in 1993. The employment and income situation has somewhat improved recently. Corporate profits have increased largely as a result of firms' restructuring efforts. This has led to a recovery in business fixed investment.  While economic activity is improving, mild deflation is expected to continue. Indeed, the most recent figure for the Bank of Japan's Policy Board members' forecast of the Consumer Price Index excluding volatile food prices, which we generally refer to as the “core CPI,” is slightly negative, between minus 0.2 and minus 0.5 percent for fiscal 2004.  The combination of economic recovery and continuing deflation suggests a number of underlying problems, which may have some policy implications.  First, the output gap remains large. Since real GDP growth in both fiscal 2003 and 2004 will be slightly above potential growth, the output gap will be reduced only marginally.  Second, inflation has been declining globally. This is due mainly to the successful conduct of monetary policy worldwide and the increasing penetration of emerging countries into market economies. Firms have not regained pricing power in the market. Therefore, there is a strong possibility that inflation will stay at a relatively low level, while the growth rate will increase.  Third, Japan's economy is still suffering from structural problems such as excess debt, excess labor, and financial system fragility. Because of these structural problems, cyclical recoveries at large manufacturers are not able to generate strong positive spillover effects for non-manufacturers, small to medium-sized companies, or households.  To return to a sustainable growth path and overcome deflation, Japan must thus solve its structural problems and enhance the growth prospects of both firms and households. In Japan, as in Europe, structural reform to ensure the more efficient use of capital and labor is urgently called for.  Despite the recent progress, we should not be complacent about the need for structural reform. The process of solving structural problems is still half-finished. For example, the debt to sales ratio for non-manufacturing industries is still higher than it was before the bubble period. In addition, the sense that they are still holding excess labor remains among firms, whether in manufacturing or non-manufacturing, and whether large or small.  Banks have also made progress in their restructuring. Large banks have reduced outstanding amounts of nonperforming loans and have increased provisioning. They have also reduced the risk pertaining BIS Review 55/2003 1 
to stock prices by selling their shareholdings to the market as well as to the Bank of Japan under our stock purchasing scheme. Almost all banks have reduced their shareholdings to levels below their Tier 1 capital.  Banks' financial results turned out to be better than expected for the first half of the current business year ended in September. Because losses resulting from the disposal of nonperforming loans were smaller than operating profits, most banks posted profits. The average capital adequacy ratio for large banks was around 11 percent.  Given the scheduled removal of blanket deposit insurance in the spring of 2005, time is running short for us to engage in the further restructuring of the financial system to restore the soundness of the banking system. Moreover, the decline in bank lending illustrates not only that demand for loans is weak but also that the risk-taking ability of banks has not recovered sufficiently.  Under such circumstances, the Bank of Japan has adopted quantitative easing as its fundamental policy framework. And we have made our commitment to maintain the current quantitative easing, that is to maintain zero interest rates, until the core CPI shows a year-on-year rate of increase of zero percent or above on a sustainable basis.  Quantitative easing has helped to maintain financial market stability and to make the environment surrounding corporate finance more accommodative, thereby underpinning economic activity. Concerns about a liquidity shortage in the money market have been almost dispelled, and short- to medium-term interest rates have been low, reflecting the Bank's commitment in terms of policy duration.  In the area of corporate finance, borrowing rates have been stable at low levels. Although the outstanding amount of loans has been declining, the lending attitudes of banks as perceived by firms and the funding situations of firms themselves have been improving. During 1997 and 1998 amid the currency crises in Asia and Russia, the failures of several large Japanese financial institutions triggered a credit crunch. Since then, however, firms have not experienced such hardships, thanks to the provision of ample liquidity by the Bank and the strengthening of the safety nets.  Under quantitative easing, the Bank has raised the target for the outstanding balance of current accounts three times this year, resulting in a total increase of 10 trillion yen. In April and May, the Bank raised the target in response to downside risks, including the negative effect of SARS and the decline in stock prices. In October, the Bank raised the upper limit of the target. This was intended to give the Bank more flexibility in providing liquidity through its money market operations. Unlike earlier increases in the target, the objective of the increase in October was not to deal with downside risks, but rather to reinforce the recent momentum for recovery.  In my view, two things are important to strengthen the framework of quantitative easing. One is to clarify our commitment to maintain the quantitative easing policy, thereby enhancing the transparency and increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy. The other is to strengthen the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in the area of corporate finance.  In October, with a view to enhancing the transparency of monetary policy, we decided to clarify our commitment to maintain the quantitative easing policy. We also decided to improve the way we communicate to the market our thinking on the economic outlook.  In terms of our commitment, we specified two conditions for terminating quantitative easing. First, the most recently published year-on-year rate of increase in the core CPI must register zero percent or above, and such a tendency must be confirmed over a period of a few months. Second, we need to be convinced that the future year-on-year rate of increase in the core CPI will not fall below zero percent. To be more specific, the majority of Policy Board members must forecast that the rate of increase in the core CPI will be above zero percent during the forecasting period.  While these two conditions are necessary conditions, there might be cases in which even though the above conditions have been met, the Bank might still deem it appropriate to continue quantitative easing.  As a way to improve our communication with the market, we have introduced the following measures with particular emphasis on the timing and frequency of communication in conjunction with the clarification of our commitment. We decided to release an interim assessment of the state of the economy and prices in January and July. Previously, the Bank released its view of the “standard scenario” for the economy after reviewing the outlook and risk assessment of the economy and prices twice a year, in April and October. Now, in addition to these, the Bank will discuss possible deviations 2 BIS Review 55/2003 
BIS Review 55/2003 3 from this standard scenario at Monetary Policy meetings and report the outcome of its discussion in the January and July monthly reports. The Bank also decided to change the schedule for publishing its monthly report as well as to hold the Governor's press conference on the same day as the Monetary Policy meetings.  We hope that the clear and concrete commitment to continue quantitative easing will help the effects of monetary easing to permeate the economy more efficiently. We believe this will contribute to strengthening the foundation for a more sustainable economic recovery.  Some argue that such clarification of the Bank's commitment may impair the flexibility with which it is able to conduct future monetary policy. For example, if market participants consider the Bank's commitment to be too inflationary, this will cause the yield curve to steepen. It reflects not only the eventual increase in future short-term interest rates, but also the greater risk premium attached to concerns that a “too-easy” policy may be continued for “too long.”  In this sense, the idea of policy commitment involves a delicate balancing act between securing the short-term economic recovery and achieving long-term sustainable growth. Considering that deflation, though mild, is expected to continue under zero interest rates, I believe an unusual policy commitment, which is linked with a specific and observed economic indicator, is necessary in striking the best possible balance under the circumstances.  To strengthen the policy commitment, I am well aware that there are those both at home and abroad who argue for adopting an inflation target or a numerical definition of price stability. In this regard, let me reiterate that when nominal interest rates are constrained by the zero bound and financial institutions are not performing their intermediary function sufficiently, we cannot expect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to function properly. Under such circumstances, it is hard to believe that the adoption of inflation targeting would increase the effectiveness and enhance transparency regarding the future conduct of monetary policy.  I believe that the current policy commitment is most effective in enhancing the transparency of monetary policy and stabilizing the expectations in the market. It clarifies under what conditions and for how long the Bank intends to maintain the framework of its current quantitative easing policy.  In addition to enhancing transparency, we need to strengthen the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in the area of corporate finance. In this regard, the Bank has begun purchasing asset-backed securities backed by private sector corporate debt. The credit markets in Japan have traditionally been dominated by bank lending. However, given a situation in which banks' ability to take risks is constrained, we need to expand the markets for asset-backed securities and other such credit instruments, which are not susceptible to fluctuations in banks' capital levels. To date, the Bank has purchased about 200 billion yen of asset-backed securities and asset-backed commercial paper.  We hope that our efforts will contribute to the further expansion of the asset-backed securities market by raising awareness of its advantages among financial institutions and investors as well as encouraging the origination of asset-backed securities in the market. Earlier this month, the Bank initiated a series of workshops with a wide range of market participants on how best to coordinate efforts to improve the markets for asset-backed securities and other similar credit instruments.  Our current framework for quantitative easing coupled with measures to strengthen the transmission mechanism of monetary policy will improve the financial environment within which firms and banks engage with the structural problems. It will thus facilitate the Japanese economy's return to a sustainable growth path and also bolster the efforts to overcome deflation. Since the strategy of the Bank of Japan relies on the efforts of the private sector, this policy may take time to pay off, but it is the most effective way of tackling the roots of the structural problems.  In closing, I express my sincere hope that the current momentum for recovery in both Europe and Japan will be successfully translated into sustainable economic growth.  
Sir K Dwight Venner: Economic reform – towards a programme for resuscitation of economic growth and development in the Caribbean Remarks by Sir K Dwight Venner, Governor of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, at the opening ceremony of the 35th Annual Caribbean Monetary Studies Conference, Basseterre. St Kitts, 24 November 2003. *      *      * The Caribbean region now finds itself at the crossroads of its economic history when it must make some fundamental choices in order to ensure the economic viability of its citizens, the improvement of their social prospects, and the maintenance of their political freedoms. All these issues fit squarely within the theme of this 35th Annual Conference of Monetary Studies, “Economic Reform: Towards a programme for resuscitation of economic growth and development in the Caribbean”. The international and domestic environments within which we now operate make this one of the most challenging epochs we have experienced and make the case for economic reform an even more urgent one. The increasing pace of globalisation and the constant spectre of poverty at the international level present formidable challenges and in some instances reduced options for most members of the international community, that is, the developing countries. The dominant countries of the international system have now posed or exposed the threat of terrorism as a counterpoint to the eradication of poverty. They may not express it in those terms, but the facts are that resources will be diverted from the fight on poverty to prosecute the fight against terrorism. The question which is being increasingly asked is “Are the circumstances of poverty not a pre-requisite for terrorism?” The opposition to globalisation has certainly brought out a number of dissidents of different persuasions, including new style anarchists who are not opposed to violence. These issues speak to fundamental and systemic disjunctions at the international level, which will certainly have a limiting impact on our capacity to develop. The stark reality is that while we may have little or no control over these matters, other things being equal, we still must have strategies at our disposal to avoid, if possible, or to mitigate the impact on our countries and communities. This will require clarity of thought and rigorous intellectual analysis as well as a clear understanding of our long-term goals as opposed to short-term expediency. The policy makers of the region could possibly find themselves between a rock and a very hard place as they attempt to balance two sometimes conflicting demands. On the one hand there are the demands of the international community with their insistence on a raft of standards and codes, rating agencies in not only the financial sphere, but also in governance in democracy, the environment, etc. On the other hand are the insistent demands of our populations, a large section of which experiences poverty and unemployment, for education, health and social services. It must also be borne in mind that standards of living are relative and ours is not that of Bangladesh or sub Saharan Africa, but that of the Americas. The weighted, undemocratic voting systems as well as the lack of participation in the decision making process of major international institutions introduce significant biases into international decision making, which on many occasions presents difficulties for developing countries. These, however, while they are current givens, should not be permanent showstoppers for our development process. This is contingent on how we approach the solutions to our domestic and regional economic, social and political problems. These approaches should be based on our vision, our technical capacity and a broad societal consensus on the goals of our societies and how to achieve them. With respect to the vision, the broad outlines are fully accepted. That is, the solution to our problems lies in the closest possible integration of the Caribbean countries. This vision is devalued by raising it to utopian proportions and stating that it would not be possible in our own lifetimes. This, one could BIS Review 55/2003 1 
posit, in fact represents a clear disjuncture between the fact of political authority where it now resides, and the recognition of economic efficiency, which requires a larger contiguous economic space. Consideration of the economic benefits to the mass of people is in a sense not a primary objective, to the extent that there is no clear articulation of the economic benefits of such a wide space. A recent opinion survey in Jamaica revealed that 61% of the population were not, so to speak, averse to a federal arrangement. A similar poll in that country some time ago, revealed some uncomfortable views on the issue of independence. These two results in the largest and probably best-endowed country in the region poses significant questions for us as Caribbean citizens at the beginning of the 21st century. The answer to one of the unspoken questions is that independence is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for economic and social progress. Independence gives us the capacity but then we must exercise policy choices which lead to sustainable economic and social progress. We have never doubted that a collective regional approach is also a necessary condition for social and economic progress. The impediment has always been what the political traffic could bear after the demise of the ill- fated West Indian Federation. Lloyd Best at the 30th Monetary Studies Conference in the Bahamas, in a truly outstanding tribute to Alister McIntyre remarked on the fact that the “independence movement within the single territories of the CARICOM community, has not had the local machinery for exploiting or converting opportunities for development and transformation at home.” He also stated that the integration movement had been hopelessly short on implementation. The movement lacked the required instruments; a view he claimed was shared by the West Indian Commission in 1992. I now quote fully from Lloyd Best, in one of his most controversial assertions in a style, which is uniquely Lloyd’s. “If, in 1992, the West Indies Commission felt bound to declare time for action, what was the reason? Was it not that the Trade Unions and the Labour Congresses had gone off the stage fifty years before? Wasn’t it that organized units had effectively disappeared, almost blocking all political trade (as distinct from industrial relations bargaining) above all, when it involved transactions across the borders of newly independent states with insanely jealous leaders”. Lloyd went on - “Within the islands and territories, this gap was difficult to fill without breeding consistent new conflict. In many places, industrial stabilization became a surrogate for slowing or even stopping the development of new community forces with political potential. However, at the regional level, certain accidents of Federation did make it possible to envisage the emergence of an effective network of active as well as passive participants of Caribbean integration, exchanging ideas as well as promoting concrete measures. Let us call this the West Indian party. I am sure that today it is very well represented here.” Finally, in paying tribute to McIntyre and Demas, Lloyd delivered this very stirring oration. “Over the years, McIntyre and Demas have consistently and without fail, provided this party with inspiration and leadership, policy, programme and plan. They have worked selflessly. They have worked tirelessly, whether out of the multilateral institutions operating in the region, including the UWI and the wider system of higher education, the CARICOM Secretariat and regional agencies, the CDB and the UN system. McIntyre and Demas have had no other business - not academic life, not administration, not the university, not the regional Development Bank. The pair has had one transcendental concern, which has not been economics, which they have practiced expertly, when and where it has mattered to them. They have sought only the holding together of the West Indian nation and, as a means to that, the construction of one single integrated and effective West Indian party. At issue here is not an election party of course, but a political party in the proper sense: a private voluntary and considered community instrument deployed to public purpose.” I have quoted at length from our colleague Lloyd, to remind you of the tremendous institution we have created over the last 35 years and to alert you to the challenges ahead which will reach their zenith in the year 2007. Four arrangements will literally peak in that year. These are the FTAA, the COTONOU Agreement, the WTO, and of course, the Cricket World Cup. Economic reform will have to be greatly accelerated to get past this turning point. From an optimist’s point of view, this is a golden opportunity. The conditions to hold the World Cup are so commercially stringent that satisfying them will have an impact on our ability to treat with the trade arrangements. 2 BIS Review 55/2003 
BIS Review 55/2003 3 Also, using cricket as a reason and given our passion for the game we should be able to get our public and private sectors to attain standards they thought were unattainable in the past. Once we get past that year, when freedom of movement will be a condition to host the games, there will be no possible return to the status quo ante. I would simply like to say in conclusion that there is an inevitability in our circumstances about economic reform and we must get down to business without delay. Once again, quoting from the West Indian Commission of 1992, “This is the time for action.” 
Lars Nyberg: Current financial stability issues Speech by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, to the Riksdag Standing Committee on Finance, Stockholm, 25 November 2003. *      *      * Allow me to begin by thanking you for your invitation to come here and speak about the Riksbank’s work on financial stability. In the same way that the Standing Committee has the opportunity to regularly question the Riksbank Governor about monetary policy, it is natural that the Committee should also be able to learn about the Riksbank’s stability efforts. In the aftermath of the banking crisis, the Riksbank began to develop its expertise and analytical capacity with regard to stability issues. In autumn 1997, the Riksbank published the first report with a more coherent analysis of financial stability. The Riksbank became the first central bank to present its view of stability publicly. Other countries were more hesitant about speaking openly about stability in the financial system. Their opinion was that it would nevertheless be impossible to be open about these issues in the event a crisis should occur. The Riksbank’s attitude, however, was that it is better to be open. Discussing risks and vulnerabilities at an early stage would enable crises to be avoided. Moreover, the experiences of transparency in the area of price stability were positive. Today, some thirty countries have followed suit. Repeated financial crises have made it clear that there will always be problems to take account of and that authorities can therefore be benefited by a structured approach to financial stability. Banks are the focus of our work on financial stability. This is because banks are the institutions that ensure the functioning of the payment system. Experience shows that if individuals and companies are unable to make ordinary payments, or if the credit function in society is disrupted, this has highly adverse effects on the economy. Insurance companies are also important in society, but they are not system-critical in the same way as banks. I intend to return to the subject of insurance companies later on as they are undeniably in the spotlight at present. But banks are not only important for stability; their balance sheets also contain a built-in source of instability. Banks’ funding is generally short term in nature and can quickly disappear, while their assets have long maturities and cannot be realised as quickly. Should depositors and financiers lose confidence in a bank, it could face an acute liquidity crisis. Moreover, problems in one bank can spread to other banks. This can happen because they have liabilities to one another due to loans or securities trading, or because they participate in the payment system. Contagion effects can also arise if other economic players suspect that there are connections between the banks. Banks can then encounter difficulties, even if the original suspicions were entirely unfounded. As a result of these factors, banks operate within the bounds of a strict regulatory framework and are subject to public supervision. Finansinspektionen has primary responsibility for prudential supervision of individual banks. The Riksbank oversees the banking system as a whole and attempts to assess the risks that could arise in it in both the short and long term. Of course, there is some overlap in the tasks of both Finansinspektionen and the Riksbank, but it is sometimes fruitful to approach a problem from somewhat different angles. I am also of the opinion that the cooperation between the authorities works well. If a crisis were to actually occur in spite of regulations and supervision - and this can happen as we know - the Government may need to take action. The Riksbank’s task in a crisis is to provide emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to the banks that have run into liquidity problems. Allow me to underscore, however, that it is far from certain that a bank in difficulty will be given ELA. Since all our experience says that it is easier to provide assistance than not, especially when decisions have to be made under time constraints, there is reason to carefully consider such a measure - and to be well prepared. It would be serious if the banks were to feel certain that they would automatically be given assistance in the event of difficulties. Such thinking could cause them to take unnecessary risks. Were the crisis to spread to other healthier banks than the bank that requested ELA, perhaps the Riksbank should concentrate its liquidity injections to these banks in order to rescue the system rather than the bank itself. If the problems in a bank are of a more serious nature, whereby its solvency - that is the bank’s ability to meet its long-term obligations - rather than its liquidity is in question, this is more an issue for the BIS Review 54/2003 1 
Government than the Riksbank. Even in such cases, there is reason to question whether the bank really is systemically important before taking measures. In practice, every crisis should entail intensive cooperation between Finansinspektionen, the Riksbank and the Ministry of Finance. I am keen to stress how important it is to be well prepared for such cooperation, especially given how quickly crises can develop in today’s financial markets. Stability in the Swedish financial system The Riksbank presents an analysis of system stability twice a year. This comprises partly a review of developments in banks, mainly the four major banking groups, and partly an analysis of the financial infrastructure. The analysis of the banks discusses how borrowers’ indebtedness and their ability to service this debt has changed and how the banks themselves have acted. The analysis of the financial infrastructure discusses problems and risks in the rather complicated technical systems that are currently used to transfer payments, for example RIX, VPC and BGC. The Financial Stability Report enables the Riksbank to describe the banks’ ability to cope with unexpected disruptions. We can point to conceivable risks and dampen any exaggerated optimism during an upturn, when everything appears problem-free. Similarly, we can modify the picture during a downturn and, with the help of thorough analysis, ease concerns about serious loan losses. We can also call attention to risks and discuss these with the banks. However, the day will never come when the Riksbank indicates in a Financial Stability Report that the risk of a financial crisis occurring is high. In such a case, the crisis would materialise immediately, as pricing in the financial markets is based on expectations of future developments. Following this background information about the Riksbank’s stability efforts, I intend to discuss the most recent assessment of the Swedish financial system that was published in a Financial Stability Report yesterday. As always, the point of departure is the general picture of economic activity. An improvement in activity usually enhances bank profitability and thereby the resilience of the financial system. I should probably add here that this applies in the short term, as a prolonged economic upturn can lead to over-optimism and price imbalances in asset markets, which subsequently affect the banks in the form of loan losses. At the moment, there is no doubt that the overall economic outlook appears more positive than it did six months ago, both in Sweden and abroad, even if it is somewhat mixed. Prospects for an acceleration in growth are favourable for the United States and a number of emerging markets, but less so in Europe. The major Swedish banks have now begun to increase profitability for the first time since 2000. This is partly because the equity market has strengthened again, but also because the banks have cut costs while their interest income from lending has continued to increase. Banks have thereby improved their ability to cope with unexpected losses. Loan losses remain low. There has not been any expansion in credit other than in mortgages to households. The Tier 1 capital of the four major banks has risen over the past two years and now averages just over seven per cent, which is satisfactory given current economic conditions. Developments in the coming year are expected to lead to a further increase in profits and capital adequacy ratios. Neither are the banks’ borrowers - of which half actually reside outside Sweden - expected to cause the banks any considerable losses in the period ahead if economic activity strengthens in accordance with the Riksbank’s main scenario. The corporate sector, which is the largest borrower group and the group that previously has caused the banks’ biggest loan losses, has reduced its debt burden somewhat in relation to equity. Companies should also be able to benefit from an improved economic situation and thereby lower their interest expenditure in relation to income. Property companies have been feeling the effects of a decline in office prices and rents, but their debt is moderate and their earnings continue to be well above interest expenditure. We are far from the situation that existed at the end of the 1980s. However, households’ debt burden has increased throughout the slowdown. The main reasons have been higher disposable income and low interest rates, which has led to high house prices. Debt in relation to income is now approaching the levels seen before the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. The difference, however, is that interest expenditure makes up a considerably lower percentage of income than it did then. This makes the high debt levels possible to endure. 2 BIS Review 54/2003 
There is reason for vigilance regarding growth in household debt, even if households have never caused the banks’ losses that have posed a threat to financial stability. But it is also possible that the increase in indebtedness is partly an adaptation to a low-inflation economy. The pattern of rising household borrowing is evident in many industrialised countries that have got the better of inflation in the past decade. When there is less uncertainty about future inflation and thereby interest rate levels, lenders are more willing to grant credit and also demand a lower risk premium for this credit. Loans become cheaper. This makes borrowers more inclined to borrow, also because they are less uncertain about their future costs. Thus, they can accumulate more debt. However, households’ willingness to borrow tends to boost demand for housing and thereby raise house prices. This has been observed both in Sweden and other countries. House prices in Sweden have risen 56 per cent since 1997 at current prices. Also, unlike commercial property prices, they have not declined during the economic slowdown of recent years. In addition to low financing costs, increasing disposable income and the low housing supply have also contributed to the price rises. Does this give us reason to suspect that a speculative bubble is developing in the housing market? I don’t believe so, even if we have glimpsed local tendencies, notably in Stockholm. We don’t see any signs of housing being bought as an investment with a view to leasing it out until prices rise further. Such indications are evident in a couple of other European countries. As far as we can see, the price increases in the Swedish housing market appear to be due to fundamental factors and are not being driven by speculative behaviour. Low interest rates, rising income and limited housing construction goes a long way towards explaining current price developments. Lower confidence in insurance companies Recently, the media have drawn attention to the strained financial situation of life insurance companies. The crisis in these companies has been placed on a par with the banking crisis at the beginning of the 1990s, and there is concern that it could have equally serious repercussions for society. This is not the case. The actions of the life insurance companies do not jeopardise the financial system’s basic functions - to transfer payments, provide credit and manage risk. What could happen is that those who have saved in these companies choose to transfer their savings elsewhere, in the event that they can do this. In any case, fewer people will be signing new life insurance policies. This is bad news for life insurance companies, but has limited significance for financial system stability. It is unfortunate that the criticism of the life insurance companies, which is justified, also affects their products, especially traditional life insurance. Traditional life insurance is an excellent product for anyone hoping to have a long life. The insurance includes the “risk” of policyholders living a long life, that is, policyholders ensure that they will receive a predetermined income over life, which is enabled by evening out the risk in a large insurance portfolio. It is a unique product and a form of saving that deserves a better fate than that of disappearing because of a confidence crisis. Anyone that doesn’t know exactly when they’re going to pass away, and that means most of us, have reason to reflect over the advantages of life insurance. In my opinion, the serious consequence of the life insurance companies’ problems is that confidence in the financial system as a whole may have taken a blow. As savers we feel cheated, both by broken promises about returns that have not been forthcoming and by the greed inherent in some perks and bonus programmes. Low confidence in financial market institutions tends to subdue capital formation, which we all lose out on in the long run. Functioning financial markets are a precondition for good growth. As regards the life insurance companies, I personally believe that the root of the problem is found in their mutual construction, which has long been cherished since it means that all profits are given back to the policyholders. But as the companies have largely been affiliated to non-life insurance companies or banks, it has been natural for them to charge high fees for various services, such as sales and asset management. As profits go to policyholders, this is the only way to yield any gains from the affiliated life insurance companies. This is not a new problem, far from it, but it has come under the spotlight due to recent events, particularly the sale of asset management companies, where values that were previously difficult to establish have become evident. It is especially annoying that the life insurance companies’ mutual construction and no-dividend rule has made policyholders responsible for the entire risk capital. Affiliated non-life insurance companies or banks have neither been able to nor had reason to contribute equity, in spite of the fact that they BIS Review 54/2003 3 
have controlled the life insurance companies in practice. For this reason, the board of Finansinspektionen has proposed that it should not be possible for the boards of the mutual life insurance companies to be controlled by affiliated companies. The fact that the mutual corporate structure is being investigated further as planned is, I believe, also necessary, though overdue. It should be observed that the Insurance Committee called attention to the problems associated with mutual life insurance companies in its 1998 report and proposed that profit-making companies be established to clarify both ownership structure and control. Legislators adopted the Committee’s proposal and a profit-making life insurance company has since been established. In this case, moreover, the owner was forced to inject new risk capital as a result of the equity market decline. Another confidence issue stems from the fact that many savers since the bursting of the equity market bubble naturally feel they were misled by the advice they received from banks, securities brokers, insurance brokers and life insurance companies. It has happened many times that salespeople at these institutions have been presented as advisers, which has created the credibility we associate with neutrality. Unfortunately, the advisers’ competence has been rather superficial in some respects, especially with regard to assessing risk. Although information, particularly from the major banks and life insurance companies, has become appreciably better, much remains to be done so that savers with limited knowledge are not led astray. Whether companies’ own efforts are sufficient in this respect is a delicate question. Strict ethical guidelines, drawn up by each company and followed up by Finansinspektionen, could be a start. In countries like the United States, where families have long been forced to plan their saving to finance their children’s education and their own pensions, it has become natural to turn to independent investment consultants to discuss how much and in what way they should save. A new financial landscape? Allow me to conclude by taking a look ahead to discuss a number of challenges we may encounter regarding financial stability. They are all tied to our increasing international dependence. Financial market integration is beginning to become a reality in several parts of Europe and this has led to increasing interdependence between these countries’ banking systems. A problem in one country can spread in various ways to the banking systems of other countries. This places new demands on prudential supervision, oversight and regulations. In order to create a single market for financial services, the EU is striving to introduce a regulatory framework that will be common to all financial companies within the Union. This will enable banks to compete on equal terms, thus allowing the evolution of a single market with only the most competitive companies. This is an important initiative. Common regulations are often a precondition for enabling far-reaching integration. The integration we have seen so far has been very positive for growth, even if it is difficult to quantify the exact effects. Studies have indicated that increased financial integration in the EU could boost growth by around half a per cent per year. The risk, however, is that harmonisation in itself will make regulations more extensive and onerous for the banks than really desired. In their eagerness to safeguard stability, regulators risk overlooking efficiency. If regulations are to be harmonised, there is a risk that the strictest rules in the Union will also be those that prevail, as the reluctance to ease already existing rules is often greater than the reluctance to tighten rules further. The biggest common denominator is a more natural choice than the smallest. Neither can we have the ambition to regulate away all potential problems - for then we will also regulate away competition and efficiency, just as we did in Sweden up to the mid 1980s. Therefore, it is not unlikely that we will also witness bubbles in the asset markets in the future, as well as banks that have over-expanded or that have encountered difficulties for other reasons. We have to be able to manage such situations without them developing into systemic crises. Our ongoing work on financial stability is one way of dealing with these issues, not least as regards the financial system’s sensitivity to bubbles. But we also need legislation that can bolster efforts during a crisis, which is something that is lacking in several countries, including Sweden. However, the Banking Law Committee put forward a proposal in 2000 for such legislation in Sweden. We have to hope that a Government bill will come before the need becomes acute! 4 BIS Review 54/2003 
BIS Review 54/2003 5 Although harmonisation of regulations is desirable and opens up new possibilities, it also leads to problems that need to be dealt with, for example with regard to prudential supervision and crisis management. I intend to leave it at that as regards supervision, but would like to say a few words about crisis management. Managing a domestic banking crisis can be tricky enough, but managing one across national boundaries is in all probability even more difficult. Let me give you an example. After its most recent restructuring, Nordea is a Swedish bank with subsidiaries in other Nordic countries. It has market shares of approximately 40 per cent in Finland, 25 per cent in Denmark, 20 per cent in Sweden and 15 per cent in Norway. The bank wants to change its subsidiaries into branches. This would make Nordea an entirely Swedish bank with branches that potentially could be systemically important in other countries. According to current EU legislation, prudential supervision and crisis management would in principle be an issue for Swedish authorities. But would the Finnish authorities accept that Sweden takes responsibility for the most important part of the Finnish financial system? And would we in Sweden be willing to resolve a banking crisis in Finland, with all that it would ask of the Swedish taxpayers, if Nordea were to run into difficulties? The answers to these questions are not straightforward. But it is fairly obvious that present EU legislation does not accommodate banks with systemically important branches. An article in the Riksbank’s Financial Stability Report discusses this particular problem. The Nordic central banks have a joint working group for discussing cross-border crises, and we have drawn up a memorandum of understanding for how we are to manage them. The supervisory authorities have a corresponding group for their purposes. Unfortunately, such cooperation is still uncommon at European level. Thus, to sum up, we require harmonised rules for the financial sector in Europe, but it is important to resist the forces that seek to make them unnecessarily extensive. We also need legislation for crisis management in Sweden, which we have been waiting a long time for. And we need new regulations in the EU for managing cross-border banks. These are the main priorities for now. Thank you. 
Ewart S Williams: The role of credit unions in the emerging financial landscape Address by Mr Ewart S Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, at a Breakfast Seminar hosted by CUNA Mutual Group/CUNA Caribbean and the Trinidad and Tobago Unit Trust Corporation, Port of Spain, 6 November 2003. *      *      * Thanks for inviting me. Let me give my belated congratulations to you Mr. Chairman on your celebration of Credit Union month in October. I read with interest the many accolades that you received, and deservedly so, for the sterling contribution that the credit union movement has made towards encouraging the practice of thrift, self-help, and cooperation among its members and towards promoting the development of co-operative ideals. As I reviewed the history of the credit union movement in Trinidad and Tobago I could not help but be impressed by the resilience of the movement and its ability to survive and prosper through good times and bad. I noted, for example, that the period of the first economic boom, between 1973 and 1983, was one of very rapid growth for the credit union movement reflecting the registration of new credit unions. The growth of credit union resources was flat in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, a period of economic decline, when many credit unions either collapsed or were merged. In 1986, the Government introduced tax incentives to help boost savings in credit unions and in 1993 a Task Force was established to examine the conditions of some specific credit unions and to provide proposals for generally strengthening the sector. In recent years, the credit union industry has been going through further adaptations to cope with the changing financial environment. While there has been growth in the last few years, it has been lopsided way. Some institutions that have adapted to cope with the new market reality have prospered, while many of those that have remained in the traditional mould have languished. What is the picture today? According to the available data: • • • • We now have about 130 operating credit unions from about 400 in the early 1980s. Total assets of the movement are now estimated at around $3 billion which is a fairly sizable sum and makes the credit union movement a very important part of the overall financial system. Interestingly, the 6 largest credit unions, with assets from about $200 million up to about $750 million accounts for 50 percent of total credit union assets and the largest 17 account for three quarters of the industry assets. The smaller institutions raise resources from shares and savings deposits and make small loans for consumer purposes; these are essentially run as co-operative societies and are based on principles of volunteerism. In the case of the large credit unions, we have a new paradigm involving products and services more readily associated with the commercial banks. These larger credit unions, in addition to shares and savings deposits, now offer certificates of deposits, make mortgage and commercial loans, provide credit and debit cards to be used in automatic teller machines and also provide cambio and travel agency services. The expansion of the credit union sector over the last 35 years has taken place in the absence of an appropriate legislative framework. As you know, the present legislation, covering the credit union movement {The Co-operative Society Act} dates back to 1971 and does not address prudential issues. In an attempt to fill this gap, the Co-operative Credit Union League, over the past few years, has been promoting a system of prudential management based on adherence to the “PEARLS” system, which provides guidelines for capital adequacy, liquidity and non-performing loans. 
The League’s efforts have had mixed results. The preliminary data that I have been able to muster suggests: (i) that about 40 percent of the operating unions maintain a liquidity ratio below the 10 percent suggested in the PEARLS system; (ii) that non-performing loans in the industry average a relatively high 20 percent; (iii) that about only 40 percent of operating credit unions maintain a capital adequacy ratio of under 10 percent, which is the recommended ratio. The need for the stricter regulation of credit unions was recognised several years ago. Indeed the 1993 Task Force Report recommended amendments to the Co-operative Act: (i) to provide for the regulation and supervision of credit unions by a new supervisory agency responsible to the Minister of Finance; (ii) to give the regulator power to make regulations with respect to prudential criteria for credit unions; (iii) to grant full enforcement powers which should include the removal of directors and the suspension of a license to operate. Later in 1996, an IDB project implemented with participation of the Credit Union League initiated a review of the regulatory framework and established the Credit Union Supervisory Unit within the Ministry of Finance with responsibility for the development and implementation of a system of surveillance for credit unions. It is not clear what is the status of the new draft legislation which was prepared in the context of the project. From my vantage point, and let me emphasise that these are my views, and not official government policy. The sheer volume of resources being intermediated by the credit unions as well as the rapid changes taking place in the more aggressive segments of the sector underscore the critical need for stricter regulation to protect the funds of their members and more generally to help in maintaining the soundness of the financial system. The lower interest rate environment which is promoting greater competition within the financial sector, in my opinion, adds to the urgency for tighter regulations. But getting the right regulatory framework for the credit union is not that easy. It is indeed ironic that the main strengths of credit unions constitute unique challenges for supervision and regulation. For example, in traditional credit unions there is a collective ownership by all members, who technically have equal voting rights, regardless of the size of their monetary investment. Control is therefore not legally vested in any one person or group of persons by virtue of their having more at stake. All this is particularly true for the smaller community or employment-based credit unions. Larger credit unions tend to operate with shares and savings of their members as well as from the general public, in much the same way as banks or non-banks. This dichotomy, in my personal opinion, makes a strong case for a two-tier regulatory system of the type that is common in several Latin American countries. In the typical Latin American system one tier of the regulatory regime pertains to the small “closed type” credit unions that continue to rely on volunteers to manage and run the operations and that provide traditional basic services. The other regulatory tier pertains to the “more open credit unions” which have a more diversified resource base and are involved in a wide range of services, basically operating like banks. In applying this model to Trinidad and Tobago, I could envisage a regulatory regime for these closed-type operations that would continue to be based on prudential criteria although these should be less rigid. For instance, these small credit unions should be required to have some minimum capital requirements (but this should be ‘real’ capital devoted solely to meeting losses). Even these small credit unions should continue to meet modest liquidity ratios and should be required to make provisions for delinquent loans. Very importantly, they should be required to submit information about their operations at least on a quarterly basis and should be subject to closer monitoring if they do not meet the specified standards. These small credit unions could be monitored and supervised by a strengthened unit in the Ministry of Co-operatives. 
In my view, the larger “open-style” credit unions should in fact be subject to a regulatory regime pretty similar to that which obtains for the banks and non-banks. This more stringent regime should place emphasis on good governance and risk management structures. For instance, their supervisory regime should clearly define and distinguish between the roles of the Board of Directors and Management, and should require that Directors assume a purely oversight function to ensure that the appropriate risk-management policies are in place. Because of the diversity of services being offered these larger credit unions should be required to have professional management that meet fit and proper criteria and possess the technical ability to conduct credit risk analysis. They should be subject to higher levels of capital adequacy, liquidity, loan loss provisions and more ambitious delinquency standards. They should operate under clear rules establishing ethical standards of behaviour and controls for insider loans to avoid conflict of interest. For convenience these larger credit unions could be, in the first round, supervised from the Ministry of Finance pending consideration of a broader Financial Supervisory Authority with responsibility for the supervision of all financial institutions. Because of the unavailability of data I am unable to say whether any of the large credit unions would be able to meet the current standards that have been established in the banking and non-banking sector. For the record, the delinquency ratio for commercial banks now averages around 3 to 4 percent; and for non-banks only slightly higher. While the stationary minimum capital ratio for commercial and non-banks is 8 percent, the actual capital ratio for banks now averages about 20 percent and is even higher for non-banks. The liquidity ratio currently averages about 30 percent for banks and about 35 to 40 percent for non-banks. I recognise that this is a very ambitious proposal which may not find favour with some current industry players who would argue that they have been operating successfully without strict regulation. My point is that these large credit unions are now intermediating significant resources and assuming sizable risks and their operations can have contagion effects on the rest of the financial system. Let me make a few general observations on some of the issues that credit unions would need to grapple with in the context of Trinidad and Tobago’s march to developed-country status. There is an issue, for instance, whether credit unions should not help their members become not only savers but investors - for instance through pooling resources for investment in equities or in the government fixed income securities. Of course, some of these investments carry risks and members would need to be advised and be agreeable to such investments. There is clearly the issue about the role of credit unions in providing credit to small and medium sized industries, an area which will be critical to the achievement of sustained growth in employment in Trinidad and Tobago. There is an argument that given the movement’s connection with the small man and with groups that have been deprived access to normal banking services, the entry of credit unions into micro finance is a logical and natural step. And honestly, I believe that a way can be found to involve the credit union movement in this area without incurring excessive risks. The fact of the matter is that, in general, lending to many small and medium sized enterprises carry higher transactions cost and greater risks and inadequate security. In many countries in Latin America and Asia, governments have intervened to mitigate these risks through credit guarantee schemes. Such schemes seek to help overcome the problem of loan applicants who have good projects, are creditworthy but cannot offer adequate collateral to satisfy normal requirements of the lending institutions. The objective of the guaranteed scheme, which could be financed by government with grants and low cost loans from multi-lateral agencies, is to share the risks with the lending institution (in this case, the credit unions) so that if the borrower defaults the lender will be compensated for all or part of the loss involved. In our case I can envisage a partnership between institutions like NEDCO and the Business Development Corporation, providing the technical assistance, project management and consultancy services, on the one hand, with resources from the credit union movement backed up by government credit guarantees on the other. There are a number of best practice arrangements to reduce the risks of abuse of these subsidised arrangements, but perhaps that’s a discussion for another time. 
I would like to end with the following concluding remarks: Firstly, because the credit union movement is now intermediating significant financial resources and assuming greater risks, it would have to contend with higher regulatory standards. Secondly, the credit union movement needs to pay greater attention to improving its systems for co-operative governance, risk management and information disclosure. Thirdly, the movement needs to expand the range of investment opportunities that are available to its membership if it is to maintain a competitive position in the current financial market place. Fourthly, developing strategic alliances with institutions involved in the provision of financial services to small and medium sized enterprises should be a goal that the credit union movement should embrace. Finally, let me congratulate Cuna Mutual Group on its sterling contribution to the credit union movement in Trinidad and Tobago and let me wish this new initiative and this new partnership all the best. 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Testimony before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, Brussels, 1 December 2003. *      *      * It is my pleasure to appear before your Committee for the first time in my capacity as President of the ECB. I would like to tell you that I was very impressed by our last encounter here and I thank your Committee and Parliament for the confidence expressed by giving your approval to my appointment. I look forward to continuing our regular dialogue in the same fruitful and constructive spirit that was dear to my predecessor Wim Duisenberg, to whose achievements I wish to again pay tribute on this occasion. I shall begin my first report to you with our assessment of economic and monetary developments, before turning to another issue of topical importance, namely the draft EU Constitution. I should like to conclude my statement by briefly addressing the international role of the euro. 1. Economic and monetary developments At the time of Mr Duisenberg’s last testimony in September, we noted that economic activity had been very weak in the first half of 2003. At the same time, early signs of a recovery were emerging. Since then, data have confirmed our main scenario, which is one of a gradual improvement in economic activity starting in the second half of this year. Eurostat has provisionally estimated that quarterly real GDP growth was 0.4% in the third quarter of the year. There are, increasingly, reasons to expect the gradual economic recovery in the euro area to broaden and strengthen in the course of 2004. Recent data show that the recovery of the world economy is clearly making progress. The expansion of global trade and economic activity should support euro area exports. On the domestic side, recent survey data continue to point towards a further improvement in confidence. The conditions for investment are also improving as a result of firms’ continued adjustment efforts to enhance productivity and profitability. Financing conditions are generally favourable, not least due to the low level of interest rates. Finally, terms-of-trade effects stemming from the past appreciation of the euro should also positively affect real disposable income and thus facilitate a pick-up in consumption growth. Developments in financial markets are broadly consistent with the overall picture of a gradual resumption of economic growth. As compared with a few months ago, downside risks to the main scenario of a gradual recovery have clearly receded. Overall, the risks to this scenario in the coming quarters now appear to be balanced. Over longer horizons, some risks to the sustainability of economic growth at the global level remain. This is due, primarily, to unresolved structural problems, the sustainability of public finances and to external imbalances in some parts of the world economy. As regards prices, the annual rate of HICP inflation declined to 2.0% in October, from 2.2% in September. Looking ahead, inflation rates may not fall as quickly and strongly as was expected at the time of the last testimony of the President of the ECB. We have seen rather strong increases in some categories of food prices owing to the effects of this summer’s heatwave. In addition, oil prices have remained higher than expected, owing mainly to ongoing political uncertainties in the Middle East. Furthermore, in the coming months, planned increases in indirect taxes and administered prices in some euro area countries are likely to have an upward impact on annual inflation rates. However, there are also factors which should continue to dampen inflationary pressures. First, in the context of a gradual economic recovery, wage developments should remain moderate. In addition, the past appreciation of the euro, which is reflected in current subdued price pressures at the producer level, will continue to lower import prices and be passed on to consumer prices over time. At the same time, developments in inflation expectations need to be monitored closely. Cross-checking this assessment with our monetary analysis, we see that liquidity in the euro area remains ample following the period of strong monetary growth over the past two years, reflecting past portfolio shifts, precautionary savings and the low level of interest rates. The latter factor also provided 
a counterweight to the negative impact of weak economic growth on loans to the private sector. In the view of the Governing Council, the accumulation of excess liquidity should not, at the current juncture, be of concern for price stability, given that, for the time being, the economic recovery is only gradual. However, should high excess liquidity continue to prevail once there is a significant strengthening of economic activity, this could lead to inflationary pressures in the medium term. Monetary developments therefore need to be monitored carefully. Overall, the Governing Council of the ECB, at its meeting in November, continued to assess the outlook for price developments as in line with our definition of price stability and considered the current stance of monetary policy to be appropriate. At the same time, the Governing Council made clear that it will carefully monitor all developments that might affect its assessment of risks to price stability. Turning to recent fiscal policy developments, you are very well aware of our serious concerns. In recent months we have seen a gradual move away from the commitments made under the Stability and Growth Pact. The Governing Council had already made clear on 6 November that the recommendations of the European Commission regarding the steps to be taken in the excessive deficit procedure had pushed the room for interpretation of the rules and procedures to the limit. As you already know from the Governing Council’s statement to the public last Tuesday afternoon following the decision of the ECOFIN Council, the Governing Council deeply regrets the ECOFIN Council’s decision not to act on the basis of the Commission’s recommendations regarding France and Germany. It fully shares the views made public by the Commission on the ECOFIN Council’s conclusions. The conclusions adopted by the ECOFIN Council carry serious dangers. The failure to respect the rules and procedures foreseen in the Stability and Growth Pact risks undermining the credibility of the institutional framework and confidence in the sustainability of public finances across the euro area. The Governing Council takes note of the commitments by France and Germany to correct their excessive deficits as rapidly as possible, and by 2005 at the latest, and strongly urges the governments concerned to live up to their responsibilities. It is now absolutely imperative that effective action be taken to limit negative effects on confidence. Moreover, we also note that the ECOFIN Council stands ready to act on the basis of the Commission’s earlier recommendations to give notice to the two countries, should they fail to comply with the Council’s conclusions. The public can rest assured that the Governing Council remains staunchly committed to maintaining price stability. We firmly believe that the need to correct the excessive deficits in some countries and to pursue sound fiscal policies in general have to be framed within a comprehensive and credible medium-term reform strategy. It is necessary for executive branches, parliaments and social partners to push ahead with structural reforms aiming at enhancing the competitiveness of the euro area, notably in labour and product markets, as well as in social security systems, in order to foster a more flexible allocation and utilisation of capital and human resources. The Governing Council very strongly supports recent and ongoing efforts by a number of governments in this direction. It also encourages social partners to fully commit themselves to the objective of making the euro area a more dynamic and innovative economy, as intended by the “Lisbon agenda”. Once there is a convincing commitment to implementing comprehensive structural reforms to foster the growth perspective of the euro area, confidence will increase among all economic actors, including consumers. The upswing that we currently foresee is a sign that confidence is returning, but for the economic recovery to be sustained it is essential that excessive deficits are corrected and that the reforms currently being discussed are carried out. 2.  The draft EU Constitution For the last two years, the EU has been engaged in intense debates on a future Constitution for the Union. These debates resulted in the draft Constitution presented by the Convention in June and are now culminating in the Intergovernmental Conference, which is seeking to finalise the Constitution before the end of this year. The ECB has followed the constitution-building process with great interest and welcomes all efforts to further the construction of a united Europe. When the European Union re-writes its rulebook by giving itself a Constitution, does this mean that there will be profound changes to the provisions relating to the ECB and to monetary union in general? 
Throughout the process of drafting the Constitution, the ECB has consistently advocated that the monetary constitution of the EU - the basic set of rules and provisions for EMU, as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty - is sound both in terms of the objectives set and the allocation of responsibilities between different actors and levels of government. I am grateful that the Convention has followed a similar line of reasoning. Its draft Constitution takes over the provisions relating to EMU without changes in substance. The single monetary policy is, by its very nature, indivisible. Thus, it is an exclusive competence of the Union. The conduct of monetary policy has been assigned to an independent European Central Bank, which fulfils this task together with the national central banks of the euro area and with the clear primary objective of maintaining price stability. The European System of Central Banks is explicitly mentioned in the first part of the draft Constitution. However, further refinements to the draft Constitution are possible, and the ECB has made several suggestions. For example, we strongly believe that price stability should be added to the list of the Union’s objectives set out in the first part of the Constitution, as price stability is of great importance not only for the ECB but for the Union as a whole. It ensures confidence in the long-term value of the euro and translates into low and stable medium and long-term market interest rates. It also avoids an arbitrary redistribution of wealth, thereby helping to protect the weakest members of society. There can be no doubt that price stability deserves to be one of the European Union’s objectives. Furthermore, we would like to see a clarification of the allocation of responsibilities with regard to the international representation of the euro. It would also be useful to formally recognise the widely used term “Eurosystem”. It is now for the Intergovernmental Conference to use the Convention’s draft to finalise the Constitution. I sincerely hope that Foreign Ministers and Heads of State or Government will take decisions in full awareness of the historic nature of their task. From the ECB’s point of view, the recent proposal to introduce into the Constitution an extended enabling clause which would allow the European Council to amend, by unanimity, important parts of the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB is certainly not welcome. In a letter which I sent to the current President of the Council, Mr Frattini, last week, I stressed that the ECB is seriously concerned about this proposal. Such an expansion of the simplified amendment procedure would imply a far-reaching change to the current constitution of the ESCB, which the ECB could not support. 3. The international role of the euro Let me conclude my statement with some observations on the international role of the euro, an issue which I know the European Parliament follows with great interest. The ECB monitors developments in this area carefully and, as in previous years, we will shortly publish its annual review of the international role of the euro. The findings of this report suggest that the use of the euro by non-euro area residents continues to increase gradually and is most prominent in regions neighbouring the euro area. In addition, the use of the euro is, to some extent, driven by the euro area itself, as euro area investors account for a significant part of demand for international euro-denominated bonds. While these features have not changed over the past few years, a number of new developments have emerged in 2003. First, there is some evidence of rising interest in euro-denominated bonds on the part of Asian investors. Second, according to the latest data published by the IMF, which were recently revised, the share of the euro in global foreign exchange reserves also increased between 2001 and 2002, from 16.4% to 18.7%. Third, euro area countries are increasingly using the euro as a settlement or invoicing currency in trading with non-euro area residents, especially following the cash changeover. This suggests that the cash changeover may have encouraged exporters and importers to review their settlement and invoicing practices. As you know, these developments are the outcome of decisions essentially taken by market participants. They underscore the confidence of non-euro area residents in the euro. I am now open to questions. 
Jean-Pierre Roth: What to expect from monetary policy? Summary of a speech by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies (ICMB), Geneva, 25 November 2003. The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * A number of current issues, such as the weakness of the economy and the new National Bank Law, raise the question as to what we can expect from monetary policy.  With regard to the stability of consumer prices, the answer is relatively simple. The goal of price stability is at the very top of the Swiss National Bank’s priority list. Since both inflation and deflation are monetary phenomena over the long term, the SNB can and will guarantee price stability in future too.  Expectations of monetary policy are considerably lower when it comes to regulating economic activity. Economic activity in Switzerland is strongly dependent on growth abroad. Inflation does not bring about long-term economic growth. Stable prices, however, are the best precondition for sustained growth. A goal of price stability automatically ensures a degree of stability in the economy. Because of uncertainty and time lags, however, fine-tuning the economy is an impossible task.  Speculative bubbles in the real estate and equity markets have been an increasing source of macroeconomic instability during the past two decades. Although equity and property prices serve as important indicators for the future development of economic activity, they are not a goal of monetary policy. Many reasons militate against a direct monetary-policy response to changes in asset prices. The question nevertheless arises as to whether monetary policy could not do more to prevent any speculative bubbles from forming in the first place. BIS Review 53/2003 1 
Lars Heikensten: Euro entry before reforms or reforms before euro entry?  Speech by Mr Lars Heikensten, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the Frankfurt European Banking Congress, Frankfurt, 21 November 2003.  *      *      * The outcome of Sweden’s referendum was an unambiguous “no” to euro adoption. This means business as usual for Swedish monetary policy. Since 1993 we have had an inflation target of 2 per cent, which has gained credibility with the public and the markets. Since the introduction of the inflation target, inflation has averaged 1.7 per cent while average growth has been 3 per cent. This compares well with the Swedish experiences of previous decades. It also compares favourably with the recent performance of the euro area. This relative strength of the Swedish economy was in my opinion an important factor behind the result in the referendum. However, the outcome of the referendum does not mean business as usual in our relations vis-à-vis the rest of Europe. We will not have a seat at some of the negotiating tables in Frankfurt and Brussels that we could have had. Of course, we will try to compensate for this. To some extent, this can be done by keeping our own house in order - by conducting sound economic policies. Also, we will do our utmost to contribute to European policy discussions. Being outside the euro certainly doesn’t mean that we want to be on the margins of the debate on monetary integration in Europe.  Sweden remains a ‘pre-in’; we will have to consider euro adoption again at some point in the future. Therefore the evolution and enlargement of the euro area concerns us. Secondly, Sweden is probably one of the EU nations that will benefit most from the enlargement of the European Union. Our economy is one of the EU’s most integrated with acceding countries, with surging East-West trade and FDI. Also, should Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania adopt the euro, we would be directly affected because Swedish banks own most of the Baltic banking system.  I would therefore like to share some reflections with you on two subjects of relevance to euro area enlargement: the risks associated with ERM II membership and long-term frameworks for fiscal policy. However, before doing this let me stress two things:  First, the long-term advantages of euro area enlargement are evident. I believe the advantages would be roughly the same for acceding countries as they would be for Sweden: integration of trade and capital markets stimulates growth for both the euro adopter and the euro area. In the case of acceding countries, there are probably additional advantages of monetary integration; it gives added stability after the difficult years of transition and is important for their underdeveloped financial sectors. So the issue is not really euro area enlargement as such, but rather its timing and preconditions. Second, from the perspective of the euro area itself it is hard to see how acceding countries could pose any major risks to price stability. The sum of the economies of all the new member states does not presently amount to more than the GDP of the Netherlands. Furthermore, historically high inflation rates in the acceding countries have been reduced through reinforced macroeconomic discipline (which in turn owes much to the enlargement process). A simple calculation shows that even if growth in the acceding countries averages some 4 per cent more than the euro area, and this catch-up, according to most estimates, generates Balassa-Samuelson price convergence with 2-3 percentage points higher inflation than euro economies, their inclusion in the euro area would still only add some 0.2 percentage points to area-wide inflation. Instead, it is the perspective of the acceding countries themselves that is crucial.  Risks with ERM II The one risk with ERM II that has been discussed at length in recent years is the potential conflict between a pegged exchange rate and an inflation target. Both exchange rate stability and low inflation are necessary to fulfil the conversion criteria, but in some cases it may be difficult for monetary policy alone to meet two targets at the same time.  One possible situation is that the central parity has been set too low and that real appreciation pressures, due to catching up, are so strong that the upper band comes into question. This can result BIS Review 53/2003 1 
in large-scale speculative currency flows and unnecessary turbulence, as demonstrated by the attack on the forint at the beginning of this year.  The obvious solution to speculation against the upper band is to reach an agreement in ERM II to revalue. But this is often difficult in practice. When political decision-makers are forced to choose between the inflation and exchange rate targets, it takes courage - and good analyses - to give priority to low inflation and opt for revaluation. As the case of Ireland has demonstrated, this does not exclusively apply to acceding countries. In the end, the result can be inflationary pressures once inside the euro area.  However, the most acute risk with ERM II is probably when the exchange rate is in the lower part of the band. Virtually all the currency crises that we have experienced in recent decades have been due to speculation against weak currencies. ERM II, of course, is different from these previous failed regimes of pegged exchange rates in the sense that it has a clear exit strategy with regard to euro adoption. But this does not mean that ERM II is immune to large fluctuations in short-term financial flows. I do not think this should be a big problem for the currency board regimes or the so-called hard pegs in the new Baltic member states. In their case, ERM II membership would merely be confirmation of a credible regime that has been successfully maintained for nearly a decade, even when confronted with severe shocks such as the Russian crisis. This has been possible thanks to a high degree of wage flexibility as well as serious efforts to achieve fiscal consolidation. There is more reason for concern over some of the presently floating regimes as they move towards ERM II. Substantial fiscal slippages have occurred in some of these countries, bringing them far from the 3 per cent deficit requirement. In most cases the deterioration has not been a consequence of additional costs related to accession; neither has it mainly been the result of automatic stabilisers - these are considerably smaller in acceding countries than in present EU members. Instead, the large - cyclically adjusted - deficits reflect increases in public wages and so-called mandatory social spending, combined with a lack of expenditure cuts in other fields. Consolidation is planned to take place mainly in the medium to long term, and deficits are only set to be reduced to levels compatible with the convergence criteria towards the end of the decade (Fig. 1).  Some of my central bank colleagues from the new member states argue that rapid entry into ERM II and the target of an early euro adoption is precisely what will force politicians in their respective countries to improve fiscal policy. In the words of one of my most eminent colleagues: “delay in entry equals delay in reforms”. Of course, I can understand this argument, and in the end it hinges on the political economy of each country. But using ERM II as a straightjacket is a risky strategy. It is all too reminiscent of the period 1990-92 in Sweden when the “nominal anchor” of the ECU peg was supposed to “bind us to the mast” but ended in a macroeconomic shipwreck. A botched entry into ERM II, with increasing public deficits, will be prone to economic and political instability. Furthermore, if meeting the convergence criteria is viewed as the main leverage for fiscal reform, it is worth remembering that this particular leverage disappears on EMU entry. A framework for fiscal policy  This brings me to my next topic: fiscal policy frameworks for countries in the currency union. This is an important issue, partly for the stability of the union as a whole. It was also the perspective behind the Stability and Growth Pact. But strong frameworks for public finances are also important for each individual country when they no longer have an independent monetary policy. Only if fiscal policy is in order can asymmetric shocks be dealt with in a reasonable way. The risk of asymmetric chocks is not necessarily higher in the acceding countries than in many of the present member states; in some cases it might even be smaller. A number of studies point to a relatively strong correlation in acceding countries with the business cycle of the euro area. However, it would be unwise to assume that no important asymmetric shocks relative to the rest of the euro area cycle will ever occur. Also, there are risks of domestically generated “political” shocks due to policy mistakes. We have had examples of this in Sweden and it could also happen in some other countries.  How can euro adopters prepare public finances for asymmetric shocks? This was a major issue in the Swedish debate ahead of the euro referendum. Despite the fact that there had been reforms in the public-finance framework in Sweden in the 1990s, the Riksbank and others argued that more should be done before joining the euro area.  2 BIS Review 53/2003 
Essentially two things are required: First, there is a need for sufficient margins in the public finances. In practice, this means that debt levels should not be too high. If the economy enters a downturn that does not affect the rest of the euro area to the same extent, it is important that there is scope to conduct more expansionary policy. If the scope is there, one can be reasonably sure that it will be used.  It is more difficult to handle the second, opposite situation - upturns and over-heating tendencies. What is then required is a framework that stimulates or even forces political decision-makers to act in time and to take decisions that might be difficult in the short run but that are correct in a longer perspective. Here we drew some inspiration from our monetary policy set-up. Fiscal policy could be guided by clear targets that are defined in terms of countries’ output gaps. Alternatively, national inflation targets could be introduced. In combination with transparent processes, including recurrent evaluations by national parliaments or in other arenas, this could put pressure on politicians to act.  Is the Stability and Growth Pact not sufficient in itself? After all, it is designed to ensure fiscal discipline in the member countries. The answer here is clear; it could have been had the Pact only been followed. But now the situation is different. As the Pact has not been followed by the larger euro countries, there is a risk that the newcomers will take the same attitude. However, this could be a dangerous conclusion. It would be wiser to look at the issue the other way round. Both Germany and France attained the 3 per cent mark for the public deficit criterion by the narrowest of margins despite what was a global upturn. But they clearly did not do enough afterwards in terms of consolidation, despite intense pressure from many of the smaller countries. Today, this is a significant problem not only for the euro area as a whole; the countries themselves are also paying the price in terms of a deeper and longer downturn. This, if anything, is a warning to new euro adopters. Conclusions Having raised these complex issues, let me be very clear about my sentiments. I do not wish to see any new obstacles or separate rules for the new member states; equal treatment is essential. No other rules for convergence should apply to the new euro adopters than those that have applied to present euro area participants or that would have applied to Sweden if we had voted “yes” to adopting the euro. Indeed, early euro adoption may be entirely beneficial for those new member states that have sufficiently stable and flexible economies and that have followed a course of fiscal prudence for a long time, just as I personally would have considered it beneficial for Sweden had we joined in 2006. Rather, it is in the euro adopters’ own interests to independently consider the risks. Countries that have used exchange rate flexibility should not rush into a system of fixed exchange rates before the conditions are right. If you have not already achieved fiscal discipline, do not enter ERM II nor opt for early euro adoption as leverage on the politicians to bring about such discipline. It is not only a matter of meeting the 3 per cent convergence criterion but also of reaching a maturity in fiscal policy that includes a transparent and predictable fiscal framework with sufficient room for manoeuvre for stabilisation policy. The road to the euro may otherwise become very rocky, and if the euro is eventually adopted, the trade-off between fiscal rectitude and stabilisation needs may become a recurring problem.  My advice would be to put your house in order first, and only after that enter ERM II and begin a quick process of euro adoption. Then you will have the best possible guarantee to reap the full benefits of monetary union.  Thank you. BIS Review 53/2003 3

Jean-Claude Trichet: Financial stability Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the Forum Financier Belge, Brussels, 26 November 2003. *      *      * A. Introductory remarks It gives me great pleasure to be here in Brussels and to address you in this very well-known forum at the kind invitation of Governor Quaden. The topic I shall be talking about today, namely “financial stability”, is obviously very broad and challenging.  My main topic of discussion will be the probable consequences the profound changes currently taking place in the financial sector will have on financial stability and on the policies of the Eurosystem in this regard. The main reason why I am talking about this topic - and why we at the ECB are following the issue - is that the stability of the banking sector and the financial system at large is of the utmost importance for the Eurosystem, as it is for any central bank. It is the precondition for a successful conduct of monetary policy and the maintenance of smoothly functioning payment systems, which are major responsibilities of a central bank. I would like to focus on three specific developments: the increasing importance of financial markets in general and market volatility more specifically, financial innovation, and the process in hand to increase the integration of financial systems across countries.  When thinking about the major challenges for maintaining financial stability I find it useful to first look at the notion of how the “real world” deviates from the “frictionless” ideal world of academic textbooks. In order to organise my reasoning, this can serve as a useful starting point, since in the ideal world there is no such thing as financial instability. Indeed, most of the concerns over financial stability actually stem from the fact that our “real world” financial markets have frictions or - in other words - market imperfections.  A fundamental friction is that financial market participants very often have imperfect information. When information is not perfect - or when markets are not fully transparent - investors’ decisions may be constantly subject to reassessment, which can lead to inevitable volatility in market prices. This does not necessarily mean that there is an inherent threat to financial stability. On the contrary, the very existence of some level of volatility indicates that markets are serving the function they are supposed to deliver - that they are an efficient exchange mechanism among economic agents. Nevertheless, some recent episodes of extreme volatility have drawn our attention to more accurately delineating the boundary between “normal” and what could be called “harmful” volatility. The second source of friction is that we also fall short of the ideal of having complete markets. Through the rapidly evolving process of financial innovation, new instruments - and often entirely new markets - are being created, taking us towards more complete markets and providing remedies for the shortcomings of more traditional instruments and markets. While this process clearly increases the efficiency of the financial system, some new risks may also be created along the way. A major recent example is the emergence of instruments to transfer credit risks between banks and other financial institutions. This is changing the activities and risk profiles of financial institutions, as previously credit risks were largely confined to banks.  One could consider that a third friction is that we lack an international framework for crisis prevention and resolution. Owing to the fact that supranational governments and judicial systems do not exist, national autonomy causes problems when it comes to practical implementation, possibly hindering a resolution of crises on a global scale. As financial systems inevitably become more integrated, risks stemming from the potential lack of a common framework increase accordingly. Substantial coordination efforts are being made by the international community to overcome this friction.  Here in Europe we have a unique situation, as we have gone further than any other region in terms of integration across national borders. Indeed, financial stability is increasingly a European, rather than national, concept. In particular, the single currency, the European System of Central Banks and single market for liquid reserves - the money market in euro - are creating a much more interconnected European financial system than is usually acknowledged. Consequently, cooperation efforts are being BIS Review 53/2003 1 
made by central banks and supervisory authorities to overcome the problems caused by the fact that supervision and oversight primarily remain a national responsibility.  The ECB - and the Eurosystem as a whole - is also enhancing its activities in the field of European financial stability. One part of these activities is visible through the regular articles and reports. Many other activities are less visible and take the form of discussions concerning financial stability in the ECB Governing and General Councils and ESCB Banking Supervision Committee, or our regular contribution to the strengthening of cooperation among relevant European authorities and our participation in international discussions.  I would like to organise the rest of my remarks around the three themes I have identified. First, I will look at what evidence is provided by past crises about the severity of the market frictions. Second, I would like to discuss the changes in the policy framework which have been made and, third, are being made in order to preserve financial stability.  B.  The three themes and financial stability  Past crises could give us some hints about what could also be important financial stability concerns in the future. One should not go too far back as the financial system is rapidly changing and one must always be prepared for surprises. Often the new crises come as complete surprises.  B.1 The growing role of financial markets and volatility Let me turn to my first theme - the growing role of markets. This development means that financial stability threats could increasingly stem from financial market problems. As I alluded to earlier, sudden and extreme shifts in expectations concerning the value of an asset and increased volatility could represent one major type of financial instability.  In Europe, most historical periods of financial instability have been linked to traditional loan losses by banks. However, if one looks at the longer-term perspective over the past 15 years or so, European financial markets have grown very rapidly. No doubt, the recourse to market-based finance in Europe is still significantly below that of the United States, but the gap seems to be rapidly narrowing. As the markets have grown and have become more liquid - thanks also to the euro - investors have been moving from bank deposits to direct and collective securities investments.  Whereas sharp and large price adjustments may not necessarily have systemic implications, financial institutions with leveraged market positions may be directly affected. The Russian crisis of August 1998 illustrates the point well, as mature markets experienced spillover effects through investors’ leveraged positions in Russia and other emerging markets. One such leveraged exposure was held by the LTCM hedge fund. Prior to the rescue undertaken by private banks and aided by the US Federal Reserve, liquidity plunged and prices in many markets dropped to very low levels. An additional element threatening the stability of the global financial system was that virtually all of the leveraged Treasury bond investors had similar positions, including major financial institutions.  Banks’ direct exposures may be an important aspect of financial instability in periods of financial market volatility. In addition, banks may hold significant exposures with non-bank financial institutions, which themselves suffer from direct market exposures. The Barings crisis in 1995 is an example of the first case, while the LTCM case is an example of the second.  In my view, the eventual scale of a systemic crisis might depend on the magnitude of the deviation of asset prices from fundamentals. How, then, do asset price bubbles get created in the first place? They may be created or exacerbated by some form of herding and overly buoyant investor expectations, as groups of investors imitate leading institutions’ strategies. Bubbles may be further boosted by a lack of adequate disclosure, problems of conflicts of interest, and destabilising trading or investment strategies.  Once bubbles burst, portfolio insurance strategies in the event of falling prices - or dynamic hedging - might heighten the downward spiral. Particularly in earlier episodes of equity-driven financial instability, such as the 1987 stock exchange crash, the initial wave of the sale of equity futures appears to have resulted in an accelerated decline in stock prices. However, the jury is still out on the role of tools such as portfolio insurance or automatic trading rules in exacerbating aggregate financial risk.  Less controversial seems to be the observation that downward spirals in prices can be magnified by the institutions involved in the selling wave of the crash, thereby generating contagion across markets 2 BIS Review 53/2003 
and countries. In particular, the Russian and LTCM crises demonstrate the important role of market liquidity as a potential channel of crisis contagion, as market price falls due to liquidity withdrawals could cause losses for many market participants.  To summarise the lessons learnt from past experiences, it seems that volatility is in itself not necessarily a threat to financial stability. Other elements are necessary before serious concerns arise over financial stability. One of the key elements is the risk faced by banks and other financial institutions, because this could be the channel through which the functioning of the financial system as a whole could be jeopardised. This view is supported by the recent episodes of market volatility in late 2002 and early 2003, when the sequence of substantial market readjustment was generally managed in an orderly manner by financial institutions across the globe.  B.2  Progressing financial innovation Let me turn to the second theme - the implications of progressing financial innovation. In fact, the reason why the latest episode of stock market adjustments did not cause systemic problems could be attributed to the contribution of financial innovation to the more even distribution of risks. However, some concerns have emerged regarding the securitisation and credit risk transfer markets, for instance. From the perspective of the public authorities, concerns have been expressed in particular about the lack of transparency on the identity of the ultimate risk holders and about adequate risk management by the institutions dealing with these instruments. In particular, financial innovations may be subject to problems when their behaviour has not yet been tested in difficult market conditions. As for any new instruments, probability analysis on the basis of historical data cannot be used for the credit risk transfer instruments that have been around for a few years only, and, thus, an accurate pricing of risk is not always possible. Inadequate data was already a problem in the use of Value-at-Risk models for risk management purposes by hedge funds prior to the Russian and LTCM crises. This kind of experience could reflect a lack of full understanding by market participants of the nature of the risks they face. Turning back to the credit risk transfer instruments, these instruments allow banks to sell their credit risks, and in so doing the risk profiles of other financial institutions, particularly insurance companies, are also transformed. Hence, a major outcome of the financial innovation process is the transformation of the traditional risks faced by financial institutions.  These developments also affect the effective supervision of financial institutions, as it is increasingly more difficult to obtain adequate information to monitor the complex and possibly fast-changing risk positions. The financial innovation process has, indeed, necessitated the revision of the traditional supervisory approach concerning banks and other financial institutions. It has also made it imperative to ensure that the risk management systems of the financial institutions themselves are able to handle the complexity of their activities.  B.3 Integration of European and global financial markets I would now like to turn to the last of my three themes. The increasing integration of national financial systems poses particular issues for the European Union and the euro area where integration is fairly advanced, although not fully complete. Integration and increasing international financing flows are also very much a global issue. Recently, in particular, some emerging market crises have had at least a potential for major spillover effects.  These financial stability risks may also be related to the growing complexity of the financing of emerging countries and the related coordination problems. With many more parties and instruments involved, it is inevitable that coordination is becoming a much more pressing problem than in the past, when a small number of major banks from the industrialised countries could come to an agreement with the issuer on the terms of repayment. With more sophisticated funding structures and the increasing use of debt securities, equality among creditors also becomes a more complex issue at times of debt restructuring. C. Policy framework aimed at preserving financial stability  Let me now look at policy responses to the issues raised by the market developments I have just described. The structure of this policy discussion will be based around three themes: the importance of BIS Review 53/2003 3 
transparency in order to overcome information-related problems, reactions to financial innovation and, lastly, increasing integration and potential international spillovers of crises.  C.1 Responses to the lack of information The information imperfections illustrated by recent episodes of market turmoil notably include incomplete and disparate published information by firms traded on the markets. I see key challenges in harmonising and improving the availability of information. The ultimate objective is to allow for rational investment decisions and a correct pricing of risk. Much has been done at global level and by the EU Financial Services Action Plan to increase the degree of transparency supporting the working of financial markets. This action has intensified since the high-level corporate failures in the United States, which demonstrated that there is ample scope for misleading investors through the manipulation of accounts and the information disclosed. Maybe the most eye-catching reform - and a key challenge for companies and banks in particular - is the introduction of new accounting standards. The International Accounting Standard Board and the Federal Accounting Standard Board are both constantly trying to improve and harmonise these frameworks on both sides of the Atlantic. Indeed, harmonised and high quality accounting standards could make a significant contribution to the integration and efficiency of financial markets, and these could also help in Europe where the differences in accounting rules could affect the cross-country comparability of firms’ accounting information. In Europe, the reform of IAS 32 and 39 represents an attempt to improve the comprehensiveness of banks’ disclosure requirements. In recent years, banks’ risk exposure has shifted to instruments that have, up to now, not been reported as assets. What is maybe most important is the increased reliance of financial institutions on derivatives contracts, which has resulted in growing disparities between the information contained in financial statements and the true risk profiles of the reporting entities. The new accounting standards to be finalised next year will introduce a definition of financial instruments. They will also cover derivative instruments, which will have to be reported on balance sheets. As a consequence, information quality and coherence will be improved, providing a more accurate reflection of the new financial environment.  However, the framework that is emerging is still far from satisfactory. The revised accounting standards will most likely include an option for banks to measure any financial asset or liability at fair value. This means that instruments for which a market price is not available could also be valued on the basis of an estimate of a fair value. Several serious concerns arise from this approach. Comparability of financial statements could be affected, as the same transaction could be carried out at different values by competing financial institutions. Moreover, if the reliability of the valuation of non-traded assets is limited, the quality of the information contained in financial statements is going to deteriorate, thus allowing imbalances to build up without the possibility of activating correcting mechanisms.  What concerns us most is the potential impact on financial stability. Empirical investigations recently conducted by the ECB suggest that the extensive use of fair value accounting could significantly increase the volatility of banks’ balance sheets. Valuation effects might also reduce the ability of financial institutions to react to adverse shocks, thus enhancing pro-cyclicality. These concerns are severe and great caution is warranted in the reform of accounting standards.  More accurate and timely market information is also useful from a supervisory perspective. Supervisors are indeed relying increasingly on markets as a disciplining tool for financial institutions - thus complementing their own activities. The future role of financial markets in the supervisory toolbox is likely to increase, despite possible periods of heightened volatility in financial markets. In particular, the reform of the capital framework for banks (Basel II) will introduce market discipline as an independent pillar of the framework.  C.2 Responses to financial innovation The process of financial innovation I referred to earlier poses at least two key challenges for policy-makers. First, the supervisory framework needs to be constantly updated. Second, the legislative process needs to react in an effective and timely manner to the challenges created by market developments.  4 BIS Review 53/2003 
As regards banks, the first Basel Capital Accord agreed in late 1988 has served its purpose well in terms of raising the capital levels of banks and making them safer. However, financial innovation, in particular the securitisation of banks’ assets, has left Basel I outdated and easily circumvented. As a consequence, the need to reform the existing Accord is widely recognised and supervisors are working very hard to shape the new Accord in close consultation with the private sector.  The Basel II Accord is aimed at bringing the capital requirements closer to the true economic risks in banks’ portfolios and at offering a wide range of options and approaches to respond to the increased complexity of financial instruments. Basel II is achieving all of this basically by relying more on banks’ internal models in the supervisory process. An important by-product is, therefore, that there is a lot of pressure on banks to improve their risk management systems. Improvements are already visible. It seems clear to me that more supervisory efforts, similar to those in the banking sector, may also be needed in the other sectors of financial institutions, for example in insurance. The ECB has drawn attention since the early stages of the Basel II process and the implementation of the framework in the EU to macro-prudential implications and to the possibility of increased pro-cyclicality of certain provisions. When bank capital is largely based on risk and risk increases in a recession, macroeconomic consequences might arise through a procyclical reduced ability of banks to lend. These concerns have been appropriately addressed in the revised proposals submitted for consultation by the Basel Committee and the European Commission. Pro-cyclicality concerns are substantially mitigated and a good balance can be found between risk-sensitivity and macroeconomic stability. Of course, attention will have to be paid to these aspects in terms of the implementation of the new framework as well.  C.3 Responses to further integration Let me talk next about the challenges caused by the third development, progressing financial integration. I will first discuss some of the relevant European issues and then turn to global issues. EU/euro area issues In the EU there is first of all the challenge of increasing the efficiency of the complex regulatory process to meet the pace of innovation sustained by the markets and to increase regulatory convergence across countries in order to support integration and reduce the burden on financial institutions operating in several countries. The so-called Lamfalussy procedure - where some experience has already been gained in securities supervision - will seek to do precisely this, and will also improve the state of affairs in banking and insurance supervision.  The deepening market integration experienced in the EU has given rise to the need for enhanced supervisory cooperation and common financial stability surveillance. As regards pure, micro-level supervisory cooperation, cooperation is being gradually stepped up through the “Lamfalussy procedure” and the establishment of the so-called level three committees, where supervisors exchange views - the primary aim being to achieve a consistent implementation of the existing legal framework.  We need adequate cooperation between central banks and supervisory authorities as well as a safeguard in relation to crisis prevention. The ESCB Banking Supervision Committee has long been working as the interface between the EU central banks and banking supervisory authorities. It combines the macro-level perspective of central banks, which are best placed to monitor ongoing developments in the financial system, with the equally important micro-level approach of the supervisory authorities to provide a joint and comprehensive assessment of the stability of the EU banking sector. Let me also note the importance of having appropriate arrangements at EU level for financial crisis management. Good progress has been made as a result of the recommendations of the Brouwer report. Notably, the Banking Supervision Committee has concluded a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation and information-sharing in crisis management situations between all central banks and banking supervisors of the EU.  Global issues At international level, examples of how effective crisis management and resolution is hindered by the absence of a common legal framework are well documented. However, a common legal framework is only one important element required for the orderly pursuit of international finance. Another would be a BIS Review 53/2003 5 
6 BIS Review 53/2003 concrete enforcement mechanism, but this is possibly inconceivable in the context of sovereign states. Indeed, contractual arrangements are increasingly aimed at compensating for the lack of a common regulatory and enforcement framework. The response of the international community to coordination problems includes efforts in crisis prevention and crisis resolution. In the context of crisis prevention, the promotion of international standards and codes is a promising avenue. The policy response to alleviate crisis resolution has covered all three aspects involved: domestic adjustment, official financing and private sector involvement. Although all three are crucial to a successful crisis resolution, let me focus here on the last.  As regards private sector involvement, several proposals have been put forward, including the Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism (SDRM) proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This legally binding mechanism was based on the idea that some elements of bankruptcy mechanisms applicable in the domestic context to private or public sector entities could be used in a sovereign context. The idea of creating an SDRM has been put aside for the time being, mainly because of concerns over the potential adverse effect on borrowing costs. A second proposal, supported most enthusiastically by the private sector and by a number of sovereign issuers, is based on the use of collective action clauses (CACs). These clauses, which facilitate coordination among creditors by creating clear rules for reaching a binding agreement over a debt restructuring proposal, would become a regular feature of all new international bond issuance. CACs have the advantage of being easily integrated into market practices and having a straightforward structure, which makes them a powerful coordination tool for creditors holding debt of the same issuance. However, their contribution to solving coordination problems at the level of the total stock of outstanding debt of a country is less clear. Finally, a third proposal - and this is actually one I myself suggested at the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington in September 2002 - currently being studied by the Group of Twenty is to have a so-called Code of Good Conduct, which would set out best practices and guidelines for borrowers, lenders and the international community. The Group of Twenty consists of the G7 major industrialised countries, the largest emerging market economics and also the EU presidency, ECB, IMF and the World Bank, as well as the chairpersons of the International Monetary and Financial Committee and the Development Committee.  Although these best practices would be non-binding, they could improve the process of crisis resolution. In particular, the Code would spell out general principles for all parties involved and would also offer a “toolbox” of agreed instruments and best practices to be used by interested parties depending on the circumstances. The Code would also include CACs in the set of instruments to be recommended. In the October meeting, the Group of Twenty decided to encourage a group of issuers and market participants to engage in further discussion. D.  Concluding remarks In conclusion, the issues generated by the fast evolution of the financial system I have been speaking about today are very complex and demanding for public authorities. I hope that I have been able to demonstrate that some elements of the necessary public response are very encouraging, while others will require renewed efforts. My objective has also been to focus on European issues and to highlight the special conditions of the euro area and the role of the ECB and the Eurosystem in fostering financial stability.  Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for your attention. 
Jaime Caruana: The New Basel Capital Accord: why we need it and where we're at Remarks by Mr Jaime Caruana, Governor of the Bank of Spain and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, at the Fifth Meeting of the Asian Program of the Institute of International Finance, Beijing, 17 November 2003. *      *      * I’d like to thank the Institute of International Finance and the Bank of China for hosting this discussion on the outlook for banking and finance in Asia. For many reasons, it seems especially appropriate to discuss this topic here in Beijing. The tremendous growth of China’s economy, its recent accession to the World Trade Organisation, and the wide scope of change that is occurring here has made China a reference for the world. I am very pleased to have this opportunity to discuss with you some of the efforts of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to promote financial systems better able to sustain growth and more resilient during periods of distress. It is an honour to address this forum, but I must confess that I have come to listen and to learn. The message I am consistently hearing is on the one hand one of strong support for the principles of the New Capital Accord and on the other a desire for the best standard for financial systems in each country. Too many examples have illustrated the economic costs and social unrest that weakly capitalised and poorly managed banks can inflict on an economy. It seems to me that we all recognize the importance of a sound banking system to our economic well-being. In recent years, central bankers and supervisors around the world have been working hard on the new requirements for bank capital. I think you are familiar with the idea that, “he who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever.” For the last five years, we in the Basel Committee have asked for comments and ideas from the industry, from academia, and from the community of supervisors on how to improve the international capital standards. The wealth of ideas and views that so many shared with us has made the process longer than we expected, but the benefit of this open and honest dialogue is that we are better able to achieve a sound and balanced accord. I think that we are very close to meeting our objective. Today I would like to emphasise, perhaps even over-emphasize, three words that have guided our work on the New Accord, namely balance, consistency and cooperation. We seek a balanced approach so that the new capital guidelines can be applied around the world. A balanced approach that can be both meaningful to global organisations and yet flexible enough to be applied to smaller, more regionally focused banks. We have worked hard to strike a right balance between many other competing objectives, such as finding the balance between introducing incentives for banks to improve their risk management and implementing a system of prescriptive rules. We have sought a balance between complexity and risk sensitivity; between complexity and comparability; between soundness and conservatism; and between flexibility and consistency, and so on. Even the structure of the accord can be regarded as a balance among three different policy approaches: rules, discretion and market discipline. In addition to seeking a balance in the New Accord, the Committee’s work has also been guided by two other words, namely consistency and cooperation. I will have more to say about both later, but I would like to emphasize the word “consistency” now. We will achieve the full potential of a prudential standard such as the New Capital Accord only when we support it with other financial economic policies and regulations that share a consistent set of goals. Policy makers have long understood the value of monetary stability, and in recent years we have learned much about the importance of financial stability and how it interacts with our monetary policies. Interactions between the real economy and financial markets are becoming more intricate on a domestic level and more relevant to the global economy. Indeed, sound fiscal policies, combined with monetary stability aims based on strong financial institutions, and prudent regulations in technical areas such as accounting, provisioning and bankruptcy are valued and necessary companions to financial regulations such as the New Capital Accord. In my remarks today, I’d like to begin with a brief reminder of why bank supervisors and banks around the world believe that we need a “New Basel Accord.” Then, I’ll discuss the New Accord’s structure BIS Review 52/2003 1 
and share some of the latest news on what the Committee is doing to finishing the framework so that banks will be ready to implement it in the coming years. Finally, I’ll conclude with some thoughts on the transition to the New Capital Accord. Why we need a New Accord We might begin by recalling why we care so much about capital - and why we felt that we needed a new capital accord, which is the first topic I will address today. In many ways, supervisors view capital as the last line of defence in a bank. When risk management is insufficient, when reserves are exhausted, capital absorbs losses to prevent a bank’s failure. But when capital runs out, the bank may become insolvent, leaving public authorities and taxpayers responsible for restoring depositors’ savings. The challenge is determining how much capital is sufficient. As you know, one of the Basel Committee’s best-known achievements was the release in 1988 of an agreement on how to define and measure the adequacy of a bank’s capital. The 1988 Basel Capital Accord was a milestone. For the first time, supervisors agreed on a definition of capital and a minimum requirement that has been adopted in over 100 countries. More importantly, the Accord reversed a downward trend in internationally active banks’ capitalisation, thereby strengthening the health and stability of the global banking system. In the years since 1988, the drawbacks of a simple approach to capital regulation have become more apparent. Advances in technology and telecommunications, innovation in banking products and services, and the increasing globalisation of financial markets have changed the way that many banks measure and manage risk. Today, the 1988 Accord no longer provides these banks - and their supervisors - with reliable measures of the actual risks they face. The structure of the New Accord In response, the Committee decided in the late 1990’s to refine the measures for assessing and managing risk in the Basel Accord. But we wanted to achieve more than a simple update of the rules. Instead, we wanted to incorporate the best practices used by leading organisations across the industry. By doing so, we hope to strengthen the stability of the global financial system, something that would benefit not just banks but the society at large. In undertaking this challenge, banks and supervisors recognise that having adequate levels of capital is not enough to ensure success in banking - or even long-term survival. A bank’s long-term success is determined chiefly by the quality of its management and controls, which together make up its first line of defence. The New Basel Accord seeks to capture the relationship between the adequacy of capital and the quality of risk management by relying on three important and mutually reinforcing “pillars”. These consist of, first, the minimum capital requirements; second, supervisory review; and third, market discipline. The three pillars themselves reflect the trend among bank supervisors to embrace a balanced philosophy of regulation that provides incentives to banks to manage their risks appropriately. The first pillar, for example, seeks to align capital requirements more closely to the actual risks that banks face. But the minimum requirements provide economic incentives - in the form of lower capital charges - for those banks that develop better measures for their exposures to risk and better techniques for managing their risks. Banks with more traditional exposures and less complex operations will be better able to ensure that the their capital base is sufficient for the level of credit risk they face by aligning their capital requirements with external measures of their borrowers’ creditworthiness. The most sophisticated approaches to credit or operational risk will allow banks to rely increasingly on their own assessments of risk to determine how much capital to hold. This puts the responsibility for assessing and responding to risk in the most appropriate place, namely in a bank’s own management and directors. They are in the best position to know their customers and their risks, and it is therefore most appropriate - and critically important - that they understand their responsibility for administering the bank’s assets and its activities in a responsible manner The second pillar highlights the important role that supervisors play in ensuring that each individual bank is holding adequate capital. Under the New Accord, supervisors will be responsible for evaluating 2 BIS Review 52/2003 
the internal processes banks use to determine their need for capital to ensure that managers are exercising an appropriate degree of judgement. The responsibility of a supervisor is to ensure that the banking system operates in a safe and sound manner and that individual banks are run by capable and competent leaders. But supervisors are not the managers of the banks. The decision on how each bank should best respond to different risks: that job should always rest with senior managers and a bank’s board of directors. Instead, by engaging managers in a dialogue about the risks they face and the controls they have adopted to address them under the second pillar, supervisors create incentives for managers to behave prudently and find ways to improve their performance. The third pillar seeks to leverage the ability of markets to provide discipline to banks to ensure that they are not holding unrealistically low levels of capital. By improving the quality of banks’ public reporting of their risks and the measures they take to control them, we intend to strengthen the ability of other market participants to understand a bank’s risk profile. When investors, customers, and even other banks have access to better information on how well a bank is managing its risks, they are better able to make business and investing decisions relevant to that bank, which can create a powerful incentive for bank management to improve their handling of those risks. Together, the three pillars of minimum requirements, supervisory review, and market discipline are intended to ensure that banks understand their risks and take adequate precautions to protect themselves against those risks through their control structures and their holdings of capital. But most importantly, banks will have incentives to find better ways to identify, measure, and manage their exposures. Current status of New Accord This past summer, we concluded our third round of public consultations on the proposals, and I’d like now to give you a sense of the current status of the New Accord, which is the second topic I will address today. By now you may have read that the Basel Committee reached an agreement last month to address the final issues raised in public consultations over the summer and to complete the new rules by mid-year 2004. This was no easy task, as the Committee received over 200 comment letters on the Third Consultative Paper, or “CP3”. While we might have been somewhat surprised by the number of responses that we received, we were not surprised by the hard work that was evident in the letters. On this note, I would like to offer the Committee’s appreciation to the banks, banking associations, including the members of the IIF, and public agencies in Asia and elsewhere that devoted considerable time and resources to the consultations. If you’ve been following our work since the first consultative paper was released in 1999, you know that the proposals have evolved and improved considerably thanks to the honest responses and letters that you and others shared with us. At the Committee’s meeting last month, all members acknowledged our responsibility to consider carefully all comments. At the same time, we recognised the need to resolve the open issues and release the New Accord as soon as possible so that banks can continue to prepare for the new rules. In a statement to the press after our meeting, the members of the Committee noted that we expect to take account of the remaining issues and complete the text of the New Accord in the coming months and not later than mid-year 2004. Let me briefly mention some of the issues present in the comment letters. Complexity and the balance with risk sensitivity and comparability Certainly a key issue that we are addressing is balancing the complexity of the agreement with the need to be sensitive to risk and to offer different kinds of banks comparable approaches. It is true that the New Accord offers a far more sophisticated view of risk than the far simpler 1988 Accord does. But that is our intent. We seek to adopt the best measures of credit and operational risk. In the field of credit risk, for example, loan officers and risk managers in leading banks worldwide have at their disposal a constantly evolving array of databases, software, credit risk models, and risk rating systems, all of which provide supplemental empirical insight into a risk once not readily quantified. And all of these new tools were initially developed or refined to promote a bank’s competitiveness and protect it against loss - and not just to respond to a regulatory mandate. BIS Review 52/2003 3 
Nonetheless, the Committee is seeking a balance between complexity and risk-sensitivity. When a complex rule fails to add much to the New Accord’s measures of risk, the Committee has worked to remove it. Most recently, for example, we announced in our Madrid press release that we will simplify the proposals for securitisation exposures. At the same time, the industry has asked that the Committee not sacrifice risk sensitivity where it makes sense. The New Accord is a complex document partly because some banks felt disadvantaged under a simpler rule and wanted rules that were more comparable to their situations. They asked us to adopt more options for addressing the risks unique to a particular business or activity which, in some cases, required some complicated considerations. If you read just a few of the comment letters on our website, you will see that many of the latest suggestions from the industry would tend to increase the complexity of the New Accord even further. Still, we know that it is easier to enforce a simpler rule than a complicated one. As we complete the text of the new rules, we will continue to simplify and streamline the framework. Conservatism and the balance between soundness and conservatism A second issue that respondents to the proposals have raised is the sense that the New Accord may be highly conservative in its assumptions about how much risk exists in certain exposures. Questions about conservatism matter to us because we are trying to align capital more closely to risk and in a way that is conceptually sound. A good example would be the treatment of retail exposures, including the small and medium enterprises that fall into this category, where the Committee found persuasive economic evidence to support a significantly lower requirement compared to earlier drafts of the new rules. Another example we are evaluating currently concerns the treatment of credit losses for banks adopting one of the more sophisticated approaches to credit risk, the “internal ratings-based” or “IRB” approach. Our current rules for the IRB approach derived capital charges on mathematical estimates of a bank’s credit losses - both those that could be anticipated versus those that could not. Banks have criticised these proposals, since traditionally capital exists to protect a bank against only unexpected losses, while reserves are held when bank expects to experience credit losses. We are now seeking to revise the treatment of credit losses to calibrate capital only to losses that are not anticipated - or “unexpected losses” - and we have issued a proposal for comment on how to do so on our website. We will continue to evaluate the soundness of our assumptions in the New Accord and their relative degrees of conservatism in the final months ahead. Competition and the balance between flexibility and consistency Applying the New Accord consistently across countries is an essential goal for the Committee. By incorporating minimum standards in the New Accord, we want global competition in banking markets to be driven by each bank’s strengths, rather than by differences in each country’s rules. Moreover, Pillars Two and Three were created to a great degree to level the playing field for banks by encouraging more consistent supervisory approaches and public reporting. To advocate greater consistency in the application of the new rules, the Committee created the Accord Implementation Group to share experiences and encourage shared approaches. We expect these discussions to help supervisors apply the New Accord more consistently and to encourage greater cooperation among supervisors, which was one of the three words - together with balance and consistency - that I mentioned at the beginning as guiding the Committee’s work on the New Accord. Based on the Implementation Group’s work to date, the Committee published a paper last August on the “high level principles for the cross-border implementation of the New Accord”. In this paper, we reiterate our view that the traditional allocation of responsibilities to home and host supervisors will continue. Cooperation will be critical for effective supervision under the New Accord, especially considering the need for an internationally active bank to receive the approval to adopt, and then validate, advanced approaches to credit and operational risk at home and in host jurisdictions. Similarly, supervisors will need to find practical ways to cooperate in the evaluations of capital adequacy under the second pillar and ongoing reviews of compliance with the minimum operational requirements of the New Accord. 4 BIS Review 52/2003 
The Implementation Group and the Core Principles Working Group, which is made up of senior regulators from a variety of countries plus representatives of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund will meet for a second time in December to continue the discussions on issues related especially to the responsibilities and cooperation of home and host supervisors and issues that significant or systemically important foreign subsidiaries may pose for different jurisdictions. Based on the progress that leading banks worldwide have made in adopting more sophisticated approaches to risk management, many countries have indicated that they are planning to implement the New Accord, whether in the short or long run. This leads to the final topic I’d like to discuss, namely the issues related with the transition to the New Accord across the world. Broad application of the New Accord around the world, transition to Basel II In drafting a replacement for the 1988 Accord, the members of the Committee sought to ensure that the capital guidelines could be applied around the world to many kinds of banks. This means that our rules must build on the best practices, yet remain relevant to conventional banks in more traditional markets. The New Accord provides a “menu” of options for measuring risk, thereby offering the degree of flexibility necessary for banks of various sizes and strategic orientiations to adopt the new framework. Now that the New Basel Accord is moving away from a “one-size-fits-all” approach to capital, supervisors in every jurisdictions have the opportunity to evaluate what would be most appropriate for banks that are not large, complex, or internationally active. At the same time, we could say that Basel has moved away from a “one-schedule-fits-all” approach to implementing the new rules worldwide. Or, if you prefer, the Committee is saying to each country, “pick flowers when flowers bloom”. This suggestion is particularly crucial for supervisors who have adopted the 1988 Accord only recently. Some supervisors believe that their banks may still be strengthening their credit risk management functions and consequently would not benefit substantially from the New Accord at the moment. For these situations, the members of the Committee have long expressed their views that those banks and supervisors should concentrate on the fundamentals first. Banks in those countries should work toward developing an adequate understanding of the risks they face and a sense of the best practices in use worldwide. For example, banks should develop their understanding of the credit underwriting cycle, skill at credit analysis, and insight into the dangers posed by operational risks. They should nurture a healthy environment for corporate governance, such as by strengthening their systems of internal controls, by promoting robust internal and external audit processes, and by adopting sound standards for accounting, loan analysis and classification, provisioning and reporting. In turn, supervisors who are still fortifying the foundation of their banking systems may consider a variety of approaches to capital regulation. For some countries, the application of the simplest approaches from the New Accord may be appropriate. But others may feel that their banks are not yet ready and may decide, after careful review, that it would continue to apply the 1988 Basel Accord for several more years as banks continue to strengthen their risk management capabilities. I want to emphasise that the Basel Committee supports the decisions of those supervisors who believe that their markets may not yet be ready. We would encourage those countries that choose to remain on the 1988 Accord to look to the principles of the New Accord, and especially to strengthen the second and third pillars. Moreover, whether a country intends to implement the New Accord by the end of 2006 or perhaps later, the Basel Committee recommends that supervisors everywhere encourage their banks to strengthen their abilities to identify, measure, and manage the full range of risks they face through internal processes. At the same time, I am very encouraged to hear that banks and supervisors share the notion that none of our countries, regardless of our stage of development, can foster our own economic growth unless our banks are adequately capitalised and well managed, our financial systems stable, and our markets transparent and open. I believe that the New Basel Accord goes a long way toward achieving and strengthening those three objectives. Certainly we hope that, over time, more banks and more banking systems will adopt the more advanced approaches to risk measurement and management laid out in the New Accord. When banks are adequately capitalised and well-managed, they are better able to promote growth by providing credit to consumers and businesses alike. But more broadly, when banking systems worldwide are BIS Review 52/2003 5
