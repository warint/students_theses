 jürgen stark: main challenge monetary policy globalise world speech mr jürgen stark, member executive board european central bank, conference “monetary policy sub saharan africa: practice promise”, cape town, 28 march 2008. * * * 1. introduction the issue i invite reflect upon today, namely challenge monetary policy increasingly interdependent world, topic rank highly monetary policy makers’ agendas. the ongoing global financial market turmoil remind u country immune economic financial shock originate outside boundary jurisdiction. in pursue mandates, central bank need, therefore, ass implication economic financial integration conduct monetary policy. in remark today, i would first like address three questions: 1) how globalisation affect domestic inflation? 2) how globalisation alter way domestic economy react economic disturbances? 3) how globalisation affect way monetary policy impulse transmit economy? the answer three key question allow stress i consider main challenge monetary policy globalise world.1 2. the impact globalisation domestic inflation we agree globalisation offer great opportunities. it increase scope efficiency gain increase specialisation good use comparative advantage international production good services. in medium long term, reduce production costs, increase world’s production capacity generate gain pass consumer form low price large number good services. globalisation bring efficient allocation factor production, which, economy, increase level output sustain without generate inflationary pressures. in short medium term, increase volume develop country’s trade emerge low-cost country exert downward pressure price import good close substitute develop economy give rise gradual relocation production. view perspective, globalisation result significant shock term trade develop economies, integration china, india eastern europe world economy gradually increase global supply labour – particularly low-skilled labour. by make skilled labour relatively scarcer, globalisation reduce relative wage unskilled worker industrialise countries.2 1 for stylise fact trade globalisation probable effect euro area inflation, see ecb (2008). 2 the relative return skilled unskilled work measure relative shift labour demand. this measure incorporate relative wage relative hour worked. for instance, euro area, globalisation seem lead relative increase hour work sector employ highly skilled workers, relative wage remain fairly stable. in unite states, appear hour work wage increase sector employ highly skilled worker (ecb (2008)). bi review 35/2008 1 the secular decline observe transportation communication cost make easy firm relocate production good service require large amount low-skilled labour newly emerge economies, industrialise country tend specialise production good service require large amount skilled labour. for example, euro area specialise medium high-tech exports, comparison china, specialise mainly low-tech sector textiles, clothe footwear. in fact, technological progress fast many good service even possible allocate different stage production chain different part globe, accordance relative level skilled unskilled labour. a result, major oecd economy import price decline relative domestic producer price last 20 years. estimate oecd staff3 suggest period 1996 2005 integration world trade non-oecd economy – particularly china asian economy – reduce annual domestic inflation average around 0.2 percentage point unite state euro area.4 over last two three years, however, globalisation also see effect world demand. economic development bring increase global consumption food commodities, especially china asian countries. this result high food commodity price worldwide, have, extent, offset effect low price import good service domestic inflation. there much monetary policy sudden, perhaps permanent, increase relative price food commodities, accommodate mechanical, first-round, effect headline inflation. however, central bank aim maintain price stability medium term carefully monitor price wage formation dynamic inflation expectation remain firmly anchor second-round effect emerge. this imply objective monetary policy must define term aggregate term partial so-called “core” price index excludes, example, food energy prices, order allow central bank identify timely manner long-lasting trend dynamics. in assessment monetary policy stance, central bank realise ultimate impact increase price oil commodity – include food – inflation output dynamic depend crucially reaction economic agents, particularly participant labour product markets. their reaction influence expectation regard response monetary policy developments. an absence second-round effect follow food commodity price pressure depend crucially inflation expectation firmly anchor level line central bank’s objective. in presence food commodity-driven pressure headline inflation, always risk inflation expectation become unanchored damage wage-price spiral established. give cost curb unpleasant inflation dynamic started, price stability-oriented central bank react timely pre-emptive manner basis comprehensive analysis shock headline inflation. 3 pain sollie (2006). 4 pain sollie (2006) argue unite state impact evenly distribute ten-year period considered, whereas euro area disinflationary effect concentrate mainly period 2001-05. 2 bi review 35/2008 3. the impact globalisation structure domestic economy over past 20 year experience significant decline level volatility inflation develop emerge economies. this often associate grow empirical evidence flatten phillips curve. can globalisation alone account change way domestic economy – inflation particular – react economic shocks? globalisation may play role process two distinct channels. first, short-run phillips curve, typically relate inflation excess domestic demand, may flatten owe increase observe trade production specialisation across countries, domestic inflation increasingly affect cost pressure arise trade partners.5 second, globalisation may play role reduce inflationary effect excess demand link reduce ability firm increase mark-ups presence aggregate demand shocks.6 globalisation may, example, increase competition, reduce firms’ ability pas increase cost consumer prices.7 without neglect impact globalisation inflation, main factor responsible reduce sensitivity inflation excess domestic demand certainly substantial improvement see across many economic region conduct monetary policy. after great inflation 1970s, policymakers worldwide progressively recognise importance sound institutional framework macroeconomic performance, particular role central bank independence achieve maintain price stability. the independence central bank ensure monetary policy focus inflation without distract political desire fine-tune economy exploit perceive short-term trade-off inflation output growth, exist long term conducive creation high level inflation. economic agent gradually come term significant shift credible, price stability-oriented monetary regime adjust inflation expectation accordingly.8 the lesson monetary policy-makers clear: room complacency reason believe inflation bring control forever. independence alone suffice translate actual price stability. 5 galí monacelli (2005) model small open economy trade infinite number foreign economies. in model’s phillips curve, show open economy substitutable domestic good regard foreign goods, low coefficient domestic output gap becomes. research conduct imf bi (imf (2006) borio filardo (2007)) find support evidence hypothesis increase international trade production specialisation increase importance global indicator economic slack inflation, relative domestic indicators, explain domestic inflation develop countries. ciccareli mojon (2005) also argue sample oecd economy domestic inflation drive global inflation process, short horizon function global real developments. the robustness evidence remain controversial, however, empirical estimate depend specification estimate phillips curve (ihrig et al. (2007)). 6 batini et al. (2005). 7 rogoff (2003) contend globalisation may, fact, opposite effect firms’ price behaviour, argue increase competitive pressure arise globalisation mean cost firm set price wrong level much high would le competition. hence, globalisation would lead firm revise price frequently and, eventually, increase sensitivity inflation demand fluctuation steepen phillips curve. 8 coogley sbordone (2008) also argue lack persistence inflation recent year due low inflation environment. bi review 35/2008 3 central bank would well advise regard observe flatten phillips curve structural feature economy unrelated monetary policy. the ongoing increase price oil commodity – include food – already threaten spill price sub-components increase pressure general price level develop emerge countries. in circumstances, central bank must deviate commitment price stability. 4. the impact globalisation transmission mechanism monetary policy let turn impact globalisation could way monetary policy affect inflation, namely transmission mechanism monetary policy, implication central banks. in particular, i focus development financial markets, give fundamental role chain transmit monetary policy impulse rest economy. first all, increase financial market integration likely increase impact shock – include monetary policy action – originate particular country economic region global economy. in last 25 year ratio total foreign asset liability gdp triple industrialise country increase 150% emerge develop countries.9 the liberalisation national financial markets, decline communication cost vibrant financial innovation fuel cross-border investment flows. this increase importance global factor price assets, relationship supply demand capital savings, well risk premia investor require hold certain assets.10 thus, surprise central bank traditionally devote substantial amount resource understand way foreign development affect domestic objective way monetary policy decision transmit rest economy. to fully appreciate impact change global financial system monetary policy transmission mechanism, one bear mind two key feature financial market developments: rapid financial product innovation emergence new financial intermediaries. financial innovation, theory, generally supportive economic growth improve allocation savings, contribute create deep complete financial markets. furthermore, normal circumstances, increase efficiency transmission mechanism monetary policy central banks’ action potentially influence large number economic agents. in general, monetary policy stable interest rate le volatile small policy rate change would need order achieve desire effect aggregate demand. 9 lane milesi-ferretti (2006). 10 there grow body literature support view transmission financial market development across world recent year reach point financial market give country react economic news expect change path monetary policy rate major industrialise economies.. see, example, ehrmann et al. (2005). 4 bi review 35/2008 however, several episode post-war history witness wave financial liberalisation innovation associate excessive market euphoria, lead unsustainable asset price dynamics. the ongoing financial market turbulence one example. in last year new compute information-processing technology support rise new – often esoteric – financial instrument explicitly design unbundle repackage pay-offs risk associate primitive, conventional financial product securities. this trend – originally aim improve share risk across saver – late extend lend institutions, which, context search high returns, lead exponential growth credit derivative credit default swap (cdss) collateralised debt obligation (cdos). together number benefits, improve diversification risk deep capital markets, development also two negative side effects, namely significant increase leverage unprecedented growth marketisation financial instruments. the fact banks’ balance sheet shift away relatively illiquid asset (such mortgage loans) towards business model whereby bank originate underlie loan make tradable negotiate open market (the so-called “originate distribute” model) make hard draw clear distinction previously distinct category financial player. at time, new investor – notably hedge fund – bear need market-makers previously unknown type securities. the emergence new category investor financial intermediaries, behaviour incentive quite different traditional market player (such banks),11 combination product innovation, probably change way shock spread across financial markets. this probably also effect way monetary policy impulse transmit rest economy. the proliferation financial intermediary add value primarily securitising make liquid – i.e. render tradable market place – asset year ago would highly illiquid remain banks’ balance sheet increase ability financial system create supply liquidity. however, securitisation illiquid asset mortgage loan foster unsustainable dynamic price underlie assets, product sufficiently transparent, “originate distribute model” seek create market liquidity way increase systemic risk ultimately increase risk price stability. the mechanism was, last summer, fuel creation liquidity credit could start work opposite direction. regulatory weakness allow explosion credit creation basis what, ex post, clearly show faulty assumption regard true level market risk. beyond considerations, however, question policy-makers whether central bank ought active circumstance adapt conduct change occur monetary transmission mechanism. in view, ecb show ready take necessary step ensure provision sufficient liquidity allow financial system continue function properly. since first sign strain appear money market, ecb provide additional liquidity money markets. 11 rajan (2006). bi review 35/2008 5 liquidity-providing measure mean confuse weaken monetary policy stance. the ecb remain firmly focus price stability, policy stance reflect govern council’s assessment risk price stability euro area. central bank devote maximum effort understand extent transmission channel monetary policy may, stable macroeconomic environment, affect high degree integration global financial market ever complex market microstructures. for example, globalisation financial innovation may combine last two year make long end yield curve le responsive tighten monetary policy would expect basis historical experience – especially unite states, also euro area. it likely, fact, global ample liquidity, particular global save flow unite state drive unsustainably low risk return profile offer new financial product illusion credit risk premium almost disappeared. finally, central bank cautious communicate markets, public general, order make clear conditional nature monetary policy decision avoid foster unsustainable expectation among market participants. in circumstances, unfounded expectation particular future policy could amplify effect asset price thereby contribute build-up financial imbalances, would unwind quickly, costly manner, expectation change. this last observation lead another issue central bank academic scholar work many years, namely question whether central bank include asset price way target set interest rate – so, when. 5. asset price monetary policy to help discussion role asset price monetary policy, i would like first summarise i think generally share view look position hold two broad camp emerge debate. these camp arrive oppose policy conclusions. i believe almost everybody central bank academic community agree four points: first, central bank face exceptionally difficult task assess whether asset price drive fundamental give point time. therefore, central bank ought best obtain much information possible sustainability asset price developments, aware identify bubble real time risky business. thus, result assessment interpret particular caution. second, central bank target asset prices. target asset price would, definition, mean monetary policy’s response fundamentally-driven increase asset price similar response asset price bubbles, bubble often difficult identify real time. third, central bank take account information asset price forecast exercise assessment current state economy, asset price movement affect behaviour economic agent impact price stability. nonetheless, typically high level volatility asset price unstable link future macroeconomic condition suggest limit weight comparison indicators. 6 bi review 35/2008 fourth, although central bank influence asset price mean monetary policy actions, relatively large swing policy rate could need curb boom bust cycle asset price could pose significant threat macroeconomic stability short term. build generally agree conclusions, two possible monetary policy approach suggested. on one hand, argue central bank lean asset price bubbles, bubble potential create last distortion economy. in world asset price bubble difficult identify curb boom bust cycle asset price prove costly term inflation output, lean possible bubble see insurance policy case bubble indeed created. the proponent view argue even central bank wish target asset price directly, insurance desirable, give boom bust cycle asset price may damage economic stability. others, contrast, advocate sort flexible inflation-targeting approach. they argue premium “insurance policy” expensive, since, react change asset prices, central bank could seriously destabilise economy normal time bubble present. a result, argue, policy lean asset price could lead serious communication accountability difficulties. instead, propose central bank remain focus maintain price stability respond asset price extent provide information current future macroeconomic conditions. overall, central banker may draw lesson camps: first, asset price normally grant special role monetary policy-making. second, lean asset price movement may advisable circumstances: 1. probability asset price drive non-fundamental force estimate high; 2. probability bubble burst near future low; 3. bubble expect sensitive modest interest rate increases; 4. cost expect collapse asset prices, bubble allow persist, estimate significant. while lean asset price consider central bank case-by-case basis four condition i list met, tends, admittedly, happen rarely. the ecb’s two-pillar monetary policy strategy well suit cope challenge bring asset price developments. in particular, explicit monetary pillar guarantee ecb considerable expertise analysis monetary credit development analysis impact price stability. the close link monetary development evolve imbalance asset credit market imply monetary analysis enable detect imbalance early stage respond imply risk price financial stability timely forward-looking manner. this prove invaluable asset ecb, notably time global financial turbulence. bi review 35/2008 7 6. conclusion: globalisation change rule monetary policy-making challenge though globalisation may monetary policy, globalisation fundamentally alter rule monetary policy-making.12 over medium long term, inflation still remain monetary phenomenon. this mean price stability u achieve. while international liquidity condition may influence market interest rate thus transmission monetary policy real activity inflation, central bank retain ability control short-term interest rates, effect, turn, domestic cost credit long-term interest rates. however, i say earlier, success monetary policy dependent central bank properly adapt analysis line change environment, take account, among things, potential impact financial innovation liberalisation monetary policy transmission channel. in environment, clearly important stability-oriented monetary policy analyse development area external price international trade financial flows. asset price exchange rate necessarily give special status instead take account monetary policy extent impact price stability medium term. i shall conclude address today remark structure international financial architecture relationship domestic price stability-oriented monetary policies. my view, share member central bank community, best international monetary architecture one central bank focus achieve price stability home. this mean, however, individual monetary policy function isolation. on contrary, ongoing financial turmoil show value timely open exchange information international level central bank regulator presence increase financial globalisation. thank exist framework cooperation, ecb, conjunction major central bank around world, able recently – without change monetary policy stance – help avoid global liquidity squeeze provide euro area financial system additional refinance period heighten risk aversion. however, cooperation mean coordination. each central bank one policy instrument, instrument achieve single domestic objective, namely price stability. a result, central bank would well advise react foreign development become relevant domestic price stability. international cooperation help exploit synergy exist monetary policy-making view establish environment global monetary stability. reference batini, n., b. jackson s. nickell (2005), “an open economy new keynesian phillips curve uk”, journal monetary economics, vol. 52, pp.

ranee jayamaha: saarc payment initiative policy response speech dr ranee jayamaha, deputy governor central bank sri lanka, inauguration "saarc payment initiative", central bank sri lanka, colombo, 28 march 2008. * * * 1. it great pleasure i thank attend inaugural session saarc payment initiative. it indeed historic event landmark development payment system saarc region, first time member central banks, group, decide pay focus attention area activity. it also important achievement central bank sri lanka able pioneer effort establish saarc payment initiative. 2. the saarc payment initiative, launch today, intend • assist individual saarc country prepare domestic payment strategy forward look development plan; • design coordinate regional approach cross-border payments, take consideration implication trade, investment, central bank policy, foreign exchange position management; • clear impediment experience member area policy, operation communications, legal regulatory aspects, technical institutional infrastructure, engage research statistical analysis. 3. during course saarc payment initiative, member country able learn effort experience development payment within region, well outside. some member country may acquire modern communication infrastructure advance payment system support delivery payment settlement service required, markets, also regional market. in effect, saarc payment initiative able to: (a) guide effort member country modernize national payment systems; (b) assist establish appropriate technological link others region; (c) bring payment system appropriate standard compatible international standards. 4. the importance payment system 4.1 the broad term “payment systems” include payments, also clear settlement systems. payment system represent basic infrastructure function market economy develop inclusive financial systems, include enhancement access finance. the soundness efficiency payment system fundamental stability currency, well financial system and, therefore, sustain economic development. 4.2 it context govern law region’s central bank include reference responsibility central bank promote monetary, financial payment system respective countries. if i may quote john exter’s report 1949 establishment central bank ceylon, (the former name present central bank sri lanka), state “it monetary, financial payment system facilitate flow money economy such, central bank ceylon undertake great responsibility promote economic well-being country”. although modern central bank concentrate primarily price stability financial system stability, objective cannot satisfactorily achieve without simultaneous development payment systems. therefore, stage, central bank bi review 35/2008 1 pay attention payment system development, although take grant many recent times. 5. advance transformation payment system development 5.1 payment system undergo profound change recent years, primarily term increase complexity production differentiation payment service offer customer nationally, regionally internationally. payment system evolve towards evermore universal sophisticate level operation. in wholesale retail areas, new technologies, new participant new alliance begin transform payment system landscape. this transformation largely due development information communication technology, integration globalization financial market regional international level. 5.2 one by-product transformation blur distinction wholesale retail activities. another grow integration domestic international payment flows, effort make develop efficient cross-border clear mechanisms. the emergence non-banks payment system, play prominent role introduce significant new developments, by-product transformation. bank still remain forefront change, speed non-banks advance new area activity, significant threat banks. this trend emerge sri lanka non-bank card issue agency begin compete bank provide payment services. these change prompt central banks, pursuit mission ensure smooth function payment systems, establish structure oversight function foster stable, orderly efficient development area financial system. 6. the public’s preference public policy 6.1 in assess might drive change influence outcome payment systems, must start understand public goals. regardless mechanism involved, people expect payment system posse least three fundamental characteristics. first, must integrity, i.e. transaction must safe, reliable, secure. second, must accessible available all. finally, must competitive efficient, i.e. cost make payment affordable. to make effective contribution development payment & settlement also increase trade investment flow nationally regionally, necessary identify common theme form public policy goals. in context, central bank call upon take certain minimum action goals. 6.2 however, manner intensity current involvement central bank payment system development differ one country another. the root central bank’s specific pattern involvement lie different institutional structure tradition country. the central bank may accordingly decide appropriate action, beyond minimum, depend national institutional background. 7. importance regional effort 7.1 by large, central bank saarc region elsewhere currently involve payment system three main ways, namely, operational capacity, payment system overseers, catalyst facilitator market regulatory evolution. 7.2 a central bank aware, market may encounter persistent impediment payment system development may become unable produce efficient safe services. the existence impediment would give rise policy issue central 2 bi review 35/2008 banks, especially due responsibility achieve core objectives, price stability financial system stability. these impediment take form legal regulatory inefficiencies, structural performance weakness markets, outmode standard infrastructure used, lack attention central bank regulatory authorities. while important national central bank address issue find remedial action early, give increase trade, investment cross-border financial flows, essential region common understand apply, possible, common standards. 7.3 the design every payment system require series trade-off different element objectives. the precise outcome trade-off vary, closely base national reality international best practice. this emphasize need close continuous consultation country supplier payment service central bank overseer regulator systems. the ultimate target consultation ensure easy availability country payment system meet need users, enable supplier cover costs, absorb excessive proportion national resources. that many regional payment system development initiative spring last decades. for example, south african development community (sadc payment initiative – 1996), western hemisphere payment initiative (1999); commonwealth independent state payment initiative (2004); arab payment initiative (2005) well function regional payment initiatives. the common objective effort identify possible measure improve safety, efficiency integrity regional payment systems. 7.4 the demand factor, common all, rapidly change global payment system infrastructure challenge existence domestic regional payment systems, lag behind. give increase sophistication cross-border transactions, need mitigate risk involve use outmode infrastructure give priority. the saarc payment system development strategy therefore design cater region’s present needs, also future demands. 8. how saarc payment initiative work? 8.1 let briefly set propose institutional structure saarc payment initiative. 8.2 by consensus, hon. governor saarc central bank request central bank sri lanka take lead effort. we happy catalyst promoter, hope appropriate time, initiative drive saarc member central banks. in consultation saarc governors, already appoint saarc payment council (spc), compose chairperson national payment council (npcs) saarc member country senior official appoint governor central bank country npcs. the npc payment committee coordinate liaise stakeholder payment area, particular, bank financial institutions, stock exchanges, security traders, stock brokers, service providers, regulator legal professionals. 8.3 the spc report saarcfinance governor annual general meet obtain general approval implementation road map discuss rest today. the spc assist secretariat operational matters. for time being, mr siriwardena, director/ payment & settlement central bank sri lanka, kindly agree secretary spc. the secretariat take lead prepare road map establish working/study group key areas, particular, policy communication, infrastructure, research statistical analysis legal regulatory framework. bi review 35/2008 3 8.4 the advisory role play international standard setter agency regional payment initiative important. in regard, committee payment settlement system (cpss) bank international settlement (bis), standard setter payment system development global basis, intimate willingness provide technical assistance guidance saarc payment initiative. similarly, inform world bank also will provide technical assistance advice enable saarc payment initiative start sound footing. the presence distinguish official world bank inauguration encouragement. 8.5 the saarc member central bank happy able get saarc payment initiative grind within short period time. give enthusiasm commitment us, i hope we, regional group, make substantial contribution trade, investment economic activity country also region, whole. thank you. 4 bi review 35/2008 seong-tae lee: household debt – implication monetary policy financial stability open address mr seong-tae lee, governor chairman bank korea, bank korea/bank international settlement seminar, bank korea, seoul, 28 march 2008. * * * open remark lady gentlemen, i bid sincere welcome central banker participate seminar hold jointly bi bank korea. let also express deep gratitude keynote speaker, dr. eric rosengren, president federal reserve bank boston. this seminar, part asian research programme bis, hold allow exchange central bank's experience opinion concern major monetary policy issues. the theme seminar, "household debt: implication monetary policy financial stability", great interest u all. it closely relate current international financial market turmoil generate u sub-prime mortgage meltdown. background increase household debt a well aware, household debt many country increase quite sharply since early 2000's. in us, ratio household debt gdp rise 75% 2000 104% 2007. this lead largely expansion mortgage lending. accord analysis imf, household debt 12 asian country include korea, japan china grow average 15% per year 2002 2006. about two-thirds growth consist increase mortgage debt. the reason rapid buildup household debt find certain extent demographic changes. the age baby boom generation, together urbanization, fuel steady increase house demand. to mind, however, even great factor behind increase household debt continuation low inflation low interest rates. over last years, heighten productivity base it revolution progress globalization serve keep price stable. in line this, central bank every country maintain policy rate low levels. this result low lend rates, subsequently lead even great demand household loans. a anticipation real estate price increase form owe abundant global liquidity, mortgage lend purpose speculative house purchase also expand sharply. in u advance countries, moreover, mortgage securitization transfer credit risk make easy thank development advance financial techniques. this act additional factor boost household debt. assessment increase household debt this great increase household debt bring positive effect macro economy, well household welfare financial institution business. bi review 35/2008 1 the expand borrow opportunity household help improve quality life, make life-cycle consumption-smoothing house purchase easier. financial institution able enjoy wide range profit opportunities, household lend transaction credit derivative household loan underlie assets. the total outstanding volume credit derivative worldwide estimate swell 110 time 180 billion u dollar 1997 20 trillion u dollar 2006. in korea, share household lend banks' total loan rise 28% 1996 50% 2006. with corporate demand fund greatly blunt 1997 financial crisis, korean bank instead increase profit base household lending. this increase household lend help heighten house market vitality, stimulate consumption enhance banks' profitability. in respects, evaluate contribute improvement macro economy term trend business activity employment. have say this, however, i point household debt rise excessive level, great likelihood household unable repay principal interest loan interest rate rise house price fall. this, course, generate financial institution insolvency financial market turmoil, turn negative impact real economy. this possibility dramatically demonstrate u sub-prime mortgage meltdown. in case sub-prime mortgages, strict screen borrowers' redemption capacity often neglect time loan extension. credit risk pass financial system whole way mb cdos. for reasons, economic condition weakened, aggravate seriousness problem non-performing mortgage correspond severe impact financial market. in case korea, however, sign household debt turn sour far, although increase rapidly since early 2000's. the delinquency rate banks' household loan stand 0.6% year-end 2007. future policy task in many countries, large proportion household debt make house finance loans. to maintain household debt soundness, therefore, absolutely crucial thing avoid house boom bust cycle. to ensure this, policy initiative naturally require micro angle target supply demand house tax regime. an even important task, however, carry macro economic policy keep overall economy stable course. what more, give financial innovation amplify financial unrest, central bank financial supervisory authority redouble effort construct effective system monitor supervision financial derivatives. close remark lady gentlemen, i expect seminar forum policy debate, involve in-depth constructive discussion household debt issues. 2 bi review 35/2008 in close i like voice deep thank take part. although crowd hectic schedule, i hope able spare time gain taste korean culture beauty spring here. thank you. bi review 35/2008 3 thomas jordan: current challenge swiss national bank area monetary policy summary speech mr thomas jordan, member govern board swiss national bank, money market event swiss national bank, zurich, 27 march 2008. the complete speech find german swiss national bank’s website (www.snb.ch). * * * with forecast gdp grow 1.5%-2.0% average inflation rate amount 2%, national bank cautiously optimistic swiss economy 2008. however, since summer 2007, international environment take clear turn worse: financial market serious crisis, major economy weaken inflation rate rise worldwide. this mean snb’s monetary policy face challenge several front simultaneously. with regard economic growth, snb call upon ass consequence international financial crisis swiss economy precisely possible analyse implication monetary policy correctly early stage. on inflation front, must ensure measure take connection financial market crisis jeopardise credibility monetary policy gear long-term price stability shake establish inflation expectations. finally, challenge money market two-fold. first, snb must try – despite volatile risk premium interest rate expectation – keep target three-month libor close possible desire goal. second, operation choice instruments, must contribute well-functioning money market. even though several innovation area monetary policy instruments, snb’s option complex environment limited, however. in particular, magic bullet central bank could restore lose confidence among market participants. in deal financial market crisis, therefore, bank financial market participant must also try help restore proper function market implement measure shore confidence. bi review 34/2008 1 njuguna ndung’u: ifrs, basel ii challenge ahead kenya keynote address prof njuguna ndung’u, governor central bank kenya, official open financial report workshop bank sector, nairobi, 27 march 2008. * * * distinguish participants, distinguish resource persons, lady gentleman let first thank ernst young invitation give today’s keynote address, financial report workshop bank sector. look agenda, meet next two day dwell number important account regulatory issues. therefore, help set stage discussion follow, i would like take opportunity expound central bank kenya’s perspective compliance international financial report standard (ifrs), specifically benefit compliance, progress made, link ifrs basel ii challenge ahead. acceptance use ifrs become virtually universal, many country hitherto operate national standard phase ifrs despite associate challenges. international flow investment capital capital instrument across geographical boundary add new impetus adoption international standard globally. it wonder 1998, institute certify public accountant kenya (icpak), move kenya account standard favour international account standards. the central bank principal regulator bank non-bank financial institutions, formulate prudential guideline harmony ifrs order minimize conflict enhance compliance international standards. the central bank kenya recognise financial report standard play crucial role enhance financial stability. on one hand, report standard provide foundation production credible financial statement disclosure communicate performance industry firm level. on hand, disclosure reliable information facilitate market discipline, cultivate confidence reduce possibility adverse instability. the credibility information allow market participant process right information make appropriate decisions, thus good signal mechanism. disclosure information, however, compromise proprietary data, must flexible enough accommodate future advancement risk management. such outcome therefore, obvious implication supervisor’s ability oversee safety soundness financial institutions. it necessary bank non-bank financial institution prepare quality financial statement shareholder stakeholder well-informed sound judgement financial status make market. quality reliable information depend turn, report standard applied. in respect, ifrs ensure financial report prepare accept principle convey true fair view financial position institution. the forego notwithstanding, central bank make significant progress strengthen supervisory approach risk management guidance bank non-bank financial institutions. this aim encourage bank non-bank financial institution implement sound risk management practice level market segments. bi review 34/2008 1 it reason central bank continue attach great importance risk management report standard financial statement produce bank non-bank financial institution convey adequate information risk management activity key stakeholders, shareholders, creditors, depositor interest parties. it hop adequate timely information potential investor make correct judgement/assessment market. the choice basel ii topic discussion workshop indeed timely. basel ii represent crossroad, watershed turn point future global supervisory practices. basel ii present u opportunity enhance risk management system banks, upgrade supervisory approach inculcate market discipline. this serve enhance financial stability. central bank recently issue information memorandum bank non-bank financial institution thereby set stage implementation basel ii. unlike basel i focus single risk measure, basel ii put emphasis banks’ internal methodologies, supervisory review, market discipline. the accord base three mutually reinforce pillar allow bank supervisor evaluate properly various risk bank face. all reinforce pillar contribute safety soundness financial system. market discipline reinforce incentive management bank enterprise manage along sound lines. it operate basis disclosure information available market define

trichet: hear economic monetary affair committee european parliament speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, hear economic monetary affair committee european parliament, brussels, 26 march 2008. * * * madame la présidente, madame et monsieur le membres de la commission economique et monétaire, je réjouis d'apparaître devant votre commission aujourd'hui et de poursuivre notre dialogue régulier. je commencerai mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique et monétaire, en expliquant le raisons sous-jacentes à no récentes décisions de taux. ensuite, je vous donnerai de plus amples explication sur la distinction opérée par la bce entre la définition de notre politique monétaire d’une part, et la preservation du bon fonctionnement du marche monetaire d’autre part. zum abschluss möchte ich einige vorläufige schlussfolgerungen für die regulierung, aufsicht und stabilität d finanzmärkte ziehen. economic monetary development since previous appearance european parliament mid december, inflation remain relatively high level 3%. the incoming information confirm assessment prevail upside risk price stability medium term, context continue vigorous money credit growth. strong upward pressure inflation short term mainly stem recent increase energy food prices. look ahead, inflation rate expect remain significantly 2% year. hence period relatively high inflation rate protract previously expected. the march 2008 ecb staff macroeconomic projection foresee hicp inflation range 2.6% 3.2% 2008, 1.5% 2.7% 2009. these project range shift upwards, mainly result high food energy prices. i stress staff projection base number purely technical assumption unrelated policy intentions, use market expectation assumption short-term interest rates. in view govern council, risk medium-term outlook inflation upside. these risk include rise oil agricultural prices. furthermore, take account high capacity utilisation tight labour market conditions, wage growth may strong currently expected, well price power firms, notably market segment low competition. moreover, administer price indirect tax may increase beyond foreseen. at juncture, therefore imperative party concern meet responsibility second-round effect price wage-setting stem current inflation rate prevented. to end, scheme nominal wage index consumer price must avoided. this key preserve price stability medium term thereby purchase power euro area citizens. turn economic activity, fourth quarter 2007, real gdp grow 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, follow rise 0.8% third quarter. incoming information confirm picture moderate growth. look forward, ongoing growth expected. the euro area economy sound fundamental suffer major imbalances. investment growth – dampen global slowdown – provide ongoing support. at time, employment labour force participation increase significantly bi review 33/2008 1 unemployment rate fall level see 25 years. accordingly, consumption growth continue contribute economic expansion. this assessment reflect late ecb staff projections, foresee annual real gdp growth range 1.3% 2.1% 2008 1.3% 2.3% 2009. these range revise downwards, reflect weak global demand, strong pressure commodity price le favourable finance condition foresee december. in view govern council, uncertainty prospect economic growth remain unusually high. downside risk relate potentially broad currently expect impact financial market developments. further downside risk stem scope additional increase commodity prices, protectionist pressure possibility disorderly development owe global imbalances. the monetary analysis confirm prevail upside risk price stability medium longer-term horizons. on basis data available january, underlie money credit expansion remain strong, even take temporary factor account, relatively flat yield curve. there little evidence financial market turbulence since august 2007 strongly influence overall dynamic broad money credit aggregates. bank loan domestic private sector grow annual rate around 11% past two years. while growth household borrow moderate recent months, loan growth non-financial corporation remain strong. in line mandate, ecb’s govern council remain strongly commit prevent second-round effect materialisation upside risk price stability medium term. against background, 6 march, decide leave key ecb interest rate unchanged. the current monetary policy stance contribute achieve price stability objective. indeed, firm anchor medium longer-term inflation expectation high priority. the govern council continue monitor closely developments. the separation task determine monetary policy stance one hand preservation proper function money market hand let address issue separation determination monetary policy stance one hand actual implementation hand, mean keep short-term rate close level choose govern council. in accordance treaty provisions, primary objective ecb maintain price stability euro area. to end, govern council determines, basis economic monetary analyses, appropriate monetary policy stance set key ecb interest rate level ensure maintenance price stability medium term. in view safeguard credibility firmly anchor long-term inflation expectations, crucial govern council set appropriate monetary policy stance basis consideration delivery price stability medium term. once appropriate level key ecb interest rate set, executive board ecb implement monetary policy level key interest rate decide govern council actually prevail money market. for purpose, ecb steers, primarily mean open market operations, liquidity lend euro area credit institution adequate sound collateral give short period time. by ecb also foster smooth function euro area money market. the steer liquidity important element eurosystem’s framework monetary policy implementation since launch euro. by means, market participant get clear loud signal orientation monetary policy stance foster predictability credibility govern council’s monetary policy decisions. the fact decision firmly base objective price stability 2 bi review 33/2008 concomitant fact steer liquidity turn dependent decisions, way influence ensure price stability maintain medium term. this also ensure liquidity provision aim promote smooth function resilience money market also fully line primary objective price stability. particularly onset financial tension august 2007, principle, steer liquidity subservient monetary policy stance affect it, appear essence. in period acute turbulences, ecb succeed contain deviation short-term interest rate official interest rate set govern council. a result, ecb ensure continue effective implementation monetary policy line stance, thereby also contribute safeguard overall financial stability. since last hear december, tension continued. during period, eurosystem remained, usual, close contact major central banks. in context, 11 march govern council ecb decided, conjunction federal reserve offer u dollar fund eurosystem counterparties december 2007 january 2008. through operation currently undertaken, liquidity overall amount usd 30 billion provided. the swiss national bank follow analogous course action. overall, give flexible design, eurosystem’s operational framework broad range instrument thus far prove resilient effective. even course ongoing financial turmoil, need adjust extend exist framework, e.g. introduce innovative instrument broad range collateral. recent development regard financial stability supervision i would like share ecb’s assessment current financial stability situation. i also touch briefly upon possible policy measure prepare european international level response financial turmoil. with global financial system undergo process de-leveraging, euro area financial stability outlook continue cloud considerable uncertainty. since last hear committee, argue total valuation income loss face global financial system clearer. yet considerable uncertainty still remain reliability total cost estimate cost eventually spread. there also uncertainty possibility feedback effect onto financial system, include question ultimate impact intermediation credit – financial institution market – be. moreover, condition u house market show sign improvement, possibility continue tension structure credit market cannot excluded. in period ahead, large euro area bank likely face pressure revenue account low activity level structure credit market well general retrenchment risk-taking across many business lines. at time, bank face increase fund costs. consistent this, number financial market indicator – include bank equity price credit default swap spread – generally reflect expectation weak profitability well concern credit counterparty risks. on positive side, several year strengthen profitability mid-2007 leave euro area bank sector strong financial position face possibility credit cycle downturn. all all, give heighten uncertainties, environment balance sheet condition could unexpectedly change, vigilance ever essence. financial institution need step effort effectively manage risk may lie bi review 33/2008 3 ahead. from central banks’ perspective, restore confidence among economic agent market participant crucial current environment great uncertainty high market volatility. one important contribution ecb make preserve confidence continue firmly anchor medium long term inflation expectation euro area time ensure smooth function short-term money market. at current juncture, priority give comprehensively draw lesson formulate policy response address challenge raise financial market turbulence. the key area identify since last hear you, work progress intensively internationally eu. the financial stability forum ecofin develop preliminary assessment warrant policy action. in context, let mention area i see require timely responses: first, regard improve disclosure valuation structure finance products, financial institution call upon promptly fully disclose on- off-balance sheet risk exposures. moreover, guidance warrant auditor supervisor aim enhance clarity robustness structure product valuations, particularly relation illiquid assets. second, credit rat agencies, whilst eliminate conflict interest, take measure expand scope information provide investor – thus facilitate exercise due diligence, improve governance rat methodologies. if endeavour prove adequate, public policy action would need considered. third, supervisor ensure bank retain adequate capital liquidity buffers. in context, work underway refine certain aspect capital adequacy framework, especially relation treatment securitisation off-balance sheet exposures. moreover, supervisory guidance need develop liquidity risk, incorporate lesson turmoil focus liquidity stress-testing contingency fund plans. these three example area important progress made. more generally, i would call significant change culture national, european global level. i would sum cultural change two words: transparency anti-cyclicality. “transparency” enhance public information financial instruments, market institution necessary permit market participant take optimal economic decisions, also way avoid contagion, herd-behaviour and, therefore, propagation turbulence time difficulty. and “anti-cyclicality” large number rules, regulation procedure tendency foster behaviour largely procyclical, amplify boom well bust cycle. we must look part global finance view diminish progressively pro-cyclical components, implies, particular certainly exclusively, eliminate great possible extent asymmetry treatment boom bust and, necessary, extend far possible time-horizon adopt institution concerned. i disposal questions. 4 bi review 33/2008 amando m tetangco, jr: bank sector development philippine speech mr amando m tetangco, jr, governor central bank philippine (bangko

tradeoff structural issue speech dr shamshad akhtar, governor state bank pakistan, golden jubilee pakistan institute development economic, islamabad, 11 march 2008. * * * resilience pakistan’s economy face unforeseen global multiple domestic shock subject debate – proponent outgo government argue strengthened, opponent criticize state economy. in circumstances, i propose provide neutral, unbiased economic reason stand today? i encourage pakistan institute development economics (pide) investigate provide professional economic perspective economy objective feed properly policy advice. in provide perspectives, i propose highlight emerge challenge pose weak global economic scenario, consequent impact domestic economy already strain, discus policy option solutions, especially structural change require put pakistan road sustainable economic recovery. pakistan enter 21st century display average economic performance 1990s numerous fronts. in deference historical pattern growth path associate business cycles, economy gain momentum. from 2000 onwards: foreign exchange reserve grew, debt-to-gdp ratio fell, inflation, particular core inflation, decelerated. dynamism financial sector, benefit change ownership management strong regulation supervision, help revive real economy exploit untapped economic potential. financial sector asset rise $180 billion (125% total gdp) banks’ capitalize stock market remain buoyant. corporate bank sector profitability attract cumulatively foreign direct investment $11.9 billion, remittance $22.4, net portfolio flow $5.0 billion. since late 2004 domestic vulnerability reemerged mount fiscal external current account deficit rise 4% gdp induce inflationary pressures. risk macroeconomic stability year robust growth stability surprising. a quick review pakistan’s economic history reveal episode strong economic growth 1960s 1980s follow slowdown growth weakness macroeconomic indicators. why pakistan vulnerable cyclical downturns? why cannot country sustainable economic performance? the oscillate growth performance year largely inherent domestic structural rigidity yet effectively tackle ensure macroeconomic stability desire growth path. proper diagnosis effective resolution issue implementation broad range structural reform critical skirt bout slowdown growth instability. aside broad development debates, unusual currently pakistan’s economy simultaneously face twin shocks, global domestic. the global shock represent international financial market turmoil unprecedented increase global commodity prices, rise fiscal external current account imbalance characterize domestic shocks. in backdrop (relative) slowdown foreign exchange inflow fy2008, shock result pressure exchange rate foreign exchange reserves, heavy government borrow central bank, rise domestic inflation. combined, international domestic event complicate short term economic management disrupt monetary management succeed bring core inflation 5.2% may 2007 – peak level 8.3% october 2005 bring surface starkly vulnerability economy faces. like economic bi review 33/2008 1 phenomenon, international shock domestic deficit interrelate entail stringent tradeoff come devise implement well-coordinated, timely, endure policy response. unless immediately addressed, present economic vulnerability emerge pakistan’s economy risk reversal high growth trajectory even disruption gain achieved. below, i attempt give basic reason (re)emergence shock deficits, highlight complexities, suggest sustainable solutions. the global scene worldwide central bankers, economic policy maker business overwhelm global economy slide tailspin. financial market turmoil cause subprime debacle spark numerous debate regard origin event, effect aftermath, term contagion policy response across globe. risk spread contagion associate u uk’s credit crisis liquidity crunch compound financial economic loss magnify thwart global financial stability economic growth prospects. combine record-high international commodity price (in particular oil food prices) global inflationary risk intensified. emerge market like pakistan, thus far insulate mainly due low exposure subprime paper, likely impact second round effect financial market turmoil visible way sluggish world economic growth u downturn set in. to mitigate risk, u launch unprecedented package involving: ease liquidity special fund windows, cut policy rate, five rounds, 225 bps provide us$200 billion fiscal package. this package, warranted, fairly controversial associate moral hazard inflationary consequence rate cut ease liquidity. since appropriate size stimulus cannot calibrate precision, aggressive stimulus way monetary accommodation likely compound global inflationary pressure already rise wake (i) supply constraint magnify due world wide shortage strategic product (such wheat) oil substitution effort divert use corn bio-fuel (ii) grow demand pressure rise world income. fuel international commodity price also fall u dollar drive investor chase gold oil markets. in globally integrate world cost re-anchoring inflation expectation likely punitive. no wonder, central banks, exception federal reserve bank england, either tighten monetary policy keep hold exist level tightening. develop understand origin financial crisis adequacy policy response critical. analyst largely identify collapse u sub-prime mortgage market key cause financial market turmoil. however, sub-prime mortgage debacle appear symptom rather cause evolve credit crisis. underlie causative factor sustain decline inflation inflation volatility associate notable decline nominal real interest rate develop develop economies. this result complacency central banks’ adopt accommodative monetary policy long period induce excessive liquidity. combine regulatory supervisory gap oversight off-balance sheet nonbank transactions, provide opportunity overleveraging without appropriate risk management frameworks. arguably, development increase appetite price risk (although price risk (and is) become increase difficult face fast-paced financial innovations), elevate asset prices, increase capital flow across border search good yield (reflecting global macro imbalances), “carry trade” currency misalignments. although, monetary condition begin tighten, sub-prime mortgage crisis cause liquidity squeeze result loss confidence panic among investor lender 2 bi review 33/2008 (and central banks) could offload complex risky asset structure financial products. since bank turn rescue buy chunk papers, low mark-to market valuation result loss number financial institution write off require capital injections. this fortunately possible give growth sovereign fund wait acquisition deals. could possible accommodate oil food price (attempting) revive economy, u set stage another round easy monetary policy liquidity situation. in opinion, key issue central bank differentiate need short-term liquidity rescue trouble financial entity need adoption credible monetary policy stance aim calibrate liquidity management way aggravate inflationary risk turn would trigger complication protract global economic recovery. while low interest rates, central bank weigh inflationary risk risk recession financial instability. in bail financial entities, central bank concern “moral hazard” associate policy response often encourage risky endeavor salvage institution whose sole purpose existence risk take profit making. not pakistan face different set complex challenges, emerge global economic scenario underscore country mimic policy response advance economies. advance country selectively low interest rate enjoy low inflation sometime face steep risk downturn. a such, trade growth supportive policy relative inflation understandable risk associate u slowdown would threaten global economic outlook financial vulnerabilities. pakistan hand relatively stable financial system, mount aggregate demand pressure visible rise inflation rise inflationary expectations. tighten monetary stance flexible exchange rate management two key central bank policy responses. these however distinct impact government revert fiscal prudence effort count visible recent reduction oil subsidies. turn domestic front structural reforms: an assessment. to understand economic complexity hand important trace briefly pakistan’s economic growth trajectory experience structural reforms. over last three decades, economic growth stumbled: while grow around 6-7% late-1970s-1980s growth falter 1988-2001 4.4%. from 2000, effort launch resurrect growth average 6.3% last years. the growth path disrupt frequently inability government adhere prudent macroeconomic management consistently implement structural reforms. there evidence, corroborate imf independent evaluation office1 pakistan’s macroeconomic framework structural reform suffer lack ownership economic agenda excessive focus macroeconomic stabilization without supportive real sector well institutional structural reforms. this result slippage conditionality and/or weak implementation reform best release disbursement meet economy’s financial crunch outweigh compliance structural reforms. problem design sequence structural reform result suboptimal outcome policy adopted. few strike example would illustrate this. macroeconomic stability often disrupt fiscal slippage norm give spend align resource envelop year constrain narrow tax base. these trend 1 imf (2002), “evaluation prolong use imf resources”, chapter 9: pakistan, independent evaluation office, washington d.c. bi review 33/2008 3 make fiscal-monetary coordination difficult. continue recourse deficit finance central bank domestic finance source prevent containment inflationary pressures, constrain private sector credit demands. in real sector, industrialization suffer excessive emphasis import substitution incentive regime carry anti-export bias; consequently pakistan suffer vulnerability stem lack industry export diversification. nevertheless, structural reforms, adopt since 1990s refine recent decade. among others, notable follow steps: openness economy. deregulation, price liberalization low tariffs,2 government’s increase willingness cede great role private sector economy improve incentive regime. great fiscal space. broaden sale tax base, low tax rate improvement tax administration together help raise tax revenue; offset loss stem tariff liberalization. tighten fiscal deficit fy2002-2005, decline debt3 low debt service (partly restructure external debt partly improve debt management) allow space raise development expenditures. sustain growth development expenditure become challenge tax base limit exemption significant proportion taxable bodies/incomes remain outside tax net. privatization deregulation. government’s success extricate provision good service number area sale public company help generate proceeds. this help temporary alleviate fiscal need would also reduce state enterprise recourse budget. privatization already help improve accessibility efficiency particularly banking, telecommunications, airline industry well mass medium (radio, television, etc.). improve demographics. albeit slow, pakistan manage reduce population growth rate. large population offer strong domestic market human resource industry, pose challenge tradeoffs. feed population crop productivity yield low, meet social service obligation grow demand overstretch infrastructure natural resource base. besides harness good population potential, emphasis slow population growth likely generate significant gain come decades. governance institutions. over last 10 years, institutional reform help establish regulator nadra (that help reduce transaction cost issuance id etc.), unbundled power sector, build capacity public: private partnership infrastructure development etc. accord world bank’s

potential attract global capital. on hand, remain key economic risk challenge country faces. unless address holistically could threaten economic prospects; luxury pakistan ill-afford give geopolitical context emerge global challenges. re-emergence twin deficit complicate monetary management. borrow sbp induce expansion reserve money government’s high recourse bank system potentially crowd private sector credit. these complication introduce volatility overnight interest rate weaken monetary policy transmission mechanism hurt investment potential. grow demand good services, domestic source abroad help domestic industry, also enhance import reliance. over fy03-07, import growth (including oil) average 24.7% outpace export growth (13.4%) lead widen external current account deficit. during period, capital inflow fund fully external current account deficit residual help build foreign exchange reserve (growing $5.6 billion fy03-07). even oil price fall foreign inflow restored, sustainability external account remain stress export growth may impact global slowdown. contain external fiscal account imbalance one challenge government. solutions, strategy structural reforms: future agenda. so solution situation? the answer conduct counter-cyclical policy curb demand pressure deal root cause deficits; sustainable endure solution finance deficit importantly introduce structural change reduce deficit sustainable manner, reflect approach meet country’s development requirements. to resolve macroeconomic imbalance sustainable basis meet grow development requirements, need high priority focus enhance national save rate, basic ingredient increase productive capacity (possible well sequence structural reforms) economy match rise demand. save rate historically low combination policy include country wide campaign incentive help encourage savings. this among others require maintain high stable real interest rate, give current high inflationary environment possible high nominal interest rates. in turn, high production level economy encourage savings. the challenge context remain vigilant control consumption counter cyclical policies. recognize need bring twin deficit within sustainable level increase national savings, new government need strengthen medium-term macroeconomic stabilization program front load it, accelerate implementation structural reforms. these step crucial re-invigorate growth strengthen economic resilience. keep perspective, government’s broad economic strategy next year need include: i. increase domestic resource mobilization raise revenue/gdp ratio least 5 percentage point gdp. this possible give scope enlargement tax base, removal exemption strengthen tax administration. the exist tax regime collect almost 68% tax manufacture corporate sector, agriculture service sector (aside banks) exempt segment economy outside tax net. bi review 33/2008 5 ii. restrict large proportion new resource mobilize public investment, prioritize recurrent expenditure major overhaul government machinery. iii. restore momentum privatization state-owned enterprises, one successful asia. the government sell cumulatively almost $7 billion asset fy2000-fy2008 around 61 state entity pipeline. iv. provide autonomy public sector organizations, effective leadership management, improve operational financial efficiency accompany program strengthen balance sheet allow graduate budgetary allocation seek fund market. v. and raise private investment/gdp 23% least 28% involve significant tap additional resource domestic international financial markets. to address structural weakness inhibit pakistan’s long term growth need for: (i) exploit agriculture sector, key driver economy, regain food self sufficiency. conserve agriculture land deal land hold entitlement issue area cultivation expanded, remove infrastructural bottleneck (such inconsistent water availability) promote right technology well research development, strengthen wholesale retail market help improve food availability time global food scenario worrisome. great food production help cater rise demand within pakistan due grow population prosperity outside particularly middle eastern bloc, india china. (ii) development diversify industrial sector urgent cater domestic external demand. private sector provide right incentive environment promote require diversification. for promote industry, need broaden deepen private equity debt market – help diversify financial sector exclusively dependent bank system carry attendant risks. closely hold company encourage move capital market examine opportunity merger acquisition attract foreign investment achieve scale efficiencies. (iii) instead focus ad hoc subsidy reach largely profitable industry, best design incentive focus ensure adequate supply infrastructure. all new funding, tax proceed mobilize privatization infrastructure henceforth keep separate account fund exclusively dedicate develop infrastructure dedicate industrial sites. for modernization industry, sbp government already focus provision right incentive import plant machinery. these measure help industrial sector’s ability compete effectively achieve organic natural growth. scope export significant industry achieve scale, value addition, diversity, develop information technology outsource business west. (iv) foreign investment would receive impetus legal system overhaul ensure elimination cumbersome procedures, effective enforcement property right business contract availability timely justice. in conclusion, pakistan opportunity draw lesson past. among others list above, key lesson need effective implementation reform agenda, though case launch second generation reform strengthen governance

true, one could argue experience one-off shock commodity food price whose inflationary consequence wane rapidly thank increase flexibility economies. but possible scenario worrying. second-round

central scenario short term scenario couple month inflation recede euro area come back “below close 2%” accordance definition price stability. it unusual witness commodity consumer price acceleration initial phase economic slowdown, inertia employment commodity price dynamic respect activity. this happen previously end 1990s, subsequent moderation inflation. in short run, recent inflationary shock likely maintain inflation high level 2008 may expect significant degree persistence energy, industrial commodity food price increase (such meat). in euro area, hicp inflation reach 3.3% february. it

nothing significant materialise juncture. on contrary, remuneration remain well line productivity gain with, take example, reference wage increase 0.3% france fourth quarter last year. from point view, protract shock food commodity price put anchor inflation expectation credibility monetary policy test. the recent upward trend european household market expectation may concern. however,

1990s. the economic crisis 2001 low point period, economy contract 5 percent. since then, turkey put place intense ambitious structural reform agenda, couple sound monetary fiscal policies, establish macroeconomic financial stability improve business environment. central bank independence grant law 2001 one milestone agenda. the introduction free-floating exchange rate regime 2001 inflation-targeting regime 2002 key steps. the central bank turkey also experience comprehensive institutional change towards good communication policy clearly define accountability measures. we experience significant disinflation process since 2001. the consumer price index come 68.5% 2001 8.4% 2007. i call attention fact list country low inflation 2007 quite short, thank global inflationary pressure food commodities. in fact, average inflation around world increase 3.5 percent 2006 4.8 percent 2007 5.5 percent january 2008. in environment turkey able reduce inflation 1.3 percentage point 2007. in fact, sharp drop among 60 major develop emerge countries. the disinflation process even pronounce core inflation, exclude energy food prices. it stand 4.36% february 2008. the favorable outlook core inflation indicator despite surge energy food price allow central bank cut policy rate since september 2007. the cumulative rate cut reach 225 basis point february 2008 bring overnight borrow rate 15.25% 17.50%. the time ease depend development global markets, demand conditions, fiscal policy performance factor affect medium term inflation outlook. accord forecast january 2008

target 4%. however, inflation forecast converge target 2009 come 1.8-5.5% range 70% probability end 2009. at point let say couple word fiscal policy last six year fiscal discipline, also contribute much macroeconomic stability turkey. one main characteristic turkish economy 1990s high budget deficits, around 7% gdp average. during 2002-2007 period set ambitious primary surplus target realization targets, couple almost balance budget pave way significantly improve debt dynamics. even recent upward revision gdp figures, turkey easily meet maastricht criterion budget deficit debt stock. accord recent data, ratio net government debt gdp come 29%, whereas budget deficit le 2%. dear guests, bi review 32/2008 1 a know, financial system play key role accumulation save distribution among productive sectors. therefore, health stability financial system crucial economic growth country. we attribute utmost importance financial stability country experience deep financial crisis past. price stability primary objective central bank. but, also regard financial stability auxiliary objective monitor system closely. the achievement inflation front significantly improve macroeconomic environment eliminate vulnerability put burden proper function financial system. the bank sector restructure program measure take follow 2001 crisis, lead formation strong resilient financial system. this contribute high growth rate achieve crisis. i comfortably say today bank sector turkey compare well new member european union. the bank law enact 2005 line best international practices. asset size turkish bank sector increase three-folds last six year reach usd 500 billion 2007. still, huge unexplored potential sector take account size turkey’s young population low rate credit utilization among household private business. capital adequacy ratio (car) bank sector stand 18.8%, well minimum legal requirement 8% average european union, 12.1%. short-term liquidity ratio comfortably meet

deficits, bank sector return core function, intermediary borrower lenders. the ratio total credit total deposits, proxy intermediation function bank sector, increase almost two-folds since 2001 reach 80% 2007. the strong growth performance turkish economy may consider fruit structural reforms, fiscal discipline, cautious monetary policy last 6 years. turkey grow 23 consecutive quarter since 2002 one fast grow country world period. the real gdp grow almost 50% cumulative basis period, bring average annual growth rate 7%. this strong growth performance private sector drive support continuous productivity gains. along high economic growth, openness turkish economy also increase substantially. exports, stand usd 31 billion 2001, increase two-folds reach usd 107 billion 2007. dear guests, there four distinguish characteristic turkey set apart emerge market countries. first, unlike country central eastern europe region, turkey young population, demographic gift could accelerate economic growth. of course, great potential guarantee success. currently, turkish economy utilize le half workforce. improve state labor market, remove rigid labor market regulations, reduce tax wedge, importantly enhance human capital education reform essential accelerate growth rate economy sustainable basis. second, turkey net commodity importer contrast latin american country south africa. we need import excess 35 billion usd worth oil natural gas year, almost 5% gdp. look composition foreign trade, see import mainly commodity intermediate goods, whereas industrial good cover 90% total exports. therefore, promote turkey's competitiveness key future success. 2 bi review 32/2008 third, high domestic save rate, high emerge country asia, quite low turkey. it around 20%. we need attract foreign save finance investments. it surprise observe strong direct positive relationship turkey growth rate current account deficit. of course, upward trend energy price also contribute widen current account deficit 5.8% 2007. the current account deficit structural problem source vulnerability. however, turkey difficulty finance last 6 years. in fact, quality foreign capital flow improve sharply. the current account deficit finance foreign direct investment (fdi) long-term capital inflows. the fdi inflow excess usd 20 billion last two years, put turkey among top 5 develop country fdi inflows. fourth, turkey one country “convergence story”. negotiation european union full membership status provide major stimulus policy maker put turkey’s huge potential life complete reform agenda. this agenda consist next generation policy reform focus remove structural bottleneck improve economy’s capacity labor absorption, innovation, competitiveness. dear guests, turkey heavy structural reform agenda since 2001. however, continuation structural reform vital importance sustainability economic gain achieve recent year resilience economy shock future. the important structural reform pipeline social security reform expect significantly improve turkey’s fiscal balance medium long term. it also expect contribute domestic save rate. other prominent step take include reduce size unregistered economy broaden tax base, reform labor market increase job creation bring business environment level par international competition, re-designing education system order make consistent labor demand raise quality labor force, privatize energy market ensure energy supply security. these step together macroeconomic stability undoubtedly make turkey competitive country international arena. look ahead, main goal achieve sustain price stability economic growth. prerequisite macroeconomic stability, structural reform adherence good governance principle public private institutions. we recognize economic growth expense price stability cannot permanent. together eu anchor place, move decisively become trillion usd economy. thank you. bi review 32/2008 3 lucas papademos: eurosystem bank russia

central bank, conference “the euro: global implication relevance latin america”, são paulo, 17-18 march 2008. * * * lady gentlemen, during lunch i would like share brief reflection international dimension europe’s economic monetary union, emu. the title presentation additional part: “and potential latin america”. i sure i one ass potential euro latin america; i perhaps let latin american audience decide itself. a know, policy ecb neither encourage discourage use euro. what i would prefer today examine main lesson draw ten year experience monetary union, lesson may also interest rest world, particular latin america. i concise selective, give time constraints. i thus focus main issue i think deserve attention inevitably leave aside important aspect may take late discussion. i focus five main lesson i would draw first ten year euro discus issue currently debate europe may relevance latin america, particular policy-makers. let start lessons. the first lesson draw last ten year importance economy like euro area monetary policy. this seem self-evident, always case. we currently see around world many important country economy actually choose monetary policy. consider instance case china, asian emerge markets, gulf countries, russia. by make exchange rate main target policy de facto give monetary policy import monetary condition prevail country whose currency targeting, often unite states. give underlie economic condition unite state surely different prevail countries, monetary condition latter import unlikely conducive sustainable growth. give ability conduct monetary policy bind sooner late give rise internal instability. just illustration, economy grow 10% per year inflation rise towards 10% cannot afford nominal interest rate 5%, even le 3 2%. we know problem low interest rate protract period time produce. ten year emu suggest possible – actually desirable – major economy world monetary policy, attune internal condition target domestic objectives. this first lesson doesn’t seem wholly understand observers. in particular, financial market participant commentator time lead think central bank le bind act similar way. in fact, last month various central bank act quite differently, precisely different situation prevail respective economies. some decrease rates, others keep rate unchanged others actually increase rates. the world economy become integrate time also affect idiosyncratic shock diverge start conditions, may time require different response policy-makers around world. 2 bi review 31/2008 the second lesson price stability primary objective monetary policy. this enshrine statute central bank around world, exception federal reserve system, whose mandate go back end 1970s. ten year experience emu show price stability ensure without sacrifice growth medium term. compare last ten year ten year emu, see inflation lower, growth broadly similar employment growth, lately, much stronger. i dwell much issue. it seem recent development confirm clear primary objective, also well-defined quantitative terms, best way anchor market expectation ensure smooth adjustment external shocks, real financial nature. the third lesson independent central bank essential ensure first two requirement i mention met. it strengthen credibility monetary policy aim price stability therefore enable relatively low interest rate maintained. central bank independence many elements; personal institutional aspect two important. if monetary policy conduct view medium term, rather reaction short-term developments, security tenure relatively long time – case ecb’s executive board, instance, non-renewable term eight year – quite relevant. it help decision-makers set monetary policy independently political cycle.1 in theory, central bank independence tend take granted. in practice, european experience shows, may challenge even statute central bank enshrine constitutional framework. the support people independence central bank objective price stability additional protection attempt undermine independence. in country euro area, support public opinion two thing strong. the fourth lesson clarity role monetary policy also help clarify role policies, particular fiscal structural policy. with respect fiscal policy, consensus fiscal discipline essential, monetary union also individual countries, ensure room manoeuvre anticyclical budget, discretionary automatic. the stability growth pact 3% 60% limit country’s deficit debt treaty establish european community also find broad application macroeconomic surveillance continents. experience show country comply requirement pact, particular maintain sound budgetary position good times, wide margin absorb negative effect economic slowdown. those country instead delay adjustment certain face next slowdown much great anxiety, negative effect consumer investor confidence. the main instrument enhance long-term economic growth employment structural policy. this become universally recognise eu. the lisbon process enable structural policy result across country compared, basis simple set indicators. this advantage focus discussion within individual country policy necessary growth. some result achieved. for instance, structural rate unemployment decrease substantially countries, follow labour market reforms. overall, 13 1 see l. bini smaghi (2008): “central bank independence eu: from theory practice”, european law journal, forthcoming. bi review 31/2008 3 million job create since introduction euro, le 3 million previous decade. however, much need do labour product markets, especially service sector, permanently increase productivity euro area. overall, easily see europe country implement far reach reform also perform good years. a similar comparison country area world could help clarify responsibility various policy achieve sustainable growth. the last lesson i would like draw attention emu europe much monetary union, it’s fact political union. the share currency implication citizen go beyond economist use considering. it entail implicit contractual relation direct impact citizens’ day-to-day decisions. furthermore, policy-making structure euro area become much intertwine relation monetary policy also budgetary policy. this issue would require much time discus detail always fully understood, partly form political union take euro area, eu generally, quite unique, evolve time way correspond political union around world. to sure, issue understand observers, particular financial markets, consider leave euro area viable policy option. a barry eichengreen recently show paper, way euro area construct develop mean exit would entail economic also political consequence make nearly impossible.2 the fact unite kingdom, sweden denmark enter euro area people agree decision confirmation emu indeed political union. the five lesson i mention help explain euro emerge second world currency ten years. i provide data illustrate developments. they obtain regular ecb publication international role euro.3 the development last ten year provide u lesson also issue remain open pose challenge policy-makers. let illustrate three. a first issue concern impact new international currency functioning, particular stability, international financial system. this issue literature far say little. in theory, one could think world several reserve currency would stable, would confer opportunity international investor would impose great discipline policy-makers. however, recent event tend confirm rely market alone discipline policy-makers allocate fund efficiently across border might always optimal. in certain circumstance market might tend overreact overshoot respect underlie economic fundamentals. in particular, portfolio adjustment phase transition characterise several currency acquire international status might quite disorderly. this might negative effect world economy. it require close monitor coordination monetary authority major economies. a second issue, constantly discuss euro area also countries, centre relationship independent central bank policy-makers order ensure consistent overall economic policy. this issue relate 2 see b. j. eichengreen (2007): "the breakup euro area", nber work paper no. 13393. see also b. j. eichengreen (2008): "sui generis emu", nber work paper no. 13740, unique feature emu compare past monetary unions. 3 see ecb (2007): review international role euro, june, available www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2007/html/pr070625.en.html. 4 bi review 31/2008 number area policies. in europe problem tend become complicate policies, fiscal structural policies, conduct national level others, trade antitrust policy, conduct european union level, euro area alone. the euro area many respect strong policy framework, often underestimated. the relationship monetary budgetary policy quite similar country independent central bank, ex ante coordination policies. there exchange information, particular state economy, trade-offs. this case industrial countries. on exchange rate policy i believe that, i argue elsewhere, euro area arrangement good, involve finance ministry central bank.4 in country central bank, technical expertise financial market charge interest rate policy, involve tend get involve late process, may make thing complicate risk undermine credibility statement action. in area external representation, too, clarity achieve responsible represent euro area, least within g7 groupings. some confusion still remain forum g20, eu rather euro area participates. in imf still consolidation euro area member within one seat, something mind take place sooner later. on financial stability, situation euro area quite unusual, ecb direct responsibility bank supervision. the situation also vary within eurosystem: country central bank direct responsibility supervise domestic system, others responsibility give another institution. the recent turmoil show importance keep central bank closely involve issue relate proper function financial markets. furthermore, increase integration eu financial market require close cooperation supervisors, harmonise implementation regulation effective exchange information market institutions, creation efficient crisis resolution framework. work issue ongoing europe need strengthened. to conclude, last issue discussion, euro area, well countries, major challenge involve policy-makers. it explain help citizen adapt globalisation. globalisation produce many positive effect society quite challenge social groups. in particular, recent increase food energy price bite purchase power households, especially low end income distribution. these effect come top others develop years, squeeze income employ sector low value added. i want enter debate best way forward. i mention europe difficulty, i.e. euro introduce time globalisation accelerate effects. this lead confuse effect globalisation associate introduction euro. for instance, perceive inflation country high measure inflation, attribute effect euro, even though six year pass since introduction euro banknote coins. 4 see l. bini smaghi (2007): “the euro international currency: implication exchange rate policy”, remark conference “50 year treaty rome: strengthen economic leg emu”, rome, 2-3 july 2007. bi review 31/2008 5 overall, euro area citizen go series adjustment last years, might create sense confusion. this require great unity among policy-makers euro area, le blame europe euro – case past – order help citizen adjust recover confidence new environment. the irony somebody like travel frequently around world notice benefit euro tend much appreciate outside within euro area! thank attention. this

political interests, as, access military technology, control strategic resource markets, influence public opinion.9 there often complaint sovereign wealth fund lack transparency. decoded, request reassurance investment policies. i certainly go argue transparency (except special case market operation central banks). more openness swfs may help alleviate concern recipient country – thus reduce protectionist pressures. and may improve dissemination information market participant citizens. i know many swfs work imf produce voluntary code conduct base best practice governance transparency sovereign wealth funds. for example, would helpful sovereign wealth fund transparent overall strategies, objective broad investment guidelines. norway’s government pension fund good example respect. but level play field apply investors. the case great transparency apply investor too. swfs may take comfort single equally powerful pressure transparency hedge fund private equity investors. in respect, two recent initiative particularly welcome. first, report chairmanship sir andrew large – predecessor deputy governor financial stability bank – voluntary standards, include disclosure, hedge

community reinvestment coalition annual meeting, washington dc, 14 march 2008. * * * this audience, national community reinvestment coalition, certainly aware mortgage delinquency foreclosure rate increase substantially past year half. this increase reflect significantly, though exclusively, sharp deterioration performance subprime mortgages, particularly adjustable-rate features. at end last year, one five roughly 3.6 million outstanding subprime adjustable-rate mortgage (arms) seriously delinquent, mean either foreclosure ninety day past due.1 that rate four time high mid-2005. lender initiate roughly 1-1/2 million foreclosure last year, average 950,000 precede two years. more one-half foreclosure start 2007 subprime mortgages. behind disturb statistic family face personal financial hardship neighborhood may destabilize cluster foreclosures. these reality challenge u find way prevent unnecessary foreclosures. and, look toward future, challenge u ensure regulatory environment promote responsible lend sustainable homeownership. i would like briefly discus arrive today. then i would like share federal reserve reduce foreclosures, protect aspire homeowner unfair deceptive practices, equip choose wisely among often confuse array mortgage options. in particular, i would like highlight new regulation propose home ownership equity protection act (hoepa). origin subprime mortgage turmoil over past quarter century, advance information technology, development credit-scoring techniques, emergence large secondary market, among factors, significantly increase access mortgage credit. from 1994 2006, subprime lend increase estimate $35 billion, 4.5 percent one-to-four family mortgage originations, $600 billion, 20 percent origination (inside mortgage finance, 2007). responsible subprime lend expand credit borrower imperfect limit credit histories. more renter become homeowner would otherwise. though subprime mortgage write today, i believe responsible subprime lend helpful, point again, foster sustainable homeownership. however, far much lend recent year neither responsible prudent. the term subprime mortgage permit homebuyers investor purchase property beyond means, often little equity. in addition, abusive, unfair, deceptive lend practice lead borrower mortgage would choose knowingly. 1 base servicer data first american loanperformance. 2 bi review 31/2008 the current crisis many roots. the drop home price many once-hot market among significant. in recent survey, nearly 30 percent homeowner report house decrease value past year.2 the decline home equity make difficult struggle homeowner refinance reduce financial incentive stress borrower remain homes. mortgage performance data show strong correlation adverse house price change subsequent increase mortgage delinquency foreclosure (avery, brevoort, canner, 2007; gerardi, shapiro, willen, 2007). investor purchase home hope price appreciation seem particularly likely walk away "underwater" mortgages. indeed, role investor house market increase markedly time. accord data collect home mortgage disclosure act (hmda), lend non-owner-occupants rise 5 percent home-purchase loan mid-1990s 17 percent purchase 2005 2006 (avery, brevoort, canner, 2007). mortgage delinquency also tie local economic conditions; notably, several midwestern state struggle job loss slow income growth see increase delinquencies. the deterioration underwrite standard appear begin late 2005 another important factor underlie current crisis. a large share subprime loan originate time feature high combine loan-to-value ratio and, cases, layer additional risk factors, lack full documentation acceptance high debt-to-income ratios. in 2006, example, hmda data suggest nearly 40 percent higher-priced home-purchase loan involve piggy-back loan second mortgage.3 indeed, many default occur within first month origination, well payment reset occur subprime arm products. much weaken underwrite standard appear happen outside institution regulate federal bank agencies. the hmda data 2006 show 45 percent high-cost first mortgage originate independent mortgage companies, institution regulate federal bank agency sell almost mortgage originate. in instance, originate-to-distribute model appear contribute breakdown underwrite standards, lender often find able pas credit risk without much resistance ultimate investors. for number years, rapid increase house price effectively insulate lender investor effect weak underwriting, provide false comfort. another concern substantial number borrower subprime arm whose interest rate schedule reset upward--about 1.5 million 2008.4 the problem pose reset serious, may mitigate somewhat low short-term interest rate effort servicers, include work hope now alliance, find solution borrower face resets, include interest-rate freeze (hope now alliance servicers, 2008). in addition, fhasecure plan, federal house administration (fha) announce late last summer, offer qualify borrower delinquent interest rate reset equity home opportunity refinance fha-insured mortgage. recently, congress administration temporarily increase maximum loan value eligible fha insurance, allow borrower access program. 2 analysis base reuters/university michigan survey consumer data provide federal reserve board. 3 the federal reserve board staff estimate base 2006 hmda data. additional information available federal financial institution examination council website december 2007 federal reserve bulletin. 4 the federal reserve board's staff calculation base data first american loanperformance mortgage banker association. bi review 31/2008 3 the current high rate delinquency foreclosure confine subprime market. in 2007, 45 percent foreclosure prime, near-prime, government-backed mortgages. across market segments, delinquency rise fast more-complex loan originate past years. in part, trend seem due fact loan make borrower weak financial condition. in cases, borrower may fully understand detail loans, include potential large payment increases. federal reserve response effective response need build inform understand complex picture. thus, problem house emerge deepened, federal reserve system engage wide array market participants--including lenders, community groups, servicers, consumer advocates, public officials, regulators--to properly diagnose problem work toward sustainable solutions. the federal reserve system alone, course, cannot resolve problem marketplace, respond thus far regulatory, supervisory, research, community affair functions. regulation supervision a part periodic review regulation hoepa, federal reserve board 2006 begin systematic look change mortgage industry. four public hear hold around country confirm evidence gather source mortgage market undergo significant change familiar. our concern lead u 2006 2007 issue, along federal state regulators, series guidance institution supervise cover nontraditional mortgage loans, subprime lending, service practices. those good steps, also recognize many problem begin see result action company individual subject supervisory oversight. thus, conduct additional hoepa hearing, focus four specific areas: assessment repayment ability; low- no-documentation lending; escrowing tax insurance; prepayment penalties. a result careful review available data information, propose new rule hoepa authority december, ban practice find unfair deceptive. significantly, ban unfair deceptive act practice would apply entire mortgage industry, institution directly regulate board. our goal produce clear comprehensive rule protect consumer unfair practice maintain viability market responsible mortgage lending. the rule would apply strict regulation higher-priced mortgage loans, define broadly cover substantially subprime market.5 the regulation would enforceable state federal supervisory enforcement agency well consumer themselves, could recover statutory damage violation beyond actual damages. the propose rule cover range practices. first, rule would prohibit lender engage pattern practice make higher-priced loan borrower cannot reasonably expect repay income asset house. of course, appropriate attention borrower's ability repay fundamental feature good underwriting. 5 under proposal, "higher-priced mortgage loan" would annual percentage rate exceed yield comparable treasury security 3 percentage point first-lien loan 5 percentage point subordinate-lien loans. 4 bi review 31/2008 second, find prevalence "stated-income" lend lead many borrower receive mortgage could afford. consequently, would require lender verify income asset rely make credit decision higher-priced loans--standard industry practice, fact, lend quite recently. third, proposal would require higher-priced loan escrow account real-estate tax hazard insurance. this rule would help ensure borrower afford payment avoid case borrowers, especially first-time borrowers, understand monthly principal interest payment financial obligation associate homeownership. escrowing become standard practice prime market, proposal would make standard practice part market, well. fourth, propose rule would ban prepayment penalty situation borrower may especially vulnerable. for example, prepayment penalty would prohibit borrower's debt-to-income ratio exceed 50 percent and, permitted, would require expire least sixty day schedule increase loan payment. the rule would also ban prepayment penalty could enable "loan flipping" scheme, lender affiliate refinance lender's loan adverse term borrower. in seek information opinion four issues, board determine additional problem need address well, loans, higher-priced loans. among practice address proposal use yield spread premium (ysps).6 many consumer use mortgage broke guide complex process shop best deal. unfortunately, consumer may believe broke responsibility get best deal, necessarily case. in fact, design ysps may provide broke financial incentive offer loan high rate. consumer understand point may shop best advantage. therefore, would prohibit lender, prime subprime loans, pay broke amount great consumer agree advance. broke would also disclose potential conflict interest. the combination strict regulation good disclosure solve problems. we believe, however, proposal give consumer much good information raise awareness brokers' potential conflict interest reduce broker's incentive steer consumer high rate. to protect consumer promote competition, proposal would also ban seven specific advertise practice deem unfair deceptive. under rules, example, mortgage originator would allow advertise mortgage "fixed" rate unless advertisement also state clearly long rate payment fixed, could advertise loan one language important consumer disclosure another. the proposal would also require consumer receive loan-specific truth lend act disclosure early application process, use information shop effectively. the proposal also address certain practice loan service cause problem consumers, delay post payment consumer's account, act prohibit coercion appraiser lender brokers. we believe propose rule help protect mortgage borrower unfair deceptive practices. at time, want create rule open-ended costly administer responsible lender would pull subprime market. so, proposal design protect consumer without shut access responsible 6 a ysp present dollar value difference low interest rate wholesale lender would accept particular transaction interest rate broke actually obtain lender. this dollar amount usually pay mortgage broker. it may also apply loan-related costs, board's proposal concern amount pay broker. bi review 31/2008 5 credit. we anticipate vigorous discussion public comment process end april 8, will, always, carefully consider input issue final rules. in addition regulations, strong uniform oversight different type mortgage lender critical avoid future problems. regulatory oversight mortgage lend become challenge breadth depth market grow past decade. other changes, increase role nonbank mortgage lenders, add complexity. to achieve uniformly effective supervision, federal reserve, together federal state agencies, launch pilot program last summer conduct review select nondepository lender significant subprime mortgage operations. these review evaluate companies' underwrite standard well senior management oversight compliance state federal consumer protection regulation laws. we take corrective enforcement action warranted. we plan use joint project vehicle strengthen cooperation coordination among federal state agencies. research community affair the federal reserve address foreclosure crisis capacity regulator, leverage strength research data analysis, regional presence, many contact develop local community groups, lenders, policymakers, stakeholder issue. community affair officer board twelve reserve bank work federal reserve research economist anticipate and, possible, mitigate foreclosure problems. they share detail report information help community organizations, nonprofits, state regulators, others identify region neighborhood vulnerable foreclosure respond accordingly. for instance, neighborworks america recently use board's analysis help identify geographic area neighborhood critical need $130 million emergency fund provide congress increase mortgage counselor capacity. solid analysis available information critical craft appropriate policy remedies, federal reserve invest considerable resource studies. for example, federal reserve bank boston work paper analyze factor predict foreclosure, find particularly important role decline house price (gerardi, shapiro, willen, 2007). the federal reserve bank philadelphia conduct five-year study pre-purchase homeownership counseling. that study provide important information benefit counsel service foster sustainable homeownership help u understand long-term effect financial-management skill credit worthiness low- moderate-income homebuyers. in addition ongoing research, federal reserve support effort reach trouble borrower raise awareness community way prevent foreclosures. since july, community affair office across federal reserve system sponsor cosponsor fifty event relate foreclosures, reach 4,000 attendee include lenders, counselors, community development specialists, policymakers. there also work do mitigate impact unavoidable foreclosure consumer communities. family cannot sustain homeownership need find new place live, highlight critical need adequate supply affordable rental housing. consumer go foreclosure typically see credit score drop, raise longer-term question ability rebound financially perhaps pursue sustainable home purchase late point. high number foreclose home community also raise challenges, perhaps opportunities. because vacant homes, particular, impose real cost neighborhood communities, forward-looking strategy keep home occupy important (apgar duda, 2005). some effort underway prevent vacancies, well return vacant property active use; 6 bi review 31/2008 effort may also help preserve supply affordable house area experience shortages.7 the federal reserve recently undertake joint effort neighborworks america help community develop strategy neighborhood stabilization. conclusion it clear rise home foreclosure delinquency significantly challenge many consumer communities, i hope i convey today federal reserve strongly commit fully employ authority, expertise, resource help alleviate distress. we continue collaborate national, regional, local level stakeholder public, private, nonprofit sector help avoid preventable foreclosure address consequence foreclosure occur. in long term, regulation oversight, seek promote responsible sustainable lend allow american achieve goal homeownership. reference apgar,

i’m sure one fail notice fact periodically turmoil financial market since last summer. it scarcely remarkable unusual financial market experience upswings downswings. and almost always country world experience problem financial sector. we become use fact life. but time appear much great nervousness see long time. central bank also follow development great interest. for instance, ecb, federal reserve bank england take number well-publicised measures. so commotion time? well, one subject speech today. financial stability riksbank's task addition monetary policy. apart red-hot topic discussion, also area i devote many year work. today i want talk regulation manage financial institution distress challenge face. but let first reason little financial crisis basis current turbulence crisis sweden experience begin 1990s. the problem begin subprime market a know, recent credit concern begin problem u mortgage market. this apply particular area offer so-called subprime loans. these loan mortgage customer low credit rat – often household without document credit history low income average household. these loan double 1996 2006, although still comprise relatively small part u credit market. the problem begin affect many borrower back 2005 connection rise interest rates. when loan renew new, high interest rate loan cost borrower rise substantially. and property price fell many areas, scope mortgage house householder could borrow way problems. this otherwise common – albeit dubious – strategy year rise property prices. many borrower could long make interest mortgage payment loans. this lead turn substantial credit loss many mortgage institutions. but loan loss merely affect bank mortgage institution originally issue loans. a know, problem come much wide spread. and problem spread risk sell the reason problem spread extensive securitisation mortgages. this special form financial engineer make possible lender sell credit risk together right payment flow loan prospective investor around world. what means, basically, number loan combine put investment vehicle create especially purpose, turn finance issue securities, know mortgage-backed securities. in principle, way make illiquid asset liquid. bi review 30/2008 1 this become increasingly common among bank credit institution around world. one say thus increasingly move away traditional role monitor credit risk. instead great degree originate loans, inherent credit risk immediately distribute investor financial market will take risks. their business strategy change focus long-term customer relation repackaging selling. have say this, securitisation necessarily bad thing itself. what new something problem time way securitised loan repackaged sell several stages. they create so-called structure credit risk products, often include large portion subprime loans. the variety impressive. often one product include component another product, turn repackaged include component new product. one equate russian dolls: large one contain small one, turn contain even small one, on. this mean create asset suit investor differ risk appetites, particularly asset high return high risk level. a complicate structure emerge but substantial variation among special vehicle use bank credit institution securitisation. i intend describe detail conduit sivs suchlike. but common invest high-yield asset long durations, often structure credit-risk product subprime content. they financed, least partially, issue certificate fix income market short durations, know asset-backed commercial papers. the special vehicle thus great less degree dependent liquidity market security financing. even special vehicle principle independent banks, common bank supply form liquidity guarantee. in words, special vehicle reason unable issue new certificate old one fall due, bank guarantee ability pay, wholly partly. such guarantee need consist formal obligations. they may also purely informal nature. this bank may disincline abandon special vehicle protect name reputation. whatever case, mean finance problem affect special vehicle easily lead back bank. what one regard true sale may reality always so. credit rat attract investor use wrongly a realise, result extremely complicate structure. many asset class arisen, unique condition idiosyncrasy pricing. this turn make difficult ass different products. then instead obtain help credit rat agencies. with aid credit rat agency issued, investor persuade invest products. credit rat excellent aid measure probability failure expect loss. but take account risk covary otherwise distributed. unfortunately, many investor appear disregard limitations. in addition, repackaging, special middleman le visible guarantee make difficult gain insight risk are. in particular geographical spread appear great early episode financial turbulence. 2 bi review 30/2008 uncertainty increase liquidity disappear when problem subprime market begin show there, cause great uncertainty. it quite simply impossible know actually leave direct indirect exposure subprime loans. this lead liquidity wan part interbank market. it therefore become difficult expensive bank refinance themselves. when many bank experience problems, number central bank choose take measure increase liquidity interbank market. the unease credit market continue winter spring. many large establish bank gradually force write value subprime-related assets. this lead major financial group require new capital. at time, increase uncertainty international economic activity. this turn contribute major fluctuation world’s stock markets. over past week unease increase again. this contribute rise interest rate interbank market in, instance, unite state unite kingdom. with free capital movement course also affect swedish interbank rates. but high interest rate interbank market definition mean bank experience liquidity problems. the swedish bank good liquidity throughout entire period turmoil. they expose subprime-related security great extent. their solidity remain good loan loss present small. nevertheless, swedish bank able entirely escape effect events. there similarity today’s financial turmoil swedish bank crisis the current financial turmoil swedish bank crisis actually number common denominators. harvard professor kenneth rogoff together carmen reinhart maryland university point number similarity u mortgage turmoil number early financial crises, include swedish bank crisis begin 1990s. some common denominator period prior outbreak crisis include rapid increase property share prices, fact current account deficit large grow economic growth decline early high level. one important difference exchange rate regime play prominent role u case. too low risk premium abstruse risk but also possible find specific parallel swedish bank crisis. in case lend increase rapidly time bank underestimate therefore take sufficient payment credit risks. in sweden link bank – decade credit regulation – lack develop strategy manage price credit risk. when deregulation come mid-1980s quite simply unused loan losses. but tendency could also see prior recent market turmoil. for long time, risk premium credit risk-related security remarkably low. the uncertainty lead increase. but, also parallels. this include particular arrangement make banks’ real risk-taking abstruse. the banks’ formal informal promise loan special investment vehicle mean problem quickly bounce back banks' balance sheets. in swedish bank crisis one say finance company respect play correspond role special vehicle. it finance company primarily finance expansion construction property markets. the finance company largely finance short term issue so-called commercial paper bi review 30/2008 3 fix income market. when property market folded, finance company, nyckeln, september 1990 first throw towel could renew financing. other finance company follow suit. many finance company own banks. and bank tie formal informal commitments. the loss therefore soon return bank system. in 1991 become apparent bank substantial problem loan exposure property branch directly indirectly finance company supported. the bank crisis become reality. perhaps begin see pattern now? the structure side-effect desire avoid regulation it also interest abstruse structures, lead current financial turmoil bank crisis 1990s, case partly due so-called regulatory arbitrage. the recent wave securitisation banks’ credit portfolio partly propel deficiency capital adequacy rules. through securitisation bank could easily avoid lot expensive capital adequacy. since 2004 new capital adequacy regime, basel ii, applied. this finely mesh allow possibility avoid capital adequacy securitisation. however, yet implement countries, unite states, instance. the swedish finance company day result regulatory arbitrage. prior abolition credit regulation sweden, finance company often use mean bank get round credit restrictions. this “grey” credit market substantial important source additional income banks. around 25 year ago i write quite lot this. credit insurance exist one also observe another similarity, namely occurrence so-called credit insurances. a company sell credit insurance swedish bank 1980s 1990s svenska kredit. many bank buy insurance loss loan property company company. when property market crashed, svenska kredit unable meet obligation consequently go bankrupt. this turn fuel problem banks. there parallel swedish credit insurance company time current so-called monolines. these large insurance company specialise insure various type bond loan. those buy companies’ insurance traditionally municipalities, federal state bond issuer poor credit ratings. the insurance mean bond loan receive good credit rat possible sell good rates. in july 2007 outstanding volume bond insure monolines amount value usd 3,300 billion. in recent year monolines increasingly use insure security issue subprime content. this mean also begin experience problems. this risk turn repercussion security insure ultimately invest them. of course, also essential difference recent financial turbulence swedish bank crisis. this apply nature scope crisis. but, note, many strike similarity way people acted. or voltaire suppose say "while history may never repeat – man always does!” 4 bi review 30/2008 financial crisis arise result imbalance balance sheet so financial crisis arise? the root financial crisis quite simply find imbalance asset financing. the simple way illustrate look stylise bank’s balance sheet. on asset side lend company households. these asset cannot realise quickly without substantial discount. in words, illiquid. the bank’s finance hand largely consist deposit general public short-term borrow interbank security markets. their finance thus liquid. in normal circumstance problem, expect depositor lender withdraw money finance time. but time liquidity transformation make bank sensitive financiers' confidence ability meet obligations. suspicion bank financial problem could quickly lead bank run. there many bank run past. stockholm banco, found johan palmstruch 1656, hit bank run 1660s depositor lose confidence note issue bank. the bank take estate realm, precursor riksbank found 1668. there countless bank run unite state end 1920s begin 1930s. argentina indonesia hit end 1990s begin 2000s. and recently september 2007 british build society northern rock suffer bank run. i shall return shortly. it clear even recent financial turmoil question imbalance asset liabilities, although asset liability come look rather different fictitious example. essentially question thing, namely lend long duration fund short durations. the awareness inherent instability difficulty see risk lie mean sometimes little liquidity part money market. what new bank around world become much dependent security market manage risk finance themselves. in 2007 concrete evidence sensitive bank become liquidity shock markets. problem security market almost never return bank system force. the importance financial stability when northern rock suffer problems, british authority take number exceptional measures. for instance, bank england grant build society emergency liquidity assistance. and hm treasury abandon limit exist deposit guarantee, extend cover deposit northern rock without limitation. the question many people probably ask much effort make one individual financial institution. public measure type could hardly appropriate question ordinary engineer company retail chain financial straits. it due two factors. firstly, concern special role play bank bank system whole economy. secondly, concern special contagion risk financial system. in central bank context, usually call systemic risks. bank intermediary credit market receive deposit general public play central role financial system. they contribute, instance, facilitate mediation capital act intermediary depositor borrowers. they also create condition efficient mediation payment economy. the banks’ deposit account central importance use payment cards, credit card credit transfers. many bank also participate system settlement bi review 30/2008 5 large-value payment supply central bank. the bank account system therefore vital part payment system. so anyone ask bank special, i could reply way john dillinger, designate fbi 1930s public enemy number one, ask rob banks: “because that’s money is.” at time, problem arise one bank easily spread banks. this spread occur different ways. firstly, direct spread, exposure bank one another payment system connection foreign exchange security trading. severe chain effect arise customer bank suffer problem mean payment tie bank. this make difficult make payment household companies. it lead liquidity problem turn give rise loan loss payment problem customers’ banks. secondly, bank often expose sort risk. this increase probability that, instance, macroeconomic shock may affect one bank. the spread problem bank thus also arise indirect effect, expectation bank may suffer similar problem one first affects, via well-founded suspicion banks' exposure one another. the contagion risk mean problem one bank easily lead problem entire bank system. the cost society crisis affect entire bank system substantial. it is, course, difficult calculate costs. some survey indicate average production loss result bank crisis could around 15-20 per cent gdp. accord calculations, collapse swedish bank market cost around 5 per cent gdp term loss output. see society’s point view, individual agents’ incentive sufficient take protective measure crisis affect financial system whole. the shareholder never lose capital put individual depositor find difficult monitor bank widespread operations. there are, use economic terminology, considerable negative externalities. in addition consumer protection aspects, decisive motive financial safety net form special regulation, supervision deposit guarantee. it also reason central bank possibility provide liquidity support form emergency liquidity assistance. such emergency liquidity assistance shall principle grant institution question temporary liquidity problems, essentially robust systemic contagion risks. it exactly risk domino effect rest financial system mean northern rock, hardly say critical significance bank system, become object number measure take british authorities. it probably similar consideration motivate measure take germany save ikb sachsen landesbank. now one see easy british authority manage problem northern rock. the exist regulation arrangement prove particularly effective. despite measure taken, manage avoid bank run. this lead authority great britain draw up, impressively short time, proposal number improvement regulatory framework manage institution distress. in february british finance minister announce decide nationalise northern rock, otherwise risk cost taxpayer would high. 6 bi review 30/2008 the regulation manage institution distress inadequate a partially responsible stability financial system, i ask myself, thing sweden? do regulatory framework require manage possible future problems? unfortunately, answer question must probably no, least present. during swedish bank crisis begin 1990s number extraordinary measure taken. these include issue bank deposit guarantee. this general declaration banks’ creditor would protected. in addition, special crisis management authority established, swedish bank support authority. in connection this, number provision compulsory nature introduce prevent possibility state place blackmail situation. for instance, act introduce mean principle swedish bank support authority could make decision bank state compulsory purchase share bank’s capital adequacy fell two per cent. but temporary provisions, like general bank guarantee, cease apply 1996. the bank support authority transform deposit guarantee board, give task manage deposit guarantee investor protection. since principle general regulation competition liquidation system deposit guarantee available manage institution problems. unfortunately particularly appropriate – even possible – apply general competition regulation banks. the regulation competition liquidity primarily protect interest creditors. they particularly well-adapted take account society’s interest maintain stability financial system. the primary task receiver bankruptcy safeguard interest creditors. he neither authority expect skill require take measure need safeguard stability financial system. problem threaten stability require immediate action. bankruptcy usually take year resolve. some element general bankruptcy procedure, freeze balance sheets, may case directly harmful apply systemically-important institution. for example, banks’ central role payment system mean one cannot merely stop payment one major banks, could devastate consequence financial system. during bank crisis bank declare bankrupt. the lack specially-adapted regulation wind problem institution capacity take account society’s need financial stability emphasise bank law committee. this commission enquiry appoint 1995 wake bank crisis look need modernise legislation banks. the committee also present proposal new system manage bank distress, call public administration. this proposal investigation, called, government office since year 2000. custodia reminder shortcoming since receive new indication shortcoming regulations. the course event credit institution custodia 2006 indicate worry difficulty manage even relatively small insignificant problem institution. we therefore way good equip unite kingdom manage problem institution apply regard small large institutions. fortunately, custodia small company problem occur situation relative calm financial markets. the stability financial system thus definitely never threatened. but regrettable still manage create bi review 30/2008 7 adequate regulatory framework field, fifteen year bank crisis. in country slightly experience bank failures, unite state canada, learn special institution arrangement require manage institution experience financial problems. one important lesson authority must able intervene quickly possible bank face problems. there several reason this. the first put pressure management owner bank rectify situation hopefully prevent situation deteriorate further. the so-called save loan crisis unite state 1980s become costly authority fail take action time. this mean unite state begin 1990s introduce system so-called prompt corrective action. this mean authority quite simply oblige law intervene certain specify thresholds. in opinion desirable finansinspektionen (the swedish financial supervisory authority) also large toolbox measure take early stage. it possible intensify measure gradually problem worsen. of course, desirable possibility withdraw license institution whose capital adequacy fall eight per cent level. in sweden, every reason look closely obligation power authority finansinspektionen. another motive authority act quickly able quickly pay deposit guarantee. to able make necessary preparation this, authority therefore need access control relevant data file early stage institution get difficulties. this problem early case compensation swedish deposit guarantee. if financial system threatened, authority must also able temporarily take control bank maintain vital functions. the banks’ central role payment system mean payment default one bank substantial domino effects. the consequence rest financial system may difficult survey. with regard institution lack long-term survival capacity, course important wind quickly smoothly possible. there must several different alternative method wind bank make possible choose model best suit entail least cost society. of course, would best one could get another bank take institution’s activities. but possibility carve business sell part could case prove profitable. in certain case reconstruction bank may appropriate solution. if take long find buyer, might necessary state take bank temporarily. this ultimately necessary case northern rock. there risk similar situation state could expose blackmail. to minimise cost taxpayers, therefore necessary opinion state sufficient strength negotiate exist presumptive shareholders. for instance, must legal possibility state redeem share price correspond value bank state aid measures. it also particularly important avoid situation bank end man’s land regard ownership. an essential condition well-functioning system one attain balance interest party come forward bank distress. the various interest include society’s interest financial stability depositors’ interest good consumer protection. but also creditors’ interest good protection fair treatment, taxpayers’ fee-paying institutions’ interest cost deposit guarantee system low possible. in addition owners’ interest legal right least society’s interest administration justice function field economic crime. 8 bi review 30/2008 all interests, probably more, entirely legitimate must course take care legislation. but must classify accord relative significance society. otherwise possible distribute role different authority best way manage problem institutions. there also risk waste valuable time manage conflict different interest party instead manage institution’s problems. in words, necessary bird’s eye view draw regulations. the regulation must formulate give state right tool i know ministry finance currently work hard proposal public administration bank distress. the design deposit guarantee finansinspektionen’s power authority also reviewed. we eagerly await proposals. even work carry parallel tracks, important final result coherent. otherwise could difficult manage future crisis financial system. it also important proposal toothless. run bank right, rather entail considerable responsibility towards society whole customer entrust save bank. bank owner already protect financial safety net isolate risk completely different way ordinary companies. it would therefore unfortunate result merely proposal entail state take management problem institution, fix hand back owner new, improve version. my hope government dare take overall approach require work issues. i hope particular take note event unite kingdom initiative come result problem northern rock. it important state necessary tools. if current eu legislation various way put speak wheel, joint regulation also need reviewed. the internationalisation financial sector require great cross-border cooperation the authorities’ crisis preparedness legal institutional arrangement crisis management thus le purely national affair. the financial sector increasingly internationalised, globalised. the banks’ activity become cross-border nature. the four large swedish bank currently half total asset abroad, mainly nordic countries, also germany, poland baltic states. an almost equally large share total operate profit originate abroad. for nordea group share le three quarters. in recent year also much-publicised cross-border acquisition among several large european banks. there currently around 50 bank europe substantial operation several eu countries. there number interact reason behind this. the capital adequacy rule harmonised, opportunity expand small mature domestic market slight economy scale increase result of, instance, it cost account large share banks’ total costs. when bank operate across national border competition increases. this benefit company households, finance cost fall supply financial service increases. these efficiency gain ultimately beneficial economic growth. but time risk bank crisis spread across national border increases. this also increase risk serious problem arise several country time. this make high demand crisis management. the exchange information decision make must coordinate different authorities. i know bi review 30/2008 9 experience difficult achieve one country. the difference different authorities’ aims, perspective method work substantial. in cross-border crisis would also necessary coordinate authority several different countries. it difficult imagine could complicated. apart involve authorities, number legal practical complication arise. this sorely test coordination exchange information decision making. the swedish bank’s substantial activity abroad therefore mean riksbank enter number agreement cooperation event financial crisis central bank nordic country baltic states. there also overall agreement crisis management eu level – memorandum understanding, mou. this cover central banks, supervisory authority finance ministry member states. agreement nature valuable create orderly form cooperation. they create necessary contact network least common parlance, great importance manage crisis. but mous also shortcomings. they often word vague general manner usually legally binding; declaration intent. but serious deficiency take account conflict national interest may arise crisis situation. these add conflict may arise different interest party authority different objectives. conflict national interest particularly prominent socioeconomic cost crisis cross-border institution unevenly unreasonably distribute different countries. this could situation affect willingness contribute constructively overall solution crisis. there evident risk crisis management prolong political negotiate games. when stake high, risk many country choose play card close chest long possible. in bad case scenario, could lead crisis measure take time, could devastate result involved. in september 2007 nordic-baltic crisis exercise organise around financial crisis scenario. take part exercise central banks, financial supervisory authority finance ministry five nordic country central bank baltic states. without go details, i reveal exercise bring light many deficiency coordination – authority within individual country across national boundaries. in particular, show measure take unilaterally authority one country easily disastrous consequence financial stability countries. it also emphasis importance continue develop cooperation ensure national regulation form obstacle cross-border crisis management. in crisis essential authority different country understand one another’s assessment situation preferable reach common view. this make demand common criterion joint terminology. it must also possible coordinate various measure across borders, emergency liquidity assistance payment deposit guarantee funds. and must possible distribute socioeconomic burden wake cross-border crisis reasonable preferably fairly predictable manner. otherwise risk conflict national interest make management crisis difficult prolonged. another aspect come fore recent financial turmoil banks’ increase dependence liquidity security market risk management financing. central bank around world need examine whether necessary tool manage come liquidity crises. the question liquidity support give decision communicate without stigmatise effect counteract purpose may require new way thinking. 10 bi review 30/2008 good regulation increase cross-border cooperation necessary let conclusion observe financial turmoil currently prevail bear number clear parallel many financial crisis – least swedish bank crisis 1990s. the bank crisis many way wake-up call make riksbank authority realise serious consequence lack stability financial system have. it lead riksbank develop analysis capacity field financial stability. ten year ago riksbank publish first regular financial stability reports. i warmly recommend read them. the insight bank crisis also lead riksbank strengthen crisis organisation develop form cooperation authority regard manage financial crises. but one important element missing, namely effective coherent regulatory framework manage institution distress. in opinion, one least fundamental requirement system. firstly, ensure quickest, resolute action possible finansinspektionen financial institution suffer problems. secondly, design possible quickly easily pay deposit guarantee. thirdly, give state sufficient negotiate power towards exist presumptive shareholder prevent taxpayer bear cost financial institution mismanaged. without well-functioning arrangement appropriate legislation already place may difficult manage future problem swedish financial system. and sufficient merely patch gap domestic regulatory framework. the real challenge lie manage cross-border crises. this become increasingly important, particularly light banks’ increase international operations. it entail challenge must tackle jointly international level. the regulation must develop european level, least. all difficult issues. one need look far beyond narrow authority objective short-sighted national interest realise new regulatory framework arrangement cooperation require able manage future financial crises. but appear insight everyone reach time. the picture appear clear country come furthest question integration financial sector across national boundary experience financial crises. it appear take country long realise new demand arise change financial landscape. to achieve necessary surmount ingrain opinion internal resistance. i hope require financial crisis catastrophic proportion political maturity willingness go achieve fronts, nationally within eu. a john f kennedy said, “the time repair roof sun shining.” when start drizzle high time speed up. with word i conclude talk swedish economics association. it always great pleasure able share think prominent assembly economists. i happily answer question may now. bi review 30/2008 11 philipp hildebrand: globalisation current development financial market summary speech mr philipp hildebrand, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank, swiss institute international studies, zurich, 13 march 2008. the complete speech find german swiss national

event like correction u residential property market rapidly develop global event. we experience first truly major crisis financial globalisation. the long crisis lasts, hard – also important – keep mind advantage financial globalisation preserve long run. there need regulatory correction, need remain future. the exist system regulation supervision improved. the regulation liquidity equity, particular, need fine-tuned, strengthen adjust late development financial markets. however, possible need fine-tune regulations. the buff financial system strengthened. in simple terms, ultimately require international bank strengthen capital backing. at time, big liquidity cushion needed. in addition, authority look possibility supplement complex regulation simple robust indicator as, instance, effective concentration limit upper limit indebtedness ratio. bi review 30/2008 1 paul jenkins: how trade impediment internal trade affect canadian economy open statement mr paul jenkins, senior deputy governor bank canada, stand senate committee banking, trade commerce, ottawa, 12 march 2008. * * * thank you, mr. chairman, opportunity appear committee. with john murray, deputy governor bank canada member bank's govern council. let start say issue internal trade barrier critically important, i'm pleased, mr. chairman, committee examine it. we review previous submission committee, see focus slightly different. rather address detail give restriction internal trade, i'd like focus trade impediment internal trade affect overall performance canadian economy. in remarks, i'd like address two important issue perspective: need flexibility adjust economic change, need economic policy promote flexibility market goods, services, capital, labour. economic flexibility refer ability economy adjust change circumstances. change economic condition often relate movement relative prices, turn send important signal markets. a flexible economy one adjust signal return production potential quickly, little cost, possible. over past decade so, economic expansion canada around world robust, despite series major shocks. these shock included: - 1997-98 financial crisis asia, spread russia latin america - worldwide collapse high-tech bubble - 9/11 terrorist attack unite state - sars bse - intensify competition china india - and, since 2003, sharp increase commodity price associate sharp increase external value currency. more recently, course, face fallout credit market turbulence associate problem american subprime-mortgage market increase use structure financial products. it's important note shock international origin and/or dimension. many shock – notably, asian crisis recent sharp run-up commodity price – involve large movement relative prices, is, price energy non-energy commodities, well large movement exchange rate canadian dollar. and movement turn trigger important shift economic activity, well reallocation production resource across sector region country. all underscore fact live era rapid change, operate global environment constantly shifting. uncertainty, risks, shock constant feature economic landscape. for canada, particularly important recognize reality, give open economy international trade capital flows. the best approach deal risk sudden development constantly ask step take make economy domestic market flexible, bi review 30/2008 1 thus good able adapt change circumstances. and need recognize share responsibility among firms, workers, policy makers. firm worker need able respond quickly technological advance shock require change way conduct business, kind good service produce, market choose develop. a well-functioning market-based economy send clear relative price signal critical context. at time, policy-makers need wary barrier adjustment, labour regulation inhibit movement worker one type job, one sector region, another. to enhance flexibility, raise growth potential economy, increase resilience shocks, need policy encourage structural reforms. for canada, structural reform broad context, priority across number jurisdictions. the financial system, vital role support healthy modern economy, continue one priority. an efficient sound financial system enhance overall economic flexibility help redirect capital resource productive uses, cost-effective way, follow shock. remove internal barrier free movement goods, services, labour another priority. these barrier rightly attract attention canada difference regional economic performance shortage skilled labour become pronounced, demographic challenge intensify. a number initiative remove internal barrier undertake years, mix generally modest results. the red seal program introduce 45 year ago help standardize recognize workers' trade qualifications. the agreement internal trade (ait), sign first minister 1994, aim reduce barrier movement goods, services, investment, labour. one important recent example trade, investment labour mobility agreement (tilma) reach april 2006 british columbia alberta strengthen enforcement dispute resolution harmonize labour credential business regulation standard early 2009. considerably need do enhance flexibility function internal market coast coast. business regulation standards, include financial sector, need harmonize across canada. dispute resolution enforcement ait need strengthened. and make labour market flexible, trade professional designation recognize fully transferable across country. a significant step forward would others adopt british columbia-alberta accord. the bank canada also important role play help economy adjust economic change. the bank's monetary policy aim keep inflation low, stable, predictable, turn help canadian business read price signal clearly, respond relative price movement promptly, allocate production resource efficiently. i'll conclude say uncertainty, risks, shock much part tomorrow's economic picture past. we stake canada's economic well-being, role play improve flexibility adaptability. from perspective alone, committee's study issue relate internal barrier trade timely important. thank you, mr. chairman. john i would happy respond question comments. 2 bi review 30/2008 anselmo l s teng: macao’s financial sector – exhibit steady development speech mr anselmo l s teng, chairman

american banker association spring summit meeting, washington dc, 11 march 2008. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * it pleasure address new american banker association, arise successful merger america's community banker aba. your association truly represent full range bank unite states. the focus remark today – importance fundamental risk management – still resonate you, whether part large global bank small community bank. unfortunately, recent market event show u bank institution still face risk management challenges, include need refocus key fundamentals. the good news, however, also many example sound risk management practice recent disruptions. risk management challenge get fundamental right – ever vigilant consistent application execution – form basis sound risk management system. i try imply implement risk management fundamental easy; is, something fundamental mean come naturally. in fact, number risk management challenge inherent bank require careful identification attention. one basic risk management challenge relate concentration risks. from begin banking, banker always cautious guard against, old adage says, "putting egg one basket." for example, renaissance banker learn lesson – hard way – good lend merchant active one trade, range merchant active variety trades. a risk management technique grow centuries, banker become adept identifying, measuring, manage risk concentrations, mean original problem present concentration – loss could occur time – vanished. indeed, banker occasionally forget challenge still exists, usually unfavorable consequences. it also important note concentration bank include basic lending, also hold securities, trade complex instruments, provide liquidity facilities, engage off-balance sheet transactions, conduct financial activities. a bank extend range activity involvement new markets, must particularly mindful potential concentration risk arise number reasons. first, new activity le familiar involve le data experience evaluate risk compare long-standing activity markets. second, risk concentration hide normal time may manifest time stress activity instrument might normal time little negative correlation suddenly become correlated, market-wide increase demand liquidity see recently. in words, banker may far egg jostle around basket, egg may fragile originally thought. bi review 29/2008 1 understand linkage risk concentration capital especially important, since concentration risk give portfolio markedly affect amount capital hold it. heavy concentration produce so-called fat tail loss distribution, mean considerably high capital level require support risk taken. if one underestimate amount capital need hold risk concentration and/or extent concentration themselves, banker would realize initial level capital sufficient remedial action would need taken. naturally, large small bank continue successful profitable lend type concentrations, need aware risk involve proper risk management capital support concentrations. risk management fundamental i would like elaborate three key risk management fundamental relationship concentration risk banking: governance risk control; risk identification measurement; liquidity risk management. in so, i highlight important find report release last week group supervisory agency france, germany, switzerland, unite kingdom unite states, know senior supervisor group ssg.1 the report, "observations risk management practice recent market turbulence," provide summary analysis joint survey review, initiate last autumn, risk management practice understand different approach fare recent financial stress. although analysis cover group large bank security firms, lesson learn actually relevance financial institution size scope – even thus far suffer recent financial turbulence. i also discus example supervisory activities, recent guidance commercial real estate concentrations, learn valuable lessons. governance control i start perhaps one fundamental aspect risk management bank organization – fact, organization: governance controls. the ssg report highlight solid senior management oversight engagement key factor differentiate performance recent events. clearly, senior management must take active involve role risk management. although may seem somewhat obvious, recent case demonstrate, unfortunately, senior management may always exercise proper oversight may engage would wise. a supervisors, governance control key feature look assess risk management institution. clearly, senior manager also need ensure proper understand risk assume firm, always happen. for example, see evidence information keep silo within firm adequately distribute vertically horizontally within certain firms. this segregation prevent senior manager develop enterprise-wide perspective risk whole entity. it mean manager fully aware extent risk different activity undertake firm could, first, become correlate time stress and, second, result high concentration risk exposures. to quite specific, particular cases, senior management fully aware firm's latent concentration u.s. subprime mortgages, realize addition subprime mortgage 1 the report available at: http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/banking/2008/rp080306.html. 2 bi review 29/2008 books, exposure off-balance sheet vehicle hold mortgages, claim counterparties expose subprime, certain complex securities. adequate distribution information allow enterprise-wide perspective risk. information must percolate senior management, top executive must, turn, disseminate view analysis back business lines. effective risk management remain sturdy durable support strong independent risk function produce unbiased information. empower independent risk manager result clear, dispassionate think entire firm's risk profile, favoritism toward business unit. senior manager encourage risk manager dig deep uncover risk within business unit, also risk concentration arise set activity undertake firm whole well latent risk – hide risk concentration arise correlation risk time stress. such risk management assessment lead risk manager point case certain business line assume much risk. in words, good people within institution – paraphrase former federal reserve chairman – know take away punch bowl. be party pooper, however, difficult organization, crucial risk manager know independent voice influential top management top executives, large small firms, set appropriate "tone top" respect importance independent unbiased risk evaluation. a i discuss detail speech global association risk professional couple week ago, successful organization need develop appropriate mechanism ensure adherence to, sustainability of, risk management.2 incentive structure key mechanism purpose. appropriate incentive reward good behavior penalize inappropriate behavior. of course, incentive work best know well advance, is, serve ex ante signal done. naturally, large organization difficult senior management monitor individual, incentive need consistent, permeate even low level organization, remind individual risk-taking affect whole enterprise. limit control useful tool create right incentive send appropriate signals, course need tailor individually firm. problem arise incentive properly structure appropriate "risk discipline" exercise – example, limit control set or, set, adherence monitor enforced. such control provide incentive business-line leader assume risk firm absorb penalize try take excessive risk inadequate mitigation name maximize short-term profit. this true large international firm community banks. risk identification measurement the second fundamental sound risk management relate risk identification measurement. timely accurate information lifeblood sound risk management. a good risk-management structure must encompass risk across

frederic s mishkin: comfort zones, shmumfort zone speech mr frederic s mishkin, member board governor u federal reserve system, sandridge lecture virginia association economist h parker willis lecture washington lee university, lexington, virginia, 27 march 2008. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * it's genuine pleasure address virginia association economist washington lee university important issue monetary policy. some may wonder mean speech title – "comfort zones, shmumfort zones." well, put "shm" word way cast bite skepticism it. thus, friend tell "fancy, shmancy," might overdress occasion. and exclaim, "email, shmemail!" find inbox overloaded. of course, there's also significant distinction expression "shlemiel" "shlimazel," that's more-advanced material i defer another speech. although speech somewhat humorous title, remark address serious important topic, namely, central bank promote stability price economic activity policy framework communicate public. more specifically, i consider whether central bank describe price stability term desire range inflation outcome – often refer "comfort zone" inflation – term specific numerical value inflation rate expect settle reasonable time horizon. after brief review academic literature regard level inflation best promote longer-run economic growth employment, i discus several conceptual issue regard pitfall comfort zone benefit specify point objective inflation. finally, i move theory practice consider experience major industrial countries. a usual, remark reflect view intend reflect federal open market committee (fomc) anyone else associate federal reserve system.1what optimal level inflation rate? research monetary economics usually specify monetary policy objective term stabilize inflation economic activity.2 those two goal related: maintain price stability promote strong economic activity long run. what mean price stability? a widely cite definition inflation rate sufficiently low household business need take inflation account 1 i'd like thank etienne gagnon, steven kamin, linda kole, andrew levin, david lopez-salido helpful comment assistance speech. 2 indeed, specification monetary policy objective exactly suggest dual mandate congress give federal reserve promote price stability maximum employment (mishkin, 2007a, 2008). bi review 35/2008 1 make everyday decisions.3 broadly speaking, i believe definition price stability reasonable one, practice, central bank around world choose average level inflation 0 3 percent consistent criterion. however, range narrow bite consider implication economic theory empirical evidence average inflation rate produce best economic outcomes. in particular, literature optimal inflation rate bolster case low inflation also highlight risk maintain excessively low inflation rate. the case low inflation all economist agree hyperinflations, one germany 1920s, particularly damage due result distortion economic incentive waste valuable resources. even rate inflation far short hyperinflation appear detrimental economic performance, evidence double-digit inflation rate 1970s. and past decade so, central banker academic economist reach remarkable degree consensus desirability low stable inflation – know, arrive consensus quite rare economists. the average rate inflation distort efficient allocation resource three main channels. first, firm face cost change prices, rise general price level tend generate undesirable movement relative prices, thereby lead inefficient allocation resources. this relative price dispersion increase inflation, desirability minimize relative price distortion provide key rationale price stability.4 second, inflation implicit tax capital. in imperfectly index tax system, inflation seriously distort save investment investment income tax basis nominal rather inflation-adjusted real value. in circumstances, price stability may considerably improve efficiency economy.5 third, high average inflation rate tend generate distortion raise cost hold currency non-interest-bearing assets.6 can inflation low? while benefit low inflation widely recognized, somewhat le attention give pitfall maintain inflation rate close zero, i discus 3 for example, former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan (2002) state "price stability best think environment inflation low stable time materially enter decision household firms." 4 over past couple decades, extensive literature analyze benefit low average inflation so-called new keynesian framework. these study generally start neoclassical model incorporate two key features: monopolistic competition costly price adjustment. refer, instance, goodfriend king (1997) woodford (2003). 5 interestingly, large burden come interaction inflation capital income tax, government tax revenue fall inflation reduced. feldstein (1997, 1999) provide quantitative assessment benefit price stability base interaction inflation tax system, show low average inflation rate stimulate investment reduce effective tax capital income. 6 because real money balance bear interest, opportunity cost hold nominal rate interest. high inflation lead high nominal interest rates, hence low real balances, cause welfare loss social cost produce real balance remain substantially unaffected. in absence friction economy, inflation view class model tax real balance (bailey, 1956; friedman 1969). however, cost high hold real money balance arguably become much le relevant economy become financially sophisticated. household hold modest amount cash, "shoe leather" cost likely fairly trivial. 2 bi review 35/2008 issue somewhat great detail. specifically, average inflation rate low, economy face great risk give adverse shock could distort labor markets, induce debt deflation, cause monetary policy become constrain zero low bind nominal interest rates. these risk imply undershoot zero inflation objective potentially costly overshoot objective amount, set inflation objective rate bite zero provide insurance risks. downward nominal wage rigidities. inflation rate close zero might create nonnegligible cost economy firm may relatively reluctant cut nominal wages.7 sticky nominal wage prevent labor market reach optimal equilibrium. however, empirical evidence switzerland japan indicate environment deflation low inflation, downward nominal wage rigidity become le prevalent.8debt deflation. keep average inflation rate close zero increase likelihood economy experience occasional episode deflation. deflation particularly dangerous advance economy, debt contract often long maturities. a describe irving fisher (1933), episode deflation lead "debt deflation," is, substantial rise real indebtedness household firms, nominal value debt obligation largely predetermine whereas nominal value household income business revenue fall together general price level.9 indeed, deterioration balance sheet household firm result financial turmoil contribute deflation great macroeconomic instability. the zero low bound. with low average inflation rate, monetary policy also likely encounter circumstance short-term interest rate constrain so-called zero low bind nominal interest rates.10 specifically, investor never choose lend money negative nominal interest rate always option simply hold cash zero interest rate; thus, nominal interest rate cannot fall zero. a number researcher federal reserve system elsewhere analyze implication zero low bind estimate dynamic rational expectation models.11 if economy face large contractionary shock, optimal monetary policy response 7 akerlof, dickens, perry (2000). the main idea describe follows: during period low productivity growth inflation, firm need cut relative wage cut money wages. in presence downward nominal wage rigidities, firm keep relative wage high employment low. hence, low rate inflation might prevent real wage adjust downward response decline labor demand certain industry regions, thereby lead increase unemployment hind re-allocation labor decline sector expand sectors. research staff federal reserve board find evidence downward nominal wage rigidity exist unite state (estevao wilson, 1998; lebow, saks, wilson, 2003). however, evidence mechanism low inflation raise natural rate unemployment clear cut. inflation "grease" labor market thus allow downward shift real wage response decline demand along, also put friction system ("sand") increase noise relative real wage (groshen schweitzer, 1999). the noise reduce information content nominal wage hence efficiency process worker allocate across occupation industries. 8 see kuroda yamamoto (2003) analysis japanese experience, fehr goette (2005) analysis swiss experience, kim ruge-murcia (2007) macroeconometric analysis implication downward nominal wage rigidity unite states. 9 the fact deflation anticipate completely rule negative effect balance sheets: if debt sufficiently long-lived, still redistribution debtor creditors. 10 although consideration important design monetary policy, central bank make use policy tool policy rate become constrain zero low bind (bernanke, 2002). 11 see reifschneider williams (2000), eggertsson woodford (2003, 2004), coenen, orphanides, wieland (2004), wolman (2005), citation therein. bi review 35/2008 3 push short-term nominal interest rate level expect inflation, thereby reduce real interest rate enough mitigate impact shock. but central bank inflation objective close zero, zero low bind prevent full implementation policy response, hence economy tend exhibit great volatility economic activity inflation. in contrast, give shock like see past several decades, average inflation rate high 1 percent substantially reduce frequency economy hit zero low bound. an inflation objective 2 percent imply monetary policy rarely constrain zero low bind thereby minimize adverse consequence macroeconomic stability. why comfort zones? these consideration provide foundation broad consensus among academic economist monetary policymakers around world optimal inflation rate range 1 3 percent; is, average inflation rate outside range would detrimental longer-run health economy. in light consensus, might seem natural specify price stability term range acceptable outcome inflation. indeed, several present past fomc participant use term "comfort zone" specify 1 2 percent range, thereby provide valuable information regard view level inflation consistent federal reserve's dual mandate.12the analytical case point objective nevertheless, "comfort zone" approach may seem appealing, analytical consideration reveal disadvantage approach well significant benefit specify maintain point objective inflation. the pitfall comfort zone in particular, i would like highlight three specific pitfall associate "comfort zone" approach. confusion objectives. first, price stability objective formulate term acceptable range inflation outcomes, policy implication may difficult interpret. for example, comfort zone span range 1 2 percent, mean policymakers equally comfortable inflation rate 1.1 percent 1.9 percent? furthermore, confusion inflation objective might make hard committee policymakers decide appropriate course monetary policy. when one member advocate accommodative policy stance members, may clear whether reflect negative outlook economy great willingness allow inflation settle near top comfort zone. thus, comfort zone approach might lead great confusion policy deliberation hence produce le effective decisionmaking process. perverse expectation dynamics. second, frame price stability term comfort zone could lead perverse expectation dynamic thereby generate large fluctuation economic activity, especially policymakers maintain neutral stance regardless inflation rate fall within comfort zone. 12 the term "comfort zone" appear headline september 2002 new york time interview former federal reserve governor laurence meyer (stevenson, 2002) subsequently use federal reserve official numerous occasions, include prominent speech bernanke (2005) yellen (2006). 4 bi review 35/2008 for instance, negative shock aggregate demand bring inflation near bottom end range might cause long-run expect inflation fall, would raise real interest rate nominal interest rate remain unchanged. this rise real interest rate would exert drag could exacerbate adverse impact original negative shock economy. similarly, positive shock aggregate demand raise inflation upper end range might cause rise expect inflation thus decline real interest rate, would provide stimulus economy. the result would pronounce swing economic activity. nonlinearities macroeconomic stability. third, central bank place high degree emphasis boundary comfort zone, threshold effect imply nonlinearities conduct monetary policy likely produce le desirable economic outcome (orphanides wieland, 2000). for example, stance policy would remain roughly neutral response shock leaf inflation upper end comfort zone, whereas slightly large shock push inflation boundary would cause abrupt shift contractionary policy stance. such "stop-start" approach likely cause great uncertainty financial market would also tend generate great volatility macroeconomy. the benefit maintain point objective in contrast various pitfall associate comfort zones, number significant benefit maintain point objective inflation. clarity communication. first, i emphasize several previous speeches, communication play crucial role success monetary policy (mishkin, 2007b 2007c). and regard, seem virtually self-evident communicate single numerical value inflation objective straightforward communicate interval range numbers. of course, regardless whether central bank point objective comfort zone, inevitable inflation rate fluctuate response various shocks; that's also crucial policymakers communicate clearly outlook macroeconomy central bank's strategy promote stability price economic activity. anchor inflation expectations. an explicit point objective anchor inflation expectation effectively comfort zone. if comfort zone consider zone indifference, inflation rate might well exhibit highly persistent fluctuation inside zone, perhaps even look like random walk within range. in case, inflation drift top comfort zone, private sector could take view inflation might remain rate extend period time, especially policymakers take action bring inflation back toward midpoint range. thus, comfort zone might generate somewhat large fluctuation longer-run inflation expectations, would turn tend contribute wide fluctuation actual inflation. in contrast, transparent credible point objective, longer-run inflation expectation firmly anchor rate. the insurance motive. even policymakers relatively indifferent level inflation within comfort zone, research optimal design monetary policy indicate be: the central bank actively seek bring inflation back midpoint comfort zone, thereby minimize probability inflation wander outside boundary zone. in effect, optimal policy strategy take account benefit insurance, hence midpoint zone become point objective inflation (mishkin westelius, 2006). bi review 35/2008 5 the empirical case point objective now let's turn international experience.13 a show table 1, number major industrial economy adopt explicit inflation objective in 1990, newly independent reserve bank new zealand become first central bank establish objective. many government follow new zealand's footsteps, inflation objective variously express form point, range prefer midpoint, comfort zone (that is, range indifference). in cases, inflation objective adopt part way lock benefit recent disinflation prevent return adverse inflation outcomes. new zealand, whose inflation performance 1970s 1980s bad among industrialize economies, arguably one example. in instances, inflation already keep low stable time, adoption explicit inflation objective follow extensive research debate issue benefit low stable inflation, presence bias measurement inflation, importance central bank communications. although mix reason circumstance lead adoption explicit inflation objective vary across economies, remarkable degree similarity characteristic policy frameworks, three broad conclusion drawn. first, fairly general consensus among central bank throughout world average inflation rate somewhere 1 percent 3 percent. second, point objective prove effective range anchor inflation expectations. third, inflation objective formulate term range, imply degree nonlinearity central bank's policy action alleviate place increase emphasis midpoint range. new zealand the monetary policy objective reserve bank new zealand "keep future cpi inflation outcome 1 3 per cent average medium term." the narrowness range may seem surprising, especially give historical volatility inflation new zealand. after all, new zealand small open economy large commodity-producing sector, result economy particularly subject external shock relatively large impact consumer prices. in context, use narrow comfort zone would increase odds inflation would fall outside band certain times. some observer argue outcome may undermine public's trust central bank's ability deliver inflation outcome line state objective, hence inflation band widened.14 nevertheless, wide band would hind anchor inflation expectations, pivotal successful pursuit explicit inflation objective. a previous discussion illustrated, express inflation objective term range make difficult central bank anchor inflation expectations, especially absence explicit emphasis midpoint. a relate issue boundary range may see "hard edges," is, inflation outcome inside range may see qualitatively different outside range. the nonlinear policy reaction imply approach lead great variation interest rates, exchange rates, output. the international experience indicate even inflation band hard 13 this section focus major industrial economies. mishkin (2000) consider experience number emerge market economy adopt explicit inflation objectives. 14 bernanke others (1999) counter line reason note "missing entire range may perceive public serious failure policy miss point, even narrow band, (which happen almost inevitably), lead possible loss credibility." 6 bi review 35/2008 edge introduced, subsequent change central bank's policy framework communication tend soften edge inflation band. the experience new zealand particularly instructive regard. the reserve bank act require price stability define specific public contract, negotiate minister finance reserve bank new zealand. under act, governor reserve bank personally accountable keep inflation line state objective. (indeed, governor could fire fail so.) since 1990, price stability define term band inflation rate. over follow decade, reserve bank treat band hard edges, conduct policy communication public; indeed, boundary inflation band occasionally refer "electric fences" (sherwin, 1999). however, become increasingly evident reserve bank's vigorous attempt keep inflation within band tend generate destabilize fluctuation nominal interest rate undesirable outcome broad macroeconomy. give dissatisfaction approach, reserve bank's mandate refine significantly 1997, namely, seek keep inflation within band, reserve bank avoid "unnecessary instability" output, interest rates, exchange rate (sherwin, 1999). this refinement allow reserve bank lengthen time horizon achieve inflation goal, thereby reduce need respond transitory price fluctuation provide great flexibility promote goal macroeconomic stability. and since edge inflation band softened, reserve bank place great emphasis policy action need bring inflation toward midpoint band forecast horizon.15united kingdom the desire anchor inflation expectation firmly lead unite kingdom move range point objective inflation. three week unite kingdom depart european exchange rate mechanism fall 1992, chancellor exchequer announce inflation objective 1 4 percent, achieve middle 1997. the use range inflation objective interpret many way limit extent discretionary policy acknowledge extent imperfect control inflation (bernanke others, 1999, p. 154). the initial target range 1 4 percent often perceive range indifference, imply inflation outside range would view qualitatively different inflation inside range. a consequence, inflation tend stay near upper border range. dissatisfaction outcome motivate subsequent decision mid-1997 move framework explicit point objective 2-1/2 percent, deviation either direction treat symmetrically. this modification policy framework well receive financial market general public, survey household professional forecaster indicate inflation expectation converge fairly quickly bank england's point objective.16 15 since early 1990s, reserve bank australia's objective keep average inflation rate within range 2 percent 3 percent; thus, edge new zealand's official inflation band softened, reserve bank new zealand describe move transition direction australian-style "thick point" (sherwin, 1999). 16 from 1992 2003, bank england's inflation objective define term retail price index exclude mortgage interest (rpix). in october 2003, u.k. government announce official inflation objective would henceforth define term consumer price index (cpi) target would set 2 percent, choice reflect fact recent average cpi inflation 1/2 percentage point low rpix inflation. bi review 35/2008 7 the euro area canada the importance anchor expectation help explain central bank initially adopt inflation objective state term range – even narrow one – increasingly emphasize single value communication replace range point objective. for example, may 2003 european central bank (ecb) clarify implement mandate price stability, monetary policy would aim maintain inflation "below, close to, 2 percent medium term" (european central bank, 2003). that clarification welcome market participant likely make easy ecb anchor inflation expectations. a final example, consider evolution monetary policy framework canada. in late 1990s, framework well describe range relatively hard edge statement bank canada official consistently indicate boundary target zone (which range 1 3 percent) take seriously midpoint (bernanke others, 1999). over past decade, however, conduct monetary policy evolve direction place great emphasis midpoint, range use mainly communication device rather objective itself. conclusion i argue today science monetary policy provide strong rationale frame inflation goal term specific point objective rather range comfort zone.17 first all, i've argue inflation low low. second, i've provide brief review lesson economic theory inform policymakers choice inflation objectives. third, i've outline learn practical experience industrial economies; indeed, recent years, number foreign central bank move toward emphasize midpoint inflation range provide specific point objective inflation. finally, may notice i say much unite state speech. nevertheless, issue i've discuss today potentially important implication ongoing process refine federal reserve's policy framework enhance communications. indeed, chairman bernanke recently indicated, communication strategy "a work progress," federal reserve "will continue look way improve accountability public understand u.s. monetary policymaking" (bernanke, 2007). and i certainly hope remark helpful contribute continuation process. 17 further discussion regard scientific approach monetary policy mishkin (2007b). 8 bi review 35/2008 table 1: major industrial economy explicit inflation objective economy start date current objective australia april 1993 2% 3% canada february 1991 2% ± 1% euro area january 1999 below close 2% new zealand march 1990 1% 3% norway march 2001 2 1/2% sweden january 1993 2% ± 1% switzerland january 2000 above 0 2% unite kingdom october 1992 2% reference akerlof, george a., william t. dickens, george l. perry (2000).

the mortgage market long source strength u.s. economy, face significant challenges, especially subprime segment serf consumer short weak credit records. a january 2008, recent month data available, 24

communities, everyone's interest avoid foreclosure whenever viable option exist. with large number borrower face potential repayment problems, interest borrower investor alike industry develop prudent loan modification program assistance help borrower systematic sustainable basis. a know, various initiative underway help borrower struggle mortgages. neighborworks america homeownership preservation foundation offer financial counsel service homeowner hope hotline. the hope now alliance, broad-based coalition government sponsor enterprises, industry trade associations, counsel agencies, mortgage servicers, make effort find way help borrower loan modification plans. the federal house administration establish fhasecure plan provide qualify borrower delinquent interest rate reset equity home opportunity refinance fha-insured mortgage. i active proponent streamline systematic approach reduce transaction cost help mitigate foreclosure risk, i strongly encourage market participant adopt implement fast-track modification proposal quickly possible. i applaud effort also recognize much must done. challenge remain, example, respect ongoing constraint service capacity expedite work outs. servicers must undertake investment overcome capacity challenge provide transparent timely measure results. the federal reserve work financial institution community group around country address

since launch centralize call center website november 2007, capability 2 bi review 34/2008 reach even great number provide information assistance spanish-speaking consumer 888-851-1920.4 the board's proposal i focus board's recent proposal strict regulation prohibit abusive deceptive practice mortgage market authority home ownership equity protection act (hoepa). this proposal intend protect consumer preserve consumer choice target protection borrower face risk. we also seek ensure standard clear lender reduce unintended consequence consumers. though clear, standard intend overly prescriptive, preserve access responsible credit amply protect consumers. our proposal also comprehensive, cover mortgage loan certain protection entire subprime market certain specific regulations. while comprehensive, proposal would focus protection risk great preserve consumers' access responsible credit. our effort produce robust, clear, comprehensive rule base rigorous analysis available qualitative quantitative data. we put proposal public comment april 8 eagerly seek suggestion able craft best possible final rule. comprehensive scope let say comprehensive scope proposal. it would apply strict regulation higher-priced mortgage loans, define broadly, cover type mortgage lenders, unlike guidance apply federally insure banks. we particularly interest ensure protection remain strong time loan product lend practice change. our analysis data suggest trouble mortgage market generally arise single practice isolation, instead complex way risk factor underwrite practice affect other, sometimes call "risk layering." therefore, propose use loan's annual percentage rate, apr, determine whether loan cover strict regulations.5 because apr closely correlate risk, propose protection would cover loan high risk rather single particular risk factor underwrite practices. with apr threshold proposed, expect new protection would cover entire subprime mortgage market risky end "near prime" market, latter also know "alt-a" market. cover part alt-a market would anticipate possible action lender avoid restriction subprime loan price near threshold. it would also address real risk consumer alt-a segment. this segment grow rapidly, layer risks, undocumented income, top risks, nontraditional loan structure allow borrower defer pay principal interest. however, hear commenters express concern current market environment, propose trigger could cover market broadly, carefully consider issue raise possible approach achieve objective. 4 federal reserve consumer help access online www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov/index_sp.cfm. 5 under proposal, "higher-priced mortgage loan" would apr exceed yield comparable treasury security three percentage point first-lien loans, five percentage point subordinate-lien loans. bi review 34/2008 3 our public hear analysis identify problem higher-priced loans, also broad mortgage market. thus, proposal address unfair deceptive practice vast majority mortgage loan secure consumer's primary home. area target broadly include broke steering, appraisal coercion, unwarranted service fees, deceptive advertising. i'll touch broke steer toward end remarks. robust approach affordability extend credit borrower afford repay fundamental pillar responsible lending. across whole range higher-priced mortgage loans, proposal offer three rule that, work combination, would help ensure borrower afford payments. first, requirement lender maintain responsible underwrite practice genuinely ass borrowers' ability repay. this general requirement would complement specific requirement verify income asset borrower rely upon make loan. a third rule would require lender escrow property tax homeowner insurance help borrower meet obligations. this robust approach affordability would help ensure subprime market promote sustainable homeownership. just important, would also help protect consumer abusive refinance strip equity. clear lend standard advantage increase investor confidence mortgage market help revive flow credit consumer short weak credit records. assessment repayment ability now i want discus major element propose regulation higher-priced loan little depth, start requirement ass repayment ability. the regulation would prohibit lender engage pattern practice make higher-priced loan base value borrower's house rather borrower's ability repay income, asset house. this prohibition intentionally broad capture risk loan performance different way risk layered. moreover, proposal avoid prescribe quantitative underwrite requirements. for example, proposal would prohibit pattern practice disregard ratio applicants' income debt, prescribe maximum ratio appropriate number depend heavily risk factors, vary loan loan. at time, proposal offer specifics. for example, would create presumption lender violate regulation engage pattern practice fail underwrite fully-indexed rate.6 our propose regulation would robust comprehensive subprime guidance agency issue last year. the regulation would apply mortgage lenders, include independent mortgage companies. moreover, regulation would legally enforceable supervisory enforcement agencies. just important, regulations, unlike guidance, would legally enforceable consumer could recover statutory actual damage violations. the propose requirement ass repayment ability intend protect consumer abusive practice maintain access responsible credit. we recognize 6 on adjustable-rate mortgage, fully-indexed rate sum value applicable index loan origination margin specify loan agreement. for example, typical 2/28 mortgage issue 2006 might fully-indexed rate 11.37. this assume mortgage link six-month libor, libor 2006 average value 5.37 percent, mortgage margin six percentage points. 4 bi review 34/2008 satisfy objective time challenge. the propose rule's potential consumer actions, couple careful avoidance prescribe quantitative underwrite thresholds, could raise compliance litigation risk. in turn, could raise cost credit higher-risk borrower limit availability responsible credit. that propose prohibit "pattern practice" disregard repayment ability rather attach risk legal liability every individual loan perform. some commentator argue pattern practice requirement create high standard proof make difficult costly consumer pursue litigation. we specifically seek comment provision look forward perspective offer industry consumer groups. income verification when look closely many borrower mortgage struggle repay soon take loan, prevalence "stated-income" lend clear culprit. substantial anecdotal evidence indicate fail verify income invite fraud. moreover, look loan-level data saw clear correlation "low-doc" "no-doc" lend performance problems, particularly early payment defaults. that propose complement broad requirement ass repayment ability specific requirement verify income asset lender rely make credit decision. we recognize stated-income lend may proper place layer top many risks. therefore, would target verification requirement higher-priced loans, include higher-priced end alt-a market, risk stated-income lend could layer top many risks. the proposal identify standard document would acceptable, w-2 forms. it also allows, however, third party document provide reasonably reliable evidence income. some consumer may access nonstandard document others, self-employed entrepreneurs, may difficulty document income. this rule mean preserve consumer choice allow market identify credible nontraditional documentation consumer income – example, check-cashing receipts. to help ensure proposal preserve access credit full range consumers, seek public comment issue. escrow tax insurance another part proposal higher-priced loan – requirement escrow tax insurance – would also help ensure borrower afford payments. escrowing become standard practice prime market, case make standard subprime market, too, appear compelling. consumer short weak credit history may le likely appreciate sizable burden tax insurance add cost homeownership, vulnerable mislead payment quote leave amounts. moreover, look data, saw unusually high level early payment default possible evidence lack escrow hurt consumer experience pay property tax insurance bills. we propose address problem requirement escrow tax insurance higher-priced loans, accompany limit allowance opt-out. we want regulation prevent irresponsible effort encourage borrower opt out. so rule would permit opt-out close table, instead would require twelve month pas consumer may opt out. the twelve-month wait period would also apply consumer refinance another high-cost loan, reduce likelihood consumer would refinance solely decrease monthly payment eliminate escrowing tax insurance. in respect proposal intend preserve consumer choice protect consumer unaffordable mortgage obligations. bi review 34/2008 5 prepayment penalty have discuss rule would promote affordability, i want say word propose rule prepayment penalties. these penalty take toll consumer risky loans, many consumer may even aware loan penalty. accordingly, propose ban prepayment penalty circumstance high degree risk consumer, also address transparency concerns. the propose rule would ban prepayment penalty likely prevent consumer refinance loan particularly burdensome payment. specifically, penalty would prohibit borrower's debt-to-income ratio exceed 50 percent, penalty would expire loan's payment could increase. the rule would also ban prepayment penalty likely part "loan flipping" scheme – specifically, lender affiliate refinance lender's loan. ban penalty altogether could cause borrowers, include prepay, bear full cost investors' prepayment risk, could raise question fairness, could reduce consumer choice. we recognize differ view look forward gain perspective comment process. steer i far discuss element proposal would seek ensure underwrite practice loan term higher-priced loan present unwarranted risk consumers. there another potential source risk consumer i want address relate "steering" – risk use service mortgage broker, appreciate extent broker's interest may diverge consumer's interest "yield spread premiums."7the growth market brokerage service doubt increase competition market mortgage loans, benefit consumers. moreover, yield spread premium, payment lender broke base loan's interest rate, sometimes best way consumer fund cost broker's services. however, lender pay broke loan high rate, payment create conflict interest broke consumer. this conflict problematic consumer know exist assumes, incorrectly, broke obligate put consumer's interest first. in cases, consumer cannot protect interests, competition loan brokerage service work effectively. therefore, propose prohibit lender, prime subprime loans, pay broke consumer expressly agree broke would receive. this agreement must execute up-front, consumer submit application become invest close deal. the combination strict regulation good disclosure propose help reduce broker's incentive steer consumer high rate, empower consumer shop negotiate among brokers, preserve consumers' option use service broker. good early information consumer lastly, protect consumer promote competition, propose regulation would prohibit mislead mortgage advertise require consumer receive loan-specific 7 a "yield spread premium" present dollar value difference low interest rate wholesale lender would accept particular transaction interest rate broke actually obtain lender. this dollar amount usually pay mortgage broker. it may also apply loan-related costs, board’s proposal concern amount pay broker. 6 bi review 34/2008 disclosure early application process, use information shop effectively. we recognize, however, face challenge ensure disclosure mortgage loan remain effective. we begin comprehensive program rigorous consumer test potential improvement current disclosures. conclusion there element comprehensive proposal i time today discuss, prohibition coerce appraiser restriction unwarranted service fees. we anticipate vigorous public comment proposal, carefully consider input receive, move expeditiously final rule. a i note outset, effective consumer protection help restore confidence mortgage market help preserve flow capital consumer wish purchase home. it early emphasize effectiveness final rule depend critically effective enforcement. the federal reserve part ensure compliance among institution supervises. we also instrumental launch pilot project federal state agency conduct consumer compliance review non-depository lender industry participants. i sure aid effort new system register track mortgage broke recently launch conference state bank supervisors. while work build effective consumer protection enforcement regime future consumers, also continue efforts, encourage initiative many others undertaking, limit unnecessary foreclosure consumer hurt now. bi review 34/2008 7 rundheersing bheenick: local currency bond trade risk management open address mr rundheersing

authority – – do. whilst initiative add necessary condition market development, unlikely prove sufficient own. however good infrastructure may be, player themselves, issuers, investor financial intermediary eventually determine shape size market. it also paramount importance market player adopt participative approach development money market, existence trade limit impede development markets. allow dwell little challenge small country like mauritius currently face conduct monetary policy. today, bank mauritius find confront important challenge reduce rate inflation, stand 9.0 percent end february 2008, preserve competitiveness export-oriented sectors. and must meet challenge backdrop unprecedented capital inflow drive exchange rate rupee. with globalization, small open economy receive large capital inflow face daunt task manage external flow ensure macroeconomic financial stability. intervention central bank purchase large amount foreign exchange market expansionary impact domestic money supply pose severe challenge conduct monetary policy. since mid-december 2007 bank purchase total amount equivalent u dollar 193 million domestic foreign exchange market. to sterilize excess liquidity stem capital inflows, bank issue central bank paper separation debt management monetary management. this entail issue huge amount bank mauritius bill monetary policy purposes, potentially adverse impact central bank’s balance sheet. the central bank, regulator, different role slightly different perspective compare commercial banks, our mandate price stability, financial stability promotion economic development. in pursuit objectives, profitability become secondary issue time like present, dip reserve meet costs. when balance sheet consideration conflict public interest, doubt mind way central bank lean. we must explicitly recognize cost central bank run monetary policy. that central bank require strengthen balance sheet order manage shock impact economy. the central bank’s capital reserve strong enough able sustain repeat intervention money market. give uncertainty surround nature capital inflows, would also prudent central bank small open economy build reserve cushion possible reversal capital flows. presently, treasury bank mauritius bill maturity 91 day 364 days. treasury note maturity 2, 3 4 year bond maturity range 5 year 29 year issue regular basis. lately introduce 14 day special deposit facility. we feel gap 14 day special deposit facility 91 day bill order close gap manage persistent excess liquidity system, bank contemplate issue central bank paper maturity 1 2 months. let say word exchange rate, subject much interest right now. a matter policy, bank allow free play market force determine exchange value rupee. our intervention domestic foreign exchange market aim offset 2 bi review 34/2008 market forces, target specific exchange rate. our objective smooth unwarranted volatility rupee exchange rate improve function market. in brief interview i give “business standard” newspaper india last week, i say even economy suffer deluge foreign exchange inflows, foreign exchange operation confine spot market. this want encourage development vibrant future forward market help create active foreign exchange market introduce new instrument exporter entrepreneur hedge trade financial service sector. a regard issue risk management, correct practice day use derivative hedge unwanted volatilities. derivative bring substantial benefit commercial community, facilitate hedge business planning. such instrument enable financial institution offer progressively wide range service achieve great efficiency intermediation process. unfortunately, one area mauritius lag behind. the market derivative pick significantly compare emerge market economies. i strongly believe domestic financial market mature enough engage derivative trade proper regulation. the bank consider necessary measure need implement stimulate development market. i know that. in many quarters, derivative murky reputation. we believe derivative necessarily lead market manipulation, would bad small market like ours. rather, see derivative enhance efficiency financial market determine put place near future necessary build block rapid development. we conscious derivative involve multiple extra policy responsibility bank. derivative derivatives-trading potential bring disaster properly supervised. therefore one area bank concentrate upon therefore ensure risk properly identified, managed, downside risk might threaten systemic stability avoided. a move new pasture design deepen financial market broaden range financial product instruments, feel also right time encourage rat agency start operation mauritius. in case move also beneficial sector move implementation basle ii. the bank already state intention sell data hold mauritius credit information bureau accredit rat agencies. all concert initiative certainly take u direction develop local bond

in addition, risk capital available market long extent. the intermediary find substantial capital recent months. by curtail share repurchase reduce dividends, several intermediary generate necessary

touch. with long presence thailand, japanese chamber play active role promote common understand thai government agency japanese business community here. japan-thailand economic relationship special breadth depth. even casual observer cannot fail notice prosperous partnership. trade nation double value past 5 years; that’s roughly 14 per cent increase per year. on investment front, japan’s annual direct investment thailand steady close 3 billion u dollar past years, considerable uncertainty notwithstanding. japanese financial service provider lively participant thai financial system. lady gentlemen, much happen since last met. the story financial disruption play u reverberate across world. oil price increase 50 per cent. business government look best response strategy ensure smooth expansion enterprise economy general. tonight, i would like focus 3 relate timely subjects. i begin view outlook thai economy risk surround prospects. then, i would like outline i think necessary monetary exchange rate policy go forward. and lastly, i would like talk foster private investment japanese business do, role investor employers, help make thailand even good place invest. lady gentlemen, a well know, thai economy weather host challenge past 2 years. to mind, view monetary policy committee, domestic political uncertainty, high rise energy price sharp u dollar decline top concern. indeed, political uncertainty, couple rise retail oil prices, take toll private sector confidence consumers’ purchase power. these negative development dent domestic demand first 9 month 2007. the fall u dollar, widely anticipated, major risk could disrupt thailand’s robust export activities. in fact, risk even great extent u financial crisis become clear second half 2007. the u sub-prime mortgage market, small compare entire global financial system, could deliver large impact back u house concerns, credit crunch global liquidity squeeze. it make bad prognosis especially last year’s growth momentum rely heavily net exports. when say done, however, thai economy manage grow rate 5.7 per cent fourth quarter 4.8 per cent whole year. government pump-priming contribute favorable growth outcome. but importantly, turn net export contribute almost 60 per cent overall gdp growth. indeed, export grow remarkable rate 18 per cent u dollar term 2007. the robust expansion due bi review 33/2008 1 ability exporter adjust quality improvement search new markets. but exceptional export performance due le healthy global growth, translate strong trade partners’ demand. another factor contribute success export ability preserve overall price competitiveness face sharp dollar decline. i come back point minutes. i would like turn briefly economic stability. monetary policy accommodative growth since begin 2007 aim shore domestic demand keep inflation check. the outcome front quite favorable, headline core inflation well contain 2.3 1.1 percent, respectively, end-2007. despite unusual global situation, thai financial market also remain resilient 2007 moderate fluctuations. and credit deposit grow slowly, profitability bank financial institution remain satisfactory level. overall npls bank system remain moderate, low income households’ ability service debt start decline mostly account slow income expansion. lady gentlemen, these growth stability outcome significant downside risk paint picture resilient economy. a far outlook thai economy 2008 concerned, i would like address first growth momentum talk risk uncertainty confront economy year. preliminary data indicate private consumption investment firm recover fourth quarter last year. this good news, private consumption investment constitute almost 70 per cent total demand. clear political landscape post-election continue spend government help revive private demand. reflect that, start see strong pickup import january. february data also confirm strength imports. moreover, plan fiscal stimulus well accelerate budget disbursement ensure domestic demand revival firmly place. on external side, even though export growth january especially robust 33 per cent, likelihood see repeat spectacular export performance slim year, global growth project slow considerably. in fact, export growth february already decelerate 16 percent. go forward, risk factor weigh ability thai economy expand likely come u recession high oil commodity prices. in increasingly integrate world, slowdown u demand impact thailand’s export prospects. despite fed’s aggressive interest rate cut innovative measure forestall rise mortgage interest rates, substantial downside risk remains. most u watcher agree u economy may able avoid recession; indeed, employment, house price business confidence data point possibility already recession. it’s matter deep long process last. but u economy weaken substantially worsen prospects, global price pressure let off. crude oil price continue rise world oil demand strengthen face limit global production capacity. in tight demand-supply situation, adverse geopolitical events, unfavorable weather condition dollar slide spike oil prices. this phenomenon new. in fact, continue demand pressure couple supply constraint uncertainty lead country find substitute fossil fuel. so far find bio-fuels, turn put pressure agriculture commodity prices. sign mount cost-push pressure oil commodity price observe recent acceleration domestic headline inflation, rise 5 per cent february. 2 bi review 33/2008 such increase, continued, pose risk incipient recovery private consumption low households’ purchase power. rise production construction cost also dampen business profit, especially face tight control final good prices. dampen prospect profit turn may lead delay plan investment. while downside risk substantial, also upside. high commodity price strengthen farm income, tend benefit large section thai workforce. lady gentlemen, the risk global growth global inflation increase near-term. at point, cannot sure slowdown global growth affect global inflation year. and even though, asset price perspective, positive probability correction oil commodity price go forward, cannot certain correction substantial enough bring inflation risk down. one thing le certain, however: global financial interconnectedness almost ensure expect high financial volatility near term, market player alternate yield-seeking risk-aversion investment strategies. the bank thailand closely monitor situation assess impact thailand’s financial economic stability. give pickup domestic growth momentum various risk thai economy likely confront, monetary policy committee expect thailand’s gdp expand 4.5-6 per cent year inflation exclude raw food energy remain within target 0-3.5 per cent next 8 quarters. in face rise food energy prices, headline inflation expect hover 2.8-4 per cent 2008, expect come next year. i want note however monetary policy committee’s new forecast give april along late inflation report. lady gentlemen, i talk length economic outlook risk go forward. what appropriate course monetary exchange rate policy i think help cushion economy along bumpy road ahead? monetary policy aim ensure price stability economy continue expand full potential. the definition price stability monetary policy committee us alignment public; is, want see low stable inflation time. at moment, policy interest rate low region, monetary policy continue supportive domestic demand growth. in period ahead, challenge monetary policy likely come increase price pressure. with regard exchange rate policy, bank thailand use manage float approach time now. our principle let exchange rate reflect fundamental economy relative trade partner competitors. in short run, international price competitiveness depend 2 things: 1. appreciation thai baht vis-à-vis basket currency trade partner competitors; 2. increase production cost thai company relative trade partner competitors. for example, give appreciation path two compete currency vis-à-vis u dollar, production cost thai company rise beyond foreign competitors, lose price competitiveness. generally, production cost rise inflation. and so, keep inflation low help low relative cost increase thai exporter boost price competitiveness. the exchange rate bank thailand manage represent price competitiveness; call real effective exchange rate. let give specific example: it well know even though baht gain u dollar, appreciate line regional currencies. from begin 2007 early march 2008, real effective exchange rate china bi review 33/2008 3 appreciate roughly 8 per cent india gain 5.4 per cent. during period, thai baht real effective exchange rate appreciate 1.8 per cent. so take account high inflation china india, average thailand-based exporter lose price competitiveness base two countries. view light, export boom come big surprise. lady gentlemen, to gain exchange rate flexibility, bank thailand always seek limit volatility thai baht-us dollar exchange rate. we business use u dollar invoice currency. to end, baht least volatile currency region past year. go forward, continue take care short-term volatility deem disruptive export import price-setting. over next 12 months, global financial environment become even volatile, likely regional currency become flexible. those follow foreign exchange market regularly know market begin take different view regional currency u dollar lose sufficient ground. no one know sure way currency move, increase likelihood see 2-way movement regional currencies. so key message party concern assume one-way movement currency next 12 months. instead, make normal practice hedge undesirable outcomes. lady gentlemen, monetary exchange rate policy best help safeguard economic stability smooth short-term fluctuation bump there. price competitiveness may important, one side story. the side competitiveness product improvement efficient production techniques. japanese company strange dimension competitiveness. after plaza accord mid-1980s, yen gain roughly 50 per cent one year u dollar, japanese business find way improve. those succeed become resourceful result. for thai economy compete grow robustly 21st century, need foster investment infrastructure, physical institutional, well human resource. this way improve productivity enable majority thai people share gain economic growth global integration. what’s especially important continue prosperity clarity implementation plan public investment next 5 years. these plans, are, address entire spectrum infrastructure deficiency economy faces. the public sector’s commitment invest heavily matter help boost business sentiment private investment, important growth engine hold back past years. moreover, modernization public transportation, house water resource management, well health education spend translate good private sector return cost reduction productivity increase. good outlook return enhance charm thailand investment destination. we also need focus service well manufacture sectors. in fact, service sector large manufacture employment terms. the bank thailand help endeavor continue strengthen financial infrastructure. aside broaden people’s access financial services, also aim promote competition financial sector. competition, mindful risk involved, enhance efficiency well knowledge build transfer. with good prudential supervision background, pressure competition help ensure financial institution perform well globally competitiveness environment. to end, good account standard, example, adoption ia 39, expect strengthen financial sector’s resiliency adverse shock bring forward good investment climate. 4 bi review 33/2008 go hand hand modern infrastructure skilled human resource. study labor market condition dialogue entrepreneurs, thai foreign, confirm labor quality shortage key problem well everywhere else world. to sure, formal school important source skill quality development, experience workplace contribute less. in thailand, acute problem skill mismatch; is, skill produce formal school find different firm find useful. lady gentlemen, japan’s direct investment contribute skill improvement thai business workforce, mostly learn doing, train knowledge transfers. but beyond that, reduce mismatch demand production skills, japanese firm play direct beneficial role. the solution break barrier work school early on. firm get involve train vocational student potential worker get glimpse what’s really need real world. if do well, i think give incentive firm invest train student give opportunity identify select best worker enter workforce. to students, potential gain incentive well. with opportunity train best get know corporate culture first-hand, student trainee likely compete limit hire improve performance. this sort apprenticeship program long practice germany, show reduce skill mismatch workplace well improve firms’ profitability. practice here, could also reinforce mutual understand thai worker way japanese firm business. that said, human capital development take vast continuous effort long period time. in near term, i think experience adjust yen’s sharp appreciation particularly helpful local partners. japanese company capable lend help hand local supplier try upgrade productive efficiency. that would help smooth adjustment process rough tumble times. lady gentlemen, i hope i contribute understand economic condition outlook thailand. the thai economy show resilient adverse shocks. i confident fundamental strong. public investment basic infrastructure bank thailand’s commitment maintain economic financial stability translate moderate long-term cost investment financing. with awareness what’s store u right macroeconomic policy mix go forward, see economy expand favorably sustainable fashion. i need mention crucial thailand japan ensure trade investment partnership prosper year come. thank attention. bi review 33/2008 5 shamshad akhtar: corporate governance bank speech dr shamshad akhtar, governor state bank pakistan, ibp convocation,

would also potential inflationary consequence rest population wide economy. in term macroeconomic policies, policy trade-off extent exchange rate adjustment inflation rate. the way forward small open economy like mauritius aim become competitive achievement real productivity gains. long-term competitiveness depend exchange rate change productivity growth. short-term exchange rate accommodation

it aim offset market force target specific exchange rate bank exchange rate target. the policy approach use bank mauritius face incoming capital inflow also validate recent article iv mission imf. the conduct monetary policy free sectoral considerations. it role central bank support particular sector expense sectors. policy aim promote general interest country try do. part iii: challenge emerge globalization after remark relate specific context mauritius, say implication globalization conduct monetary policy kind situation? but, generally, u begin wonder whether globalization lead reassessment central banks’ primary objective price stability. especially now, light recent action u federal reserve seem concern stave recession kick-start economy. should revisit entire framework economic monetary analysis central banks? how react range variable assume great importance global markets? ha globalization alter way monetary policy influence inflation output? in words, affect transmission mechanism monetary policy? not know much first place, people would believe! should monetary policy react directly exchange rate movement focus inflation real gdp? it often assert integrate global markets, sit back let market work. can central banker small open economy face unprecedented capital flow afford that? how interventionist central bank circumstances? how resilient monetary policy frameworks? do need sophisticate economic monetary model address monetary policy challenge stem globalization? with globalization, small open economy receive unprecedented capital flow face daunt task manage external flow order ensure macroeconomic financial stability. monetary management contend vicissitude capital flow increase volatility exchange rates. while distinction short-term long-term capital flow may conceptually clear, operational viewpoint, severe problem distinguish two. at give time, inflow could endure nature whereas others could temporary and, hence, reversible. in face uncertainty determine temporary permanent nature inflows, justify blame central banker if, prudence, assume flow temporary permanent nature established? there underlie similarity challenge face india mauritius face capital inflows. there also, however, significant difference that. india full convertibility capital financial account balance payments. this difference translate additional leeway reserve bank india manage capital flows. mauritius open capital financial account, since abolition capital control july 1994, tool rbi disposal. introduce capital control guise certainly option us. bi review 31/2008 7 part iv: challenge monetary policy what, then, challenge face small open economy conduct monetary policy confront unprecedented capital flows? a i say open remarks, question trouble ever since i take helm bank mauritius one year ago. a doubt aware, economics, simultaneously target exchange rate maintain independent monetary policy, open capital account, consider impossible trinity. this famous trilemma follow mundell-fleming model, state country cannot simultaneously fix exchange rate, open capital account, pursue independent monetary policy. only two three objective mutually consistent. even fully float exchange rate, become difficult small open economy face unprecedented capital flow run independent monetary policy. and, boy, don’t i know it! governor reddy, recent address last week, paris international symposium banque de france “globalization, inflation monetary policy”, underline simultaneous challenges, several angles, conduct monetary policy arise recent financial market turbulence, grow importance global factor relate abrupt large policy shift monetary policy measure major economies, unprecedented inflationary pressure due food energy prices. i fully endorse governor’s reddy’s view development certainly warrant significant innovative way cooperation among central bankers. intervention central bank purchase large amount foreign exchange market expansionary impact domestic money supply pose challenge conduct monetary policy. just illustrate point i try make, yesterday bank mauritius intervene purchase r 1.8 billion foreign currency dollar euro domestic forex market prevent market seize altogether major player reach foreign currency exposure limits. this new record, improve previous record single transaction r 1.6 billion conduct christmas 2007 purchase euro 40.5 million market. i suspect present record stand long either. to appreciate relative enormity transactions, remember bank’s capital base currently r 1 billion general reserve stand r 23.5 billion. to sterilize excess liquidity stem capital inflows, central bank issue government central bank securities. in case mauritius, separation debt management monetary management, entail issue huge amount bank mauritius bill monetary policy purposes, potentially adverse impact central bank’s balance sheet profit loss account. it instructive recall recent past, precisely fy 2003-04, bank mauritius incur loss accrue largely monetary operation time return foreign exchange reserve also low point, rate u dollar hover around 1 per cent. with current apprehension imminent recession unite state aggressive ease interest rate u federal reserve, conduct level monetary operation sterilise project volume capital inflow would, likelihood, move central bank negative territory. such outcome become near certainty give significant interest rate differential exist yield central bank securities, currently around 8.0 per cent, placement u dollar stand around 3.0 per cent. globalization indeed complicate task monetary management .with globalize capital markets, small open economy, face unprecedented capital flows, must grapple potentially serious challenge keep inflation control, prevent exchange rate appreciation undermine external competitiveness. there 8 bi review 31/2008 clearly cost central bank run monetary policy explicitly recognized. i believe instrument operate procedure monetary policy also constantly refine meet challenge arise unprecedented capital inflows. moreover, central bank require strengthen balance sheet order manage shock impact economy. a central bank’s capital reserve strong enough able sustain repeat intervention money market. give uncertainty surround nature capital inflows, would also prudent central bank small open economy build reserve cushion possible change investor sentiment, lead sudden stop syndrome even mare dread reversal capital flows. in circumstances, governor sound alarm bell seek help minister finance? to offset strong impulse aggregate demand large capital flows, isn’t hefty dose fiscal consolidation doctor ordered? or governor accuse spoilsport good buoyant times? to sum then, i would say central banker indeed live interest times. it take grant smart bunch. but smart long enough. we must also lucky. i try demonstrate that, present juncture, conduct monetary policy nothing short gargantuan task lilliputian economy mauritius is. to meet emerge unprecedented challenge financial sector, bank mauritius, i say early celebrate 40th anniversary last year, pursue renew vigour determination excite journey modernization. we enlist support reserve bank india area bank supervision, thus renew tradition go back early year existence rbi officer help establish bank mauritius. we engage major restructure internal organisation help resource person bank negara malaysia. the structure flatter, creation division within bank responsible particular focus area activity. the bank adopt open transparent staff strategy, promotion fifty-five exist staff recruitment twenty-three additional staff outside bank. to appreciate fundamental transformation, remember total staff strength add 250 persons. we enhance skill knowledge base add value organisation contribute directly towards attainment organisational goals. bi review 31/2008 1 jean-pierre roth: swiss outlook global development summary speech mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank chairman board director bank international settlements, icon roadshow euro 2008, frankfurt main, 17 march 2008. the complete speech find german swiss national bank’s website (www.snb.ch). * * * the swiss economy look back number successful year active participant growth world economy. the export sector rapidly expand presence new markets, thereby make important contribution development. what remarkable increase foreign activity detrimental switzerland production location. on contrary, swiss location benefit overall. reform aim strengthen open switzerland business location also make substantial contribution economic prosperity recent years. the turbulence financial market erupt mid-2007 unlikely leave swiss economy unscathed. the export sector, include banks, affect slowdown international economy. an additional factor substantial rise value swiss franc past month euro u dollar. however, already position learn quite bite financial market turmoil. first, financial market highly integrated, central bank need cooperate closely order master problems. second, incentive scheme bank give particular priority reward risky behaviour changed, instrument measure risk need reassessed. the way swiss national bank steer swiss franc money market, however, prove worth, three-month libor successfully hold inside target range. in way, real economy protect upheaval interbank market. mark carney: address financial market turbulence remark mr mark carney, governor bank canada, toronto board trade, toronto, 13 march 2008. * * * since last summer, many u today preoccupy ongoing dislocation financial markets. what begin security link u.s. subprime mortgage spread broad range structure assets, conventional credit markets, and, less extent, equities. a consequence, world's large financial institution record substantial losses, cost borrow increased, availability credit decreased. more seven month on, end yet sight, although safe say reach end begin turmoil. this dislocation market eased; fact, strain financial market intensify recently, rather enter new phase policy-makers market participant good understand shortcoming current financial system need do – group – address them. this response important economies. even though practice contribute crisis take place beyond borders, financial institution comparatively robust health, canada isolate global events. some institution suffer losses, economy begin feel effect deterioration global financial conditions. moreover, go forward, national market judge new standard liquidity, transparency, great integrity come properly align incentives. our institution compete environment. in remark today, i would like discus briefly three factor behind market turbulence outline correspond priority official sector market participants. this list far exhaustive, i choose three among important, effort way – public private sector – address them. cause turbulence recent event represent overdue repricing risk; direction predict many desire some.1 however, speed virulence repricing illustrate adage "be careful wish for." while repricing trigger significantly higher-than-expected default u.s. subprime mortgages, recognize trigger could come wide range sources. the social economic cost event subprime market concentrate unite states, financial cost widely disperse – relative scale system – readily absorbable. in short, painful affected, subprime loss important primarily reveal deep flaw financial system. while number underlie cause identified, i concentrate three particular. the first relate liquidity. in recent years, market participant overly confident liquid market would continually provide outlet new product represent ongoing source fund liquidity financial institutions. ample market liquidity origin benign macroeconomic conditions, low relatively stable long-term interest rates, financial 1 indeed, central bank discuss possibility repricing risk time. see "developments trends," financial system review (ottawa: bank canada, june 2004): 4-5. bi review 30/2008 1 innovation, broaden list financial market participants. ultimately sow seed demise, market liquidity feed supreme confidence ability sell hold price match mark-to-model valuations. this overconfidence encourage rapid growth "originate-to-distribute" credit model. in model, borrower often become separate end investor several transactions, credit risk repackaged, tiered, securitized, distributed. many originator distributor felt confident long-term credit risk transform short-term "warehouse" risk prior distribution distribution irrevocable. others know fully eliminate risks, felt could get time. such confidence misplaced. risk disappeared, merely redistributed, distribution often final. the current market disruption represent, part, painful process find risk ultimately lies. liquidity also achilles heel many asset-backed commercial paper (abcp) program structure investment vehicles. in many vehicles, medium-term, illiquid, hard-to-value asset fund short-term money market security yield marginally high offer liquid, transparent, risk-free securities. a confidence paper could roll faltered, indiscriminate sell structure assets. in market backstop liquidity judge automatic, abcp currently involve montreal accord, noteholders could long redeem paper.2 in market backstop liquidity robust, investor could exit and, result, abcp come back balance sheet financial institutions, turn raise concern scale exposure. from medium-term perspective, disappearance segment abcp market around world important implication viability many securitized products, since abcp represent important fund source senior tranche securitized credit structures. the second cause current market disruption lack transparency inadequate disclosure characterize many highly structure financial products. these shortcoming ignore time good extent many investor actually understand characteristic security owned. market participant often le surprise deterioration subprime market fundamental marked-to-market loss subprime collateralize debt obligation (cdo) securities, give default underlie mortgages. this surprise, turn, prompt broad re-evaluation structure product and, cases, indiscriminate selling. even month later, opacity structure product make hard value, thus dramatically reduce secondary market liquidity. poor disclosure many securitized product continue make difficult new investor enter market confidently purchase security despite distress price presence still-substantial global liquidity. indeed, i discus moment, high cost default protection many market – corporate bond – imply pessimism actual default probability appear excessive.3 at time, widespread uncertainty distribution loss feed concern counterparty risk. with assumption risk irrevocably transfer find wanting, market participant become uncertain true financial situation counterparties, sometimes reluctant lend, even short horizons. the 2 the bank canada raise concern p. toovey j. kiff, "developments issue canadian market asset-backed commercial paper," financial system review (ottawa: bank canada, june 2003): 43-49. 3 for example, recent weeks, default rate imply level itraax crossover index reach almost twice cumulative default rate experience comparably rat company last two recessions. 2 bi review 30/2008 result "reckless prudence" has, occasion, create unusual condition interbank market intensify already sharp reduction market liquidity. inadequate transparency also factor behind breakdown trust credit-rating agencies, amplify stress financial markets. this breakdown occur several reasons. first, default rat transition probability structure product always consistent corporate sovereign ratings. moreover, recent event bring focus potential conflict interest rat business.4 the fall grace rat agency significant impact rat agency grow powerful anyone intended. indeed, many investor seem perform little in-house credit analysis investments; words, substitute subscription rat publication analysis due diligence. the third final cause i mention series misalign incentives. it belatedly recognize sever long-term relationship originator borrower contribute decline credit quality. historically, original lender (or originator credit) would meticulous documentation careful due diligence, know would likely retain exposure risk default loan matured. however, originator become increasingly confident could sell loan, documentation credit standard decline now-infamous extreme "low doc/ninja" (no income, job assets) loan u.s. subprime borrowers. performance deteriorate accordingly: example, default rate u.s. subprime mortgage loan make 2006 already reach almost 8 per cent le two year origination, rate 2.5 time comparable figure similar loan make 2004.5 there also appear number problem incentive alignment several global financial institutions. these include mismatch time trader compensation realization profit trades, insufficient recognition compensation risk-management professionals, provision fund risk-free rate trade desk place risky bets. all factor encourage excessive risk taking. finally, appear possible incentive provide series regulation may encourage crowd trades. the so-called "cliff risk" create mandate use rat one example. a paradox current turbulence desire shelter perceive safety aaa-rated asset lead dangerous explosion supply synthetically create aaa-rated assets. since many asset finance excessive leverage many participant constrain mandate sell downgrades, rush exit prove extremely destabilizing. next step policy-makers before address specific response detail, i would like make couple general points. the first that, need restore well-functioning market paramount importance, official sector afford take time ensure action take appropriate. this many market practice contribute dislocation stopped. at present, many financial institution are, best, assume limit access market-based liquidity and, extreme, hoard liquidity. it understatement say credit exposure receive active scrutiny. the 4 for full discussion, see m. zelmer, "reforming credit-rating process," financial system review (ottawa: bank canada, december 2007): 51-57. 5 data supply merrill lynch u.s. see also j. kiff p. mills, "money nothing check free: recent development u.s. subprime mortgage markets" (working paper wp/07/188, international monetary fund, 2007). bi review 30/2008 3 demand complex, opaque security dry up. with institutional memory long months, even financial sector, need rush judgment impose hastily conceive measures. the point market participant every reason learn lesson event change behaviour required. a i discus moment, encourage sign regard. that said, recent event reveal serious widespread shortcoming that, address promptly, completely, credibly, demand activist response part regulators. the ultimate response likely combination improve private sector standard effective regulation. with general point mind, i would like describe current response three factor i mentioned. first, term liquidity, many country official sector work strengthen modernize liquidity arrangement necessary. since august, many central bank provide liquidity keep financial system functioning, favour one market. in case bank canada, provision liquidity standard operation effective keep overnight interest rate close target. however, countries, liquidity maturity spectrum problematic. while liquidity term money market canada currently good december good experience jurisdictions, yet return historical norms. there number way bank canada seek improve ability provide liquidity system. first, bank indicate plan expand list collateral accept stand liquidity facility. last week, issue consultation paper plan take type abcp collateral 31 march. we also plan accept u.s. treasury collateral middle year. second, examine type term purchase resale facility make available time financial instability market failure. these facility could similar term purchase resale agreement (or pras) bank conduct december conduct next weeks. in cases, announcement term pras make part coordinate action take major central bank address liquidity pressure fund markets. the g-10 central bank continue work together take appropriate step address liquidity pressures. finally, recent budget, federal government announce proposal amend bank canada act order modernize authority support stability financial system. in parallel initiatives, liquidity management financial institution must also improved. reinvigorate institutional memory remind broad range institution importance liquidity management credit discipline. it worth note that, year ago, institute international finance publish thoughtful document outline potential vulnerability management liquidity risk financial institution suggest best practice private official sectors.6 however, much life, implementation everything. regulator develop new guideline increase focus liquidity management redress shortcomings. the second priority area action need improvement transparency disclosure practices. such improvement would help reduce information asymmetry impede smooth function markets. globally, urgent need credible, timely disclosure. recent report canadian financial institution meet requirement. however, information alone 6 institute international finance, principle liquidity risk management (washington: institute international finance, 2007). 4 bi review 30/2008 insufficient; investor also need know interpret it. the combination relative novelty fair value account extremely volatile market make interpretation difficult. some question utility require mark-to-market valuation asset liability corporate balance sheet.7 the point make that, current circumstances, exist account rule provide degree precision warranted. by reflect market moves, fair value account certainly increase volatility report earnings. whether contribute pro-cyclically market volatility depend behaviour management. management's incentive realize mark-to-market loss depend expectation future market move also, importantly, extent investor reward cap downside risk penalize high book leverage cause unrealized losses. this depends, part, investors' interpretation exist rules. investor keep several factor mind. first, volatile markets, report earn volatile. second, investor distinguish realize unrealized losses. third, security may marked-to-market use imperfect proxies, thinly trade derivative indices. a consequence, investor wary assign unwarranted precision valuations. fourth, many complex securities, valuation might good express range outcomes. since current account rule permit this, investor must use judgment construct valuation distributions. institution provide information necessary facilitate judgments. from medium-term perspective, financial stability forum look account valuation procedure financial derivative instruments, particularly complex, narrowly trade product become difficult price time stress. more generally, authority around world promote prompt full disclosure financial institution loss valuation structure products, seek improve understand disclosure institutions' exposure off-balance-sheet vehicles. loss recognition major financial institution proceed much rapidly previous period financial turmoil. this ultimately speed recovery process, provide investor realize rule game changed. loss would hide reserve past quickly, sometimes imprecisely, open. some loss revise later; thus, report earn may volatile realize final results. what authority encourage great transparency structure products? first, announce last week, bank's high disclosure standard abcp accept collateral stand liquidity facility may encourage market participant raise standards. in end, decision. while issuer arranger every incentive improve transparency structure products, ultimately, disclosure guideline set – – regulators. one lesson abcp situation may blanket disclosure exemption broad. at time, however, authority resist temptation bring forward overly prescriptive regulations. rather, consider great application principles-based regulation. there point regulator try anticipate every new product restrain development. there point encourage issuer ensure adequacy disclosure within principles-based framework bear consequence subsequently find wanting. a i comment earlier, evolve role rat agency relate closely issue disclosure transparency. authority examine role credit-rating agency 7 for example, see b. connolly, "accounting depression." banque aig research, 4 march 2008. bi review 30/2008 5 evaluate structure product impact mandate use rat due investment guideline regulation. go forward, security regulator want see agency incentive align closely investors, ensure agency quick thorough review past ratings. other regulator must also take responsibility look extent mandate use rat encourage credit outsourcing, lead pro-cyclical price movements, encourage discontinuous crowd trades. since rat agency rely reputations, powerful incentive sharpen practices, improve information content rat complex financial instruments, ensure material fact disclose concise timely manner, address inherent conflict interest rat process. recent announcement rat agency regard encouraging. i stress investor must rely exclusively change rat methodology agency repair deficiency risk-management practices. in mark-to-market world, leveraged, collateralize positions, investor need make judgment creditworthiness, liquidity, price volatility security own. the third priority area action concern proper alignment incentives. the market dislocation reveal example serious principal-agent problems, notably, within originate-to-distribute model. for securitization market function well, incentive originator align end investors. indeed, originator distributor find difficult sell product face first loss otherwise retain exposure reputational risk. i little doubt that, time, originator distributor adjust. incentive alignment necessary sufficient condition revive many structured-product markets. it need accompany great standardization, improve transparency, development appropriate investor base. another example misalign incentive see risk-management practice remuneration structure financial institution globally.8 many financial institution pay structure reward short-term result encourage potentially excessive risk taking. investor take lead demand compensation structure align interests. others suggest regulator make determinations. while i think regulation compensation within private institution entirely inappropriate, i think regulator need consider carefully incentive impact compensation arrangement ass robustness risk-management internal control systems. regulation also create incentives. the financial stability forum review basic supervisory principle prudential oversight possibility incentive create account standard bank capital regulation contribute pro-cyclicality financial system.9 conclusion let conclude comment role monetary policy. at time great uncertainty, important ever monetary policy act stabilize force. this underscore importance keep inflation low, stable, predictable. this mean 8 m. wolf, "why regulator intervene bankers' pay," financial times, 16 january 2008, 11. 9 both basel committee bank supervision international organization security commission work area. 6 bi review 30/2008 bank continue watch development real economy impact inflation. development financial sector important monetary policy perspective extent expect influence development real economy and, therefore, inflation. i mean downplay current financial turbulence – clearly begin affect u.s. economy and, less extent, well. at bank canada, continue monitor effects, aim neither favour particular market segment insulate market participant consequence decisions. those consequence continue reveal week month ahead. this remain difficult process. however, response i outline help market translate uncertainty risk, encourage appropriate repricing risk market ultimately return normal functioning. however, mean full return status quo ante. while risk still distributed, securitization increasingly transparent standardized, perhaps eventually exchange traded. first loss likely remain, degree, originator. liquidity balance sheet strength highly valued. volatility le restrain overconfidence. in short, see world financial institution sound credit judgment, effective risk management, patient capital prosper; world capital allocate efficiently; world reward traditional attribute canadian financial institutions. i feel positive canada's medium-term prospect world. bi review 30/2008 7 irma rosenberg: current monetary policy – difficult balance act speech m irma rosenberg, first deputy governor sverige riksbank, nordea, stockholm, 11 march 2008. * * * at monetary policy meet 12 february riksbank decide raise repo rate 0.25 percentage point 4.25 per cent. i enter reservation decision consider repo rate leave unchanged. however, far clear stance. i would therefore like take opportunity explain reason clearly consideration monetary policy take account. i also comment statistic receive since monetary policy meeting. in context feel natural briefly comment criticism received, namely riksbank altogether silent view economic developments. it possible autumn, begin financial turmoil, underestimate need executive board member comment development see around us. it also possible generally underestimate need, even le turbulent times, discus late assessment relate new statistic receive since recent monetary policy meeting. all this, is, publish forecast new outcomes, public information link make follow work. however, sake clarity, i also intend run important information receive since monetary policy meet 12 february. however, i say anything new information mean future interest rate developments. this something executive board member decide next monetary policy meeting. the material february decision in monetary policy report publish february account give way majority executive board view prospect inflation development real economy sweden abroad come years. the monetary policy consideration also show assessment base forecast repo rate describe report. the main scenario report forecast continue high cost pressure swedish economy weak economic growth abroad sweden, albeit still good. it add forecast change marginally since december monetary policy update. growth unite state euro area expect considerably low last year also low trend development. even world whole growth expect slow remain good since emerge market china india expect continue grow rapid rate. in main scenario recovery unite state euro area expect begin second half year next year growth largely back trend level. growth sweden expect approximately year last year, reality weaken one take account large number work day year. inflation sweden rise rapidly autumn and, measure cpi cpix, expect exceed inflation target large part forecast period. the uncertainty future economic development still considerable, however, highlight number alternative scenario describe monetary policy report. one involve great financial turmoil growth abroad slow sharply. in scenario growth u economy fall main scenario, time borrow cost household company whole world bi review 30/2008 1 higher. this lead general dampen demand low gdp growth inflation abroad sweden. but, write previous reports, also risk inflation high main scenario wage development strong productivity weak expected. in addition, risk grow price abroad may increase fast rate main scenario, would impact inflation sweden also. my international outlook february we must look overall picture make monetary policy decisions. the forecast report see average forecast, always surround substantial uncertainty interval. in case unusually difficult idea probability different outcomes. even though present situation certain similarity previous episodes, difference outweigh similarity is, therefore, little previous experience learn from. prior monetary policy meet february i felt, still feel, concern international development reflect main scenario monetary policy report. my view international development differ greatly main scenario short-term perspective. however, i concern financial crisis would deep protract forecast. the financial market turmoil continue monetary policy meeting. the problem interbank market appear alleviate extent, although interbank rate still high normal risk premium credit market continue high. the turmoil continue great financial crisis express ways. it probably take long time gain general view extent international bank financial institution force write-down losses. one relatively late consequence crisis problem so-called monolines, is, insurance company insure bond loans. many risk downgrade credit rat agency since case several them. a i saw it, problem could lead substantial credit crunch. development world’s stock market another clear expression financial turmoil. since international stock market fall begin last summer, february monetary policy meeting, price large stock exchange fall 15 30 per cent. just since begin year price fall 10-15 per cent. it difficult predict exist turmoil financial market affect development around world swedish economy. the financial sector sweden outside bad crisis area since small direct exposure problematic area security markets, assessment swedish economy would affect continue crisis abnormally high interest rate element credit rationing. the problem u house market also continued. accord real estate statistics, house price fall regions. a long adjustment continues, risk problem subprime market aggravate financial turmoil intensify. it difficult ass financial turmoil problem house market affect real economy. growth unite state weaken substantially final quarter last year fall house investment make significantly negative contribution. nonetheless, household consumption maintain relatively well fourth quarter. the question resistant household consumption, correspond approximately 70 per cent gdp, give shock face u economy. the fact house share price fall mean household wealth declining, 2 bi review 30/2008 could negative impact demand. the upturn oil food price also mean households’ purchase power undermined. these negative effect counteract extent federal reserve’s cut policy rate various fiscal policy measures. the forecast main scenario monetary policy report entail fairly weak growth u economy come quarters. nevertheless, i consider evident risk problem would prolong forecast main scenario report. growth euro area also subdue fourth quarter last year. the outcome publish time monetary policy meeting, largely expected. household euro area appear restrictive consumption expenditure. retail trade turnover fell end last year also possible discern survey data household confidence declined. a unite states, prolong problem financial market lead development weak main scenario. my view february development sweden inflation gradually rise sweden recent years. on average, measure term cpi, inflation 2.2 per cent last year, close inflation target. the upswing inflation partly due resource utilisation economy increase cost pressure risen. hourly wage increase rapidly time productivity growth slacken considerably. inflation low several years, 2007 rise cost pressure factor contribute inflation reach target. underlie inflation, measure term cpix, however 1.2 per cent average 2007. during autumn last year inflation rise quickly and, measure term cpi, reach 3.5 per cent december. underlie inflation, measure term cpix, rise 2 per cent december. the rapid upturn inflation last autumn largely due rise energy food prices, reflection fact price rise rapidly world market. at monetary policy meet i point possible immediately counteract rapid price impulse abroad monetary policy. quite simply, must allow take time. in monetary policy report rapid price increase extent assess temporary nature. if world market price continue rise rapid pace future, inflation fall back again. this also forecast main scenario report. however, extent, also concern effect inflation risk become permanent may need counteract monetary policy. when inflation rise target, cpi inflation is, important allow become entrench become permanently high. the risk increase inflation expectation rise, exactly occurred. inflation expectation rise one year ahead, even two five year ahead, troublesome. the monetary policy decision the upturn inflation inflation expectation slightly long term also factor indicate interest rate raise monetary policy meet february. the forecast main scenario monetary policy report mean growth slacken still remain good forecast period. i personally slightly concern problem financial market risk weak development abroad, would course also affect development sweden. bi review 30/2008 3 a minute meet show i was, hand, quite concern cost pressure before. wage appear rise quickly riksbank assume shortly new agreement meet last year. the wage forecast also adjust downwards monetary policy report. in addition, opinion slowdown productivity growth last year comprehensible publication national account statistic third quarter show output growth clearly slow early begin 2007. growth number hour work slacken output growth. this normal pattern growth slacken labour market typically lag behind somewhat economic cycle. i therefore assess weak productivity growth indicate company restrictive recruit labour rather see rapid price increase future. when i weigh together great uncertainty development financial market risk weak development abroad swedish economic outlook risk inflation sweden remain high, conclusion interest rate leave unchanged. i would like emphasise regard though i wish attach le weight inflation target. it question much time take bring inflation back target. i also point riksbank raise interest rate number stage since january 2006 increase yet full impact economy. what happen since monetary policy meeting? so far assessment outcome data indicator euro area largely line assessment main scenario monetary policy report. my opinion also indication weak u growth begin year continue problem house property market line assessment main scenario. in short-term perspective assessment differ own. i however concern take long recovery gather pace. swedish gdp growth fourth quarter last year somewhat strong expect monetary policy report. employment, measure number hour worked, increase unexpectedly high rate productivity growth last year weak expect report. the national institute economic research’s business tendency survey february show clear slowdown economic activity business sector whole. the business tendency survey suggest employment continue increase, slow rate. company adjust recruitment plan downwards ahead come months. in contrast, purchase manager index display positive view february. the total index rise somewhat several month fluctuate around level 55, close average since 2001. however, time, survey show growth employment slacken company become le optimistic output growth future. in january inflation sweden somewhat low compare forecast monetary policy report. however, largely connect fact weight cpi basket, end year, changed. the effect change unusually large time. this could interpret though consumers, great extent normal, replace good service increase rapidly price consumption. the so-called substitution effect great riksbank analyst assumed. all all, activity swedish economy final quarter last year appear slightly high expect february. productivity hand show weak development assessment report. survey data clearly suggest 4 bi review 30/2008 however slowdown occur part business sector increase demand labour point slowing. the turmoil increase financial market around world. this suggest complicate process protracted. the so-called ted spreads, spread interbank rate t-bill rates, rise more, unite state even sweden unite kingdom. credit spread still high. in recent day spread mortgage market sweden increased. this link unrest mortgage market european countries. credit insurance premium rise recently unite state europe. new report loss relate u subprime sector received. share price europe unite state fluctuate somewhat, present somewhat low time monetary policy meeting. the krona strengthen somewhat, especially u dollar. conclusion a i mention initially, i speech refer new information receive compare forecast make connection february monetary policy report. it important point lot important new statistic receive prior next monetary policy meet april, overall assessment make monetary policy consequences. when i look happen since monetary policy meet 12 february i think event far support general outline give monetary policy report. neither difference assessment main scenario apply development short term month two. my slightly pessimistic view apply consequence might turmoil financial markets. it question risk weak development abroad consequence may development real economy inflation swedish economy. my assessment february that, give considerable prevail uncertainty, wait raise repo rate. at time, important emphasise executive board members, regardless stance recent meeting, look seriously upon risk aggravate financial turmoil weak development abroad well risk inflation sweden become entrench high level. it easy weigh risk i therefore believe remarkable executive board member reach slightly different conclusion deliberation meet february. bi review 30/2008 5 glenn stevens: monetary policy inflation – work? remark mr glenn stevens, governor reserve bank australia, australian treasury seminar series, canberra, 11 march 2008. * * * when i originally approach speak audience, i ask give reserve bank perspective economy. that fairly general brief. give current state affairs, make sense fulfil talk specifically inflation monetary policy. there extensive commentary around moment “blunt” instruments, concern effect rise interest rate particular indebted section community appeal various quarter way deal inflation. hence, seem sensible moment visit monetary policy works. it also important realistic assessment extent instrument available help job monetary policy charge with. but tackle either issues, prior set question addressed, actually happen inflation. unless clear that, subsequent discussion monetary policy’s role control well based. if actually inflation problem, presumably monetary policy proceed differently would is, fact, problem. so plan remark follows. first, i address question happen inflation why. then i turn question monetary policy it, instrument do. in instances, way i propose recount question see raise various places. in cases, reasonable questions. but reasonable answers, i would like offer them. finally, i would like step back approach focus particular detail current situation give broad historical perspective. it important keep perspective mind, clear big challenge is, also clear well economy done, far least, meet it. argument inflation one argument around isn’t much inflation. on face it, unreasonable start point. the late cpi headline rate is, all, 3 per cent. if high get come point long, presumably much problem. it would, fact, quite consistent inflation target framework operate well decade now. the average inflation rate run year would still “two point something”. unfortunately, situation present quite benign that. the headline figure owe quite bite unusually low result march quarter 2007, affect unusual temporary effects. when get march 2008 figure towards end april, likely find rise four quarter like 4 per cent. that result various temporary factor affect it, necessarily immediate guide concern be. to get good feel component inflation likely persistent, look various measure underlie inflation. a know, one way this, judgement sensible doctrinaire one underlie measure. but clear series pick up, exact extent vary measure. overall, reserve bank, february 2008 statement monetary policy, put pace underlie inflation past year 3½ per cent. that disaster bi review 30/2008 1 temporary phenomenon either, monetary policy set view wind increase back within reasonable period. now i need clear status underlie measures. the target monetary policy set term consumer price index. the objective achieve average rate cpi inflation 2 3 per cent. the “on average” specification use precisely cpi sometimes affect short period factor year two’s time, effect monetary policy change still come through. for policy chase short term fluctuation would risk make economy less, rather more, stable. so need look ahead cpi likely future, well now. for purpose, employ analytical device help u detect ongoing trend inflation likely be, underlie measure useful. they not, themselves, target variable. but policy target future cpi inflation, use underlie inflation analytical tool and/or predictor headline cpi, would probably look similar one target underlie inflation per se. so, sense, one try ass economist would call bank’s “reaction function” use particular price series, underlie measure would probably helpful headline rate. another argument hear inflation higher, due thing supply side cannot help, cannot influence monetary policy. there price historically subject large temporary supply disturbances. agricultural produce classic example – droughts, flood phenomenon sometimes significant, even large, impacts. but effect expect temporary – weather condition change, price revert back trend. so need monetary policy respond them, various underlie measure help u abstract effect short term. when cyclone larry devastate banana crop early 2006, effect help push cpi inflation rate 4 per cent. that impact reversed. contrary assert quarters, monetary policy respond event time, since. there certainly food price push recent drought (though others push down). it le clear, however, unusually large price movement currently affect cpi pass temporary supply disturbances. global oil price certainly rise sharply, supply oil reduced. in fact, supply oil never higher. the big reason rise price oil (measured u dollars) rise demand. of course australian demand (though risen), demand asia, especially china, account much rise global demand. so rise energy price “our fault”, speak, temporary. high chinese demand go go away. so adjust high energy prices. people also point prominent increase rent cpi special factor, certainly true rent rise quickly. the reason happen pretty clear too: strong demand type accommodation, rent yield supplier unusually low. hence, rent bind rise. interestingly, show lengthy rather complex connection asset price change consumer price inflation. a key factor behind rental yield low price residential property rise strongly – far fast rent – early part decade, stay high place country. while capital gain occurring, matter little many investor rent run yield low. but sustainable. once capital gain slowed, low rental yield matter great deal. low yield also prompt demand rental accommodation otherwise. that combination bind lead adjustment rents, unless property price actually decline restore yield. since, locations, not, adjustment something like one see become likely. it seem likely continue yet, 2 bi review 30/2008 either rental yield regain attractive level factor raise effective return investors. suppose, though, take “special factors” people nominate. let’s, sake argument, remove cpi rent petrol, well calculation deposit loan facilities. if that, rate inflation remain item year december 2007 2.1 per cent. no problem, right? well, exactly. to ass trend inflation objectively, cannot take item rise price, typically use underlie measures, trim extreme rise falls. suppose current purpose, then, also remove fresh fruit, volatile item one happen hold cpi past year, due unwind great banana episode 2005/06. let’s also remove effect child care rebate changes, treat price fall cpi, know one-time effect reduce cpi 0.2 per cent. if that, get rate inflation 3.0 per cent year december 2007. a little elementary figure look quarterly profile, moreover, tell that, calculation do year march 2008, answer likely high again. this far statistical underlie measures, dampen effect large rise fall systematic way, tell u trend inflation rate now. so, unfortunately, say item explain away. what really go price rise across pretty wide range item pick up. about two third item cpi weight rise 2½ per cent past year. normally, experience half price rise pace (which would expect average inflation 2½ per cent). in essence, explain away rise inflation seen, list special factor appeal grow rather long. at time, question aggregate demand australian economy rise strongly 2007, indeed recent year generally, pace well economy’s likely growth potential supply. nor much serious argument proposition usage capacity economy high – business survey uniformly tell u that, measure level real gdp relative trend, low unemployment rate high level vacancies. firm struggle find additional worker expand activity – tell us. in short, hard avoid conclusion genuine pressure prices, cause temporary supply shortfall areas, even though those, also persistent strength demand. the next argument i want address wage pick up. some people object message inflation, include reference make labour costs, seem think somehow “blaming” wage earner inflation. we say that. this episode cause exogenous “break out” wages. until recently, was, fact, possible say wage growth remarkably steady aggregate level face tight labour market, relative wage across industry region one would expect give shock hit economy. at one stage, i describe textbook case adjustment1, labour market make much flexible long sequence reforms. private sector wage growth may pick little now, business talk say 1 see official committee hansard house representative stand committee economics, finance public administration, 17 august 2007, gold coast. available http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/reps/commttee/r10393.pdf. bi review 30/2008 3 find way raise compensation, way may immediately evident official data. but certainly claim labour cost lead way. it seem labour cost start accelerate, mainly symptom inflation pressure strong economy. inflation problem start wages. sometimes australia past start way, assume way every occasion. on hand, people come expect inflation high long time, wage claim price set start reflect that, trouble get inflation again. one important job monetary policy condition expectations. to achieve that, people believe require control inflation time. the final argument i want tackle inflation target low. this view accept inflation increased, factor responsible, argue 3-4 per cent inflation acceptable, unrealistic expect return 2-3 per cent standard. i think 2-3 per cent average inflation target ambitious. we achieve past 15 years, achieve average outcome order long period 20th century. if accept target could slide 3-4 per cent, match actual inflation, long would debate 4-5 per cent goal? if analysis economy set correct – overall demand grow fast sustain – would long. ongoing demand growth sustainable rate would mean steady inflation high level, would mean continue increase inflation. if situation, demand curtail stabilise inflation level. revise target high would provide temporary respite measure need control inflation, unless prepare revise high every year. furthermore, argument could accept high trend inflation rate ignore much structure economy adapt – good way – “two point something” inflation. the structure nominal interest rates, name one thing, predicate medium term anchor. if anchor allow drag, high average interest rate future would result. this result amply demonstrate history: sure way high average interest rate accept high inflation. to put simply, community want sustainably low interest rates, choose low inflation target, high one. so accept rise trend inflation short term moderation demand growth need contain pick price would short sight policy. it would likely condemn u repeat problem late 1960s 1970s, mistakenly think could live bite inflation, attendant difficulty 1980s fix inflation problem, again. it far good resist rise inflation now. argument monetary policy i turn argument monetary policy inflation. the first one i want address assertion monetary policy, adjust interest rates, ineffective control prices, fail restrain demand. more i see people state rise interest rate seem make much difference. but really true sequence adjustment take place raise cash rate low 4.25 per cent 2001 7.25 per cent today make difference economy inflation, would follow could reduce cash rate 300 basis point tomorrow nothing would change. if put like that, surely many people could seriously believe change interest rate make difference. 4 bi review 30/2008 more realistically, people might think change rate matter, level, change small. in view, interest rate change perhaps bigger, give “shock” behaviour occasion (though presumably also le frequent – otherwise level rate would reach would much higher). i suppose possible different sequence changes, include big ones, would change behaviour economy. we cannot know alternative scenario cannot run, everyone knows, board occasion recent past consider large movements. so idea large change absurd. yet hardly though interest rate change small one noticed. there issue report length interest rates; one could say unaware happening. begin march 2005 rate change, moreover, extent coverage medium far intense prior then, far intense case comparable countries. we could debate reason that, matter present purposes. on every one occasions, shortage dramatic medium coverage, shortage prediction serious consequence indebted households, economy on. if look announcement effects, surely work period. my view monetary policy effective action see consistent factual evidence available economy, sensible assessment future risks, framework clear medium term objective policy. apart that, accept likely effect one move 25 even 50 basis point is, uncertain, probably modest. it combination changes, particularly level reached, work. a second version “ineffectiveness” argument hold (1) price rise come factor beyond control australian policy, particularly abroad, follow (2) monetary policy cannot anything them. for people, follow therefore (3) futile, unnecessarily disruptive, try. i already address question whether price rise put special factors, obviously control. the fact price rise broad that. but even initial impetus high price come event abroad, still decide respond shock. in case energy prices, world price oil u dollar certainly completely outside control, australian dollar price oil actually matter australian motorist. that price low present might been, rise exchange rate. insofar interest rate bear exchange rate, affect petrol prices, indirectly, do so. look across economy generally, see main external event recent year rise term trade, obviously completely exogenous far australia concerned. but high resource price generate additional income, affect demand good service home. that expansionary, put pressure price non trade good services. even though monetary policy cannot stop initial shock – course cannot stop chinese demand resource – can, should, seek condition economy’s subsequent response shock, rather simply let domestic overheat go unchecked. tight policy dampen domestic demand contain pick non trade price well raise exchange rate, make import cheaper, export le competitive foster move productive resource part economy production needed. that appropriate form adjustment shock, particularly shock likely fairly persistent. bi review 30/2008 5 so even event beyond control occur put pressure prices, still respond, response quite effective. another line argument take quite different tack. it argue monetary policy ineffective, fact make problem bad actually raise prices. the logic interest payment cost business activity, raise cost simply result business pass on. it obviously true interest cost, business stay solvent cover along cost sell price. but interest rate rise, business pas cost without lose sales? it might possible initially, since high interest rate eventually slow demand, get difficult raise price due course. so people say high rate push prices, i think answer strength demand allow that, rise interest rate will, time, dampen demand. all historical evidence monetary policy quite effective regard. i turn arguments, monetary policy ineffective, terribly precise. one common expression blunt instrument. people rarely define mean term, i think mind two things. first, inflation rise particular price move lot, monetary policy cannot focus precisely exactly particular prices, particular feature economic behaviour cause price rises. it general, rather specific, instrument sense. second, i think people say “blunt”, mean “unfair” – particularly interest rate rise, affect household owe money home loan. (presumably argument would mean equally unfair saver put interest rate economy weak.) a i note before, actually true recent rise inflation confine items. to extent, use general instrument would seem quite appropriate. but also couple quite important point make regard “blunt instrument” critique. the first transmission channel monetary policy much wide impact household home loans. most business debts, too.2 float rate debt cost service interest rate rise, presumably cause reconsider thing might planning. so “cash flow” channel monetary policy affect business. monetary policy also affect economist would call inter temporal decision making. incentive save, oppose consume, alter. it commonly observe many australian save rather little, household save rate fact rise noticeably recent years, largely unnoticed conventional opinion. i claim increase mainly due rise interest rates, i think assume incentive matter. despite australia’s extensive use foreign save build economy, bulk productive investment finance via domestic save one form another. change interest rate affect asset value time, effect discount rates, expect earn growth on. these fee behaviour several dimension – via cost capital firms, wealth effect on. through complex channels, monetary policy sometimes also affect non price term credit, particularly manage affect expectation future growth, creditworthiness risk appetite. then exchange rate, i already mentioned. numerous factor affect exchange rates, relationship hard pin down. however, interest rate 2 about 35 per cent household owe money home. if include debt kind, close 70 per cent household carry debt kind, though many debt relatively small. 6 bi review 30/2008 differential country matter exchange rates, along expectation differential may change (a function growth expectations), factor affect trade position (such commodity price case), investor risk preference on. i already discuss case petrol, surely little doubt price tradable good service generally low today would exchange rate long run average level. this case even much mute short term pas exchange rate change use have. in words, change exchange rate alter term rest world supply good service australia way stabilise prices. all channel monetary policy’s effects. they operate different speeds, differ extent different episode – there, i would say work present. the transmission monetary policy home loan rates, important channel is. secondly, say monetary policy blunt instrument beg question: sharp instruments? it obvious many. people mention supply side reform various kind unquestionably extremely important years. to extent done, good australians’ standard living. but long term. it hard deploy hurry. and many general – “blunt” even – rather specific. many people appeal, perhaps unreasonably, possibility use fiscal policy counter inflation pressure. for time now, fiscal policy actively deploy manage business cycle. the focus mainly achieve maintain structurally sound, long run fiscal position and, subject that, make tax spend decision aim various objective government have. this preclude allow budget’s “automatic stabilisers” operate cycle (though might observe that, elongate upswing like one having, get difficult decide think temporary rise revenue assume permanent). it strike popular discussion fiscal policy, many participant talk past look different time dimensions. it unreasonable say budget perpetually surplus, debt speak loom large unfunded liability, tax probably, long run horizon, lower. this, seem me, economic case structural reduction taxes, observer articulate. others argue reduction delayed, cyclical reasons, give demand need slow contain inflation. so structural case tax fall, cyclical case to. it doubt difficult government reconcile two, equally valid, point view, tension persist number consecutive years. leave aside, let u give think effective instrument budgetary policy likely be. if inflationary pressure due specific, narrow issue (which, clear above, i doubt), precise target source inflationary pressure via tax spend measure could nonetheless exceedingly difficult technical level, let alone politically. if accepted, hand, inflation sufficiently general overall demand slow, amount slow regardless whether come via monetary policy fiscal policy. it would somewhat differently distribute across sector regions, impact interest rate exchange rate effect obviously would overlap exactly tax spend measure would occur place. i would hazard guess, though, good many people today pay high interest rate would instead pay high tax world fiscal policy use actively manage business cycle. we unlikely, i submit, witness situation income bi review 30/2008 7 tax raise without home loans, live western australia queensland, work mine sector. then time lag implement fiscal measures. the budget occur year, long gruelling process lead up. i expect stampede people room wish often. the economy could conceivably look rather different mid may budget occur budget process began, different time measure actually take effect. monetary policy full effect long lag, least get reconsider month, need reverse direction quickly. don’t get wrong. i argue fiscal policy matter cyclical outcomes, fiscal policy make eye cycle well structural position. to extent be, course welcome. i offer particular suggestion fiscal policy present. i simply say task fine tune fiscal policy stabilisation purposes, think desirable, unlikely straightforward use monetary policy. fiscal policy, way reasons, also likely prove fairly blunt instrument. inevitably, even fiscal policy ideally calibrate conjunctural position, monetary policy would still lot work manage inflation. broad perspective the remark address reservation conduct monetary policy i see late. some reservation understandable, reasonable response them. it also observe first time see arguments: tend recur time reach top end inflation cycle monetary policy control it. have say that, important keep perspective situation find ourselves. we live one large transformation structure global economy, far australia concerned, century. the rise term trade past five year big event since korean war boom early 1950s. but korean war event temporary one, indication rise china cyclical event, structural change first order. china certainly business cycle, like economies, slow point. even so, highly likely that, short catastrophic event, china many year strong growth still ahead. it 11 per cent per annum pace past couple years, period weakness instability. but rise china flash pan economic history. in essence, see large change relative price world economy, relative price change important australia, particular, almost country. these sort event always produce stress strains, include significant divergence performance across industry region (though often exaggerate popular discussion). because event is, overall, expansionary, always likely associate risk high inflation. but give magnitude shock, say done, economy cop pretty well far. yes, inflation risen. this problem, require suitable response monetary policy. but compare outcome occasion commodity price boom early 1950s mid 1970s. in early 1950s, cpi inflation reach 25 per cent, fell back zero within years, associate quite pronounce recession. in mid 1970s, inflation reach 18 per cent, take long time come acceptable levels. this time, grapple peak cpi inflation rate look like around 4 per cent cpi terms, try ass 8 bi review 30/2008 soon reasonably return 2-3 per cent. this far cry problem yesteryear. the reason good time around hard fathom, either. a work treasury argue persuasively, flexible exchange rate, reform flexible industrial environment, good private sector management much strong fiscal monetary policy framework make lot difference. the fruit decade effort reform economy that, strains, well circumstances. the officer treasury, past present, play key role achieve that. that legacy hand you, us. our challenge keep improve structure place develop further, period privilege influence. bi review 30/2008 9 ajith nivard cabraal: harness sustainable growth emerge market keynote address mr ajith nivard cabraal, governor central bank sri lanka, 2nd world management summit 2008, karachi, pakistan, 11 march 2008. * * * a salaam aleikum, ayubowan, good morning. mr. chairman, distinguish delegates, lady gentlemen, at outset, i wish thank organizer world management summit invite deliver keynote address. i also greatly touch wonderful hospitality accord interest historic city karachi. mr. chairman, i consider privilege honour share think view timely topic, “harnessing sustainable growth emerge markets” important forum. i hope i would able plant seed distinguish mind seed may nurture deliberation follow. a first step, let u examine current global regional trend relation world economic growth, could deal topic wide perspective. a know, past years, global economy experience one its’ strong sustain period growth, since early 1970s. this expansion project strong even account impact recent financial market turbulence. significantly, growth has, foundation, strong result emerge market lead way. in fact, 2007, china’s economy grow 11 per cent make large contribution global growth. india grow 9 per cent russia almost 8 per cent. these three country account one-half global growth past year, several develop country also maintain robust expansions. in fact, rapid growth country counter-balanced moderate growth unite state advance economies. the current global expansion remarkable several ways. first, emerge market develop country account high share growth – two-thirds, compare one-half 1990s; second, success arise rapid growth enjoy country – country region good comparison past standards; and, third, volatility growth decline substantially. for example, sri lankan economy grow well 6% past 3 year 2008 too, growth 7% close 7% projected. pakistan record average growth rate 7% last 4 years. mr. chairman, last decade, clear relationship global economic growth growth advance economies. a matter fact, major economies, particularly, usa, record slow down, retard world output significantly. so much so, say usa get cold, others get pneumonia! however, recent trend show world economy long overwhelmingly reliant advance economy only. in fact, weight seem gradually shift emerge global economy record strong growth performance recent years, advance economy basically record moderate growth. it may therefore useful “flag” important aspect discuss issue relate harness sustainable growth emerge markets. let u consider extent current expansion emerge market develop country due implementation good policies, whether bi review 29/2008 1 good luck make happen. what secret behind remarkable performance emerge economies? a simple assessment may probably tell u main driver recent expansion fast integration develop nation global economy, rapid open economic activity. all three major emerge economies, china, india russia, basically “closed” economy couple decade ago. emergence three giants, collectively account 20% land area earth serve home 40% world population, dramatically change shape world trade, direction capital flow growth source global economy. in fact, last decade, share advance economy global trade reduce gradually around 75% around 60%, direction investment also reversed, evidence fast accumulation foreign reserve emerge nations. in meantime, would also observe develop country benefit immensely prudent policy implement rapid economic development emerge economies. these improvement include discipline monetary fiscal policies, focus institutions, responsible financial sector developments. in essence, recent success emerge economy could explained, significant extent, conventional growth theory. improvement physical capital stock; improvement human capital; improvement productivity. we know accord growth theory, increase gdp growth lead increase per caput incomes, turn lead significant improvement quality life people country. we also know that, right now, significant growth take place. but, continue happen? can ensure sustainability outcome? upto point go tough country keep achieving? many economic expert believe immediate challenge develop nation reach per caput income target around u $ 2,500 quickly possible. it secret that, country surpass threshold per caput income around us$ 2,500, provide new impetus policymakers, key stakeholder people whole, launch new phase development. thereafter, process development take place smoothly naturally. this due several reasons. first, new level income, society naturally attain certain standards, include strong business ethics, good behavioral pattern wide national integration. second, new level income, people able plan investment better, look beyond match income cost basics. this include financial investments, also include investment skill knowledge, upgrade invest physical health, boost factor accumulation le effort. third, income level increase, even low growth rate mean high increase income absolute terms. but, move towards magical number go easy. in today’s try conditions, would even difficult past many old establish advance nation cross magical mark. a know, many today’s advance nation pass threshold different condition emerge economy face today. in fact, early days, country able freely utilize labour resource country colonize them, benefit immensely fruit foreign land natural resources. they adhere law regulation relate education, training, health labour practices, standard work conditions. there environmental law treaties, environment often first casualty quest accumulate wealth. capital accumulate illegal mean criminal activity use freely without restriction. 2 bi review 29/2008 but, today situation completely different. today, emerge country act much responsible manner drive economy forward. in fact, present day emerge economy achieve attractive level growth, adhere to, respect international convention copyright, anti-money launder terrorist financing, environmental, labour, human rights, safety, health, etc., etc. this situation sometimes forget economic political analysts, particularly advance nation therefore may inappropriate remind world state affairs, off. all all, point view individual develop countries, important economic need present maintain high economic growth momentum currently achieving, sustainable manner. although tough, hearten note many develop country have, since late, able so. but challenge become intense day, policymakers constantly alert development several front simultaneously, order continue momentum. investment boosted; institution need strengthened; infrastructure improved; regulation strengthened. in addition, happen time. in meantime, global challenge risk loom large. some downside risk intense serious could even threaten foundation present growth momentum, drag develop nation well entire world economy towards recession! there many danger lurking. the current financial market turmoil could trigger pronounce global slowdown. the unbelievably high volatile oil price result inflationary pressure could lead severe bop problems, disrupt capital inflow cause large global imbalances. the age population, intensification resistance globalization, havoc may cause global warm danger terrorism could lead serious repercussion sustainable growth model economic planner attempt implement. but good news sufficient evidence indicate us, many develop country implement number structural change order face upto grow threats. improve monetary fiscal policies, improve institutions, good financial systems, etc., clearly help stretch current positive business cycle, notwithstanding numerous threats. however, must complacent. we must underestimate recent increase financial market volatility. we must take oil shock inflation pressure lightly. we must ignore imbalance generate age population. we must think resistance globalization fade away. we must conclude terrorism someone else’s problem therefore affect us. we must imagine global warm impact coastal nation therefore safe effects. in contrast, must anticipate threat prepare face confidence. needle say, challenge adequately addressed, face directly, fall could result serious repercussion greatly hamper continue success current expansion. mr. chairman, another interest phenomenon that, country seem grow well aggregate level, also grow concern equitable distribution gains. it clear rapid technological progress continue globalization trade finance help enhance growth reduce poverty. but condition also contribute increase concentration income wealth, within certain select groups. in general, owner capital scarce skill well rewarded, while, less-skilled worker limit access job finance enjoy limit gains. while obvious outcome pose serious political risks, even economic point view, inequality raise economic issue since imply human resource productively used. therefore bi review 29/2008 3 follow that, unless imbalance addressed, would probably manifest dangerous political upheavals, could easily negate economic gain may painstakingly build up. in recent years, global expansion support ready availability external finance relatively reasonable interest rates. credit readily available, particularly result innovation financial market instrument suppose improve liquidity distribute risk better. but innovative model today face increase pressure, economic planner process re-thinking processes. therefore, near future another serious issue may face effort achieve sustainability growth momentum would that, time, global save may well become scarce, put upward pressure real interest rates. mr. chairman, twice first half last century, prosperity world severely threaten devastate world wars. fortunately us, concert effort many statesman-like leader far think person serve respect international organizations, danger averted. nevertheless world pay huge price terrible experience. but, today different way, world face another destructive force terrorism, almost debilitate horrible world war past century. a result, world’s advance economy less develop economies, many country face aspect terrorism; directly indirectly. these evil forces, eliminated, soon hamper global economic growth many ways. it destroy physical human capital. it weaken infrastructure development institution building. it force government divert resource national security terrorism prevention. it result reduce resource channel developmental efforts. in context focus sustainable growth, ill-effects terrorism must also clearly identify must take, well support, necessary step deal threat, politically militarily; locally internationally; directly indirectly; individually collectively. the ever increase oil energy price another serious concern economic planners. international price oil, know, increase five-fold last 6 years. a world bravely adjust daily unconscionable wild increases, oil producer enjoy unprecedented gains. in background, cannot realistically expect oil price reduce near future therefore would consciously brace deal harmful effect highly destructive attack future growth, maintain growth momentum. a oil shock enough, international commodity price too, rise sharply past year so. this outcome possibly display tightly link price commodity are, other. a result increases, result global food price index record 54% increase past year, many country face high record inflation figure new millennium. china’s inflation january 2008 high 11 years. in singapore, high 25 years. australia record high figure 16 years. we, sri lanka also record high rate 18 year know pakistan struggle inflation, amidst high food prices. in volatile scenario, challenge emerge country maintain price stability, without hamper growth momentum. unfortunately, backdrop high international oil commodity prices, appear easy escape route quick fix. bad still, many expert proffer view current increase oil commodity price may “structural adjustment” rather another “supply shock”. if case, present sky-high price may return previous low levels. if so, policymakers factor situation future 4 bi review 29/2008 projections. then billion dollar question crop up: what do? if allow domestic price adjust line high international prices, immediately face high inflation. on hand, subsidize commodity use inflationary financing, result again, even high inflation future. not attractive options! but, country make choice now, particularly highly unlikely problem go away. mr. chairman, far discuss length, current trend economic growth, challenge face attempt harness sustainable growth. now, let u get even critical part discussion. how continue harness sustainable growth economies? how protect growth momentum? before really get discuss factor surround issue, let u see usually happen world nation face serious threat economic well being. in early 1970s, oil price increase sharply, many country quickly start oil exploration development. when so, several oil reserves, were, time, believe uneconomical development, suddenly qualify “economical”. in words, many country re-positioned become “net commodity exporters” “net commodity importers”, face rise prices. they quick understand shift vital future economic development well being. a 1970’s, today too, clear trend country quickly attempt boost capacity produce oil agricultural commodities. if, expected, re-positioning and/or restructure occurs, occur quickly, current imbalance address sooner later. in fact, look recent increase bio-fuel production, clearly case steady increase production variety oil substitutes, world. in sense, current vibrant challenge economic environment provide new excite opportunity develop advance countries, many country seem eager seize opportunity implement decision quickly. mr. chairman, time, also probably realize constant search sustainable growth, regular issue confront emerge economy also need address appropriately series fundamental policy actions. let u therefore, completeness sake, take quick look policy action well. one, sound management risk. a pace globalization intensify massive flow capital take place, on-going reform regulation supervision, development domestic capital markets, improvement corporate governance adequate credible legal framework take place effectively. two, maintenance sound macroeconomic policies. sound fiscal monetary policy lead low stable inflation environment exchange rate stability sustain private sector investment vital sustainable development. three, implementation policy promote domestic save investment. it important note steady flow foreign save important emerge markets, effort mobilize domestic resource equally critical long-term growth. four, maintenance reasonable debt level repayment capacity economy compromised, even major risk materialize. five, improvement quality information statistic relate sector economy. this policy action ensure widespread timely dissemination information, thereby encourage robust economic activity. six, continuous expansion trade lobby major change within industrialize nations, promote great trade among emerge economy within regions. bi review 29/2008 5 seven, rapid implementation consistent significant poverty reduction programme infrastructure development project provide opportunity hope poor address regional imbalances. eight, active use technology economic transformation, backward society group could “leap-frog” rather drift along “snail’s pace”. at time, also keep mind sustainability growth develop country greatly enhance political stability. therefore, care must take ensure political crisis threaten undermine economic progress need resolve quickly satisfactorily, growth momentum hamper short medium terms. mr. chairman, glad today karachi, deliberate topic “harnessing sustainable growth”, topic touch life closely, today well tomorrow. in so, naturally closely study worldwide conditions, trends, needs, challenges, future strategy many issue connect realization outcome. it certainly complex topic, cut dry answers; easy path, free obstacles. at time one fact must clear about. i.e., harness growth beginning. if so, must realize begin would vital, would need methodically build capacity sustain growth keep going, amidst whatever challenge may encounter. implementation policy would therefore key sustainable growth. people could, course, eloquently talk sound monetary policies; effective fiscal policies; well structure private/public partnerships; super regulatory institutions; vibrant markets; skilled managers; technical capabilities; clean environments; safe live conditions; develop infrastructure; speedy justice; transparent systems; stable governments; corruption – free societies; free media; low crime; balance development; trickle effects; equal opportunities; equitable distribution wealth; good live standard whole host similar outcomes. but, mere talk condition would lead u achieve goal achieve high sustainable growth. if realize outcomes, continuous implementation close monitor evaluation programme policy action essential. that then, key. let u remember good implement one action write 100 report one take notice of. it good deliver one outcome deliver 100 speech one listen to. it good improve one life organize 100 workshop one find useful. it good light one candle curse darkness! this then, dear friends, challenge us. very often, encounter prophet gloom doom attempt demoralize u show magnitude problem continuously criticizing, tell u can’t. we fall prey distraction falter implementation policy actions. we must, conviction courage, move towards realize growth targets, improve macroeconomic fundamentals. if achieve 8% growth continuous basis 8 9 years, would position double per caput income. for country like sri lanka would mean would reach per caput income around us$ 3,000 year 2015, current per caput around us$ 1,600. that impossible dream. sri lanka show that, determination clear focus, done. in fact, 2005 2007, per caput income shoot nearly 30%! these success maintained, could do hard work hard work. mr. chairman, south asia, huge giant, finally wake its’ deep slumber. this giant take long rest, enjoy glorious past. a huge giant cannot stir, without world around notice rumble. all recent indication world certainly take note re-awakening. it time u region capitalize 6 bi review 29/2008 new visibility. all u region know destiny linked. we rise fall together. today, see clear light end tunnel tunnel become wide wider, make journey excite pleasant, yet tough adventurous. it cricket excel today. we make mark many area well. let u then, region, take rightful place league nation show develop economically reasonable level quickly sustainable manner. our people responding. our people become conscious good live standard possible. they increasingly show prepare work towards goal. our collective work ethic productivity standard improving. let u support intensify effort amplify trends. let u keep momentum going. let u implement, implement, implement! mr. chairman, global management summit organize provide excellent forum u learn shape strategies. let u use opportunity fine-tune knowledge skill move confidence towards deliver sustainable growth economy usher good life people. that wish u i certain would energy resilience succeed. thank you. bi review 29/2008 7 bandid nijathaworn: economic volatility year rat speech dr

slowdown become increasingly visible. draw information end february, key element late data include continue correction house market, fall consumer confidence, slowdown consumer spend private investment, weak employment numbers. the good news export u hold well, financial condition companies, especially non-financial companies, intact. but go forward, correction house market likely continue, weigh economic activities. on financial market side, thing also look up. cdx spread continue rise, indicate increase risk premium cdo market. and confidence market securitized credit yet return, writedown expected. next, economic activity u slow down, quality bank’s asset commercial real estate consumer loan may come great pressure, affect bank profitability. with profit declining, bank may become risk averse protect capital, put pressure credit extension real economy. so, late u data point weak outlook ahead downside risk near-term. the risk include correction house market, continue tighten credit conditions, decline economic activities. outside us, economic picture look le negative. while adjustment house market also ongoing europe, european bank report loss cdos, impact economic activity expect limited. for example, consensus forecast february, revise downward euro zone’s gdp growth 2008 0.3 percentage point december compare 0.5 percentage point downward revision us. for southeast asia, impact also forecast limited. late consensus forecast southeast asia’s gdp growth 5.7 percent 2008, decline slightly forecast 5.9 percent december last year. these forecasts, together late data, suggest that, short-term, thing likely get bad get better, slow growth u impact growth globally. the key question, time, deep thing get see turnaround. this definitely important, difficult question answer. market bi review 29/2008 1 participant usual range views, i personally intend offer another prediction. instead, i want share think current development mean thailand. to begin, one context i think useful understand current turmoil unwind global imbalance, trigger correction u house market begin 2006, ongoing. such unwind necessary process clear excess reduce financial leverage build form high level us’s current account deficits. economically speaking, reduce deficits, value u dollar need fall level u long-term interest rate need rise. exchange rate adjustment much ongoing. the u dollar decline 8.0 percent nominal effective term since 2006. and reflect this, u current account begin show improvement last year, expect improve go forward. experience recent episode current account adjustment elsewhere, include one thailand 1997, show process adjustment long, potential substantial dislocation economic activities, especially proper policy put place. important context dynamic interaction real economy financial sector tend fee either positively negatively. therefore, address current challenge, important policymakers pay close attention dynamic especially issue liquidity, health bank sector, condition normalization business activities, ability service debt households. in view, policymakers u move relatively quickly fronts, positive markets. let turn implication thailand. be small open economy, thailand able avoid impact global slowdown increase economic volatilities. the u form 12 percent export markets. a direct impact sub-prime, exposure thai bank system cdo limited. total investment thai bank cdos 0.26 percent bank’s total asset june last year, 0.03 percent sub-prime related. such exposure decline december, bank cdo investment increase provision accordingly. at end december last year, bi ratio capital adequacy thai bank system 14.6 percent, well minimum requirement 8.5 percent. more important concern, however, indirect economic financial impact (i) possible export decline result global economy slowdown, (ii) tighten global liquidity, (iii) possible increase volatility capital flows, risk repriced global investors. these indirect impact potential impart volatility markets, depend magnitude global slowdown. so far, adverse impact emerged, downside risk uncertainty ahead, important one complacent alert possible impact outcomes. this point fully recognize bank thailand’s monetary policy committee meet last month. the mpc’s post-meeting statement make clear need monitor situation global market closely stance monetary policy appropriately flexibly calibrate ensure price stability steady growth. finally, last point i want stress ability thai economy weather external shock global slowdown time much great compare situation say ten year ago. 2 bi review 29/2008 first, country’s economic fundamental improve crisis years, solid external position mark current account surpluses, high level international reserves, much low level external debt. this strong financial position enhance ability economy cushion external shocks. second, bank sector excellent shape, good profitability, strong capital base, improve asset quality. the corporate sector also good financial shape strong earn low financial leverage. these quality make private sector resilient impact economic volatility outside. and third, policy regime thailand become flexible, especially exchange rate, market force play dominant role allocate resources. such attribute provide private sector mechanism efficiently adjust impact external shocks. i confident improve fundamental help lessen impact global slowdown economy, enhance ability private sector manage deal economic volatility, provide economy strong foundation continue strong growth stability year ahead. this i want say evening. i hope useful. and i want end wish year rat year plenty, bring opportunity good prospect fcct. thank you. bi review 29/2008 3 jürgen stark: contribution session “implications conduct monetary policy” speech mr jürgen stark, member executive board european central bank, international symposium “globalisation, inflation monetary policy”, organise bank france, paris, 7 march 2008. * * * john taylor discuss number challenge monetary policy-making era globalisation. in remarks, i focus implication globalisation specifically monetary policy-making euro area.1 globalisation may change environment monetary policy-making we agree globalisation offer great opportunities. it increase scope efficiency gain specialisation since allow economy make good use comparative advantage international production. this reduce production cost expand production frontier, generate gain pass consumer low price many goods. globalisation thus foster economic prosperity raise live standards. at time, gain globalisation may distribute evenly, globalisation affect differently return different factor production. 2 to monetary policy-makers, globalisation important mainly two reasons: • first, process globalisation occasionally lead economic disruptions, especially market lack transparency. increasingly-globalised internationally-integrated financial markets, example, sufficiently transparent, time conducive excessive risk-taking contagion effect – theme ring particularly true light current financial turmoil. • second, importantly, increase global integration induce structural change good market financial market alike. a result, foreign shock may great impact domestic inflation, transmission impulse euro area economy change. this also apply impact monetary policy inflation. let briefly elaborate structural changes, drive globalisation, affect process inflation. • there good reason, instance, believe globalisation increase competitive pressures, worldwide domestic markets. an increase competition may – relative previous period – put downward pressure wage price thus contain inflation period time.3 a structural intensification 1 for stylise fact trade globalisation likely effect euro area inflation, see also ecb monthly bulletin article entitle “globalisation, trade euro area macroeconomy”, (january 2008). 2 trade theory (stolper-samuelson theorem) would e.g. suggest trade integration place downward pressure relative return lower-skilled labour. however, real wage development similar across skill group euro area. see ecb (2008), op. cit. 3 while globalisation discipline impact exert price cost control likely facilitate disinflation around globe past ten year so, globalisation per se cannot permanently reduce inflation. the main reason observe spread low inflation around globe recent year bi review 28/2008 1 competition would also induce firm work hard increase productivity, would translate increase growth rate natural level output.4 • beyond effect, increase use international production opportunity base comparative advantage may lead change production structure economy, would turn alter relative scarcity production factors, thus response price price final good economic shocks. thus, globalisation • importance monetary policy • likely last effect economy environment monetary policy-making. an initial conclusion therefore central bank need continue commit resource analyse closely monitor structural change shock cause globalisation, need build increase awareness economic financial development outside home countries. globalisation change rule monetary policy-making although globalisation challenge monetary policy, i fully agree john taylor’s assessment globalisation fundamentally alter rule monetary policy-making. nowadays ever, medium long term, inflation monetary phenomenon. this mean price stability u achieve. let stress obvious here, namely central bank cannot permanently determine relative price specific goods. in refer price stability, mean stability purchase power (of domestic legal tender) measure cost representative basket goods. while international liquidity condition may influence market interest rate thus transmission monetary policy real activity inflation, central bank retain ability control short-term interest rate appropriately influence supply domestic legal tender. short-term rate turn work way domestic cost credit long-term interest rates. therefore, central bank ensure price stability medium long-term, even financially-integrated world production factor good move freely, even size world economy increase relative domestic economy.5 but, i say earlier, precondition successful monetary policy central bank need properly adapt analysis change environment. in environment, clearly important stability-orientated monetary policy analyse development external prices, international trade flow international financial flows. this said, i agree john taylor development exchange rate per se give special status take account monetary policy change monetary policymaking many countries, and, particular, change towards credible commitment price stability. 4 that is, would lead increase rate economy grow without jeopardise price stability. 5 see, e.g., m. woodford (2007), “globalization monetary control,” nber work paper no. 13329, appear galí, j. m. gertler eds., the international dimension monetary policy, university chicago press. 2 bi review 28/2008 extent medium-term influence price stability. this another fundamental law monetary economics alive well globalise economy: flexible exchange rate sine qua non price stability. doe globalise world call international monetary coordination? with grow set price asset valuation determine internationally, information international development crucial monetary policy-making. in light, financial turmoil particular show value grow financial globalisation place timely open international exchange information among central bank regulators. central bank therefore cooperate exchange information design solid international financial architecture. beyond that, however, scope monetary policy-makers coordinate limited. this case central bank one policy instrument, instrument achieve single domestic objective, price stability. a consequence, central bank well advise react foreign development become relevant domestic price stability. i therefore fully agree john taylor’s conclusion central bank mechanically follow central banks’ policy decisions. not least result consensus, i question strong conclusion john taylor draw empirical analysis. in brief, john taylor find simple monetary policy rule, also widely refer “taylor rule”, apply euro area, residual correlate positively u federal fund rate. he interpret find imply leader-follower structure sense u monetary policy induce ecb deviate objective price stability concern exchange rate. this case. indeed, reasonable explanation john taylor’s find following: central bank concern domestic price stability seek offset potentially destabilise shocks. in globalise world, though, different central bank naturally respond part similar global factors. and, know, number factor well capture mechanical policy rule type john taylor take benchmark good monetary policy-making. adequate policy reaction global factors, risk pose domestic price stability, thus show – within context simple rule – residual term. some observers, john taylor included, interpret residual measure monetary stance. it may indeed, cases, possible interpret residual way. however, often residual measure lack explanatory power simple policy rule itself. now, extent economy structurally different hit shock different timings, • global factor affect economy different lags. • a result, measure inflation output gap use john taylor’s policy rule also affect different lags. • in context, monetary policy react pre-emptive manner current future likely development ensure domestic price stability medium long term. bi review 28/2008 3 • however, behaviour might generate spurious correlation residual simple taylor type policy rule euro area interest rate economies. i suspect lie behind john taylor’s result concern deviation euro area “policy rule” u federal fund rate. have inside knowledge, i fact rule john taylor’s result constitute sign leader-follower structure sign focus side ecb dollar-euro exchange rate, fact exchange rate, target policy. neither case. i agree john taylor, however, development direction would deeply worrying. only clear assignment responsibility ensure clarity central bank’s objective, heart successful monetary policy. yet international complementarity exist monetary policymaking, extent international architecture central bank keep house order also conducive environment global monetary stability. such architecture provide best basis friendly open exchange view information international level. today frequent interaction as, example, bi provide much-appreciated forum discussion among central bankers. in addition, occasion fruitful exchange – symposium one them. the role monetary policy strategy increasingly globalise world i argue best international monetary architecture one central bank focus achieve domestic price stability. in practice, even need guarantee successful monetary policy. a clear mandate price stability well-defined monetary policy strategy base mandate essential cop successfully analytical practical challenge lie ahead. fortunately, condition place euro area. a clear mandate price stability • ensure central bank fully accountable achieve price stability. the commitment price stability mandate generate is, turn, conducive anchor private sector expectation last way. this anchor particularly important globalisation cause sequence one-sided shock inflation. • prevent central bank policy go astray. while john taylor express concern central bank may increasingly tempt stabilise exchange rate expense price stability, clear mandate price stability guarantee central bank fall trap. instead price stability-orientated central bank assign special role exchange rates, important information variable economic analysis. build clear mandate, successful strategy • support accountability. • ensure transparent systematic response risk price stability • guide effective communication policy, • enhance predictability monetary policy medium long term. in context, measure price stability use central bank must adequately reflect evolution purchase power money. price stability therefore best define term cost representative, i.e. broad, basket goods. an example provide 4 bi review 28/2008 clear assessable yardstick price stability basket underlie euro area harmonise index consumer prices. this encompass definition underlie basket contrast partial, so-called “core” measure inflation. while measure useful assess risk price stability, – put front centre – risk provide distort view underlie price development would jeopardise anchor inflation expectations. this would particularly detrimental situation globalisation might induce sustain movement price certain category goods. a broad, transparent widely accept yardstick instead create necessary clarity ensure firm anchor inflation expectations. it clarity allow central bank adopt medium-term orientation within policy-makers appropriately discount short-term price volatility transitory movement inflation. a mentioned, globalisation likely change structure euro area economy regard good market financial markets. a strategy monitor structural change good market angle financial monetary point view therefore well-suited cope challenge bring globalisation. the complementary perspective economic analysis monetary analysis, underlie ecb’s “two-pillar strategy”, conducive appropriately adapt policy change environment. at time, two-pillar strategy keep mind focus fundamental law monetary economics. in particular, explicit monetary pillar guarantee ecb always considerable expertise analysis monetary credit development analysis impact price stability. the close link monetary development evolve imbalance asset credit market imply monetary analysis enable central bank detect imbalance early stage respond imply risk price financial stability timely forward-looking manner. this has, past, prove invaluable asset ecb, notably time global financial turbulence. just two-pillar strategy structure discussion within ecb, also provide basis communicate understand economy outside world. by adhere transparency, ecb achieve high level predictability monetary policy decisions. our strategy therefore improve policy effectiveness. let conclude. 1. especially environment ongoing globalisation, monetary policy must aim robustly anchor inflation expectations. this require permanent alertness risk price stability side central bank, shock inflation must translate second-round effect price-setting wage-setting. 2. that said, efficient adjustment economy macroeconomic shock best facilitate monetary policy-makers keep firm focus domestic price stability objective. in particular, external stability without domestic price stability. 3. domestic price stability precondition global monetary stability. globalisation therefore expand need international monetary co-operation beyond open exchange view information. the best international architecture one central bank clear mandate focus domestic price stability. 4. great microeconomic flexibility would allow economy take good advantage opportunity provide globalisation, would also facilitate macroeconomic adjustment wake shock improve resilience economy. globalisation therefore intensify need flexibility product labour markets. bi review 28/2008 5 5. i argue monetary policy strategy carefully monitor development domestic, well international, financial good market well-equipped cope challenge globalisation bring monetary policy. such strategy place euro area. at time, price stability best contribution monetary policy make enable euro area economy take full advantage opportunity offer globalisation. 6 bi review 28/2008 christian noyer: france’s bank industry 2007 – key trend speech mr christian noyer, governor bank france chairman french bank commission, presentation 2007 annual report french bank commission, paris, 26 june 2008. * * * welcome work breakfast organise press occasion publication commission bancaire’s 2007 annual report today. i would like take opportunity speak major trend see bank industry 2007. naturally, main development last year subprime crisis. i also speak lesson learn crisis future. even though french bank system’s overall exposure risk reveal subprime crisis turn le severe g10 countries, bank system still affected, see decline profitability. on encourage note, however, french bank manage maintain satisfactory solvency ratios, testify system’s resilience ability cope large-scale complex crisis. however, addition impact business conditions, financial crisis call examination robustness bank activity develop rapidly last ten years. these activity complicate task risk management major bank groups. the materialisation certain risks, return volatility financial market uncertainty economic outlook mean major bank need make special effort three key areas: i) maintain adequate capital ratio cushion shocks, may still occur, ii) strengthen risk management system processes, iii) price credit liquidity risk appropriately. to explain developments, i would like speak briefly follow points. 1. first all, french bank system provide proof resilience face financial turmoil 2007. 2. the current economic situation call vigilance nonetheless, since bank must ready cope new risk may occur time. 3. finally, crisis condition persist, i like talk main thrust supervisory authorities’ actions. 1. the french bank system provide proof resilience face financial turmoil 2007 after post good performance since 2003, french bank system hit fall-out subprime crisis start mid 2007, bank system lead develop countries. this lead extend period strong turbulence. the impact crisis banks’ earn first show third quarter financial statement clearly fourth-quarter statements. french bank affect several channels: • first, direct exposure american household subprime category indirect exposure portfolio structure financial instruments, residential mortgage back security (rmbs) collateralised debt obligation (cdos) turn expose subprime risks. a case rest bank system europe, indirect exposure account much great amount direct exposure therefore bi review 82/2008 1 bulk losses; lesson situation hold refine risk management need learn quickly. • secondly, exposure securitisation vehicle (conduits structure investment vehicles) particularly liquidity lines, need manage rigorously go forward. • thirdly, exposure asset take back securitisation vehicles, even collective investment schemes, run liquidity problems; type reintermediation need give consideration term capital requirements. • fourthly, exposure monoline insurers, insure product hard-hit crisis thus epitomise “wrong-way” counterparty risks, need assess carefully. • finally, though exposure leverage buy-outs, generally credit-risk-related cost vulnerable companies, start rise. consequently, french bank escape overall slowdown net bank income growth affect major international bank groups. the net bank income three lead group use ifrs grow 3.8 per cent 2007, rise 18 per cent 2006. however, aggregate net profit french account standard french bank system 2007 reach nearly €27 billion, make possible generate income use part strengthen institutions’ financial foundations, thereby contribute financial stability paris market. the diversification french bank groups’ activity prove strength. several business line show positive trends, gain retail banking, post growth 9.1 per cent (particularly foreign operations, increase 22 per cent compare 2006), project financing. retail bank still core business french bank play critical role stabilise income source since begin financial crisis. origination new loan non-financial agent remain high. proper price risk accord credit quality borrower therefore key issue france’s highly competitive lend market. by contrast, corporate investment bank activity broadly negative impact earnings, due combine effect asset impairment fall profits. loss asset management vary significantly one institution another. what learn major banks’ first quarter earn 2008? earn obviously follow trend 2007 reflect persistent effect risk associate subprime crisis, valuation loss asset high risk-related costs. a compound indicator, roe show decline profitability, still stand average 14 per cent, compare 18.9 per cent three large bank group first quarter 2007. on point, i would like put decline context. it follow several year exceptional profits, raise question sustainability. despite decline income, french bank system still financially sound: tier 1 solvency ratio base original fund stand average 7.1 per cent three large bank group end 2007, much high minimum ratio 4 per cent set pillar 1 basel ii accord. bank increase solvency ratio first quarter 2008 commission bancaire attache great deal importance effort. the benefit business diversification, effectiveness measure take limit risk exposure satisfactory capital level also enable major bank group remain highly rat lead international agencies. 2 bi review 82/2008 2. the current economic situation call vigilance nonetheless, since bank must ready cope new risk may occur time. the source risk relate crisis closely monitored, french bank system, like other, cannot fully protect new negative development stem crisis. in today’s globalise financial markets, contagion financial turmoil spread many channels. therefore, extreme vigilance call for. for example, let say word hedge fund risks, since increase counterparty risk exposure unregulated entity may still occur, could combine “commodities” risk. in respect, i would like stress critical bank ensure hedge fund exposure adequately collateralised times. i aware hedge fund attractive customer credit institution afford ignore today, prime brokerage activity path growth many institutions. similarly, bank afford ignore growth financial market link commodity energy. however, must forget hedge fund also active highly volatile markets. it therefore critical avoid risk concentration combination vulnerability stem two rapidly grow sectors. even though take second-round shock real economy stem financial crisis central scenario euro area, high degree uncertainty still distinguish characteristic bank business 2008. bank obviously face solve complex equation: i) maintain positive contribution net income financial service retail bank risk-related cost rise, ii) control risk profile corporate investment bank activities, maintain good profitability level, iii) cop impact aftershock crisis banks’ balance sheets. in regard, let stress liquidity management, market condition remain tense, attendant consequence management hedge transaction generally. on last point, i add diversify business model mean french bank among dependent market financing. therefore, lead french bank group able manage liquidity need effectively, even period great tension markets. yet, tightening-up access liquidity wake crisis show critical risk management become. 3. a crisis condition persist, i like talk main thrust supervisory authorities’ actions. we always maintain practical implementation new basel ii solvency ratio would primarily ensure bank measure risk accurately ordinary time well crises. the new basel ii framework reality france since begin year. it noteworthy large proportion french bank use “internal-ratings based” approach credit risk. such approach use 80 per cent relevant bank asset 1 january 2008. i would also like point impact basel ii credit institutions’ capital go beyond capital requirement calculation stipulate pillar 1 (even though provide comprehensive coverage basel i new risks, securitisation activities). regard pillar 2, new regulation call major additional arrangement refine banks’ risk management plan capital cushions. this could lead additional capital requirements, appropriate measure enhance bank stability consider risk deal inadequately deal pillar 1. by end year, approach lead individual ratio institution commission bancaire set basis structure dialogue institution. bi review 82/2008 3 we also undertake series major action directly line general framework recommendation make financial stability forum. many sphere action defined, i would like speak three i think priorities, start transparency valuation, follow adapt capital requirement set basel ii certain instruments, finally, liquidity risk. first all, enhance transparency financial disclosure quickly identify one key requirement end crisis. we urge french banks, conjunction national institute statutory auditors, cncc, provide detail disclosure subprime exposures. a joint work group make staff commission bancaire, autorité de marchés financier french bank federation define best practice area. institution start implement satisfactory manner practice improve financial statement first-half 2008. in 2009, basel committee plan publish recommendation information disseminate requirement pillar 3 basel ii. in-depth discussion bank lead convergence practice asset valuation, include priority rely price directly observable market data. where bank use valuation model liquid price disappear markets, recommendation deal consideration risk – include liquidity risk counterparty risk – rigorousness process determine prices. with regard adapt basel ii requirements, also play active role various international work group lead basel committee give great consideration, necessary, capital requirement relate liquidity line securitisation rules. finally, crisis highlight need bank improve analysis, measurement management liquidity risk. a review refinance risk could arise across bank’s business line priority; analysis refinance risk interact market risk, credit risk concentration risk. the committee european bank supervisor basel committee, global level, currently review principle govern liquidity risk management. on final note, i would like add crisis highlight need enhance internal control system improve circulation information risks, especially senior managers. the exceptional case fraud affect société générale strengthen resolve matter. in france, lead amendment regulation 97.02 internal control, provision manage operate risk, along specific effort fight fraud. this reform connect move ensure great involvement banks’ high governance body monitor internal control systems. all initiative draw lesson learn past, also forward-looking. their purpose establish principle risk management. these principle eliminate risks, enhance resilience system tension emerge. this objective reforms, i sure contribute great financial stability long run. * * * the commission bancaire therefore intend continue action enhance management control risks, within france international level well, naturally, within european bank supervision structure emphasis real convergence supervisory practices. the practical implementation supervisory college need step order achieve objective. supervisory college keystone supervision large cross-border group europe. the resolutely european thrust action, naturally line international development bank activity source vulnerability financial 4 bi review 82/2008 stability, lead incorporation european convergence objective mandate domestic supervisors. from point view, objective major motivation supervisory community whole. bi review 82/2008 5 durmuş yılmaz: global challenge local response – monetary policy turkey address mr durmuş yılmaz, governor central bank republic turkey, congress organise turkish economic association international economic association, istanbul, 25 june 2008. * * * dear guests, first all, i would like welcome turkey. i delight address distinguish audience istanbul. i would like thank turkish economic association international economic association organize congress. let start talk word josiah charles stamp, one former governor bank england 1920s: “it easy dodge responsibilities, cannot dodge consequence dodge responsibilities.” this quote also theme speech today. distinguish guests, although globalization start second half 1980’s, yet reach peak still witness evolution. a thomas friedman’s said, globalization make world flatter. we witness record high growth rate around world period; although also notable variation growth performance across countries. it wrong argue globalization could powerful tool may contribute sustain development combine compatible policies. however, also keep mind globalization also present challenge thus, make job policy-makers difficult. firstly, i would like underline concept financial globalization. thank financial liberalization improvement information communication technologies, significant amount capital flow develop countries, especially offer high growth potential – help country achieve relatively high growth levels. in post-war period globalization popular buzzword, high growth rate also observe number countries, usually south asia. however, country something common, high rate savings. in country like turkey, half population 30 year old young save rate comparatively low; foreign savings, therefore capital inflow need maintain high level growth. in respect, financial globalization contribute convergence process among countries. financial liberalization also lead amplification new complex financial products. a side effect, financial product introduce new risk fragility financial markets. a financial market gradually become integrated, concept financial stability start receive attention become one priority central banks. therefore, surprise systemic problem emerge u sub-prime house loan second half 2007 gradually spill credit market give enormous anxiety policy makers. in context, central bank engage close cooperation information share address challenges. the recent crisis financial market likely significant repercussion real economy obvious victim economic growth. a mark slowdown bi review 82/2008 1 develop country expected. part current debate whether develop country could escape sharp slowdown industrialize world. some argue can, thank progress macroeconomic stability structural reform recent years. we still know whether right. another aspect globalization huge volume international trade, lead considerable convergence business cycle across countries. integration previously-closed economies, like china, india eastern european, international market lead economic boom world economy, mostly anti-inflationary – recently. needle say, record increase commodity price last two year create doubt mind sustainability anti-inflationist growth process near future. dear guests, we currently face significant inflationary pressure global scale due record high increase commodity prices. the surge inflation rate become major challenge threaten price stability many countries. i would like give examples. between 2006 2008, eighteen develop country implement inflation-targeting regime. in 2006, end-year inflation within target band twelve countries. in 2007, number drop five. by may 2008 one 18 country (brazil) succeed keep inflation within target band. in remain 17 countries, include turkey, inflation outside target band. develop country also experience similar problem. by may 2008, one eight develop country inflation rate still within band – country canada, way. average inflation throughout world increase one-fold seven percent last 12 months. inflation develop country reach high level last eighteen years. for first time many years, inflation figure develop country two digit levels. in period central bank adopt different approach fight inflation. one reason divergence difference objective central banks. for example, federal reserve bank unite states, ultimate goal price stability, financial stability full employment, low interest rate 325 basis point september 2007 june 2008 due severe problem financial system. the european central bank, hand, follow hawkish attitude focus attain primary objective, price stability. the disparity consumption pattern another factor cause divergence monetary policies. in comparison industrialize world, food expenditure develop country constitute large share basket consumer prices. that increase food price typically lead high increase inflation rate develop countries. this one reason central bank develop country focus price stability display tight monetary policy stance recent months. to put figures, since mid-2007, policy rate sixteen major develop country increase 110 basis point average – contrast develop country policy rate cut 98 basis point average. the exchange rate regime also affect conduct monetary policy. a may know, many develop country peg currency u dollar euro. a u dollar lose value many currency recent years, lead sharp increase inflation rate economy whose currency peg u dollar. in period january 2006 may 2008, inflation rate country whose currency peg u dollar increase three-fold 15.1 percent 3.9 percent. inflation rate country whose currency peg euro rise 10.2 percent 4.4 percent. in period, country avoid nominal appreciation currency exacerbate inflationary effect supply shocks. the necessary adjustment real exchange rate take place rise general price level. 2 bi review 82/2008 until recently, common view among central bank develop country give priority problem financial market absence inflationary pressures. however, slowly acknowledge fact increase inflation reach critical levels. accordingly, uncertainty financial market diminishing, feed ecb hint may resort monetary tighten near future face rise inflation. what best reaction monetary policy circumstances? although factor cause high inflation presume exogenous beyond control central banks, lot controversy issue. but go detail, let question validity debate first, extent increase commodity price supply-driven questionable first place. certainly, structural reason behind recent run-up food energy prices. however, also undeniable significant demand-driven pressure commodities. loose monetary policy adopt early 2000s certainly play key role, together excess liquidity financial system. another culprit high subsidy provide many government develop world least partially protect consumer cost high food energy prices. fast-forwarding recent period, observation central bank develop country still keep real interest rate negative face financial risk may hamper correction commodity prices. on hand, many develop countries, mainly china, india, malaysia, indonesia, egypt decide gradually reduce subsidize energy price pas true cost consumers. this favorable development eventually help control demand pressure commodities. dear guests, a may know, commonly accept practice inflation target regime monetary policy react supply-driven shock temporary nature allow temporary increase inflation short-term, unless create deterioration inflation expectations. otherwise, undesired fluctuation might arise economic activity relative prices. the increase commodity price would trigger self-correcting mechanism. by change relative prices, would provide valuable information resource economy distributed. while high food energy price curb consumption products, would also encourage investment increase supply long-term. in short, common view central bank nothing wait supply-driven shock work natural course. however, current environment persistent rapid increase food energy price observe considerable period, prevalence view become questionable – especially light current projection foresee even high price near future. a matter fact, many country inflation target regime project inflation converge target end-2009 2010, earliest. go long period high inflation serious risk price stability. first, general price level may shift upwards fast rate, producer worker sector ask high price wage response loss real purchase power. the fall real interest rate due deterioration inflation expectation another risk, since low real rate lead fast pace credit expansion. the common factor two risk persistent supply shock may turn demand shock while. thus, point, central bank decide extent tolerate rise inflation. a famous philosopher karl popper put define demarcation problem, “if demarcate scientific hypothesis, leave one key step verify correctness hypothesis”. any theory formulate way allow falsification; circumstance theory fail identified. bi review 82/2008 3 advocator “wait-and-see” approach face supply shock clear question supply shock end demand-driven price increase take place, environment inflation keep rising. if issue clarified, above-target inflation figure upward revision inflation forecast easily attribute supply-side factors. clear line draw economic data would refute discourse would constitute limit supply shock central banker’s point view. dear guests, in part speech, i would like discus recent development turkish economy monetary policy implement period. i believe start evaluation development 2006 useful provide good understand current monetary policy stance. a may know, may 2006 risk perception develop country change significantly owe deterioration global liquidity conditions. in period supply-side shock start take toll inflation, rapid depreciation turkish lira lead significant deterioration medium long-term inflation expectation – give rise risk potential second-round impacts. the central bank turkey respond development rapid strong monetary tightening. this strong monetary tighten necessary policy stance keep inflation expectation check make inflation converge target medium term. thus, policy rate raise total 425 basis point june july 2006. at time, excessive liquidity overnight market cut via open market operation foreign exchange sales. these measure soon prove effective. the acceleration inflation stop third quarter 2006, follow mark decline inflation rate start second quarter 2007. favorable development service sector, record significant price rigidity past, particularly noticeable. a may know, bring service inflation take long compare good inflation, owe structural factor lack competitive pressures, high share labor cost production function, backward-looking price behavior. against background, favorable development service inflation decline single digit level first time mid-2007, hover around 14 percent even 2004-2005 period consumer price inflation come single-digit figures. the year 2007 time effect unfavorable development food energy price become visible. nevertheless, uncertainty persistence supply-side shock future mark slowdown core inflation indicator create favorable environment gradual ease monetary tightening. in framework, central bank initiate measure rate-cut cycle september 2007 cut interest rate total 225 basis point within six-month period. by end-2007, consumer inflation reach 8.4 percent, exceed 4-percent target. however, fall core inflation (which exclude item beyond control monetary policy food energy) 4.8 percent confirm monetary tighten implement 2006 right policy choice. during period, domestic demand capacity condition also continue support disinflation process. in early 2008 supply side shock food energy price start exert significant inflationary pressures, reach unprecedented level beyond expectations. for instance, october 2007 inflation report, base forecast international agencies, foresee oil price around usd 70 per barrel 2008 gradual correction food prices. in words, assume supply side shock would temporary would lose impact while. these forecast line price forward future markets. however, expectation materialize. both crude oil price agricultural commodity price continue rise. the adverse impact supply shock reach unprecedented level first half 2008. 4 bi review 82/2008 under normal circumstances, supply shock expect temporary impact relative prices, change course medium-term inflation. nevertheless, emergence multiple shock time persistence considerable period aggravate risk price behavior. in fact, research conduct central bank staff indicate economic agent increasingly focus past inflation form inflation expectations. after evaluate say developments, central bank conclude increase food energy price recent year reflect structural change stem global economic environment. in words, shock likely prevail long time period, contrary previous forecasts. there clear evidence point trend reverse short term. moreover, revise projection suggest even maintenance cautious policy stance foreseeable future, reach 4 percent target go take extend period time. dear guests, under circumstances, central bank turkey two options. the first one stick inflation targets, many central bank today, avoid implement monetary policy consistent targets. in words, central bank would accept priori inflation would surpass target foreseeable future. the absence policy response would justify presence supply side shocks. the central bank adopt approach bind lose credibility gradually, long inflation continue remain targets. the second option involve revise inflation target attainable level implement monetary policy line new target without compromise. that would help control economic uncertainty create new anchor use economic agent decisions. dear guests, in light evaluations, central bank turkey announce framework monetary policy upcoming period april 2008 inflation report letter inflation target send government june 3, 2008. the first pillar monetary policy framework target revision. the main purpose target revision create achievable disinflation path take reference economic agent would take u price stability objective medium term, inflation rate 4 percent. a may know, turkey witness low single-digit inflation figure nearly half century. this adversely affect expectation attain 4 percent inflation target. furthermore, overshoot inflation target 2006 2007, recent supply shock elevate expectation even further. hence, new target announce june 3, 2008 aim create new anchor economic agents, attainable. at point, i would like emphasize nature new target differ remarkably set 2006-2008 period. the central bank treat revise target asymmetrically. in framework, upcoming period, central bank prefer inflation stay target rather otherwise. accordingly, good expect outcome food energy price global factor perceive opportunity bring inflation fast imply revise target path. should upside risk materialize; monetary policy conduct minimize upside deviation inflation revise targets. target revision solution provide bank aforementioned “problem demarcation”, face almost central bank today. however, revision work necessary policy stance adopted. for reason, second pillar monetary policy comprise implementation monetary tighten consistent new inflation targets. newly set target reference would help decision bi review 82/2008 5 maker economy understand reason behind policy stance, i.e. factor lead monetary tighten extent monetary tighten necessary. in words, central bank announced, via target revision, limit tolerance first round impact supply side shocks. dear guests, in part speech, i would like cover central bank’s reason implement measure course monetary policy tightening, detail. obviously, interest rate decision take order curbe hike food energy prices. it possible control direct effect supply side shock monetary policy tools. the central bank implement monetary tighten offset secondary effect supply shocks. since domestic demand grow moderate pace moment, curb pas cost-push factors. a matter fact, price product use food energy main input rather well behave compare price product food energy inputs. however, fact first round effect supply side shock reach unprecedented level affect inflation expectation adversely. monetary policy cannot remain indifferent case deterioration overall price behavior. if supply side shock last long, effect spill sector economy. a tight stance must order control expectation prevent mutation supply side shock demand shocks. if monetary policy react disruption inflation dynamics, supply side price hike may, certain point, easily evolve self-feeding vicious circle. dear guests, why central bank repeat strong monetary tighten policy implement 2006, instead opt measure gradual increase interest rate 2008? the current condition differ may 2006 fluctuation. prominent reason disruption inflation dynamic may 2006 significant depreciation turkish lira due deterioration risk perception environment domestic demand strong impact exchange rate pass-through price well increase non-processed food price high. the central bank’s response rapid strong monetary tighten aim overcome deterioration inflation expectation period – economic unit would continue take inflation target reference decisions. today, primary cause last deterioration inflation outlook presence significant supply side shock .as i mention previously, central bank’s projection suggest possible bring inflation back 4 percent short-term even sustain maintenance tight monetary policy stance. in case, strong reaction monetary policy, case 2006, would ensure convergence inflation 4-percent target short-term, would create undesired fluctuation economic activity relative prices. it keep mind, however, inflation expectation deteriorate absence reaction central bank. the current path core inflation indicator demonstrate sharp increase food energy price start adversely effect price behavior. the core inflation indicator exclude food energy price rise 6.3 percent may. put differently, risk deterioration price behavior might spread sector economy. this situation necessitate measured, gradual predictable phase monetary tightening. the measure gradual nature monetary tighten important face already moderate economic growth monetary tighten predictable important prevent undesired fluctuation financial markets. 6 bi review 82/2008 dear guests, i would like stress more. macro-economic stability one key input sustainable economic growth. macro-economic stability cannot co-exist high inflation. country concede high inflation pursuit economic growth short-term bind deprive medium-term. policy attain price stability entail cost short-term. we need pay cost achieve price stability ensure sustainable high growth rates. if hesitate today step back ultimate target price stability, still face similar problem near future, possibly bad circumstances. in conclusion, disinflation turkey on-going process. the disinflation process disrupt past two year due extraordinary effect supply side shock inflation target overshoot considerably. in environment, central bank turkey make necessary assessment react accordingly. within framework monetary policy adopt recently, target revised. this response question extent central bank turkey may allow supply side shocks. monetary tighten consistent target constitute second pillar policy. if foresee deviation inflation outlook target, necessary policy action take without hesitation delay. a remember, i start speech word charles stamp, former governor bank england: “it easy dodge responsibilities, cannot dodge consequence dodge responsibilities.” the central bank republic turkey dodge responsibilities. in environment massive global challenges, perceive new inflation target attainable. all exist monetary policy tool hand utilize decisively without hesitation order attain targets. while conclude speech, i would like extend thank turkish economic association international economic association, institution individual contribute organization significant event. thank you. bi review 82/2008 7 donald l kohn: global economic integration decouple speech mr donald l kohn, vice chairman board governor u federal reserve system, international research forum monetary policy, frankfurt main, germany, 26 june 2008. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * during past decade, one prominent theme sound policymakers, observers, analyst international economic development "globalization." base rapid advance trade, finance, transportation, communications, world economy become increasingly tightly knit. large number world's population – include china, india, former soviet union – emerge relative isolation participate fully global economic system. the impression national border regional difference become le le relevant business increasingly operate single global market. in past year so, however, especially house sector unite state slow sharply turmoil erupt many financial markets, different theme come foreground: "decoupling." this term refer apparent divergence economic performance among different region world economy. first, perception business cycle unite state industrial economy become le synchronized, u.s. economy weaken sharply many industrial economy past several quarters. second, decouple often use refer fact economic growth emerge market economy hold up, even growth slow substantially unite state and, less extent, elsewhere industrial world. finally, relate point, observer point fact even financial market many industrial country roil turmoil emerge last august, condition traditionally volatile financial market emerge market economy prove surprisingly resilient. in talk today, i would like address two questions: first, world economy genuinely experience divergence economic financial performance describe "decoupling"? and second, true, reconcile perception globalization make economy increasingly interlink suggestion recent u.s. slowdown match slow elsewhere extent see recent cycles?1 global integration trade finance undoubtedly, economy become integrate recent decades. for example, u.s. import good service rise relative u.s. gross domestic product (gdp), 10 percent second half 1980s nearly 18 percent today. u.s. trade industrialize country double period. 1 the view i express necessarily member board governors. shaghil ahmed, steven kamin, michael leahy, staff board governor federal reserve system, linda goldberg, staff federal reserve bank new york, contribute remarks. bi review 82/2008 1 industrialize country trade emerge market economy experience far dramatic increase.2 these increase trade natural result various forces. transport cost big factor. air ship cost decline time, although erode recently great security cost rise fuel prices. cost ocean ship come down, due containerization, bulk shipping, efficiencies.3 policy-induced barriers, tariff mean restrain international trade, also declined, progress especially mark develop asia eastern europe breakup soviet union. additionally, information production opportunity foreign country become easy attain, promote part immigrant multinational company facilitate network enhance availability information internet. these development lead expand trade traditional manufacture goods, also lead expand breadth type trade good especially services. a consequence developments, internationally integrate production risen. from u.s. perspective, rise primarily occur growth import share intermediate input use across private industries. in last decade alone, import input share rise around 8-1/4 percent 1997 10-1/2 percent 2006. the international movement worker lead macroeconomic consequences, particularly small develop countries. in 2007, estimate $240 billion remittance go develop countries, double flow 2001. these remittance represent significant source develop country income broaden scope cyclical spillovers.4 another area impressive growth international linkage financial services. we've see increase cross-listings stock cross-border ownership control exchanges, banks, security settlement systems. outside unite states, 1997, 15 percent asset private equity portfolio foreign equities. a decade later, share rise 24 percent. for u.s. investors, comparable share grow 9 percent total equity portfolio 19 percent. bond portfolio also become international, especially foreign investors. while financial integration occur globally, growth uneven. integration among industrialize countries, measure ratio sum foreign asset liability gdp, triple since 1990, analogous measure emerge develop economy increase 50 percent.5 one result financial integration financial channel grow importance transmission shock economies.6 the extent integration become painfully evident investor financial institution current episode financial turmoil, collapse subprime mortgage market unite state spread loss fund pressure many corner globe. recent analysis size source spillover unite states, euro area, japan, industrial country find central role international trade. but 2 data 1986 compare 2007 (international monetary fund, 1986-2007). 3 hummels (forthcoming). 4 federal reserve bank atlanta (2008); also see the world bank (2005). 5 lane milesi-ferretti (2007). 6 imbs (2004) show financial integration raise business-cycle synchronization among sample industrialize countries, even though financial integration lead country specialized. 2 bi review 82/2008 spillover also occur commodity price financial variable short- long-term interest rate equity prices.7 for example, liquidity condition tighten one country, globally active bank may attempt pull liquidity overseas affiliates, reduce liquidity consequence home simultaneously transmit shock abroad.8 what particularly interest cases, financial linkage might important transmission traditional trade linkages. decouple recent u.s. slowdown i turn evidence regard decouple recent u.s. slowdown. part reason hypothesis decouple gain much traction economy world appear particularly "coupled" last major downturn unite states, high-tech slowdown 2001 2002. over two year prior, 1999 2000, quarterly real gdp growth unite state average 3-1/2 percent annual rate; u.s. growth slow sharply 1 percent 2001 2002 recover subsequent two years. in major industrialize countries, average growth slow similarly, recovery slower.9 in emerge market world, economic growth move tandem u.s. growth, fall 6 percent 3-1/2 percent, recover 6-1/2 percent.10what recent experience? during first three quarter 2007, u.s. economy grow solid pace 3 percent annual rate. over next two quarters, u.s. growth slow average 3/4 percent, growth industrialize country stay much close trend rate 2-1/2 percent, growth emerge market economies, 6-1/2 percent, hold quite well. it important keep mind, however, still midst current episode. financial market remain stressed; house market many country adjust sharp run-up prices; effect turmoil economic activity unite state elsewhere still work out. accordingly, early tell correlate u.s. foreign activity period. one piece research business cycle g-7 economies, do staff federal reserve board, show difficult establish confidence business cycle become synchronize recent decades, despite trade financial integration clearly increased.11 other research, show modest convergence business cycle across large group industrial economies, fail find increase correlation industrial country cycle emerge market economy cycles.12 7 bayoumi swiston (2007); international monetary fund (2007). 8 cetorelli goldberg (2008) provide evidence transmission globally active u.s. banks. 9 the industrialized-country aggregate refer weight average real gdp growth rate canada, denmark, euro area, japan, norway, sweden, unite kingdom. the weight proportional u.s. dollar-denominated gdp compute market exchange rates. growth industrialize country go 3-1/2 percent 1-1/2 percent, recover 1-3/4 percent. the recovery industrialize country take long unite states, growth pick 2004, pattern broadly similar. 10 the emerge market economy aggregate base real gdp growth rate argentina, brazil, chile, china, colombia, hong kong, india, indonesia, korea, malaysia, mexico, peru, philippines, russia, singapore, south africa, taiwan, thailand, turkey, venezuela weight scheme use industrial countries. 11 doyle faust (2005). 12 kose, otrok, prasad (2008). bi review 82/2008 3 the dimension recent linkage financial, evidence clearer. first, question importance financial linkage unite state industrial economies, area decouple clearly occur recent episode. while industrial country market stock bond display high degree co-movement years, current episode see notable new correlation across money markets, disruption fund market show euro area, switzerland, unite kingdom, canada, well unite states. some effect u.s. subprime mortgage crisis financial market country occur result direct indirect balance sheet exposure financial institution u.s. securities. other adverse consequence foreign financial institution occur entire markets, asset-backed commercial paper, become impaired. in contrast, point apparent resilience financial condition emerge market economy past year example decoupling. in particular, disruption advance economy limit impact money market emerge market economies, financial market indicator emerge market economy appear hold relatively well. for example, spread emerge market sovereign bond yield u.s. treasury security rise since june last year, 1/3 rise average u.s. corporate high-yield spread u.s. treasury securities. that rise roughly half average several previous episode pressure u.s. corporate bond price period 1998 2005; episode include, among others, russian long-term capital management crisis 1998, 2002 surge corporate default bankruptcies, grow concern u.s. auto company 2005. in addition, stock price emerge market country perform well, broad aggregate market show stock price past year, advance economy index exhibit double-digit declines, average.13 certainly, stock price emerge market economy move downward acute period u.s. financial stress past year. however, movement similar scale see industrial country equity markets, intervene period global pressure le intense, price emerge market equity rebound substantially industrial countries. reconcile apparent decouple integration how reconcile obvious expansion international trade, labor, financial flow evidence, albeit mixed, decouple recent period? three different point help u achieve reconciliation. the first point purely conceptual. the conventional wisdom great international trade lead demand shock reverberate intensely across international markets. however, need recognize economic theory predict great economic financial integration necessarily result increase co-movement output across nations. one way integration might lead le synchronization tendency international trade promote specialization production. if economy become specialized, economic growth, even equity markets, may drive development specific industry take root country.14 13 stock price calculation base msci index emerge market economy “world index” non-emerging-market economies. 14 catao timmermann (2004). the author identify high low volatility state past 30 years. they find country factor contribution drop markedly global equity market volatility rises, country-return correlation become tight global industry factor high-volatility state. 4 bi review 82/2008 the second point reconciliation stem observation correlation business cycle specific shock drive cycles. in 2001 2002, sharp decline growth foreign country soon u.s. economy slow reflect global nature burst technology bubble worldwide transmission equity market manufacturing. in current slowdown, implosion house sector play prominent role drag u.s. gdp growth. a construction utilize local input result output trade internationally, spillover abroad limited. to sure, portion decline domestic demand unite state absorb foreign economy import fall export risen. however, indirect spillover small compare direct effect would result shock tradable good sector one global origin. although financial turmoil trigger problem u.s. house sector international scope, particular respect industrialize countries, effect real side foreign economy appear limited, least date. the recent period also one enhance demand commodity sharp run-up many commodity prices, include fuels, metals, food. the actual increase demand benefit many producer commodity help offset effect weaken export market industrial countries, thus contribute resilience output many emerge market economies. the third final point structural change emerge market economy help country recent period. one change particular strengthen policy environment. with improve economic financial policies, emerge market economy flexible le subject internal external shock scare investor disrupt asset markets. inflation rate come dramatically since 1995, part result good monetary policy, assist many case flexible exchange rate regime allow monetary authority focus intensively domestic price stability. in addition, structural progress make fiscal side emerge markets. fiscal balance much improved, many emerge market economy run current account surpluses. improvement policy environment help reinforce perception emerge market assets, average, le risky past le likely sell event financial disruption generalize retreat risk, see since august. a evidence this, i note earlier, emerge market credit spread become le sensitive movement industrial country corporate spreads, trend ongoing even prior event last year. inflation decouple up now, i discuss whether movement economic activity decouple other. but whether business cycle diverged, clear sharp increase many commodity price give rise highly coincident increase inflation rate around world. in industrialize economies, unite states, rise inflation chiefly reflect surge energy prices, whereas develop countries, food take household budgets, rise food cost important culprit. the reason trajectory persistence increase price food energy year, global growth moderated, entirely clear. the upward trend price food energy past several years, however, importantly reflect pressure pose rapidly grow demand develop economy relatively inelastic global supply commodities. for moment, high headline rate inflation show tentative sign embed core inflation longer-term inflation expectations. however, bi review 82/2008 5 policymakers around world must monitor situation carefully sign increase relative price globally generate persistently high inflation. additionally, country strong commodity demand associate rapid growth aggregate demand outstrip potential supply, action contain inflation restrain aggregate demand would contribute global price stability. conclusion to sum up, evidence sometimes present indicative divergence economic performance, refer decoupling, definitive. it certainly case recent quarters, u.s. economy slow great extent industrial economies, economic activity industrial economies, aggregate, slow emerge market economies. this experience contrast near start decade, economic downturn 2001 2002 felt uniformly throughout global economy. in addition, financial condition emerge market economy remain relatively stable, consider turmoil overtake industrial country financial market past year. even so, neither economic growth financial market different region world move lockstep past, expect across business cycles. it far clear divergence performance see late, tentative event, represent distinct break historical benchmarks. the recent divergence economic performance reflect particular set shock hit global economy, well change way different economy respond shocks. a global economy become intertwine complex, nature transmission business cycle associate policy response doubt continue evolve. economy benefit independent monetary policy provide room respond flexibly alternative configuration economic financial shocks. these benefit could increase exchange rate flexibility become widespread monetary policy give great latitude respond shock wherever originate. reference bayoumi, tamim, andrew swiston (2007).

new anglo-american college, prague, 20 june 2008. * * * lady gentlemen, dear colleagues, it pleasure today share think concern role education investment human capital long-term development economy society general. today it’s commonplace politician swear concept like investment education, knowledge-based economy effect education long-term economic growth. they also quick add something necessity pay university education, least right wing political spectrum. don’t worry, haven’t meet today ass individual political ideas, know sometimes it’s long road politician say do. however, fact sit today indicate view education investment place today’s society regardless political preferences. i would like use opportunity point although concept investment education may somewhat misuse unfortunate overtone somebody, rigorous theoretical foundation high empirical relevance. in fact, i would like reinforce conclusion doubt arrive – make good choice invest education. in 1987, robert solow award nobel prize economics contribution theory long-term economic growth, already clear model long-term economic growth certain shortcoming description reality. on one hand, mean unexpected, economic model suffer similar syndrome certain degree. on hand, cause empirical problem surround solow’s model inspire point view. the whole issue revolve around determine extent long-term economic growth aid human labour capital measure sum previous investment still use. in practical calculations, contribution human labour always simplify ratio wage pay output. this ratio two-thirds develop world. therefore, two-thirds output develop country use remunerate labour remain one-third remunerate capital. problem occur contribution human labour capital calculate way apply two country different level development. in cases, significant degree divergence characteristic economy observe reality predict model. it clear relatively long time share human labour output one-third, solow’s model would provide good picture reality international comparison. to overcome inconsistency, however, necessary come idea introduce new variable model would represent human capital. although may seem obvious today – thing always seem soon someone else think – novelty late 1980s. it another nobel prize laureate economics robert lucas divide human labour part reflect people’s general capacity work, contribution human capital result previous investment education. what lucas simple today’s point view. use extensive structure u economic data, choose average wage people basic education basic remuneration people’s capacity work. then gradually add average wage bi review 81/2008 1 people finish year education. the result show every additional year education level bachelor’s degree increase wage 8% average. in unite states, finish high school obtain bachelor’s degree, mean invest eight year education, look forward wage two-thirds high wage would get finish basic education. although lucas’s calculation didn’t include subsequent stage education, bachelor’s degree sufficient reduce share basic human labour output improve solow’s original concept, it’s clear thing don’t stop bachelor’s degree. on contrary, one could say, seem simple linear relationship cease valid here, every additional year bring even high wage increase compare previous years. regardless size increase, investment education mean empty slogan. i wish become live proof this. 2 bi review 81/2008 savenaca narube: promote investment fiji open address mr savenaca narube, governor reserve bank fiji, open westpac’s mhcc branch, suva, 20 june 2008. * * * mr. john cashmore, westpac fiji chief manager management staff distinguish guest introductory comment today mark yet another milestone westpac’s history open 19th bank site. they certainly come long way since open fiji bank new south wale 12th august 1901. i honor part milestone evening. in last ten months, westpac open branch port denarau (september 2007) nakasi (november 2007). westpac second large number bank branch agency fiji. that impressive progress. i congratulate westpac commitment fiji also confidence fiji’s financial system. investment and confidence special thing. true, hard build quick fall. and generate confidence climate hard tough thing do. but also self fulfilling. it contagious. it always encourage see business growing. look complex. it complete six month ago. it modern meet point city. a say “business must go on” whatever environment. no one owe u living. investment must continue. we need ever before. investment locomotive growth. without it, economy lose steam. so i hope westpac’s confidence rub many us. we reserve bank promote investment. at end april raise local borrow limit non-resident company light stability foreign reserves. we listen investor commercial bank tell us. the change welcome well receive lender investors. we go still. we complete review local borrow limit non-resident individuals. we relax borrow i wish announce major changes. firstly, build new residence fiji, non-resident individual bring fund offshore – borrow locally 60 percent project cost. secondly, make refinement local borrow integrate development project. we want inconvenience project already start implement policy begin year. if company convince u project substantially start that, add project call “exempted list” would allow non-resident individual buy property borrow even locally. detail relaxation announce shortly. bi review 81/2008 1 these relaxation positive signs. i would like count proactive moves. they intend signal focus lie ahead us. i sure relaxation provide much need impetus private sector investment. on front, let take opportunity say credit ceiling constrain investment country. if commercial bank want lend business investment purposes, apply u give approval short period time generally within two days. moreover, credit ceiling allow u raise liquidity reduce interest rates. interest rate generally back 2005. so interest rate constrain investments. global price the whole world reel high food fuel prices. these price may stay u time although ease food price expect toward end year. but it’s anybody’s guess fuel price may end at! for fiji, come vulnerable time economy recover severe decline last year, national debt high foreign reserve weak. monetary policy already tight credit ceiling place. we cannot tighten address inflation. even could, prefer solution price drive supply constraint abroad. the adjustment burden rest national budget. the question becomes: “how much load budget carry mitigate rising?” my answer – “perhaps much give high debt level!” we somewhat catch rock hard place! in view, need concentrate measure change behaviour thing – reduce fuel consumption self sufficient basic foods. to help small way, reserve bank announce relaxation forward foreign exchange cover facility. commercial bank enter forward foreign exchange contract local importer rice, wheat, flour, edible oil milk hedge future price increases. previously, commercial bank could match forward sale forward purchases. we hope measure reduce import cost food item benefit pass onto customers. westpac mhcc let get back mhcc westpac. for shop mall open december 2007, mhcc already look like place suva. it appear john westpac team may scrabble open branch mhcc. with volume foot traffic i see today, branch may small point representation westpac, certainly go busy one. i also tell cruise ship call suva, traffic become even intense. retail business

introductory remark mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank chairman board director bank international settlements, half yearly medium news conference, geneva, 19 june 2008. * * * the swiss national bank (snb) leave target range swiss franc three-month libor unchanged 2.25-3.25%. it intend hold rate middle target range time being. despite slowdown economic activity, global economy remain robust price oil continue climb. this lead general increase inflation. the situation financial market still uncertain, le turbulent month ago. although swiss economy also grow slow pace, snb change forecast real gdp growth 1.5% 2% 2008. however, increase inflation forecast expect average rate 2.7% 2008. nevertheless, assume libor remain unchanged 2.75%, inflation edge back 1.7% 2009 1.3% 2010, result expect economic downturn. considerable risk attach inflation forecast. strong price increase likely, energy price rise swiss franc depreciate foreign exchange market. a significant slowdown global economy might ease inflationary pressure. give conditions, snb maintain cautious stance leave monetary policy strategy unchanged. in view medium-term inflation outlook, afford so. after all, enough reason suggest current inflationary trend transitory nature. the snb keep close watch price oil, movement swiss franc, economy, development financial markets, ass impact inflation outlook react swiftly, order maintain price stability medium term. global economic outlook with export account 52% gdp, swiss economy strong global presence. this opportunity, also mean international environment considerable impact economic development switzerland. the u economy – recently principal driver global economic growth – make scant headway last three quarters. however, period near-stagnation u economy currently experience likely prolonged. the resolutely expansionist nature u monetary fiscal policy, combine weak u dollar favour exports, help reenergise u economy. a recovery expect towards end year, albeit tentative one, give deterioration employment outlook, erosion purchase power fall property price look set weigh consumer sentiment income. europe represent second pole global economy. although continent enjoy strong growth first quarter 2008, remainder year see slowdown. a number factor contribute loss momentum. first, strong euro sharp downturn u economy dampen exports. the sub-prime crisis lead tighten credit conditions, consumer confidence deteriorated. this knock-on effect consumer spending. however, slowdown europe much le pronounce us, although subsequent pick-up economic activity also probably gradual. bi review 80/2008 1 the asian economies, constitute third major hub, continue exhibit strong growth whole, since remain virtually unaffected slowdown u economy. nevertheless, hit rise commodity food prices, seriously reduce incomes. regional variation aside, would therefore reasonable conclude global economy, whole, witness significant slowdown present – oppose one rather alarm scenario recently mooted. the impact crisis financial sector rest economy felt le acutely lot slowly could expected. it precisely continue robust global growth main reason sharp rise food oil price – although market speculation may accentuate trend. in countries, rise price oil translate increase consumer prices. after remain moderate level long time, inflation cause concern. this increase index risk destabilise inflation expectations, remain stable last number years. swiss economic outlook last year saw swiss economy still operate dynamic pace, distinct fall-off first month 2008. in first quarter, real gdp grow annualised rate 1.3%. this compare growth rate region 3% even 4% saw 2007. the slowdown attributable three major factors. first, economy turn exceptionally high rate last year. a slowdown therefore inevitable much desirable. it reduce likelihood economy overheat reflect normalisation monetary policy undertake recent years. second, slowdown export play add role, curb manufacture activity. finally, problem financial market result significant drop stock market transactions. this negative impact add value bank sector. however, slowdown production spread sector activity. growth remain strong retail wholesale business, hotel cater trade transportation communication industries. this show domestic demand remain – whole – robust. with first month 2008 see steady flow new jobs, favourable climate job market continue conducive private consumption particular. further growth demand production likely next quarters, albeit modest pace. high price oil product uncertainty relate u real estate crisis undoubtedly continue hamper economic activity. however, growth household consumption equipment investment look set continue. the snb continue forecast gdp growth 1.5% 2% 2008. however, average annual growth rate boost strong growth achieve second half 2007. it therefore conceal noticeable slowdown economic activity, quarterly rate potential throughout rest year. change monetary financial framework how monetary condition evolve since last assessment march? they become somewhat relaxed. this mainly attributable two factors. first, swiss franc depreciate 3% 26 important trade partners, thereby partially offset appreciation occur begin year. this soften direct impact inflation, increase price imports. to give example, impact oil price inflation amplified, price barrel brent crude rise 18% mid-may term swiss francs, 13% term u 2 bi review 80/2008 dollars. in long term, weaken swiss franc indirectly contribute increase price stimulate demand. second, real short-term interest rate dropped. there rise expect inflation near future mean – give nominal interest rate – low real expect yield short maturities. an analysis monetary condition term volume lead similar conclusions. let u begin money, best indicator use broad-brush long-term outlook economy inflation required. the m1 m2 monetary aggregates, decline long ago, practically stable months. a m3, continue exhibit moderate growth. the sub-prime crisis confirm importance mortgage loan indicator degree relaxation monetary policy. the reason simple. because construction project long-term nature, real estate investment react particularly sensitively interest rates. consequently, mortgage loan grow rate 5–6% 2003 2004, monetary policy firmly expansionary. these growth rate decline gradually tighten monetary policy 2006 2007. last april, settle around 3.3%. the growth rate loan – particularly heterogeneous category – remain high, confirm underlie trend economy remain dynamic. in december, emphasise need give particular attention condition credit market light sub-prime crisis. in order this, snb conduct survey 20 bank march, provide u information intention expectations. this survey complete analysis credit volumes. it reveals, first, bank significantly tighten lend condition respect either household company course last months. second, bank state that, broad terms, demand credit remain unchanged. third, expect significant change either supply demand month ahead. thus survey confirm conclusion analysis credit volume which, seen, continue rise. unlike similar survey conduct u euro area, show that, time being, sub-prime crisis lead deterioration credit condition switzerland. inflation inflation risk inflation develop line expectation first quarter year. our march forecast 2.4%, whereas actual inflation 2.5%. nonetheless – see chart – forecast high persistent inflation rest year. however, drop back 2% level begin next year, although significant risk attach relatively favourable forecast. a pronounce price surge would clearly concern increase price energy food. in addition, possible movement swiss franc contribute ease upward pressure import prices. have say that, also underestimate potential movement price raw material reverse, inflation pressure abate event pronounce global economic slowdown, especially yet know consequence financial market turbulence. today’s monetary policy decision reflect assessment different risks. monetary policy decision inflation exceed 2% mark since december 2007. however, view situation temporary expect slowdown economy moderate effect. we expect inflation already move back 2% level 2009. moreover, give prevail uncertainty regard global economy – could suffer greater-than-expected slowdown – fallout international financial bi review 80/2008 3 turmoil – hit switzerland fairly hard compare industrial country – consider prudent attitude remain appropriate change monetary policy call current circumstances. nevertheless, must remain vigilant. a renew rise energy prices, strong economy expected, weaken swiss franc increase inflation expectation would pose threat medium-term price stability. we therefore continue keep close watch factors, able react quickly order maintain price stability medium term. inflation forecast chart how inflation forecast revised? the dash red curve chart represent new forecast. it cover period second quarter 2008 first quarter 2011, map future development inflation assumption three-month libor remain unchanged 2.75% forecast period. for purpose comparison, dash-dotted green curve show inflation forecast march monetary assessment, base three-month libor 2.75%. the new forecast show inflation rise short term, exceed 2% first quarter next year. the increase primarily due rise oil price combine continue robust economic activity. however, forecast show expect slowdown economy, fall capacity utilisation rate baseline effect regard energy price contribute decline inflation, thus, medium term, arrive level fully compatible price stability. observe inflation june 2008

half-yearly medium news conference, geneva, 19 june 2008. * * * the money market lifeblood international financial system. properly function money market absolutely essential solvency banks, well effective implementation monetary policy. hence, event money market since onset financial turmoil particular focus central banks’ attention. so far, three wave turbulence. at time last news conference, almost height second wave. in meantime experience third wave, peak april. an appropriate barometer health money market difference three-month libor three-month (t)ois rate (tom-next/overnight index swap). this difference reflect credit liquidity premium unsecured money market trade compare purely derivative business virtually counterparty risk. with help chart 1, regard “fever curve”, i would like look back event unfolded, comment measure central bank take response. the first wave peak september 2007. money market risk premia rise sharply, 10 basis point 50 basis points, even exceed 100 basis point currencies. in phase, react flexibly volatile bank demand provide generous amount liquidity repo auctions, increase frequency fine-tune operations. in october, period calm risk premia retreated. in phase, patient – market – prescribe usual remedies, although high do several time day necessary. the second wave arise concern refinance shortage around year-end, reach peak december. to reduce uncertainty part market participants, swiss national bank increase repo transaction maturity several weeks, even several months, instead usual weekly maturity. these measure make easy bank manage liquidity around end year. during second wave, european bank find increasingly difficult refinance u dollars, dollar rate regularly high europe us. one reason structural dollar short position european bank concern would sufficient dollar liquidity close business result poorly function money markets. for reason, federal reserve, ecb snb decide take concert action. in december 2007, first time history, snb able provide counterparties u dollar liquidity usual snb eligible collateral, thank swap agreement fed. in context, important point dollar liquidity impact either monetary policy snb’s income statement. yet help facilitate refinance counterparties, thus make positive contribution towards ease tension swiss franc money market. in phase, central bank supplement usual remedy booster treatments. the third wave turbulence, march year, result acute liquidity problem face individual international banks, combine concern money market problem might become chronic. in third phase, snb provide new instruments, prefer make great use exist tools. in particular, resume u dollar auctions, offer usd 6 billion fortnightly basis. in way, provide market maximum usd 12 billion. in addition, supply bi review 80/2008 1 market generous amount swiss franc liquidity actively engage fine-tune operation whenever necessary. other central bank opt wide-reaching measure past months. for instance, range eligible participant collateral refinance operation expanded. the feed bank england introduce new “collateral swap facility”, bank temporarily swap unsaleable security liquid government paper. the pressure bank refinance balance sheet thus reduce without additional central bank money inject market. the feed go even provide support sale investment bank bear stearns. it take illiquid risky security directly onto balance sheet. thus, third phase, country administer new remedy addition exist ones, even perform emergency operations. in snb’s case, range counterparties admit repo auction already broad time. indeed, shortly turmoil began, decide expand range eligible security money market operations, whilst still retain stringent quality standards. measure use u uk prove necessary switzerland date. monetary policy steer crisis the measure take snb, describe above, primarily aim ensure smooth function swiss franc money market turbulence. however, also important look actual implementation monetary policy strategy crisis. of particular interest regard two aspect occasionally misinterpret general public. first, question whether, stabilise money market, snb release flood liquidity, thereby enter inflation risks. the snb indeed sometimes inject large amount central bank money market. since onset turmoil, principle always provide generous supply liquidity repo operations. however, fine-tune also consistently use absorb excess liquidity, soon call money rate fell certain level. since bank ultimately limit end-of-day demand central bank money, regular flow fund back snb. these operation allow u two things: first, limit volatility call money rates; and, second, keep market rate close repo rate. this show chart 2. moreover, also enable u keep average level sight deposit stable, mean allow bank system supply excess liquidity. a see chart 3, wide day-to-day fluctuation sight deposit crisis but, average month, level remain le stable. thus switzerland cannot say flood liquidity. second, attention focus interest rate fix monetary policy repo auctions. the snb, basis monetary policy assessment, decide range three-month libor consider appropriate monetary policy purposes. this mean movement libor line snb’s monetary policy objective counter change repo rates. thus, course turbulence, consistently offset change libor risk premia change repo rate, show chart 4. for reason, libor remain middle target band whole episode. the swiss franc libor much stable turmoil libor currencies. this simply mean able protect swiss economy part crisis-induced increase risk premia. libor criticise recently, market observer question information value libor. the libor major currency fix daily london british banker association 2 bi review 80/2008 (bba) basis survey top-rated international banks. critic argue bank would report unduly low libor rates, effort talk creditworthiness. others claim rate high panel report bank sufficiently representative. these criticism almost exclusively concern dollar libor. the bba find evidence systematic distortion libor, announce leave fix method libor unchanged. however, strengthen governance libor fix process, especially monitor individual banks’ reports. in regard, bba recently publish report, invite comment financial market participants. what snb’s standpoint discussion? the snb – like market participant – strong interest ensure libor reflect true market interest rate conditions. for three-month swiss franc libor, far evidence previously been, longer, case. the use three-month libor operational target stem considerable economic significance reference rate many financial lend contracts. here too, far evidence libor lose significance swiss franc market. since report bank equally affect financial market turmoil, since extent liquidity libor-based, unsecured money market trade crisis automatically much low usual, range number report automatically wide situation. this also give rise random fluctuations. moreover, general risk premium inherent libor become lot volatile since start turmoil. this volatility make hard steer libor. it should, however, bear mind snb use point target target range, allow certain amount fluctuation libor. yet notable thing that, despite difficulties, succeed keep libor around middle target band. this is, all, count implementation monetary policy. so neither current criticism level libor actual movement libor immediate reason dispense rate operational target snb. conclusion let briefly conclude. despite clear sign return calm, money market yet go back “business usual”. the libor/tois differential continue indicate certain degree tension. the various wave turbulence also show difficult predict happen next. central bank action help defuse situation. nevertheless, treat symptom malaise, fever. an effective cure restoration confidence market participant primarily matter bank themselves. the snb’s tool – medicine cabinet – far prove worth turbulence. yet crisis provide reason review necessary adapt them. for central banks, important consider, immediate effect instrument, also longer-term repercussions. thank monopoly issue currency, central bank engage almost unlimited short-term intervention market market participant threaten collapse. however, extreme measure carry high risk long term. it easy market participant assume protect negative effect action crisis. central bank need keep close eye moral hazard problem, necessary take step contain appropriate regulation. bi review 80/2008 3 chart 1: risk premia

introduction lady gentlemen, great pleasure even busy week bank, open letter chancellor response news tuesday cpi inflation rise 3.3% may, late mpc minutes, chancellor’s announcement last night enhance role bank financial stability. thing certainly change year since chief executive, jam ramsbotham, ask speak evening. the bank's link region go back 1828 when, response crisis confidence (this one locally issue bank notes), open branch newcastle. the move well received. the newcastle chamber commerce, write director bank england, say "in absence avow motive establishment branch bank england, newcastle, [we] see prospect good establishment.......[we] earnestly recommend director bank england re-consider policy measure adopt abstain try experiment system banking, advantage generally felt admitted." i please current agents, david buffham will dowson receive warm welcome chamber member others travel around region. our agent eye ear bank. they make sure take account economic statistics, best tell u happen (and frequently fail that), also know businessmen woman say outlook plans. the monetary policy committee receive report region month i assure always receive lot attention. all member committee also get meet business i north east two days. the main subject speech tonight wide economy, particular tale two cycle – downswing financial cycle upswing commodity price cycle. the economic environment context but first, important recognise last ten year period remarkable stability uk’s economy. it certainly stable successful period economy lifetime.1 when mpc set up, charlie bean – lead academic, soon fellow deputy governor – estimate inflation would away target 1 percentage point nearly 5 month every year. yet week governor’s open letter chancellor explain inflation last month deviate percentage point target second write 10 years. and take past decade whole, stability inflation come cost growth – quite opposite fact. output growth high relative rate 1 indeed work do bank suggest term inflation, stable decade many lifetime – is, since restoration least (benati (2006)). bi review 80/2008 1 achieve average precede 30 year comparison european neighbours. it also remarkably stable.2of course stability macro level disguise big change structure economy. indeed provide platform change. the north east example much diverse le reliant large industries. and, overall people employ region: number employ north east rise 100,000 past ten years. and export growth remain relatively buoyant. in contrast picture stability, precede 3 decade scar painful recession unemployment rise sharply, inflation fluctuate wildly. in particular, three episode mid-1970s early 1990s, inflation rise sharply, around time output contracted. while many room don’t need reminding, i think i would give young member audience reminder desperate time (chart 1). in 1975, rpi inflation peak shy stagger 27% time output fell. it era entrench term “stagflation” mind public. inflation fell back sharply subsequent year so, rear head 1979-80 – time peak around 22%. once output contract unemployment rise sharply (chart 2). a third final bout rise inflation fall output occur early 1990s, unemployment rate rise 10%. on average, inflation 1970s around 13% 7.5% 1980s. the uk macroeconomic framework why output inflation volatile economic performance improve much past 10 years? these question vital face uncertain time ahead ensure avoid repeat mistake past. i would point three main factors. there change structure uk economy make flexible adaptable. labour market reform enact past twenty-five year lead flexible workforce. unemployment fall without generate unsustainable growth wages, hence inflation. and recent year role migrant labour important ease bottleneck skill shortage otherwise undoubtedly tight labour market. firm able adjust adapt event quickly produce le volatility output, employment inflation economy whole. with economic growth expect slow come year pressure labour market likely ease, reduce demand migrant labour, possibly begin reverse recent strong inflows. a second fundamental change monetary policy framework. the experience three recession burst inflation lead settle consensus monetary policy direct control inflation long-run trade inflation output growth. this consensus embed transfer interest rate decision independent bank england, clearly define inflation target 2% measure annual cpi inflation. that help build confidence inflation move away target, monetary policy committee act ensure return target medium term. that confidence ensure 2 it deviate 1 percentage point average 4 occasions. to put context, precede 3 decade stretch back 1960s, annual gdp growth deviate 10 year average 1 percentage point half time (about 20 quarter 10 year period). 2 bi review 80/2008 employer employee le likely adjust price wage surprise movement inflation. in words, expectation inflation medium-term remain low, stable anchor target. and help contribute stability inflation, output well. reform labour market monetary policy undoubtedly play important role reduction output volatility emergence stable, low inflation environment. but third factor play probably also quite fundamental. over first decade mpc economic cycle rest world generally moderate, although without excitement. and good evidence suggest integration emerge economies, china, global economy beneficial country like uk. the share chinese good total uk good import almost triple money term past fifteen year around 8 per cent, it’s likely much content import elsewhere originate china. this rise share chinese import reduce manufacture import good price relative price wages. consumer good price inflation hover around zero last ten years, recent rise oil prices. a result, purchase power uk consumer rise high real wage achieve without cost employers. in words, period beneficial tailwind allow economy run high level activity would otherwise case, without generate additional inflationary pressures. but economic environment overseas take turn worse. in many way tale two cycles. the financial cycle the first cycle financial sector west. a bank cycle new phenomenon scale expansion cheap credit year speed downswing last year exceptional. it start u real downturn house market rise default rate sub-prime mortgage particular. that lead freeze structure credit market build loan investor lose confidence credit rat depend on. in finance least, still true america sneeze rest world catch cold sub-prime crisis swiftly spread financial institution across world. they become uncertain value financial position held, let alone counterparties held. this lead wide loss confidence banks, hoard cash illiquidity many financial market still over. a financial institution around world struggle shrink balance sheet face storm, pronounce tighten supply credit. the number loan approval house purchase fell new low april – indicator – low level thirty year (chart 3). in past, swing uk economy home grown. credit squeeze typically result rise domestic arrears defaults, drive economic downturn home. this time sequence reversed. the broad measure economic activity continue grow: quarterly gdp growth late data 2008q1 0.4% employment continue rise. the level default corporate personal loan low. so squeeze new lend precede rather follow slowdown uk. the judgement make far tighten restrain domestic economy future. there doubt material effect already (chart 4). this obvious house market, price fall around 7% since peak, fall. the drop transaction turnover ripple housebuilding industry, bi review 80/2008 3 estate agency mortgage brokers. of course fall house price benefit buyer hurt seller necessary link wide consumption. but belief house could cake eat – house would provide place live would also provide assure capital gain – become widespread shock expectation appear wide impact confidence. there also sign timely survey indicator consumer spend weakness spread too. if nothing else go on, mpc would expect prospective weakness overall demand put downward pressure inflation medium term would point rate cuts. the commodity price cycle however, something else go on! because u still drive financial cycle, become le dominant world economy. accord imf, emerge develop country together generate around 70% world growth 2007, china alone generate around 25%. and world economy still grow strongly. that drive rise oil commodity prices. for example, since start 2005, china account almost increase world demand key metal aluminium, copper zinc. and since 2000, around one-third increase world demand oil emanate china. between 1997 2004 commodity price largely stable. however, since end 2004, sterling non-oil commodity price doubled, sterling oil price trebled. and half rise occur last 9 months. the strength demand commodity emerge market match supply. in oil metal sector, new capacity take many year come stream. and agricultural sector, output affect adverse weather condition north america, europe australia. a yesterday, oil trade around $130 per barrel. relative rise price consumer good services, oil price (in u dollars) high 1970s. the rise oil price push fuel, retail gas electricity prices. similarly, rise cost agricultural commodity drive food price (chart 5). take together energy food component account 1.1 percentage point 1.2 percentage point increase cpi inflation 2.1% december last year 3.3% may. there doubt emergence china, india asian economy recent year permanent change structure balance world economy. but sign element recent growth may cyclical. the grow inflationary pressure scale boom investment typical economy reach top cycle. the huge increase oil food price dampen effect consumer country – west. so may well see balance supply demand shift point. uk inflation outlook but immediate prospect rise inflation. a governor explain open letter chancellor, rise energy price pass consumers, cpi inflation likely rise sharply second half year, 4%. there course considerable uncertainty around this, energy import price rise further, cpi inflation could well go even high short term. that bind lead downward adjustment real take-home pay. that cannot avoided. indeed, adjustment see response rise energy price 2004-06. over period, nominal wage 4 bi review 80/2008 growth broadly stable, relatively smooth adjustment real wage response rise energy prices. a key risk outlook whether similar, benign adjustment occur response late price rises. with inflation target much past three years, set rise near term, risk household business may start expect cpi inflation persistently 2%. if happened, expectation build high wage prices, benign adjustment would repeated. so closely monitor development inflation expectations. unfortunately inflation expectation can’t observe directly. but number measures, include household survey financial market instruments, act guide (chart 6). while measure drawbacks, rise – case markedly – past year. it unclear extent measure contain information medium-term – horizon mpc aim bring inflation back target. and comfort measure – money spend remain stable line average rate increase since 1997. and committee’s commitment ensure inflation return 2% target give set price wage confidence inflation close target future. conclusion there doubt current climate challenge mpc ever face. balance downside risk demand associate tight credit condition inflationary pressure emanate rest world enormous challenge. and immediate prospect deterioration output growth inflation. monetary policy cannot prevent economy buffet development wide world economy experience past 10 year show economy flexible respond events. crucially credible framework set monetary policy meet inflation target medium term. monetary policy cannot prevent short-run up down economic cycles. in current climate, committee belief that, bank rate set bring inflation back target quickly, result would unnecessary volatility output employment. instead focus return cpi inflation 2% target around two years, present sharp rise energy food price drop cpi inflation rate. we judge order inflation return target necessary economic growth slow year, reduce pressure supply capacity economy dampen increase price wages. but risk upside downside remain large mpc continue make judgement appropriate level bank rate month month. the next year go comfortable anyone already hear call change system, target, focus inflation. but new framework independence bank design difficult time well plain sailing. i hope look business support need bring inflation back target. bi review 80/2008 5 6 bi review 80/2008 bi review 80/2008 7 gertrude tumpel-gugerell: towards integrate security market – the target2-securities project speech m gertrude tumpel-gugerell, member executive board european central, bank, 12th fese convention, stockholm, 18 june 2008. * * * lady gentlemen, i delight today fese convention share vision t2s initiative, important role create integrate european security market. but let start put t2s project broad context overall financial integration europe. i often ask need integrate financial market there enough economic evidence convince even harden sceptic financial integration european level create substantial gain society whole. financial integration foster efficient allocation resources, increase competition, reduce costs, lead high trade activity, transparent price thereby raise overall potential strong economic growth. it increase consumer choice, open multitude new investment opportunities, strengthen eu bank sector make europe centre financial innovation. moreover, perspective central banker, increase financial integration enhance smooth transmission monetary policy crucial global resilience financial market constitute important element safeguard financial stability. efficient integrate market generally reinforce shock-absorbing capacity economic system offer wide range option share risk among economic agents. the economic gain financial integration coincide objective express lisbon agenda, grant citizen europe access genuine single market financial service offer condition within across borders. thus every cross-border business europe need become truly domestic. achieve require action several kind stage process – trade post-trading. i think evidence already great progress trade side; notably, european stock exchange relatively new mtfs (multilateral trade facilities) extend range instrument offer trade platform create genuine competition. this offer potential low cost intermediary class investors. it also improve prospect retail investor diversify security portfolio across europe, increase potential return investment diversify exposure financial risks. issuer also benefit great market depth fund raising. but post trade arena? there considerable evidence cost european post trade area much high – particularly cross border activity – large markets, u market, also several market eastern hemisphere states. the cost gap – example – relation u market arise large part difference different european local markets. the lack harmonisation often result history – difference market practices, laws, tax administration on. often, post trade infrastructure local market rapidly develop relatively recent past provide efficient mean accommodate local market features. bi review 79/2008 1 the solution often create huge pressure, help individual market cope dynamic innovation trade volumes. these major achievement context, world change need move next stage development. our today’s task is, therefore, become competitive rapidly change global financial market environment. difference across europe’s post trade market overcome. for this, integration harmonization need promoted, synergy need use economy scale exploited. this foster competition expansion markets, facilitate efficient allocation better-priced capital. we, eurosystem, contribute part promote financial integration post trade sector act several role – market operator, facilitator catalyst. the eurosystem already offer core, neutral borderless infrastructure support real-time settlement central bank money target2 system. moreover, work produce next generation eurosystem’s collateral management system (collateral central bank management ccbm2). the eurosystem also support market initiative sepa – new single euro payment area – enable customer make payment anywhere euro area quickly, safely easily country, use single set payment instruments. how target2-securities initiative contribute process? let focus today eurosystem’s target2-securities initiative (t2s). t2s proposal overcome fragmentation european market security settlement provide harmonise venue, single european, borderless, settlement platform, offer highly secure delivery versus payment security, use central bank money. t2s reinforce main european union initiatives, code conduct clear settlement, giovannini harmonisation process course mifid drive forward single market objective set lisbon agenda. in particular, t2s tightly integrate target2 system, combine cash security settlement single share platform real time provide single european settlement platform security central bank money, irrespective location issuer, security settlement counterparty. this create single pool security available market user service provider choose csd, eliminate costly process cross-border security settlement europe. in way, t2s provide – like airport service various airline – basic infrastructure. in basic infrastructure csds operate, offer – example – mix product service customers. in regard, t2s simply provide basic platform offer service cd unit costs. this obviously contribute competition among csds, lead transparent efficient pricing, facilitate competition provide cross-border trade venues. this create substantial gain european financial industry. thank effort make hundred expert 80 european institution eurosystem last year, govern council ecb able last week invite european csds express support t2s. we send european csds detail user requirements, economic impact analysis, description governance next project phase, presentation harmonisation effort context t2s. these outcome transparent constructive consultation process, cooperate csds market users. let point element economic impact study find website. this analysis confirm economic benefit t2s substantial. despite use rather conservative assumption show t2s potential bring significant 2 bi review 79/2008 benefit security market participant particular european economy general. the analysis conclude cost settlement reduce substantially 73 cent csd charge average euro area (excluding communication costs) today 32 cent per transaction t2s. the t2s benefit would even high csds uk, sweden, denmark switzerland join; scenario t2s settlement cost would decline 21 cents, annual save would range eur 220 million eur 340 million. these number represent narrow business case, capture – course – full dynamic impact t2s arise enhance competition complete single market security settlement relate services. the commission estimate impact eu welfare post-trading cost reduction range eur 1.1 billion 1.6 billion. let stress clearly room much discussion exact estimate i mentioned, definitely cannot contest overall benefit competitive integrate european financial market. you may wonder i call competition time offer one single settlement engine europe. the answer two parts. first, alternative offer creation many cross csd settlement links, highly efficient safe. this realise today, partly cost partly commercial dynamics; i suspect would take many year suitable network become reality. it likely cost time would good employ provide cross border asset servicing, course necessary take full advantage borderless settlement t2s. this activity high value-added, involve take commercial risk; clear priority investment effort private sector. second – view – unlikely much benefit form innovation gain preserve multiplicity compete platforms; case likely competition settlement commercial bank money. let also stress integration harmonisation become core objective european union; european financial industry request increase competitiveness give access efficient, state art financial infrastructure support true single market. in respect, t2s develop harmonisation mind. t2s deliver embody significant amount settlement harmonisation important area common interfaces, common set rule intra-day settlement finality, common daily timetable, common messages. these feature immediate contribution elimination 6 15 so-called giovannini barriers. for future, expect t2s foster great harmonisation effort beyond area pure settlement, address barrier – already address current concept t2s – kind identify giovannini group. accordingly harmonisation group establish t2s advisory group agree implement action plan harmonisation support market leaders. it likely necessary harmonise market practice – among others – repo instructions, collateral management procedures, auto collateralisation multilateral settlement without central counterparty. and top i expect change legislation – credible consensus within market produce significant benefit – proposed. bi review 79/2008 3 before come end, let come back decision lie ahead us. since participation csds t2s project voluntary, ecb ask european csds express – 4 july 2008 – whether support t2s. we sure csds consult client stakeholders, many already express strong support. i would like encourage express view csds sound basis decide future european settlement landscape. let clear. the eurosystem ready firmly commit deliver t2s state-of-the-art settlement system market via csds 2013 latest. but also clear eurosystem cannot alone. a substantial financial investment need make build t2s; need support commitment csds customers. to conclude, i see t2s europe’s best route single security settlement system, secure real time settlement central bank money provide across account hold within single platform, open all. it operate neutral trust entity, eurosystem. therefore, rely operate transparent way profit basis. let also use occasion, express warm “thank you” stakeholders, member national user groups, individual institution work together eurosystem t2s project, openness expertise contribution successful completion work do far. this example europe co-operate harmonise innovate pursuit economic benefit single market. nearly 10 year ago, euro introduce common currency 320 million europeans. the euro great success harmonise exchange cash across euro area. let u strive similar success harmonise security settlement market. it’s time implement monetary union begin 10 year ago post trade sector. i sure support co-operation. thank much. 4

bi review 78/2008 christian noyer: international financial stability role central bank crisis address mr christian noyer, governor bank france, plenary session: “the international economy transition” montreal conference, montreal, 9 june 2008. * * * lady gentlemen, it great honour take part conference set out, distinguish audience, think role central bank regard financial stability current environment. i like organise think around follow five questions: 1) do central bank role play regard financial stability? 2) what do since start financial turmoil summer 2007? 3) be right take steps? 4) why respond differently regard monetary policy stance? 5) what lesson learn future? 1) do central bank role play regard financial stability? this question might appear paradoxical recall historically raison d’être central bank ensure financial stability, is, smooth function financial market payment systems. in context, play role ultimate liquidity provider, words, lender last resort. however, people regard role inconsistent meantime universally become primary task central banks, i.e. ensure price stability. three main argument generally put forward support view: - the first central bank one instrument disposal, i.e. interest rate, instrument, virtue tinbergen’s principle, assign single objective, price stability. other mean – particularly regulatory prudential measure – would good suit effective ensure financial stability. but current crisis demonstrate central bank actually several instrument disposal. indeed, liquidity management period financial turmoil need separate issue monetary policy stance. to put clearly, monetary policy stance simply consist set key interest rate level consistent central bank’s macroeconomic objectives, whilst liquidity management aim enable money market, financial market general, function “normally” monetary policy impulse may efficiently transmit rest economy. - the second argument policy-based nature postulate monetary stability necessary sufficient prerequisite ensure financial stability. the latter would welcome consequence implementation inflation target strategy, consist respond shock last impact medium-term price stability. here again, argument hold face fact since financial crisis unfold environment low interest rate contain inflationary pressure spite soar property commodity prices, short, context price stability seem well secured. the true previous bubble form stock markets. a low bi review 78/2008 1 interest rate environment, often make agent le vigilant risk make le able gauge it, combine strong central bank credibility, way guarantee financial stability. this one manifestation economist term paradox credibility. - the third argument relate extraordinary transformation financial system undergo past years, growing, predominant, role market finance expense bank intermediation. yet operational framework central banks, mean perform role lender last resort, mainly focus banks, retail bank particular. here again, fact prove opposite. the crisis show bank remain heart financial system that, consequence, operational framework central bank remain entirely effective. in addition, framework make possible reach market participants, broker-dealer investment banks. 2) what central bank do since start financial turmoil? the overall impression press central bank inject vast amount liquidity bank system order face crisis. this true reality. in volume terms, amount liquidity allocate eurosystem post slow growth since summer 2007. on hand, crisis, central banks, feed bank england, make adjustment operational framework, others, like ecb, able rely exist framework, recently. this result remarkable convergence central banks’ operational framework field intervention around four main areas: - lengthen maturity central bank lending: maturity increase week months. in case eurosystem, major share refinance operation maturity three months, and, recently, six-month facility introduced; - widen range eligible collateral, i.e. security use collateral. security ab rmbs, always accept eurosystem, accept major central banks; - extension list eligible counterparties, particular unite states, investment bank access fed’s lend facility; - great degree coordination central banks: include joint statement aim reassure market provision liquidity need arises, also sign swap agreement central banks. this facility enable european bank need u dollar pursue activity secure fund ecb snb. 3) be central bank right take steps? the fast spillover u subprime crisis market segments, subsequently country seize commercial paper market major strain money interbank markets, call rapid central bank intervention. this include provide liquidity market whole also, countries, grant emergency liquidity assistance systemic institutions. these intervention raise number questions: central banks, adapt operational framework fit circumstances, increase moral hazard? do unduly save institution deserve saved, particular take 2 bi review 78/2008 excessive risks? do comply traditional principle expound bagehot many year ago, i.e. lend temporarily illiquid solvent financial institutions, lend penalty rate sound collateral, provide liquidity institution satisfy aforementioned solvency collateral criteria? these essential question are, however, mainly academic. today, take different dimensions. indeed, financial crisis cause downward spiral asset prices, long transform temporarily illiquid institution insolvent institution, make bagehot’s initial distinction difficult apply. this situation exacerbate develop financial system joint application new account standard require fair value measurement financial asset prudential arrangement may prove partly pro-cyclical. in context, central bank clear duty prevent market seize up, incalculable consequence financial player generally real economy. however, bear mind central banks’ criterion accept asset collateral refinance operation particularly restrictive penalising, comply traditional principle i mentioned. in particular, value security must least equal amount lend accrue interest, apply haircut take account possible decline market value repo. 4) why central bank respond differently regard monetary policy stance? a regard central banks’ response crisis, although converge short-term liquidity management methods, nonetheless respond differently term monetary policy. the underlie reason divergence due nature shock economy face mechanism propagation real economy nominal variables. over recent period, industrialise economy undergo three common shocks: rocket real-estate price least number countries, soar commodity price finally financial crisis trigger last summer. they also experience specific shocks: real-estate crisis unite state context household overindebtedness, example. in latter case, economic slowdown already underway since mid-2006 expect consequence credit crisis economic activity medium term lead u monetary authority change monetary policy stance. the different situation euro area, activity remain favourable, lead ecb keep monetary policy stance unchanged spite uncertainty generate financial crisis context also characterise persistent inflationary tensions. 5) what lesson learn future? at current juncture, financial turmoil still affect markets. however, nine months, i think already possible draw first conclusion three main areas: - first, close co-operation central bank one hand supervisory authority central bank hand seems, opinion, determine factor efficient crisis management. this point indeed underscore recent work carry financial stability forum. i must say respect french model bank supervision, bank supervisor close tie central bank, prove worth current context. the necessity proximity also bi review 78/2008 3 increase new account prudential standard prove pro-cyclical liquidity solvency intertwined. in context, financial crisis, crucial cross-check, every moment, information evolution bank balance sheet data money market function order ass risk financial stability. such assessment enable adapt, far needed, refinance policy central bank, order alleviate tension market; tension threat financial stability effectiveness transmission monetary policy. - second, regard monetary policy, let reiterate one must carefully distinguish monetary policy stance one hand, remain focus macroeconomic objective price stability medium term, refinance condition bank system hand, may adapt time financial turmoil. moreover, solid anchor inflation expectation seem particularly crucial period economic financial uncertainty. - last least, view, regulatory issue relate increase financial innovation recent period rapid market growth matter primary concern. moreover, return great market discipline, close monitor risk market participant quite simply use commonsense principles, acknowledge thing low risk/high return assets, view prerequisite return confidence markets. 4 bi review 78/2008 paul tucker: a protract “peacetime” remark mr paul tucker, executive director member monetary policy committee bank england, chatham house conference “the new financial frontiers”, london, 29 april 2008. * * * the turmoil stress global financial system go nine month more. much say “wartime” conduct authorities, bank industry asset managers. but seed current stresses, many remain risks, lie precede period “peacetime”. the main purpose remark morning underline community must future lose sight need head risk creep prolong period “peace”. the recent period peacetime long enough substantial macroeconomic imbalance build up, globally domestically. long enough innovation financial intermediation mask, many, degree leverage system. long enough many assume fund structure could choose basis deep liquidity maintain range new asset markets. long enough long memory tend gardens. long enough international authority think would get time fix problem regulatory capital regime give rise serious problem (such zero-weighting 364-day line credit, underlay profusion bank-like conduit etc). long enough many proceed basis “it couldn’t happen” or, indeed even began, “wasn’t happening”. long enough, crucially, investor get use elevate returns. those return come largely two sources. the fall risk-free rates, bring ex ante imbalance global save investment; fall risk premia, may part flow improve monetary policy regime around world. the ensue search yield think asset manager banker want sustain future fabulous ex post return “achieved” asset price rose. it main engine leverage, maturity transformation. a cocktail raise private risk asset manager lenders, also systemic risks. the upshot protracted, yet concluded, period deleveraging. that, great scheme things, relatively small u subprime mortgage delinquency could set show fragile system become. structural change financial system really matter a commentator struggle make sense this, lot say “originate distribute” model financial intermediation. three comment that. first, enough do reflect change business model disclosure regime practices. in distant world, bank in, say, germany expose largely german company households; similarly californian bank californian borrower projects. so condition deteriorate germany, california wherever, market would alert need scrutinise “home” bank operate region sectors. in today’s world, market know risk really dispersed. but know might concentrated; and, crucially, know far might flow back bank sector towards core payment system support bi review 77/2008 1 monetary economy. it interest bank – certainly interest creditor shareholder – make risk clear future; so, face strong incentive avoid risk concentrations. but second point talk shift “originate & distribute” overdone. many large global bank seem occupy half-way house. they retain large position amount view macroeconomic condition could never get bad cause material impairment, book portfolio marked-to-market (or models). that leave expose deterioration financial conditions, particularly liquidity, fall “market” price way beyond anything contemplated, perhaps still contemplate, fundamental impairment. this mentality traditional “banking book” risk assessment graft post-glass steagall “trading book” valuation financial accounting. a regime currently works, mark-to-market – or, rather, cannot – account convention; need culture, way life, adopt it. the dynamic financial system vast majority employ mtm accounting, irrespective declare hold periods, fundamentally different one “market-makers” so. third, therefore, rule infrastructure support financial system need help withstand stress. account valuation policy one area, debated. another trade clear platform themselves. the authority must encourage industry focus whether wholesale market activity could conduct across central trade clear platform rather otc. in past, intermediary tend doubtful this. but plausible system would somewhat resilient “vanilla” product subject minimum standards, great pre post-trade transparency, centrally set margin requirement accompany transact across central infrastructure. the underlie point body provide central infrastructure clear interest effective system-wide risk management stability, monitor authorities. for authority internationally, moral story must take interest, systemic perspective, regime govern, drive change in, structure behaviour financial system. that mean maintain interest peacetime, necessary rush activity crisis occur. in set rule game, authority need strike trade risk efficiency. we could reduce risk system stifle innovation. but order choose tilt balance towards innovation efficiency, authority need confident regime that, amongst things, (i) effective mop mess, (ii) create bad long-term incentives. orthodoxy cut incipient systemic stress pass: intervene early, decisively, leave loss private sector afterwards rejigging structure system contain implication future behaviour. for that, tool needed. in broad terms, precisely special resolution regime bank improve deposit insurance propose uk authority about. they tool authority need contain disruption cause bank failure occur make individual firm failure tolerable. but also need policy contain systemic stress generally; and, possible, head risk systemic problem first place. like others, speech i identify three element armoury: monetary policy; central bank liquidity policy; policy towards bank capitalisation liquidity. monetary policy i year openly query notion enough rely monetary policy “mopping up” event. 2 bi review 77/2008 the “mopping up” doctrine come view monetary authority could spot bubble policy could cushion burst turn bubble. the doctrine effectively assume that, face possibility systemic stress, monetary authority always reduce policy rate without take risk inflation. the current conjuncture test assumption. there nasty shock demand tighten credit conditions, abroad. and may get bad rather good come months. so far, financial system face “trading book” problem; cannot rule “banking book” problem cause rise defaults. we face race involve whether deleveraging process sufficiently advance financial condition stabilise macroeconomic slowdown, abroad, raise loan default bring new dimension challenge bank sector supply credit real economy. but, absolutely crucially, also face nasty shock cost rise commodity price sterling’s depreciation. that go push uk inflation next months, create risk upward pressure pay high inflation expectations. the mpc’s strategy date clear: offset part shock demand, consistent override determination maintain medium-term inflation expectation anchor 2% target. the path rate depend judgment balance risk inflation outlook. and, context remark today, different “mopping up” strategy involve simply reduce rate enough offset estimate effect demand shock plus insurance top that. central bank liquidity policy: social contract if monetary policy constrain alleviate consequence financial turmoil, too, different reasons, central bank liquidity policy many centres. for century – coincident development central bank – effectively social contract bank system authorities. on one side contract, commercial bank permit profit maturity transformation, turn liquid save illiquid loans. commercial banks’ ability rely deposit liability universally acceptable mean payment, money. but maturity transformation – borrow short lend long – risky; rely confidence. and confidence cracks, cost felt customer shareholder bank concerned, widely economy give potential disruption payment system. our monetary economy rely stability bank system. the side contract has, accordingly, three element design protect economy risks. first, prudential regulation banks, contain risk take reduce likelihood confidence cracking. second, deposit insurance, make retail depositor le whole event failure notwithstanding regulation. and thirdly, central bank liquidity policy. essentially, central bank stand ready provide unlimited amount liquidity good collateral rate market rate prevail peacetime.12 during recent turmoil, last part contract break borrow central bank via premium-rate facility become stigmatised. 1 in lombard street (1873), bagehot talk high rate interest rather penalty rate such. this part write context gold standard regime, systemic stress often associate external flight credit rise short-term interest rate (see page 56 57); part bagehot think premium term comparison normal condition (page 197). 2 this distinguish support operation individual institutions. bi review 77/2008 3 this could important. it make innovation central banks’ liquidity provision imperative turmoil. and, regain peacetime, reform need avoid recurrence problem. open-market operation (or auctions) wide collateral, bank’s special liquidity scheme launch 21 april, see light. such measure need construct interfere implementation monetary policy, depend central bank’s net supply reserve match demand economy stabilise (risk free, secured) overnight money market interest rate broadly line policy rate. the monetary part central banks’ market operation simply injection reserves. the characteristic – counterparties, maturity, collateral etc – essentially non-monetary interventions. in circumstances, central bank want make neutral possible, interfere relative asset price economy. when market break down, however, central bank may need calibrate intervention contain spillover economy. thus sl design underpin liquidity bank system, confidence system whole. tame credit cycle but we, authorities, avoid system get fragile state first place? we really must consider that. at level system, underlie issue banker wicked stupid. there is, though, nasty collective action problem. in period lead turmoil, many market participant side atlantic think financial risk priced, especially credit markets. but know correction would come, indeed would definitely come abruptly. each fear “stepping bus” competitors, would crystallise “business risk” customer activity flow away them. this seem point need kind intervention authorities. and, perhaps hindsight, baffle authority internationally content issue warnings. what instrument might authority have? there already welcome exercise underway make basel capital accord le procyclical. the accountancy world also move towards understand policy affect behaviour system-wide conditions. on fronts, design micro measure affect macro outcomes. at macro level, need debate whether would feasible design discretionary lever authority could employ credit-cycle circuit breakers. candidate include authority adjust industry-wide benchmark capital requirement margin requirement slow commercial banks’ supply leverage financial system upswing. the debate need international, capital flow freely across border capability national authority act alone constrained. conclusion interest issue i touch morning must ebb peacetime eventually regained. parochially, massively public interest bank england’s financial stability role period turmoil precede years. but peacetime affect next “war” play out. we must forget that. central bank play role bring together synthesise analytical practical expertise macroeconomic conditions, financial market financial infrastructure. that synthesis rather special, service system whole. 4 bi review 77/2008 irma rosenberg: the monetary policy decision-making process speech m irma rosenberg, first deputy governor sverige riksbank, riksbanken, stockholm, 13 june 2008. * * * the riksbank consider one open central bank world.1 openness also one basic principle shape activities. if independent central bank perceive credible must possible outsider understand decision ass activities. we therefore try open clear possible it. this increase credibility monetary policy make easy anchor inflation expectation around target. part openness entail clearly describe analysis achieve process make interest rate decisions. i believe people familiar way conduct monetary policy general. we look ahead base monetary policy forecasts. we hold many speech subject. but go produce forecast lead decision interest rate? this probably well-known i intend talk today. in recent year change method work number fields. for example, since begin 2007 report clearly future interest rate path expect see. our forecast inflation components, like interest rate decisions, base forecast future repo rate path. these forecast change new information received, report current view future every time publish monetary policy decision. the riksbank govern executive board the year 1999 natural start point describe process monetary policy decision-making. this price stability target prescribe law riksbank give independent position regard principal, sverige riksdag (the swedish parliament). this entail major change regard decision-making way work relation general council riksbank. a already know, work riksbank head since 1999 executive board consist six members, one governor riksbank chairman executive board. the member appoint period six year time. normally period office different member overlap create continuity work bank. previously govern council riksbank, whose member appoint riksdag, govern bank together governor. today general council controller function. they appoint member executive board, influence over, instance, decision repo rate. it executive board independently make decisions. the executive board usually know individualistic committee.2 this mean member individual responsibility. interest rate decision make vote member publicly express views. the bank england also type committee. in this, differ number central banks, although 1 see, instance, dincer eichengreen (2007). 2 for review different monetary policy decision-making models, see blind wyplosz (2004). bi review 77/2008 1 committee make decision interest rate.3 one exception is, instance, new zealand, central bank governor alone make decisions. many central bank instead collegial committee. in case member reach decision publicly support. any difference opinion keep within group; outwardly speak one voice. the way reach decision varies. in know genuinely collegial committee decision precede internal discussion member put forward views. the ecb example type committee. in autocratically collegial committee, hand, chairman le dictate group's “consensus”. some researcher consider federal reserve’s fomc committee leadership alan greenspan example committee.4 the change make recently indicate fomc individualistic committee. the riksbank one central bank pronounce individual responsibility. major change way material decision produce during year i work riksbank major change work produce material monetary policy decision-making. six year ago forecast base assumption repo rate would hold unchanged, regardless whether realistic assumption. the forecast extend two year ahead, compare current three years. the analysis great extent base assessment discussions. formal model use play central role today. although function fairly well, also involve limitations. for example, difficult see alternative scenario – something give great scope analysis – could use without coherent model. the fact use model also make easy explain forecast make ass forecasts. in recent year make major change significance way organise internal forecast work. the main change base forecast view future repo rate path give forecast relatively large significance communicate monetary policy. we also work extensively bring new, large models, general equilibrium models, forecast work. the forecast result interplay model assessment our toolbox make forecast consist assessments, theories, empirical study models. these tool complement one another different role work. they important necessary make good forecast possible. a economy extremely complex, use various macroeconomic model help u piece together coherent picture economy. these model base modern economic theory, empirical study practical experience different correlation economy. this make easy u make consistent assessment different part economy develop. if one merely study individual correlation one miss interdependence exist different part sector economy. there considerable risk different part analysis hold together. 3 pollard (2004) show 79 88 central bank committee make interest rate decisions. 4 see blind wyplosz (2004). fomc stand federal open market committee. 2 bi review 77/2008 but model merely simplification reality. they must supplement analysis assessment expert different fields. the expert important insight real situation model unable capture. forecast base model provide good start point help structure discussions. the expert adjust models’ forecast basis specific knowledge assessments. the assessment become particularly important unusual event structural change occur economy. such models, merely base historical correlations, may difficulty deal these. major advance academic research regard macro model in recent year model come play increasingly important role forecast work. this also case many central banks. the background method develop quickly regard empirical property forecast performance large structural macro models. there also major advance regard time series models, is, model focus regularity data base less extent economic theory.5 increasingly powerful computer play important role context. they enable u make advance time-consuming calculations.6 structural macro model base great extent micro base theory household corporate behaviour. for example assume model various market imperfection combine nominal real rigidities. the agent model also rational expectations, is, use information available best possible way make decisions. this type model usually refer research literature generic term new keynesian dsge models.7 the method develop close cooperation academic researcher economist central bank exchange idea experiences. the riksbank develop macro model swedish economy at riksbank develop dynamic macro model swedish economy know ramses.8 this so-called general equilibrium model belong group new keynesian dsge models. general mean try explain whole economy merely particular section it, private consumption labour market. the fact equilibrium model mean assume market mechanism create balance supply demand different market economy. ram currently use make forecasts, interpret economic development calculate effect monetary policy, example. some area yet well develop ramses. this includes, example, fiscal policy credit market. we therefore use partial model focus certain individual variable complement ramses. we also use so-called bayesian var models. a var model system equations, use instance capture average variation macro data.9 in 5 in academic research model usually call model reduce form. 6 for review result model forecast performance see adolfson et al (2007a). 7 dsge stand dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. 8 ram stand riksbank’s aggregate macro model study economy sweden. for detail description see adolfson et al (2007b). 9 var stand vector autoregressive model. bi review 77/2008 3 bayesian var model form subjective information prior estimation used, instance high long-term sustainable growth rate is. in general, ahead look, importance give economic theory assumption long-term equilibrium ram bayesian var models. to gain impression current situation swedish economy instead use different time series model indicator models. these use make forecast 1-2 quarter ahead. the forecast use start value large macro models. of course also substantial element assessment comprise probable development economy throughout entire process. material assessment forecast come many source on whole, use official statistic result survey authority statistic sweden national institute economic research counterpart countries. we also closely follow assessment make forecaster sweden abroad regularly evaluate forecast performance. we also bring back new impression many international meet regularly attend. in addition, riksbank begin carry company surveys. this involve employee visit company around country hear view economic situation. this mean obtain explanation see official statistic capture tendency appear statistics. the process begin discussion risk before i go great detail make forecasts, i would like make general observations. firstly, make forecast continuous process. many u riksbank, executive board member employee different departments, closely monitor economic activity. the increase use model make easy extent update forecast new information received. but make new, thorough coherent assessment new information mean future monetary policy connection monetary policy meetings, hold six time year. another observation executive board collective involve forecast process year ago. this largely choose publish forecast repo rate. i shall return shortly. a third observation concern logic process. we try deal independent monetary policy early stage. sweden small, open economy, international forecast settle without take account may late crystallise well-balanced swedish monetary policy. the current situation swedish economy also largely independent executive board determine next meeting, take time monetary policy effect economy inflation. but please note relatively broad definition "current situation”. the national account publish lag almost one quarter. they important source statistic regard real economy. this mean often know start outcome economy previous quarter. this mean assessment must make previous quarter current quarter. we use various indicator publish monthly basis make assessment. so actual process make forecasts? it usually start around eight week monetary policy meet (see figure 1). this case monetary policy report go published; otherwise process slightly shorter. in total, around 30 4 bi review 77/2008 economist involve phase forecast work, together executive board members. the material monetary policy meet mainly produce monetary policy department close cooperation executive board. the process begin risk meeting. the participant meet executive board, employee monetary policy department, employee department adviser executive board. the purpose meet capture early stage various type risk alternative sequence event economy envisage future. the discussion meet relatively unbiased take broad perspective. it meet alternative scenario begin take shape, late describe chapter 2 monetary policy report show economy might develop particular event occur. the scenario use kind counter-example explain executive board consider main scenario one present give well-balanced monetary policy. it also illustrate different risk individual member wish illustrate perhaps even scenario one person prefer instead main scenario. our experience work different scenario make easy u executive board member agree main scenario majority u support. the result present something call first large monetary policy group meeting. this meet hold roughly third week eight-week long forecast process. of course, also capacity produce new alternative scenario late process necessary. bi review 77/2008 5 several different meet lead main scenario prior first large monetary policy group meet number meet hold within monetary policy department. the executive board member invite intend meetings, mainly intend work meet economists. the discussion often relatively detail technical level. it meet forecast main scenario begin take shape. the main scenario development consider probable describe chapter 1 monetary policy report. important new statistic new event sweden abroad present analyse meetings. there also comparison development relate early assessments. the purpose gain impression current status economy. for small, open economy like sweden natural starting-point forecast work economic activity inflation develop world around us. the forecast work therefore begin international outlook meeting, purpose reach preliminary forecast international events. soon financial market meet held. at meet discussion market participants’ expectation repo rate change since previous monetary policy meeting. these compare model forecast repo rate changed. in addition, analysis discussion happen financial market since previous assessment. house prices, credits, stock market rates, exchange rates, money supply, international rate also discuss meeting. after current status meet held, focus current situation swedish economy. one particularly important aspect ass much swedish economy’s total resource form labour machinery currently use normal extent. apart new information current economic situation, also discussion new information may important forecast slightly long term. the first monetary policy group meet executive board summarise new information after time first large monetary policy group meeting. the entire executive board member monetary policy department take part meeting. in addition, number adviser executive board employee financial stability department usually take part. a summary new information current status economy sweden abroad present meeting. we also run alternative scenario order risk meet week early discus whether really capture risk executive board member envisage. we also opportunity meet request information various issue consider important come decision. the meet usually take around three hours. monetary policy department establish forecast at approximately time meet executive board, monetary policy department establish view macroeconomic development come three years. in preliminary stage focus around ten key variable inflation, interest rates, gdp, number hour worked, exchange rate resource utilisation. the forecast produce basis exogenous conditions, international forecasts, model forecast swedish economy conditional current situation assessments. the forecast interest rate path produce monetary policy department mean reflect executive board’s normal, historical behaviour. it 6 bi review 77/2008 form recommendation department. all discuss macro forecast meet monetary policy department. when overall macroeconomic picture established, economist chisel different point forecast detail. for instance, make complete forecast component balance resource labour market. finally check overall picture ensure different part forecast hold together add correctly. in total, economist forecast around fifty variables. all compile internal document summarise department’s view inflation economic activity develop future. another document also created, explain forecast affect model result assessments. none executive board member take part stage. the idea product report u far possible civil servants’ product. it influence idea different executive board members. the civil servant thus hold relatively strong position process. the executive board’s main contribution get involve detail forecast – instead shall highlight different perspective broaden analysis. the fact civil servant produce draft forecast also contribute strengthen maintain internal competence. the executive board discus forecast second large meet the monetary policy department present forecast main scenario executive board second large monetary policy group meeting. this take place week five, is, approximately three week prior monetary policy meeting. the organisation meet differ first one. the meet divide two parts. the first part meet open majority employee monetary policy department. the civil servant report outlook economy come years. they present result in-depth report order executive board. there opportunity u executive board member ask question express opinion forecast different sector experts. the second part meet hold small circle consist executive board, senior staff monetary policy department, couple adviser representative communication secretariat. it executive board discus express opinion main scenario basis assessments. this may sometimes mean give different weight alternative macroeconomic scenarios, is, risks. the main scenario adjust accordance view executive board. in situation forecasts, include interest rate forecasts, may regard well-founded guess main scenario receive support majority executive board member week later. but still possibility executive board make change forecasts. the executive board also ask civil servant provide in-depth report follow certain issues. these present 1-2 day late follow-up meet executive board. here i would like take opportunity refer current round forecasts. on monday discuss swedish macroeconomic outlook second large monetary policy group meeting. this mean executive board member enter intense phase monetary policy process. the decision-making situation spring one hand concern rise inflation hand sign slowdown economic activity. in respect outcome sweden slightly bad anticipate april monetary policy update. the inflation figure may 0.4 percentage point high forecast april. a large part deviation due energy price increase expected. at time, growth lower. the national account first quarter year show gdp growth 2.2 per cent, 0.6 percentage point le forecast april. in principle, face type problem deliberations, is, bi review 77/2008 7 rise inflationary pressure weak economic activity. the way executive board member finally decide balance factor new information receive something return monetary policy meet 2 july. we six board member come week person finally form opinion economy develop future monetary policy require attain inflation target time avoid excessive fluctuation real economy. material rework monetary policy report after second large monetary policy group meet monetary policy department continue work compile first draft monetary policy report. the department close contact executive board. a formal executive board meet hold week second meet focus forecasts. the editorial work monetary policy report continue regularly check member executive board. a day prior monetary policy meet another formal executive board meet go text report detail report tabled. however, forecast change late monetary policy meeting. it monetary policy meet text forecast monetary policy report finally determined. the executive board make interest rate decision majority vote the executive board hold six monetary policy meet year. if necessary meet often. the number meet stipulate law, determine u executive board members. we make decision current level repo rate monetary policy meetings. we also agree interest rate path appropriate present time. the decision make majority vote, chairman executive board cast vote, announce press release. in addition executive board members, number employee monetary policy department communication secretariat take part meeting, well adviser legal advisers. in addition, chairman vice chairman general council regularly take part meet thus obtain good insight work executive board. they right express opinions, put forward proposal take part decisions. in total, around 20 person usually present meeting. what happen monetary policy meeting? there agenda state order discus different items. the meet usually begin brief update financial market developed, include market expectation repo rate regard meeting, new, important information receive last days. this follow summary main element monetary policy report monetary policy update. after introductory word civil servants, i colleague go discus economic development come three years. first deal economic activity inflation abroad sweden. each person put forward view current economic situation interest rate need adjust attain inflation target. there predetermine order begin discussion. the discussion fairly free stage. during course process one u form opinion, course formal decision make actual meeting. the chairman executive board usually conclude summarise discussion hold 8 bi review 77/2008 proposal put forward regard current interest rate. after move decision vote. to give general public insight decision-making process make easy ass activities, take minute meet bank publishes. a summer 2007, also write member’s name minutes. the minute publish around two week monetary policy meeting. interest rate decision announce day monetary policy meet a press release publish day monetary policy meeting. this contain important reason consideration behind majority decision. the press release also contain riksbank’s forecast economic activity inflation description monetary policy currently consider well balanced. in connection publication interest rate decision also hold press conference journalist give opportunity ask questions. in connection three monetary policy meet monetary policy report published. on occasion short monetary policy update publish instead. this contain limit number forecast central macro variables. that say, majority view reflect press release reports. any difference opinion see minute monetary policy meetings. there state detail member argue voted. but minute publish majority line apply executive board member make speech outside riksbank. after member free describe personal difference opinion regard interest rate decision. constant assessment mean always prepare change let round off. today i talk major change recent year way produce material use base interest rate decisions. some come method make forecast general developed, something also affect central banks. other change shape specific condition apply sweden. the riksbank’s independent position make demand u open clear, economist usually term transparency. the riksbank’s decision begin publish forecast repo rate step work increase transparency improve analysis.10 the new assumption repo rate lead executive board become involve forecast process. we constantly evaluate forecast see successful capture developments. this also mean constantly strive improve way working. if make major

banker phillips curve framework speech mr donald l kohn, vice chairman board governor u federal reserve system, federal reserve bank boston's annual economic conference “understanding inflation implication monetary policy: a phillips curve retrospective”, chatham, massachusetts, 11 june 2008. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * an economic model inflation indispensable input monetary policy deliberations. a model phillips curve tradition remain core academic researcher policymakers – include one – think fluctuation inflation; indeed, alternative framework seem lack solid economic foundation empirical support. but modern phillips curve differ substantially version use several decade ago; policymakers academic alike attune importance expectations, possibility structural change, uncertainty surround understand dynamic wage price adjustment. moreover, link inflation resource utilization often emphasize phillips curve framework account modest part inflation fluctuations. my comment today focus lesson recent research phillips curve help think influence fluctuation price commodities, oil, outlook inflation appropriate policy response developments.1 policy objective framework analyze inflation fluctuation the federal reserve charge pursuit price stability maximum employment. price stability uniquely control central bank long periods, prerequisite economy perform efficiently time. the welfare cost inflation result many factors: potential cost household firm result effort insure inflation confusion regard real nominal prices; distortion financial system relate inflation; imperfect indexation taxation, especially capital income, relate distortion economic activity; cost associate slow adjustment nominal price wages. the cost inflation imply central bank aim low measure inflation. moreover, many cost inflation – associate misconception regard inflation, effort insure inflation, distortion financial system – associate rate change entire set price good service face household firms, suggest measure inflation gauge rate change broad set prices. accordingly, federal open market committee (fomc) emphasize gauge price stability long-term behavior overall personal consumption expenditure price index. the economic framework help think fluctuation inflation base substantial body research model price dynamic develop past five decades. at heart, framework base importance sluggish adjustment (some) nominal wage price change economic conditions. this sluggishness undoubtedly reflect number factors, include cost adjust 1 michael kiley, board's staff, contribute remarks. the view express necessarily colleague board governor federal open market committee. bi review 76/2008 1 nominal price wages, imperfect information regard shift economic conditions, learn firm household structure economy, include set monetary policy. regardless source, presence sluggish nominal adjustment bring fore three key element drive wage price dynamics: inflation expectations, supply shocks, resource utilization. because price wage adjust infrequently, firm household anticipate future erosion real price wage incorporate expectation inflation current price set wage demands. a result, inflation expectation play critical role formation monetary policy. moreover, tendency price adjust quickly change circumstance conjunction sluggish adjustment price wage imply large, sharp price movements, change price oil, lead relative price distortion throughout economy; distortion imply relative price shock important implication function economy.2 finally, fluctuation resource utilization, effect cost production firms' desire markup costs, significant determinant price wage decisions. the link resource utilization inflation provide major channel monetary policy set influence inflation: adjustment policy interest rate bring change resource utilization, influence current expect inflation. inflation forecast commodity price shock the economic outlook prime focus monetary policy. because stance policy influence economic activity inflation lag, policymakers must adjust policy minimize cost fluctuation activity inflation future. the phillips curve framework important input forecast inflation. i focus specifically shock price oil affect inflation outlook within framework. this topic especially salient late – commodity price general, perhaps glaringly price oil, rise sharply past year; indeed, oil price rise sharply four years. consider sharp rise price oil primarily reflect shift balance demand supply global market oil.3 in first instance, high oil price lead increase overall level consumer prices. when think outlook future inflation, useful distinguish oil prices. the significant factor determine oil price current prospective balance demand supply. the aggregate behavior prices, consist large set nominal price wage adjust slowly, drive factor enter phillips curve – inflation expectations, resource utilization, supply shock (in case, shock price oil). in forecast context, phillips curve framework motivate reduced-form regression rate inflation consumer price exclude food energy proxy 2 relative price shock act like supply shock phillips curve framework two reasons. first, price sluggish others flexible, phillips curve framework focus adjustment sluggish prices. second, price likely adjust large shocks, skewness distribution relative price disturbance fluctuate substantially, give rise shock phillips curve. ball mankiw (1995) discus issue argue second type relative price shock quantitatively important. 3 the rise broad range commodity prices, occur time time recently, would affect basic analysis rest contrast behavior flexible sluggishly adjust prices. however, simultaneous rise many commodity price might suggest strong global aggregate demand play important role, would affect appropriate set monetary policy. see section global demand, trend commodity price monetary policy. 2 bi review 76/2008 key factor. lag value inflation typically proxy inflation expectations. the deviation output potential unemployment rate sustainable rate serf proxy resource utilization. and change relative price energy, food import traditionally include measure supply shocks.4 this type regression among useful tool forecast inflation. nonetheless, forecast record far spotless, hence i consider forecast regression one input help inform outlook inflation. the result exercise imply that, recent history, sharp jump oil price appear modest effect future rate inflation. this result likely reflect two factors. first, commodity like oil represent small share overall cost production, imply magnitude direct pass-through change price price modest, else equal. second, inflation expectation well anchor recent years, contribute mute response inflation oil price shocks. but anchor expectation cannot take given; indeed, type empirical exercise i outline reveal large effect price oil inflation prior last two decades, period inflation expectation well anchor today.5 of course, oil price jump repeatedly recent years. the (relatively) continuous rise energy price since 2003 surprise others, least best i gauge look price embed future contract period. these contract currently suggest price oil flatten period ahead. nonetheless, repeat increase energy price effect overall inflation contribute rise year-ahead inflation expectation households, especially year. of great concern measure longer-term inflation expectation appear edge since last year. any tendency longer-term inflation expectation drift high even fail reverse time would troublesome implication outlook inflation. the structural phillips curve, commodity price shocks, monetary policy the central role inflation expectation imply policymakers must look beyond type reduced-form exercise guidance. after all, lag inflation reduced-form regression imperfect proxy inflation expectations. a emphasize robert lucas's critique reduced-form phillips curve 30 year ago, structural model need confidence effect shock outlook inflation economic activity.6 4 the amount relate literature large. the article robert gordon (1998) represent good example relevant consider notion supply shock generally. stock watson (1999) present broad interpretation empirical phillips curve large number macroeconomic indicator use forecast inflation. 5 these factor two contribute low effect oil price inflation. for example, energy intensity economy fall time. research like hooker (2002) subsequent work discuss various possibility detail. blanchard gali (2007) suggest seemingly mute affect change price oil inflation recent year result fall energy intensity, flexible labor markets, good monetary policy, good luck. 6 see lucas (1976). robert lucas emphasize importance structural model phillips curve well 1976 article; example, see contribution conference wage price dynamic hold federal reserve 1970 (lucas, 1972). michael woodford (1994) present important critique research commodity prices, inflation, monetary policy role lucas critique central: in particular, re-emphasize tendency commodity price forecast inflation may structural could break alternative policy regime – tendency seem bi review 76/2008 3 the importance structural relationship input monetary policy process pose challenge; instance, many "structural" model nominal price wage adjustment, model emphasize different friction imperfection therefore different policy implications, empirical work reach different conclusion regard merit alternative models.7 a result, policymakers must look lesson common across alternative specification base policy current understand likely important structural factors. fortunately, i think many model nominal price wage adjustment imply similar conclusion regard influence commodity price inflation outlook appropriate response monetary policy. i focus sharp jump price oil, reflect supply demand market oil. because many nominal price wage costly slow adjust, efficient allocation resource impede transition period relative price signal distorted. for example, price energy-intensive good need rise relative less-energy-intensive goods, adjustment follow gradual asynchronous pattern. similarly, equilibrium real wage – relative price labor – tend depress oil price shock due accompany adverse movement term trade reduction labor productivity, need wage price adjustment proceed gradually.8 an efficient monetary policy attempt facilitate need economic adjustment minimize distortion economic efficiency path achieving, time, dual objective price stability maximum employment.9in particular, appropriate monetary policy follow jump price oil allow, temporary basis, increase unemployment increase price inflation. by pursue action balance deleterious effect oil price employment inflation near term, policymakers are, essence, attempt find prefer point activity/inflation variance-tradeoff curve introduce john taylor 30 year ago.10 such policy action promote efficient adjustment relative prices: since real wage need fall price wage adjust slowly, efficient adjustment relative price tend include bite additional price inflation bite additional unemployment time, lead increase real wage temporarily trend establish productivity gains. i emphasize course policy i describe take inflation expectation given. in practice, important ensure policy action anchor inflation expectations. this anchor critical: a demonstrate historical experience around world unite state 1970s 1980s, effort bring inflation inflation expectation back desirable level rise appreciably involve costly undesirable change resource utilization.11 a result, degree confirm mark hooker (2002) work document break link oil price inflation recent decades. 7 for example, rudd whelan (2007) kiley (2007) review number model empirical study well conduct empirical analyses; two study reach quite different conclusion merit alternative specifications. 8 for example, see article chao wei (2003) illustrate effect rise oil price dynamic equilibrium model. 9 erceg, henderson, levin (2000) discus importance relative price adjustment presence sluggish nominal price wage general context; mankiw real (2003) present relate results. bodenstein, erceg, guerrieri (2007) apply reason oil price shocks. 10 see taylor (1979). 11 ball (1994) present estimate cost disinflation variety countries, include unite states. kiley (2008) provide evidence survey measure inflation expectation unite state respond economic development present model attempt explain pattern data. 4 bi review 76/2008 deviation inflation long-run objective tolerate allow efficient relative price adjustment i describe need temper ensure longer-term inflation expectation affect significant extent. global demand, trend commodity prices, monetary policy my remark far concentrate factor guide monetary policy response shock price commodity like oil stem shift balance supply demand specific market commodities. some might think focus miss point current context, least two reasons. first, suggest run-up price broad range commodity price reflects, part, global excess demand rather sector-specific forces. and second, suggest important commodity prices, like oil, may significant upward trend currently embed future prices. it seem highly likely that, period since 2003, rise commodity price reflect strong global economic growth well sector-specific factors, geopolitical tension disruption supply oil.12 in regard, i share view express chairman bernanke conference two day ago discuss range factor likely influence relative commodity prices.13 however, fact rise relative commodity price likely reflect many factor not, itself, change analytical framework i use frame policy deliberations. a i highlight begin remarks, important driver inflation model inflation dynamic i use relative price shocks, inflation expectations, balance aggregate demand supply unite states, measure notion resource utilization. if shift global demand affect commodity price demand u.s. goods, model i mind account influence inflation relative price shock resource utilization. for example, rise price oil year low consumption demand pinch households' real income likely damp growth labor productivity trim energy input; factor probably contribute low equilibrium real wage, i describe earlier. if impact demand factor accompany strong global demand boost demand u.s. good generally, forecast inflation would need take account. in event, resource utilization slackening, judge rise unemployment rate slow pace economic growth unite states, average, past six nine months. some suggest price oil significant upward trend currently appreciated.14 such unanticipated shift trend would embed anticipate rate change slowly adjust nominal price wages, imply adjustment period distortion relative price would follow. moreover, would likely orphanides williams (2005) present model perpetual learn lead fluctuation inflation expectation various horizon provide example alternative monetary policy set influence course inflation expectations, thereby illustrate importance interaction expectation formation efficient monetary policy. 12 with regard oil prices, bodenstein, erceg, guerrieri (2008) discus effect price oil u.s. economy shock various factor theoretical model; kilian (2007) provide empirical analysis. more generally, area remain fertile field future research. 13 see bernanke (2008). 14 one might question whether significant price trend reasonably anticipate storable commodity like oil. the price commodity reflect expect demand "anticipated" increase limit approximately cost storage, include nominal interest rate. still, follow discussion would also apply shift trend important subset consumer prices. bi review 76/2008 5 upward pressure overall inflation period, reflect slow response rate change nominal price new trend price oil. this tendency high overall inflation could risk rise inflation expectations. an appropriate monetary policy response would share many characteristic i discuss earlier. in particular, bring overall inflation immediately back low rate consistent price stability could associate much high rate unemployment short time. it may efficient allow adjustment period overall inflation exceed desire low level unemployment rate high long-run sustainable level; before, set policy manner balance undesirable effect shock system inflation employment tend efficient set policy deliver extreme outcome either inflation unemployment.15however, two additional consideration likely important consider shift trend. first, development inflation expectation follow significant shift relative price trend commodity like oil monitor carefully, understand change long-run inflation expectation limit shift trend infrequent, potentially imply great chance confusion relative price trend overall inflation. second, important remember cost inflation excess low rate measure inflation consistent price stability extend period significant reflect broad range factors. a i emphasize earlier, economic research many cost inflation suggest cost associate rate change

76/2008 7 caleb m fundanga: narrow zambia’s investment gap sustainable development keynote address dr caleb m fundanga, governor bank zambia, euro-money zambia investment conference “narrowing zambia’s investment gap sustainable development”, lusaka, 10 june 2008. * * * 1.0 introduction over recent past, zambian economy perform relatively well. this reflect positive growth rate real gross domestic product (gdp), low inflation, relative stability exchange rate kwacha major currencies, stable financial sector improve bank services. the recent impressive economic trend suggest reform programme pursue work bear fruit. these reform focus restructure economy, let market determine prices, shift production decision government private sector provide enable environment increase investment. this lead stable macroeconomic environment provide basis growth. however, challenge still remain meet basic need zambian order uplift live standards. equally, economy still low save need finance development activity therefore need foreign capital expand productive capacity create job contribute uplift people’s live standards. zambia country abundant natural resource human capital. it centrally locate country eight neighbour country close proximity large market south africa, surface area 750,000 sq km, approximate population 11 million people. it also boast suitable climate, peace multi-party competitive democratic political system. the country posse necessary attribute sustainable economic growth development. competitive production costs, incentives, reform also enhance attractive investment climate local foreign investors. numerous investment opportunity exist amongst agriculture, manufacturing, tourism mine sector across various region country. almost province zambia remain potential area investment whose resource remain largely untapped. it active participation sadc trade protocol comesa/fta offer preferential tariff access market potential nearly 380 million people. the zambian development agency (zda) act ensure property right fully respect full compensation market value make case expropriation. the country also signatory multilateral investment guarantee agency world bank guarantee foreign investment protection case disaster disturbances. bilateral investment treaty number country also encourage, promote protect foreign investment. foreign investor seek joint venture partner approach zda register investor together project profile domestic investor seek collaboration. 2.0 recent economic development 2.1 real gross domestic product (gdp) during period 2001-2007, growth real gross domestic product (gdp) average 5.1% per annum, largely due investment mining, tourism, construction transport bi review 76/2008 1 agriculture sectors. this set strong basis favourable economic growth medium long-term. thus gdp growth project rise le 7.0% 2008 beyond. consistent development economy, gdp per caput rise u $934.5 2007 u $360.5 2001. 2.2 interest rate commercial banks’ lend rate also declining, though fast reduction inflation treasury bill rates. for instance, commercial bank average lend rate fell 54.6% december 2001 24.4% december 2007. low lend rate expect current environment low inflation contribute reduce cost business zambia. 2.3 inflation inflation decline 18.7% record 2001 single digit level 8.2% 2006 8.9% 2007. it project slow 7.0% december 2008. this inflation outturn largely credit conduct appropriate monetary policy couple prudent fiscal policy relative stability kwacha, assist low food price follow favourable 2005/06 2006/07 farm seasons. 2.4 external sector zambia’s external position continue show remarkable improvement reflect build gross international reserve 3.6 month import cover 2007 0.9 month import cover 2001. preliminary assessment zambia’s surplus trade balance rise u $983.1 million compare deficit u $342.2 million 2001. similarly, current account deficit percentage gdp reduce 4.4% 2007 19.1% 2001. this outturn mainly attribute high receipt increase copper export follow increase production record high price international market due strong demand mainly china. couple this, 2000 2007, nontraditional export earn rise 260% us$ 255.7 million 2000 us$ 920.7 million 2007 commodity sugar, copper wire tobacco, couple receipt tourism make notable contributions. in addition, attainment enhance hipc completion point april 2005 multilateral debt relief initiative (mdri) 2006 provide cancellation (imf, ida adb) debt result reduction debt stock u $2.1 billion 2007 end-2001 debt stock u $7.3 billion. the debt relief increase budget support cooperate partner also help strengthen external position. the foreign exchange market liberalised, therefore kwacha determine demand supply condition market. in 2007, kwacha appreciate major international currency exception euro. against u dollar, kwacha appreciate 7.2% compare depreciation 20.7% 2006. this attribute largely high inflow foreign exchange market due increase export receipts, largely reflect high copper price continue participation foreign portfolio investor domestic government security market. the depreciation kwacha euro attribute significant gain euro u dollar major currencies, support mainly relatively buoyant growth prospect euro area. 2 bi review 76/2008 2.5 bank sector environment the overall financial condition performance bank sector satisfactory, reflect adequate capitalisation bank meet minimum regulatory capital requirements. with 13 commercial bank operation comprise local foreign, investment opportunity immense. the government bank zambia continue modernise overall commercial bank environment, endorse various legislation promote safe, sound efficient operation development bank sector financial system whole. this evidence enhance financial stability emergence number financial institution offer array financial services. for example, national payment system act enact june 2007, access bank, fourth large bank nigeria expect open branch country july 2008, raise number commercial bank 14. 2.6 capital market development the lusaka stock exchange perform remarkably well, market capitalisation increase 45.0% k18,872.9 billion compare increase 13.9% 2006. the lusaka all share index almost doubled, rise 92.9% close year 3,533.52 point compare increase 47.7% previous year. this robust performance reflection strong macroeconomic fundamental economy positive investor expectation growth earn prospect list quote companies. government introduce 7, 10 15-year bond help deepen financial market 2007. foreign investment government security rise k830.5 billion december 2007 k539.8 billion record end-december 2005, indication rise confidence economy. 2.7 fiscal development on fiscal front government expect limit domestic borrow 1.2 percent gdp 2008. by reduce level government borrow enforce prudent budget execution, result great mobilisation domestic resource effective coordination monetary authorities. zambia articulate long-term development objective national long term vision 2030, aim raise zambia middle income status 2030. part vision enshrine fifth national development plan (fndp); 2006-2010 whose theme is: “broad base wealth job creation citizenry participation technological advancement”. the growth economy drive increase activity private sector agriculture, mining, export-led manufacture tourism. government support growth accelerate implementation structural reform promote invest key infrastructure roads, energy telecommunication conjunction private sector well improve legal, institutional regulatory frameworks. 3.0 infrastructure development in order consolidate recent economic success realize full potential, zambia need address large infrastructure gap inhibit growth. weak infrastructure as: roads, rail system, airports/airstrips communication barrier reduce ability take advantage good location country has. furthermore investment, particularly rural infrastructure need scale-up significantly. poor infrastructure inadequate access result significantly increase cost business, make difficult integrate rural population rest economy. opportunity investment infrastructure development exist follow sectors: bi review 76/2008 3 3.1 transport communication the generally good land route communication network zambia’s neighbour country encourage southern connections. the government zambia embark process rehabilitate road network, cover 35,168 km. therefore investment opportunity available area road rehabilitation, routine maintenance consultancy. although country international highway link tanzania, democratic republic congo, botswana, zimbabwe, namibia, malawi, mozambique south africa, road accommodate grow traffic due increase trade countries. there large investment potential multiple lane highway cater smooth run traffic increase efficiency trade. further, railway system remain dominant mode transport heavy good local international routes. it also link zambia six african seaport dar e salaam, beira, east london, port elizabeth, durban cape town. the railway system however, require substantial investment upgrade ultra modern facility would allow speedy transportation good product port delivery markets. in air transport, zambia 4 international airport lusaka, livingstone, mfuwe ndola. in order support increase transportation demand good services, need increase capacity exist airport provide direct link country sub-region places. connection country subregion also encourage large commercial airline set country take advantage zambia’s central location. over 97 percent telephone exchange automatic, country enjoy direct dial facilities, fax, e-mail television link rest world. in main urban centres, public telephone independently operate cellular telephone network place. zambia also host zamnet internet service providers. in order continue diversify export base increase export earnings, imperative intensify use market strategy take advantage fact globalisation require country develop efficient mode communication. therefore, inadequate infrastructure, institutional capacity investment skilled human resource continue aggressively address target identify weak areas, implement policy tackle weakness speedily enhance economic growth development prospects. in address issues, crucial build strong partnerships, particularly private sector, effective information communication technology (ict) development zambia. the agriculture sector however, remain one key area advancement icts yet fully take advantage order benefit rural community economy general. in fact, communication infrastructure either lack inadequate rural area zambia give opportunity rural community access distribute information low cost, well facilitate interactive participation creation use agricultural information. the potential benefit well integrate ict agriculture diverse include: • transparent dissemination information weather patterns, seed fertilizer use, availability distribution; • easy accessibility supplier inputs; • common distribution information market price crops; • generally bring together supplier buyer crops. government put agriculture core rural development poverty reduction well employment creation. it therefore important note expansion icts rural community require ever before, information 4 bi review 76/2008 disseminate internet cellular phones. these facility help uplift live standard rural communities. 3.2 agriculture zambia’s agriculture sector enormous potential become major grower exporter agricultural horticultural produce. the country abundance quality land, water (over 40% fresh water resource southern africa) ideal climate suit wide range agricultural products. only 15% zambia’s 60 million hectare arable land cultivation. the recent surge food price world present enormous opportunity zambia become food basket sub region. this achieve re-doubling effort boost agricultural productivity couple substantial increase infrastructure investment ease supply bottleneck push prices. zambia’s irrigation potential estimate 500,000 hectare 40,000 hectare irrigate despite country abundant water resources. increase yield agricultural product like maize, rice wheat, require input fertilizers, irrigation water proper road enable harvest crop transport main market prevent crop losses. 3.3 energy (electricity) abundant investment opportunity exist energy sector view huge power deficit southern africa zambia’s potential hydro-power generation plants. due vast water resource coal reserves, zambia ideal provision hydroelectric power. although electricity supply major hydro stations, also small diesel power station rural areas. there plan develop 600-megawatt hydroelectric generation plant kafue river. currently, development itezhi-tezhi hydro electric project; kafue gorge low hydro-electric project; zambia-tanzania interconnector; zambia-namibia interconnector underway. however, still potential power generation capacity private sector invest in. apart mine sector provide huge demand power country, huge demand power sadc region well eastern african bloc. the expect rise manufacture sector also increase demand power country. opportunity also exist alternative source power solar energy gas energy domestic cookers. with temperature range 15 27 degree part year, solar energy potential high. the oil refinery country also emit gas tap turn gas domestic cookers. 3.4 mine zambia’s mineral wealth remain substantial. quite apart traditional mine activity copper cobalt list investment opportunity sector include: • precious metal-gold; silver; selenium; • the platinoid group – iron, tin, nickel manganese; • agro-minerals-rock phosphate igneous phosphate suitable conversion fertilizer, peat, limestone; • reclaim copper slug tail dumps; • gemstones-emerald, amethyst, aquamarine, tourmaline; • nickel; bi review 76/2008 5 • uranium; • other deposits-talc, fluorspar, graphite, barite clays, etc. the 1995 mine mineral act provide exemption import duty vat machinery equipment, include specialise motor vehicle require prospect mine activities. in 2008 budget, government introduce new fiscal regulatory framework mine sector. under framework, mine sector begin adequately contribute advancement social economic welfare people zambia. 3.5 tourism untapped tourism opportunity exist 19 national park 34 game management area well 23 million hectare devote conservation amaze variety animals. major attraction include victoria fall (one seven natural wonder world) kariba lake (one large man-made lake). specific area investment sector include: • game ranching; • provision accommodation (i.e. high quality five four star hotels, lodge camp site near popular tourist areas); • transport service – investment potential exist air charter form helicopter and/or small plane service game areas; • adventure holiday packages; • organise tours; • out door sport facility (golf course stadia); • zambia’s cultural heritage. 3.6 construction real estate the construction sector yet another area investment economy expands. a lot do recent past construction house scheme come various part country. however, still large deficit term house zambia. this deficit house provide opportunity investment construction houses. 4.0 conclusion look ahead, achievement maintenance low stable inflation rate, remain key enhancement investment, business planning, confidence economy, maintain external competitiveness stabilise people’s incomes. in medium-term, government continue pursue market structural reform partnership private sector view consolidate gain far attain sustain economic growth development. currently, enormous business opportunity still lie unexploited zambia virtually sector economy. the overall economic growth economy would enhance underpin low single digit inflation relative stable exchange rate. with enable environment, private sector would exploit full potential. hence, employment would increase poverty reduction would achieved. this would contribute achievement mdgs towards attainment vision 2030. 6 bi review 76/2008 axel a weber: financial market central bank keynote speech professor axel a weber, president deutsche bundesbank, suerf colloquium “new trend asset management: explore implications”, munich, 12 june 2008. * * * 1 introduction lady gentleman in recent years, see far-reaching structural change global financial markets. financial innovation manifest various ways, prominent grow importance new complex financial instruments, increase significance new business models, especially realm securitisation disintermediation, intensify competition, partly owe consolidation process bank sector, partly owe rise importance relatively new, largely unregulated players, hedge funds, private equity firms, conduit sivs. these remarkable financial development bind alter range activity financial market participant pursue. but also change financial markets’ reaction monetary policy? the start point answer question easy find: monetary policy transmission process. this term describe long, variable uncertain process change central bank’s official interest rate impact first financial market ultimately transmit economy general price level particular. a significant part monetary policy transmission process take place financial markets, go without say recent trend global financial market special interest central banker – would need recent financial market turmoil drive home point. against backdrop, i focus remark today follow three issues. first, recent structural change global financial system alter transmission process monetary policy – and, so, change make central banker’s life – le – difficult? second, central bank help avoid disturbance financial system? this crucial question financial stability precondition effective transmission monetary policy decision real economy. third, financial integration affect monetary policy transmission? specifically, current state affair euro area? 2 financial market monetary policy transmission i shall start general question. to extent recent financial market trend change way monetary policy affect economy price level? this crucial issue. without fair knowledge monetary transmission process, key variable lag involved, central bank face tough job decide official interest rates. for reason, eurosystem closely monitor structural development financial markets. we also try detect financial innovation could modify way change short-term interest rate transmit financial variables, output inflation. without want go much detail, essential point that, come impact recent financial trend monetary policy transmission, several countervail effect play. these countervail effect best capture unravel monetary policy transmission different channels, consider bi review 76/2008 1 individually different way change central bank interest rate affect economic variable – least short term. let focus channel argument prominent euro area. to begin with, interest rate channel. accord exist literature, development deeper, complete competitive financial market seem strengthen pass-through central bank interest rate market interest rates. this put two factors: consolidation bank system, imply emergence (fewer and) large bank thus improve arbitrage opportunity different financial markets, enhance availability alternative capital market-based instrument debt financing. it indeed likely increase competition banks, well bank loan different financial market products, lead close relationship market bank interest rates. consequently, deepen financial market amplify and/or speeded-up effect monetary policy bank interest rate (and, thing equal, financial variables, output inflation). financial development past decade also strengthen balance sheet channel. basically, idea that, economy highly develop mortgage market proliferation mark-to-market account rules, change value collateral wealth great impact economy. in environment, borrowers’ balance sheet tend fluctuate more, lead high volatility amount fund bank will lend household firms. obviously, great change supply credit translate great change consumption investment, thereby strengthen monetary policy transmission. at time, third prominent monetary policy transmission channel, bank lend channel, generally suppose become le important. comparable balance sheet channel, bank lend channel emphasis monetary policy influence aggregate demand interest rates, also impact supply bank loans. whereas balance sheet channel focus availability value collateral necessary borrow operations, bank lend channel refer change banks’ borrowers’ fund possibilities. usually, two reason put forward balance sheet channel weaken late. bank become flexible grow use securitisation improvement risk management. consequently, bank respond flexibly change financial market condition therefore pas every change central bank’s official short-term interest rate. hence, thing equal, effect monetary policy overall loan supply decreased. moreover, financial development broaden banks’ option term respond interest rate changes; also broaden borrowers’ finance opportunities, reduce dependency bank loans. to put argument nutshell, monetary policy seems, balance, gain influence financial market price real economy short run. this confirm exist theoretical empirical literature, which, way, delf much deeply intricacy various transmission channel i able today. in case, bear mind evidence still tentative. a financial development ongoing phenomenon, therefore consider valid current juncture. nonetheless, bottom line that, face great competition among financial intermediaries, financial innovation financial globalisation, monetary policy remain powerful tool deliver price stability. in context, however, essence monetary policy strategy utilise broad-based approach order guarantee robust assessment development economy financial markets. 2 bi review 76/2008 3 financial stability 3.1 financial stability analysis let turn financial stability. a widely accept definition financial stability ability financial system perform key function efficiently, namely, allocation capital risk settlement payment security transactions. these function must fulfil smoothly normal times, also period structural adjustment stress. for obvious reasons, support financial stability important objective central bank – always so. first, note above, monetary policy largely transmit financial market operations. hence, effect monetary policy real economy depend crucially smooth function financial intermediary financial markets. it point financial stability analysis monetary policy analysis closely interlinked. second generally, major macroeconomic objectives, especially price stability sustainable output growth, jeopardise financial system suffer instability. this underline generally high macroeconomic cost financial crises. in addition, aspect gain importance since financial turbulence seem become frequent past decade owe accelerate growth financial transaction great complexity new financial instruments. third, financial stability closely link central bank’s interest prudent design management payment settlement system process currency. the eurosystem, instance, statutory task promote smooth operation payment settlement systems. against background, refer financial stability analysis new trend among central banker would something misnomer. indeed, financial stability analysis anything pass fashion. it has, fact, field research right since mid-1990s. this reflect wide dissemination financial stability reports, produce 50 country worldwide. nonetheless, fair say financial stability analysis still, large extent, work progress. to illustrate point, let outline briefly kind challenge central bank face. to begin with, financial stability easily measured. this hardly surprise as, contrast monetary policy analysis, single indicator (such inflation) observe. similarly, initiative create sort all-encompassing financial stability index fail convince far. instead, concept financial stability involve various financial intermediaries, financial market segment infrastructure, whole host different quantitative qualitative indicator exist. a consequence, determine degree financial stability remain highly complex task. at point, natural suggestion academic outsider would construct theoretical model. such simplify representation reality would help academic single relevant indicator define interrelationship financial market economic variables. however, model-based financial stability analysis still infancy. three issue particularly striking. the feedback effect financial system behaviour real economy difficult model, especially episode stress. currently, macroeconomic model treat key financial system interaction feedback effect rudimentary manner. therefore, “true” cost term real gdp associate systemic risk financial market difficult determine. this significant limitation, give feedback effect play crucial role assess financial system’s vulnerability contagion system-wide stress. bi review 76/2008 3 another principal reason episode stress difficult model lie fact financial instability inherently non-linear. a one consequence non-linearity, risk factor typically normally distributed. instead, distribution characterise fat tails, imply extreme value observe frequently would predict assumption normality. model non-linearities greatly complicate research, indispensable, give central focus financial stability analysis default, contagion spillover effects. a challenge face financial stability analyst lack relevant data. first all, historical time series episode stress rare, luckily. but make even difficult understand financial markets’ behaviour fat tail risk distributions. moreover, generally, data need financial stability analysis still require development. with exception market price regulatory information, limit set data hand timely, comparable satisfactory manner. think, instance, financial intermediaries’ financial report little information available credit risk transfer. therefore, method find handle shift demand data environment financial market constantly undergo change. to sum up, feedback effects, non-linearities handle limit set data prime example numerous challenge encounter financial stability analyst design financial stability models. a consequence, come surprise standard analytical model financial stability yet developped. at present, model often scatter respect risk categories, financial market segment structural regulatory issues. mind you, reason play progress achieve far, contrary. financial stability analysis become sophisticated, bear witness increase number relate work paper conferences. a recent financial market turmoil – trigger recent financial market turbulence, speed spread across global financial market persistence foreseen, conflict statement. far – financial stability analysis aim clairvoyance. instead, likely financial crisis continue emerge spite perceptible progress financial stability analysis. but crucial point impact alleviate warnings, moral suasion – necessary – adjustment institutional regulatory framework. for reason, improvement framework financial stability analysis high priority central banks. 3.2 deal episode financial instability there yet another reason central bank need keep well-informed financial market developments. the turmoil affect global financial market since summer last year example central bank take predominantly passive role analyse comment financial stability, also play active part well. indeed, role central bank crisis management date back 19th century reflect view thornton bagehot. both note central bank – specific condition – provide liquidity bank system lender last resort. and exactly happen crisis u subprime market trigger rapid loss confidence among financial intermediary global scale. a result it, uncollateralised interbank lend mute – reason twofold. on one hand, banks’ willingness lend fall sharply due mount counterparty risks. on other, uncertainty bank face respect longer-term liquidity plan increase considerably. to alleviate ongoing tension interbank money markets, central bank world act liquidity provider last resort bank system. 4 bi review 76/2008 a eurosystem, far stand test challenge environment. owe broad design liquidity operation toolbox, eurosystem’s operational framework change slightly since outbreak financial market turbulence. what more, eurosystem succeed fairly quickly reestablish confidence function euro money market promptly inject additional fund temporary basis. we shall continue provide liquidity flexibly – seem warrant give ongoing tension euro money market, including, especially, longer-term sector. although recently identifiable sign ease several financial market segments, still early give all-clear. specifically, still elevate level money market spread underline fact room complacency. in context, i would like stress two points. in eurosystem, strictly separate management aggregate liquidity condition determination monetary policy stance. hence, decide interest rates, primary objective govern council (and continue be) price stability. against background continue persistently strong upside risk price stability, govern council state heighten alertness readiness act. moreover, strict separation make clear eurosystem intentionally directly offer sort ex post insurance financial market participant engage excessive risk-taking. this intend limit moral hazard large extent. apart this, seem appropriate point that, free market economy, central banks’ liquidity support must always confine transitional period. in words, medium run, central bank intervention cannot substitute need financial intermediary regain confidence gradually. at top list requirements, i would like see financial intermediary try enhance transparency regard credit market risk exposure also, necessary, raise capital adjust business models. furthermore, essential financial intermediary convince investor financial system whole capable manage risk adequately set continuously change financial market trends. finally, take step back crisis management, recent financial market turmoil underscore need crisis prevention strengthened. this exactly take place moment. national, european international forum organisation currently put lot effort identify lesson learned. there various initiative way, particularly important recommendation make financial stability forum implement rapidly effectively. the implementation recommendations, include disclosure standard risk management, major step forward enhance resilience international financial system. 4 financial integration euro area if i governor central bank whose currency area coincide boundary financial markets, i could end speech brief summary. however, governor central bank integral part eurosystem, yet another topic cover: financial integration. it generally accept that, currency union, well-integrated financial market facilitate implementation single monetary policy. there three aspect worth mentioning. first, currency union work smoothly, integrate national financial market are. indeed, financial integration help individual emu member state absorb country-specific shock easily. the reason diversify source national income easy borrow abroad, le consumption investment need follow fluctuation national output. hence, national consumption bi review 76/2008 5 investment level insulate domestic macroeconomic shock via cross-border risk sharing. second, financial integration strengthen stability euro area financial system – macro economy general. basically, well-integrated financial system, risk tend diversify cross-border scale lead financial intermediaries, market infrastructure become resilient idiosyncratic shocks. have say that, integrate financial market arguably broaden scope spillover effect across border – manifest recent u subprime crisis. third, i already state eurosystem’s task include smooth operation payment settlement system – closely link progress financial integration. there abundance evidence launch euro major catalyst financial integration euro area. in general, financial integration advance market segment close single monetary policy. this particularly visible unsecured money market, almost perfectly integrate right start emu, measure low cross-country standard deviation average overnight lend rate among euro area countries. moreover, euro significantly reduce home bias euro area bond equity markets, albeit vary degrees. principally, financial integration progress government bond market least advance equity markets. have say that, percentage cross-border hold bond equity euro area grow past ten years. in addition, bond market yield share price increasingly drive common euro area factors, although local factor continue play role. these development support elimination currency risk within euro area, high demand large pool investors, – far bond issue small member state company concern – reduction liquidity premium domestic-currency debt. in essence, however, development reflect high degree substitutability among bond equity issue various government corporation across euro area. let also highlight fact recent financial market turbulence undo process financial integration euro area. true, euro area sovereign spread vis-à-vis german benchmark increase substantially. moreover, cross-border country cross-sector dispersion euro area equity return rise since second half 2007. both example indicate national factor market dynamic asset price regain importance time financial market tensions. but scale happen still small comparison major development past ten years. a already noted, financial integration euro area proceed pace across sector markets. integration retail bank markets, instance, remain limited, reflect persistence legal, institutional cultural differences. this show financial integration euro area dependent close market segment monetary policy, also far relevant market infrastructure become integrated. a case point high degree integration large-value payment system euro area. they make possible

target2-securities project provide pan-european security settlement platform. these innovation demonstrate eurosystem attache great importance promote financial integration euro area. 6 bi review 76/2008 5 conclude remark lady gentlemen, wide-ranging overview change relationship central bank financial markets. i hope give flavour importance financial stability, financial market development financial integration monetary policy implementation. financial market always field vital interest eurosystem, certainly, recent financial market turmoil spur effort cop period financial stress, conduct financial market research, support integration euro area financial markets. first foremost, however, eurosystem contribute safeguard financial stability maintain price stability euro area medium term. thank attention. bi review 76/2008 7 axel a weber: financial market monetary policy speech professor axel a weber, president deutsche bundesbank, university constance, constance, 25 june 2008. * * * 1 introduction lady gentleman it great pleasure here, university constance, i study economics 30 year ago. when i finish studies, university’s postgraduate study programme “international economic relations” yet launched. in retrospect, i think many interest topic study late 70 early 80s. think two oil price crisis 1970s great inflation usa. in fact, topic worryingly relevant today – even though background story different one theoretical empirical insight advance significantly. i would therefore like come back issue late i also able talk current monetary policy stance eurosystem. before so, however, i would like focus yet another topic: financial market central banks. my choice seem natural one give extent global financial market characterise turmoil volatility past 11 months. indeed, begin fairly contain deterioration (relatively small) us-subprime market august last year rapidly develop severe test stability global financial system. financial market perform indispensable task economic welfare. they provide service product intertemporal allocation save investment accomplished. a such, financial market stability precondition macroeconomic stability economic growth. in addition, monetary policy largely transmit real economy price level financial market operations. it therefore come surprise central bank always keen interest financial market developments. and, certainly, need recent financial market turmoil drive home point. i choose two topical question guide follow remarks: first, underlie cause recent financial market turmoil? second, central bank help avoid disturbance financial system? 2 the underlie cause recent financial market turmoil when look underlie cause recent tension global financial system, one particular development blame clear cause? in fact, numerous culprit put forward: securitisation, quality risk management, credit rat agencies, compensation schemes, account standard – name few. against background, i extremely sceptical monocausal explanations. instead, i believe cocktail various ingredient trigger shock wave financial system. many ingredient recipe stem innovation financial intermediation or, precise, combination new complex instrument transfer credit risk “originate distribute” business model. the disruption previous month highlight increase complexity credit risk transfer (crt) instruments. this would le problematic risk management system financial intermediary keep pace change characteristic financial landscape. however, did. at time, investor base become diffuse, participant recent entrant crt markets. all suggest several investor may fully appreciate higher-risk nature crt product therefore overly optimistic assessment risk involved. bi review 82/2008 1 a probably know, securitisation activity promote “originate distribute” model large bank security firms. on positive note, securitising, tranching trade credit risk lead fairly broad risk dispersion. but become clear “originate distribute” model actually improve resilience financial system high-quality standard maintain level transfer process new concentration risk arise. the past years, however, characterise series distort incentive manifest lax origination standard product subprime mortgage excessive reliance credit rat investors. a final point, let add that, end day, “originate distribute” model lead – rather unexpectedly – huge reintermediation credit risk banks’ balance sheets. in words, financial market turmoil demonstrate remove asset bank balance sheet mean bank long expose risk associate them. hence, risk management system reconsider view reputational risk, credit guarantee credit line off-balance-sheet entity structure investment vehicle conduits. in nutshell, securitisation, claudio borio aptly put 2008, has, end, “distributed fear rather risks”. however, financial innovation undoubtedly increase vulnerability global financial system, present financial market turmoil meet eye casual observer. the proliferation structure finance product “originate distribute” model would arguably possible without benign economic financial backdrop notably robust global economic growth, low inflation, low level interest rates, low default rate rise asset price many countries, usa. this goldilocks economy, condition neither “too cold” “too hot”, – side effect – mask gradual build-up financial imbalances. hence, lend risk-taking experience rapid growth, word warn central bank institution largely disregard basis “this time, development surely different past”. the fact minor financial market tension spring 2005 2006 leave financial market le unscathed reinforce impression. once, however, vulnerability global financial system reveal august last year financial imbalance start unwinding, witness scene change considerably. 3 financial stability analysis central bank for time now, much talk financial stability respective role central banks, i would like address topic here. a widely accept definition financial stability ability financial system perform key function efficiently – namely, allocation capital risk settlement payment security transactions. these function must fulfil smoothly normal time also period structural adjustment stress. stable financial system reduce uncertainty therefore develop positive external effect real economy, thereby contribute great economic prosperity. however, reverse also true: instability financial system negative external effect therefore cause high economic costs. contribute financial stability thus part central bank’s core area responsibility, order ensure price stability avert negative repercussion financial system real economy. just year ago, observer question view, call temporary “fad” even dismiss result central banks’ search new responsibility – voice silence obvious reasons. indeed, financial stability analysis anything pass fashion. it establish field research right since mid-1990s, financial stability issue boost 2 bi review 82/2008 financial globalisation acceleration financial innovation. this reflect wide dissemination financial stability reports, central bank produce 50 country worldwide. i would therefore like give brief overview kind challenge central bank face embark financial stability analysis. it start fact financial stability easily measured. this hardly surprise as, contrast monetary policy analysis, single indicator (such inflation) observe. similarly, initiative create sort all-encompassing financial stability index fail convince far. instead, concept financial stability involve various financial intermediaries, financial market segment infrastructure, whole host different quantitative qualitative indicator exist. a consequence, determine degree financial stability remain highly complex task. moreover, construct theoretical model conduct model-based financial stability analysis still infancy. one particular difficulty lie model period stress. to begin with, modeller face lack relevant data historical time series episode stress rare, luckily. more generally, difficult capture behaviour financial market participant affect feedback effect financial system real economy. in many cases, shock financial system amplify interrelationship financial market economic variables. for instance without reference present situation euro area, if, period financial turbulence, financial intermediary experience widespread process deleveraging, credit crunch mechanism might come play could drive big second-round effect economy and, turn, cause loss bank sector. how model feedback effect consistently still open issue. another significant limitation assess financial system’s vulnerability contagion system-wide stress fact financial instability inherently non-linear. a one consequence non-linearity, risk factor typically normally distributed. instead, distribution characterise fat tails, imply extreme value observe frequently would predict assumption normality. model non-linearities greatly complicate research, indispensable, give central focus financial stability analysis default, contagion spillover effects. to sum up, come surprise standard analytical model financial stability yet developed. at present, model often scatter respect risk categories, financial market segment structural regulatory issues. mind you, reason play progress achieve far. on contrary. financial stability analysis become sophisticated, bear witness increase number relate work paper conferences. a recent financial market turmoil, central bank (and institutions) frequently good time warn many aspects, notably excessive risk-taking general underprice risk. however, trigger recent financial market turbulence, speed spread across global financial market persistence foreseen, conflict statement. far – financial stability analysis aim clairvoyance. instead, likely financial crisis continue emerge spite perceptible progress financial stability analysis. but crucial point impact alleviate warnings, moral suasion – necessary – adjustment institutional regulatory framework. right now, national, european international institution forum put lot effort identify lesson learned. in international context, notably, analysis recommendation financial stability forum recently publish “principles sound liquidity risk management supervision” basel committee bank supervision deserve close attention. they important step forward make international financial system resilient. bi review 82/2008 3 4 the eurosystem’s current monetary policy stance even though financial stability vital interest eurosystem, primary objective maintenance price stability euro area. during past ten years, eurosystem live mandate. since inception euro, annual inflation euro area has, average, remain close vicinity 2% (at 2.05% precise), marginally eurosystem’s benchmark price stability. recently, however, euro-area inflation accelerated, remain 3% past seven month reach worry record high 3.7% may. this confirm current upward pressure euro-area inflation, result largely sharp increase energy food price global level, rather persistent. on face it, present inflationary pattern seem bear resemblance 1970s. not inflation unusually high many country oil price increase occur gradually past year comparable real term 1970s. furthermore, economic growth slow global scale, even though, far euro area concerned, expect remain robust, certainly le dynamic quarter ahead. on close observation, however, several caveat worth mentioning. they might explain present oil price shock far le damage 1970s. first, oil intensity decrease substantially past 30 year consequence decline relative weight energy-intensive industrial sector industrialise country grow ecological awareness. second, whereas shock 1970s cause mainly sizeable disruption oil supply, present episode largely drive unexpectedly buoyant demand oil, particularly rapidly grow emerge market country – notably china. the late price hikes, however, primarily relate supply-side factors. the third, arguably important, difference today 1970s accumulate advance theory monetary policy making. monetary theory long see inflation by-product real-sector force largely outside control central bank. on contrary, long run inflation generally believe monetary phenomenon. therefore, widespread agreement substantial benefit price stability central bank independence, forward-looking nature monetary policy need credibility commitment. give change monetary policy, re-emergence inflationary wage-price spiral characteristic 1970s appear le likely. but even difference 1970s reassuring, room complacency. first, oil price hike strongly persistently generally anticipated. their present level real term even surpass 1970s. in addition, uncertainty surround future oil price development greatly complicate accurate forecast inflation therefore pose challenge monetary policy. second, apprehension grow inflation expectation rise. in euro area, chiefly true short-term medium-term inflation expectations, cover policy-relevant time horizon monetary policy. by contrast, medium longer-term inflation expectation best indicator public confidence central bank credibility move significantly. this especially true survey-based measures. yet, even rise longer-term inflation expectation marginal compare substantial temporary increase current hicp rate, guarantee remain unchanged. in respect, great inflation 1970s serve cautionary tale. subsequent two oil price shocks, many industrialise country experience period elevate inflation. a word warn i would like add correlation confound causation. obviously, global development time affect high rise oil prices. nonetheless, i focus remark nexus oil price hike monetary policy. in particular, i touch two example 1970s, germany (which i familiar with) usa (which widely 4 bi review 82/2008 discuss macroeconomic literature). germany suffer much less extent great inflation many economy elsewhere. one reason might high inflation aversion german public evolve consequence two period hyperinflation germany first half 20th century. it enable bundesbank adopt firm monetary policy stance many counterparts. the start perfect. in 1973, right gain freedom action collapse bretton wood system, bundesbank try keep inflation low mean moral suasion rather commit clear strategy. trade union le ignore bundesbank’s signal push high increase nominal wages, try compensate loss real disposable income. a consequence, inflation go up. but bundesbank learn experience and, 1975, together swiss national bank, first central bank worldwide adopt monetary target strategy, thereby commit publicly stability-oriented policy. after second oil price shock, 1979 1981, bundesbank send clear signal restore price stability raise key interest rate sharply. a consequence, german inflation rise much usa start decline earlier. at time, output loss also remain low usa, demonstrate restrictive monetary policy can, medium term, prove superior also real terms. the situation usa many industrialise country different. in usa, consumer price start hike early mid-1960s reason first unrelated oil market (vietnam war, food prices, monetary policy gear combat recession) 1½% 1965 6% 1970 aftermath oil price shock 14% 1980. in response persistent upward trend actual inflation, short-term inflation expectation also drift upwards, peak 12% 1981. such spiral mutually reinforce increase inflation inflation expectation suggest monetary policy somehow rise challenge period. the macroeconomic literature put forward numerous, often complementary explanations, i would like focus two them. first, argue monetary policy usa – though broadly commit price stability – respond sufficiently strongly high rise inflation rate 1979 (technically speaking, adhere taylor principle).1 by readily raise key interest rates, feed allow public inflation expectation become unhinged, give rise damage wage-price spiral fuel inflation. accord view, monetary policy inject volatility u economy, thereby contribute markedly large persistent inflation fluctuation 1970s. a i note earlier, macroeconomic framework 1970s general understand monetary policy undergo notable changes. nonetheless, u experience demonstrate quickly inflation expectation drift upwards actual inflation persistently stability norm central bank if, consequently, market participant lose confidence central bank’s restore price stability. another explanation great inflation focus fed’s response output.2 this view regard fed’s weak response inflation problematic, importance attach output stabilisation. indeed, strongly activist monetary policy, strive keep economy close potential, suffer fundamental conceptual problem. although policy perform well ideal conditions, may well produce markedly sub-optimal outcome give inevitable uncertainty associate estimate output gap real time. the latter happen great inflation. it argue feed detect productivity slowdown usa, start mid- 1 see clarida, galí gertler (2000). 2 see orphanides (2003, 2004). bi review 82/2008 5 1960s, real time. in similar vein, feed (and probably many central banks) immediately take account fact persistent increase oil price dampen effect potential output, even exact magnitude difficult quantify precision directly via reduction energy input indirectly via make exist capital stock redundant. both factor lead systematic overestimation u potential output. consequently, slow-down u economy first oil price shock (wrongly) perceive significant increase economic slack, central bank want counter tighten monetary policy. for reasons, central bank systematically underestimate inflationary pressure and, hence, think monetary policy stance restrictive actually was. in case, lesson learn explanation monetary policy factor change potential output even unobservable real time. in particular, central bank keep mind persistent oil price hike likely cause decline potential output. against background great inflation, press issue current juncture whether danger eurosystem repeat policy mistake 1970s. to give answer straightaway, no, i think so. a risk inaccurately assess potential output, i would first like emphasise eurosystem primarily aim output stabilisation. our primary objective price stability. however, potential output, output gap capacity utilisation part parcel collection data ecb govern council monitor ass short medium-term risk price stability. but aware uncertainty surround data make allowance cross-check short medium-term indication monetary policy come economic analysis medium long-term perspective stem monetary analysis. give eurosystem’s stability orientation, take dampen impact oil price shock potential output account therefore yield call relax monetary policy stance. if did, monetary policy would strengthen shock-related inflationary pressures. at current juncture, however, inflation euro area reach record high inflation risk still upside, concrete risk longer-term inflation expectation start creep strongly. the experience great inflation demonstrate stability-oriented central bank well-advised fight risk broad-based second-round effect decisively proactively. by so, keep cost curb inflation dynamic relatively low. our commitment systematic focus price stability even important, recent round wage settlement euro area contribute curb inflation pressures. on contrary, recent wage dynamic conjunction elevate persistent energy food price pressure increase risk prolong period intolerably high inflation. at last meet ecb govern council, emphasise that, give uncertainty economic outlook prevail downside risk economic growth, continue vigorous expansion money credit strong upside risk price stability, govern council state heighten alertness. financial market understand readiness act. it strong determination secure firm anchor medium long-term inflation expectation line price stability. after all, best contribution eurosystem make sustainable growth euro area safeguard price stability medium long term and lastly also forget reliable monetary policy also help reduce uncertainty time ongoing financial market turmoil. thank attention. reference beyer a., v.

social inclusion remark mr martín redrado, governor central bank argentina, g-20 workshop, buenos aires, 19-20 june 2008. * * * a many mentioned, could rarity find central banker address fiscal policy. but, discuss two day workshop, grow complexity world economy pose major challenge policy makers. and, definitely, ability flexibility coordinate different branch economic policy lay one significant. it seem long ago keynes realize room fiscal policy public good provider. i believe wasn’t coincidence him, specialist monetary issues, come answer to, probably, intrigue problem time. his extraordinary comprehension economy work plant seed emergence macroeconomic theory, still work improve daily basis. in opinion, debt honor legacy give long misinterpretation wrong pursue economic policy word. the analysis public finance many sides, address along workshop. from theoretical standpoint, state clear cut effect fiscal policy growth. for instance, neoclassical growth model solow’s spirit account government basically tax collector, show impact consumers’ behavior depend save pattern derive usual consumption optimization process. this ultimately imply fiscal policy determine level income, hardly affect pace economic growth. these model become engine analysis fiscal policy taxation. in view, kind framework robust term describe stylize fact free-market environment simplify hypothesis. however, able address empirical regularities, usual emerge countries. the vast amount unemployed resources, include capacity public sector take first step solve inefficiency one example. on hand, endogenous growth model acknowledge fiscal policy one key factor explain different growth rate among countries. but accord line thinking, well classical models, rise public expenditure long-run effect growth rate. the exception fact may increase private sector’s yield and, case, public investment could positive effect growth. this ultimately see improvement productivity, might help understand fiscal policy effect growth seem underestimated, daniel cohen point exposition. but, aware, model set limit environment real world extremely complicated. santiso make point clearly. i say must forget theory. instead, suggest that, dynamic economies, we, policy makers, relay much model good judgment. the world linear, many discontinuity form shock many different sources. it would much ask model able account regular irregularity and, further, able extract sound policy advice it. another relevant issue fiscal policy relate appropriate moment implementation, especially regard implication stability. in respect, need identify good way put together long-run objective short-run ones. bi review 82/2008 1 in late case, prone recognize role stabilize force. however, ability fiscal policy reduce volatility economic cycle deep scrutiny, especially develop world. probably usual hand stabilize role monetary policy. also, budgetary process seem rigid able respond timely way. in develop economies, usually expose external shock hind long-run fiscal sustainability, implementation countercyclical policy seem difficult. notwithstanding, mount evidence relevance fiscal policy stabilize economic force. a witness today, dual mandate divergent paths, we, central bankers, confront extremely challenge task call coordination economic policy instruments, give room fiscal action. a answer budgetary rigidities, grow case fiscal rules. many country put place kind framework institutional device preserve countercyclical role fiscal policy. we hear relevant experience uk chile, show applicability both, industrial emerge economies. but, forget intervention college japan. they remind u disappoint could single recipe every country. another strike issue policy maker scope public expenditure mean improve social inclusion economic growth. we see debate within g-20, evolve policy aspects. this morning clear distinction monetary fiscal policy made, later, definitely, good suit tackle micro problems. in opinion, issue must include top every single country agenda give income distribution become typical problem develop country also, recently, develop one too. a central banker, issue policy interaction – largely debate economic literature – great importance. one usual approach relate intertemporal debt sustainability call aggregate budget constraint fiscal surplus seigniorage revenue. this clear implication macroeconomic management involve treasury central bank. a matter fact, sargent wallace point back 1981, fiscal surplus must large enough pay public debt services. they frame necessary condition consistent reduction rate inflation time. and call another relevant relationship fiscal monetary policy, name fiscal dominance. fiscal dominance arise situation public deficit perception government debt unsustainability hind monetary policy credibility, even central bank legal de facto independence. in regard theoretical framework first devise woodford show enough monetary commitment price stability achieve it. fiscal behavior must clear order evaluate ability central bank put place policy. pierpaolo benigno also stress point ask interaction fiscal monetary policy business cycle. speak inflation targeting, state specific target inflation might best framework country high fiscal dominance high nominal output volatility. for instance, eighty latin-american country acknowledge period deep fiscal dominance, end collapse many economy derive overspend over-indebtness process case lead hyper inflation episodes. today picture look different. policy maker seem aware cost overtake money supply fund public expenses. recently, many emerge market 2 bi review 82/2008 reduce fiscal stimulus economic growth become stable resilient. definitely, call “crowding-in” process. several country latin-america evolve towards recreation budgetary institution encourage inter-temporal fiscal responsibility. latin-american government make notable effort fiscal area improve debt level management mean reduce vulnerability, significant progress recent years. pablo guidotti also show yesterday. a result, finance need issue past, even though shallow capital market region act constraint sustainable growth long term. in fact, financial development key – even agenda. the depth financial system integration international capital market powerful disciplinary effect reduce incentive follow expansionary policy foreign capital flow market predictable returns. on liability side, important progress also make region. the public debt gdp ratio decrease almost 30 percentage point last five years. this reflects, part, good liability management, also show enormous reduction exposure foreign currency debt. the region finally leave behind well-known original sin feature last decade (currency mismatches), provide solid grind develop domestic yield curve local currency. all latin america, financial system better-matched, well capitalize le expose public sector debt, another sin past. not long ago, use central bank also financial system finance treasury limit whatsoever. in case argentina, instance, policy design central bank aim purpose lead bank reduce government debt hold recently stand 14.6% net assets, low level many years. in view, good economic analysis also imply bundle latin american country follow different pattern different stage path towards long-term sustainability. hasty diagnosis simplistic comparison among various countries’ situation may lead inappropriate policy recommendations. to sum up, period good macroeconomic management across world. we witness turbulent time world economy decades. a i refer early last year, head towards volatile environment, resurgence volatility remain u while. in context, emerge economy resilient past confront external shocks. and, unusual condition commodity price increase play important role (as discuss morning), robust monetary policy fiscal strength key development behind performance. on longer-run, must keep work rise human capital productivity improve public education, invest social infrastructure across cycle, adopt countercyclical measure prevent distributional effect downswings. ultimately, important contribution deliver constituents. a policy makers, careful assessment current economic environment. we must avoid usual mistake take exceptionally good time remain forever, lead policy relaxation. here confront two type error: first one take good time permanent ones, really temporary situation. the possibility work transitory good time real underlie development place permanent basis. a policy maker afford fall first one. thank you. bi review 82/2008 3 svein gjedrem: from oil gas financial asset – norway’s government pension fund – global speech mr svein gjedrem, governor norge bank (central bank norway), conference “commodities, economy money” calgary, canada, 20 june 2008. * * * introduction good morning thank invitation highly topical conference. i ask talk “objectives experience norwegian oil fund”. in so, i try explain set-up purpose fund draw preliminary conclusion outcome far. since norway become oil nation 40 year ago, petroleum sector grow become important part economy. today, petroleum account approximately 25 per cent norway’s gross domestic product (gdp). and even though production oil decline peak around turn millennium, total petroleum production remain high many year come. the economic challenge pose petroleum extraction widely recognise early on. a early 1974, norwegian parliament discuss challenge depth, early 1980s, idea fund would stabilise petroleum revenue spend launched. due domestic economic turmoil financial crisis late 1980s early 1990s, take time idea fund turn actual savings. why pension fund? the government petroleum fund formally establish 1990. in 2006, name change government pension fund – global. in spite name change, fund similar endowment pension fund. since first transfer usd 400 million make 1996, fund grow rapidly size. it asset currently value around usd 400 billion. one third portfolio, usd 130 billion invest north america. the fund expect grow rapidly come years, may double 5-10 years. the fund establish tool support prudent management norway’s petroleum wealth. one purpose shield non-oil economy price fluctuation (see chart 3). the fund also long-term save instrument. it help cope future financial commitment link age population. accumulation capital fund reflect depletion non-renewable resource, exchange financial asset fund’s investments. by set fund, become possible establish path production oil gas independent profile petroleum revenue spending. furthermore, effectively shield non-oil economy, make sure private sector investment decision could make independently public sector’s save petroleum wealth, fund invest abroad. this also enhance expect return government wealth reduce risk. the alternative fund would directly regulate production put conservative upper limit annual extraction. this attempt 1970s -80s. at time, production ceiling 90 million standard cubic metre per year. this approach abandon 1980s. today, government steer exploration activity bi review 81/2008 1 award production licenses, explicit production target. since mid-1990s, total petroleum production around 250 million standard cubic metre per year. the fund mechanism the fund law fully integrate government budget, priority impose spend fund government spending. this mean entire petroleum revenue transfer fund. an amount equal non-oil budget deficit transfer fiscal budget. the mechanism ensure accumulation capital fund equal government net financial savings. there correspond increase liabilities. furthermore, legislation prohibit use fund money purpose prioritise regular budget processes. there hide use oil money, use special purposes. the fund strictly effectively “out bounds” special interests. in 2001, norwegian parliament approve new fiscal policy guideline stipulate annual transfer fund fiscal budget – annual spend oil money – correspond expect real return fund. the expect real return estimate 4 per cent. the point reference spend rule normal cyclical situation. in event particularly high capacity utilisation, spend low 4 per cent, whereas cyclical downturn, somewhat high spend may appropriate. the intention wealth transfer future generations, generation spend returns. the rule give weight long-term consideration address current economic policy challenges. the rule also help stabilise exchange rate expectations. the fiscal rule advantage intuitive appeal, easy check whether follow business cycle. in line rule, transfer fund high expect real return 4 per cent cyclical downturn 2003 follow two years. since 2006, however, transfer lower. it also note target rule cyclically adjust transfer, show solid line chart 6. automatic stabiliser allow work, thereby reduce actual transfer upturn increase downturns, illustrate break line chart 6. governance structure management model now, let turn fund management model. the governance structure base clear division responsibility political authority operational management. • the ministry finance owner fund. the ministry define mandate monitor evaluate performance. • the management fund delegate norge bank. the bank’s task implement investment strategy exercise ownership rights. norge bank also provide professional advice ministry investment strategies. the fund’s investment strategy maximise financial return moderate risk. the long-term strategic allocation define term benchmark portfolio, consist equity fix income instruments. equity account 60 per cent fund's strategic benchmark portfolio. the size fund imply currently own 1 per cent list european equity ½ per cent list equity global basis. fix income instrument account 40 per cent. 2 bi review 81/2008 furthermore, ministry recently decide fund prepare grind invest real estate 5 per cent strategic benchmark portfolio. in time, reduce fix income share 35 per cent. norge bank build organisation emphasis investment return base three fundamental principles: accountability, transparency professional standards. norge bank manage part fund internally, part manage external manager appoint bank commercial basis. active management become important part investment operations. we believe search excess return strong disciplinary effect organisation. transparency disclosure information key feature fund. all investment principle guideline well strategic advice second opinion report make public. we publish quarterly report fund performance, present press conferences. the fund’s annual report disclose list every single investment hold end year, also provide overview corporate governance work, include vote general meetings. initially, transparency aim build confidence among norwegians, also see policy transparency highly appreciate internationally. the challenge norwegian economy the risk “dutch disease”1 often cite discuss impact natural resource windfalls.2 dutch disease occur basis internationally expose industry erode fluctuation economic activity amplified. in case, say “so far good”. the economy fairly stable oil price fluctuation moderate impact currency. furthermore, difficult know economy would develop without oil, sort “control group”. the nordic country – denmark, finland sweden – comparable size structures, mainly non-oil economies.3 three indicator may relevant context. first, evidence productivity growth eroded. in fact, norway generally manage sustain high productivity growth compare advance countries. second, evidence labour force participation impaired. in fact, labour force participation high, lag behind neighbour country mid-1980s. a third indicator welfare spending. here, evidence development le favourable. norway see sharp increase sickness absence steadily high share working-age population disability benefit rehabilitation schemes. over past decade, norway underperform score compare 1 the expression ”dutch disease” originate netherlands, government rapidly spend large revenue extraction gas 1960s. 2 the economic literature include many study look relationship income natural resource economic growth, see example jeffrey d. sachs andrew m. warner, “the curse natural resources”, european economic review 45 (2001) thorvaldur gylfason, “natural resource economic growth: from dependence diversification”, discussion paper no. 4804, cepr. 3 denmark also produce oil gas since early 1970s, small scale norway. the impact danish economy therefore limited. bi review 81/2008 3 nordic countries. the grow number people outside labour force benefit increasingly become achilles’ heel norwegian economy. on balance though, picture fairly positive: we manage keep macroeconomic development steady course, avoid dramatic change industry structure, use resource fairly efficiently. it is, however, early draw definite conclusions. we probably wait another generation two see long-term impact huge windfall. the debate sovereign wealth fund let wind word sovereign wealth fund debate. typical feature many sovereign wealth fund long investment horizons, leverage claim imminent withdrawal funds. this differentiate fund instance rise number leverage fund investor short time horizons. hence, sovereign wealth fund strong risk-bearing capacity ability accommodate short-term volatility. sovereign wealth fund may reduce volatility asset price increase efficiency. again, transparency disclosure information important tool build confidence. this run ways, course. it also note separation spend petroleum revenue current revenue stream fund mechanism allow oil producer extract petroleum high rate would appropriate proceed redeploy domestic economy. hence, petroleum fund offer attractive way recycle oil producers’ revenue international financial markets, also indirect stabilise effect oil market. in view, sound management oil-producing countries’ petroleum wealth everyone’s interest. thank attention. 4 bi review

monetary view fiscal policy. i work short period world bank, give global governments’ view also imf, give global monetary authority’s view. a via-media, i opt give practitioner’s perspective fiscal policy, economic reforms. india’s fiscal situation: brief prelude broadly, first 30 year independence, 1950 1980, fiscal deficit central state government excessive. this period revenue surplus general. however, automatic monetisation government deficit rbi, start exception mid 1950s, become regular practice thereafter. simultaneously, also distinct shift management financial sector nationalisation major commercial bank 1969 1980. these two development significant bear relationship monetary authority (rbi) fiscal authority (government). there significant deterioration fiscal situation 1980s, accompany large automatic monetisation government deficits. the process involve issue ad-hoc treasury bill rate initially par 91-day treasury bills. since july 1974, ad-hoc treasury bill offer off-market discount rate 4.6 per cent le half prevail market rates. there two immediate consequences. one, large government deficit monetised, excess liquidity system, prompt monetary authority increase cash reserve ratio (crr) bank regular interval view mop excess liquidity. two, facilitate central government borrow comfortably, monetary authority, also debt manager government,

early 1990s. trigger balance payment crisis early 1990s, foreign currency asset deplete rapidly extent could barely finance two week imports, start reform process 1991-92. a credible macroeconomic structural stabilisation programme encompass trade, industry, foreign investment, exchange rate, public finance financial sector put place, create environment conducive expansion trade investment. simultaneously, several reform measure towards marketisation government borrow initiated. at instance dr. rangarajan, one illustrious predecessor governor, rbi enter first agreement government 1994 place limit automatic monetisation. the first supplemental agreement rbi government india sign 1994 set system limit creation ad hoc treasury bill three-year period end 1996-97. then 1997, soon i move rbi, second agreement government signed, mr. montek singh ahluwalia represent government. in pursuance second supplemental agreement rbi government india march 6, 1997, ad hoc treasury bill completely phase april 1997, replace scheme way mean advances, subject limits. in order smoothen transition, government india allow incur also overdraft, interest rate high rate applicable way mean advance (wma). with effect april 1, 1999 overdraft allow maximum ten work days. these feature place central government par state government bring “overdraft regulation scheme” since 1985. furthermore, agree rbi would trigger fresh floatation government security whenever 75 per cent wma limit reached. it also agree government’s surplus cash balance rbi, beyond agree level, would invest government securities. while transition full-fledged wma overdraft mechanism gradual, non-disruptive consensual, successful implementation mechanism make possible incorporate practice law – fiscal responsibility budget management act (frbm act). it noteworthy law also practically prohibit rbi participate primary issue government securities. a result concert effort restore fiscal balance tax reforms, expenditure management, institutional reform financial sector reform first half 1990s, significant reduction magnitude fiscal deficit proportion debt relative gdp period 1991 1997. however, period 1997 2003, reversal trend fiscal consolidation, cumulative impact industrial slowdown, fifth pay commission award, low expect revenue buoyancy culminate fiscal deterioration. this deterioration indian fiscal position happen inopportune time fiscal improvement world india try globalize. it important remember india’s fiscal situation significantly divergent global fiscal situation continue even now. i think, background keep view whenever discus pace content economic reform india. the come force frbm act, 2003 july 5, 2004, establish framework rule base fiscal consolidation, view background. in period subsequent 2003, central government’s fiscal position improving, though several underlie fiscal pressure entirely evident numbers, explain later. the states’ fiscal position also improve significantly period revenue deficit close virtually eliminated. however, case centre, underlie pressure reflect fiscal number states. 2 bi review 81/2008 despite considerable improvement fiscal scenario, centre states, india’s combine fiscal deficit (centre state), percentage gdp, still continue one high world. prof. rao would also able explain separately detail india’s public debt, include external debt, percentage gdp, one high world. in context, u.k. base weekly economist (dated november 17, 2007 – page 75-77) rank india, along turkey hungary, risky economy among select lead emerge market economies. the economist base conclusion standard parameter current account balance, budget balance, inflation growth bank lending, assess degree risk. one cannot disagree relevance parameter assess risks. yet noteworthy risky element present indian economy several years, almost reform period, yet economy exhibit macro-stability impressive growth even withstand significant domestic global shocks. in view evidence, need explore reason risk de-stabilising economy far; measure needed, future, insulate economy de-stabilising effects, extent feasible. i think important big picture reckon analyse pace intent reforms, despite agreement destination well direction economic reforms. role rbi fiscal reform now, let briefly explain role rbi fiscal reforms. a central bank, generally sensitive fiscal situation. it true rbi aware implication happen fiscal front first three decade (1950 1980). give institutional arrangement, rbi’s primary objective maintain monetary stability. it clear fiscal situation something decide determine sovereign. once fiscal situation decide determine sovereign, central bank’s responsibility ensure monetary stability maintain government’s borrow programme manage minimum disruptions, term stability. some argue accommodate fiscal pressure monetary action like, people call, soft-budget constraint. let revert reform process get rid remnant automatic monetisation previous years. the stock ad hoc treasury bills, put end issue bills, rs. 1,00,000 crore. this stock fact public debt perpetuity, hold rbi, bear discount rate 4.6 per cent though market rate far higher. in coordination government, agree paper convert date marketable security market relate rates, phases, depend market condition warrant open market operation rbi. thus, stock ad hoc treasury bill wiped-out. this evidence variety way rbi conceive implement process reforms, non-disruptible fashion, coordination government. let share story relate frbm act you. one day, governor jalan say finance minister make announcement introduction fiscal responsibility bill (which propose nomenclature). governor jalan say discuss minister decide i name chairman committee would draft fiscal responsibility bill. i submit government official work legislation relate fiscal issue rbi involved, ownership fiscal responsibility bill government. governor jalan relent say “no, decide it”. so finally, arrive compromise. a main formal committee set 2000 secretary, economic affairs, dr. e.a.s. sarma chairman dr. ashok lahiri one members; work group comprise rbi official set-up chairmanship provide technical assistance main committee several aspect draft fiscal responsibility bill. the rbi work group actively involve bi review 81/2008 3 sarma committee draft fiscal responsibility bill. mr. prem chand imf, invitation, spend time advise u international best practice regard. at stage, advise government without incorporate transparent budget management rule medium term fiscal framework, objective fiscal responsibility would achieved. therefore, name bill change “fiscal responsibility budget management bill” incorporate additional features. in short, i illustrate rbi actively collaborate government, whenever sought, appropriate propriety. our experience show frbm act positive effect focus attention fiscal issues. at time, may, sometimes, unintentionally lead increase recourse expand off-budget fiscal liabilities. such practice entirely uncommon many countries, magnitude involve persistence resort off-budget liability india noteworthy. the issue merely one transparency fiscal operation de facto large borrow programme government admitted, one significant implication government debt market monetary management. past experience clearly suggest recourse off-budget item ad hoc one-time only. the repeat recourse issue government bond exercise fuel, food fertilizer finance subsidies, also finance defer liability regard bank loan waiver contribution capital public sector banks. hence, unless noticeable change global price change policy towards recurrent subsidy defer liabilities, continuation special bond may rule out. the significant quasi-fiscal transaction finance recurrent revenue expenditure de facto borrow pose challenge manage link fiscal, external monetary management. the rbi render advice frbm state government also. a forum provide rbi, bring together finance secretary state governments, exchange idea sort issues. the bi-annual conference state finance secretary host rbi, initiate 1996, also attend secretary ministry finance, government india, representative plan commission, comptroller auditor general account (cag) controller general account (cga). the deliberation bi-annual conference prove useful identify common issue develop best practice regard state government finances. a number important initiative relate way mean advances, approach market borrow programme, investment surpluses, ceiling state government guarantees, model scheme state level fiscal legislations, apart change content format report budget relate document ensure transparency etc. emanate take shape result interaction meetings. the rbi has, forum, also help state government prepare state level frbm legislations. incidentally, first research policy paper pension fund india prepare dr. urjit patel, use work us. in days, hard get data tap informal link various office delhi, include old colleagues, give access relevant information. dr. urjit patel good job publish article economic & political weekly. thus, public policy pension was, sense, trigger work do consultant rbi, request. rbi also work report pension state government employees. this another evidence collaboration rbi government often view accepted. now, let come fisc monetary management issues. fisc monetary management let clarify general approach rbi relation government matter relate monetary management. a illustrate case preparation fiscal 4 bi review 81/2008 responsibility budget management bill, coordination government rbi essential structural reforms, especially legal institutional change involved. in regard operational issue relate monetary policy, element freedom but, view fiscal dominance economy, override approach harmonization monetary policy fiscal policy ensure stability. within framework, mutual cooperation, several reform measure undertake government rbi i provide illustrations. first, statutory liquidity ratio (slr) gradually reduce statutory minimum 25 per cent, effective october 21, 1997. also, crr reduce gradually, depend liquidity conditions, first step, objective ultimately reduce statutory minimum three per cent. in meantime, rbi’s commitment removal statutory prescription minimum reserve liquidity requirement demonstrate proposal government legislative amendment remove minima. these legislation since passed. now, minimum statutory stipulation slr crr. the challenge reduce crr slr stipulations, go along. the reduction crr contingent upon liquidity condition need use instrument sterilisation along instruments. the reduction slr primarily govern fiscal situation government. the issue one desirable destination one negotiate path optimal way. rbi two option proceed regard. either accept fiscal situation wait improve, effect reduction slr reduce prescription gradually consistent fiscal situation market development. so type choice face juncture rbi prefer ass fiscal situation proceed reduction cautious manner. second, issue come fore recent period pertain high volatility government’s cash balance maintain rbi, impact liquidity condition financial markets. volatility government’s cash balance unique indian situation issue even countries, situation, become increasingly prominent now. it happen that, times, government’s cash balance external situation move different direction create little net impact liquidity perspective overall monetary management. however, occasion move direction, case volatility liquidity condition much higher. this one major current issue monetary management could link cash management government. the link become critical maintain orderly liquidity condition money market effectively use short term overnight interest rate monetary operations. third, magnitude combine fiscal deficit centre state close half households’ financial savings, large component domestic savings. if fifty per cent households’ financial save take away government sector, vital implication ensure stability financial market demand fund non-government productive sector economy meet simultaneously. fourth, india still bank-dominated system 70 per cent bank (in term business) own government. thus, could situation objective monetary policy objective broad public policy deal bank converge, case monetary policy could effective. sometimes, could happen objective monetary policy objective broad public policy may converge, case monetary policy may effective. in words, effectiveness monetary policy depend action monetary authority, also public policy postures. this certainly complicate monetary management. of course, issue conflict interest public sector bank government ownership yet bi review 81/2008 5 another issue. the issue conflict interest private sector bank arise owner bank borrow bank. the single large source borrow government government-owned bank themselves, conflict rather apparent. fifth, one factor impart rigidity interest rate structure india administer interest rates, particularly small save instruments. in context, administer interest rate fix government number small save scheme provident fund special relevance generally offer rate different correspond instrument available market, case along tax incentives. the administer interest rate significantly impact level allocation savings. on lend side also, administrative prescription banks. depend calculated, save lend sides, administer structure interest rate would apply 25 40 per cent. in context, pertinent note monetary policy mainly operate interest rate interest rate signals, constraint pose administer interest rate duly recognize deal issue relate monetary policy transmission mechanisms. sixth, theoretically well recognise monetary policy generally effective counter-cyclical policy instrument fiscal policy interest rate change make reverse quickly. however, monetary policy adjustment may take long fiscal policy adjustment affect aggregate demand. it also recognize fiscal policy contribute broader-based stabilization impact tax government spend income-sensitive (in addition interest-sensitive) component aggregate demand. when monetary policy thus constrain respond output variations, fiscal policy normally take central role. thus, effective co-ordination fiscal policy monetary policy important. at aggregate level, context capacity respond global developments, counter-cyclical policy approach, monetary policy also fiscal policy counter-cyclical. if fiscal policy continue uni-directional, case, persist deficits, fiscal policy position produce reasonable counter-cyclical impact. in circumstances, monetary policy challenge design implement appropriate counter-cyclical policies, add burden off-setting impact fiscal policy. well, despite challenges, rbi manage situation reasonably well confidence would able continue manage. however, important recognize that, times, unorthodox policy assure stability indian financial system despite fiscal stress, desirable outcome rather achieve ritualistic compliance pre-set rules. by large, illustration link exist fiscal monetary management. we continuously refine monetary policy framework conduct monetary policy, take account progress fiscal consolidation. the reform monetary policy framework conduct monetary policy recognise fiscal, relate institutional well policy constraints. that limit point i want make impatient current monetary management framework. now let go fisc financial market. fisc financial market first, foremost link fisc financial market government security market. a already explain detail, central government’s borrow programme significantly monetize early days. it may interest know since large part borrow programme complete first half fiscal year, view seasonality demand credit private account, monthly average gross market borrow centre around three-quarters percent gdp recent years. despite high level government borrow programme, rbi, debt manager, able successfully complete market borrow 6 bi review 81/2008 programme, years, pursue interest rate objective without jeopardize external balance, take recourse several initiative term institution, instruments, incentive strategies. second, important issue remain cannot claim genuine market government security india, statutory liquidity ratio prescription 25 per cent. the question really proceed assumption genuine government security market, hence reinforce marketisation rapidly reduce slr ensure viable market borrow programme reduce slr tandem? here rbi ass sensitivity fisc interest rate burden, case slr reduce rapidly? the importance slr status bond issue government come fore recently oil bond issue government india turn illiquid despite carry high yield 25 basis point slr-eligible bond similar maturity. the reform debt market india, go along, recognise realities. third, case state governments, try marketise individual state’s borrow programme, many state comfortable. they sure whether would able get subscription bond unless rbi manage borrow programme state coordinate fashion uniform term condition states. know bank cannot compel subscribe programme, rbi provide investor high yield states’ paper centre’s paper comparable maturity. subsequently, encourage state go auction route stand-alone basis. now become possible rbi conduct borrow programme state without serious disruption markets, auction route. a result, state also begin take initiative improve fiscal profile discharge liability promptly banks, and, consequently, gain comparatively favourable treatment debt market. it take six seven year rbi equip state government market get use kind discipline. this perhaps possible rbi command trust state government apolitical professional public institution. fourth, another aspect worth explore fiscal implication failure financial institution markets. the rbi, central bank country, also responsible ensure financial stability. broadly, one say country’s fiscal position strong, capacity take risk arise failure financial institution higher. on hand, weak fiscal situation, capacity take care financial bank crisis rather limited. more important, whenever pocket vulnerability arise financial sector, headroom available fiscal position provide succour financial entity need assessed. in context, one important source strength well vulnerability remain publicly own financial institutions, may fiscal implications. they contribute heavily source tax revenue. another source linkage cross subsidy identify area maximum cross subsidy public sector entities. the source indirect subsidy financial intermediary also important. a read several budget speech finance minister recent year would show extent activity public sector financial intermediary operate instrument fiscal policy though entity compete market private sector fronts. these public policy orient operation public enterprise instance fisc seriously limit efficient price discovery, depth vibrancy different segment financial markets. thus, evident analyse link fiscal public sector, perhaps, one confine public sector borrow requirement only. fifth, regard reform financial markets, clear development insurance pension sector important especially government debt market corporate debt market. however, challenge regard. the tax treatment investment debt equity quite asymmetrical india bi review 81/2008 7 favourable tilt towards investment equity. there limit incentive encourage contractual savings. hence, area look at, move forward, relate demand side advocate development financial markets, also supply side policy promote contractual savings, especially pension life insurance funds. now let move fisc external sector. fisc external sector in context external sector, certain issue perspective fiscal policy contextual relevance. the first issue pertain opening-up government debt market non-residents through, may call foreign currency sovereign debt. in fact, decade ago, several argument put forward favour issue foreign currency sovereign debt government’s intention take recourse sovereign borrow international market formally announce hon’ble finance minister. several academic argue favour proposal since felt may economical government raise fund abroad. however, borrow may entail foreign currency exposure hence foreign currency risk, build analysis benefits. another line argument put forward favour foreign currency sovereign borrow government’s borrow abroad would help develop benchmark private sector foreign currency debt. however, weightage sovereign risk assign private sector debt even without sovereign benchmark, take account sovereign risks. moreover, issue always political economic temptations, happen many countries, raise foreign currency sovereign debt, credit market sentiment favourable probably without factoring-in likely situation may prevail sentiment turn unfavourable. the rbi work along government issue come come conclusion that, point time, might desirable issue foreign currency sovereign bonds. one argument approach international market sovereign bond persistence large revenue deficit government. thus, context, point consider that, give magnitude public debt percentage gdp magnitude fiscal deficit, whether public policy would manoeuvrability maintain stability debt denominate foreign currency hold non-residents. in backdrop, may conclude that, give fiscal situation, health financial institutions, stage development financial markets, scope non-resident participation government security market particularly foreign currency denominate bond may expand gradually. however, pace open foreign currency sovereign debt non-residents would dependent upon pace progress fiscal, institutional, market fronts. second, another key issue basically practitioner’s perspective fiscal cost market stabilization scheme (mss). perhaps i explain background story, since academic forum. around end 2003, i join governor, look macroeconomic parameter anticipate large capital inflows. during late 2003 early january 2004, two group constitute rbi, one issue sterilisation review liquidity adjustment facility (laf) operation since 2001 part monetary policy operate framework. the draft report two technical group deliberation place public domain rbi website intensely debated. anticipate enhance capital inflow future possible volatility liquidity, ms introduce new 8 bi review 81/2008 instrument sterilisation, focus laf shift rbi management day day liquidity fluctuations. the relate issue surface accumulation foreign exchange due market interventions, whether sterilise sterilise finally decide sterilise, much sterilise bear sterilisation cost. one view that, similar practice countries, central bank may take decision intervention also sterilisation accordingly central bank may issue bonds. a prudential requirement, rbi prohibit bond issuances. a result, ms introduce whereby sterilisation issuance government securities. simultaneously, give large public policy implication exchange rate indian context, deliberate whether desirable central bank alone take view extent sterilisation. after considerable debate within government rbi, agree march 2004, limit market stabilisation scheme (mss) would prescribe government time time light proposal rbi. this imply prescribe limit mss, government recognise fiscal cost ready bear context external sector management. third, relate issue whether fiscal cost sterilization bear central bank government. we unique show part government’s budget unlike practice follow countries. it would pertinent mention practice take quasi fiscal cost central bank balance sheet lead erosion capital base many central banks. although central bank operate autonomously, consequence erosion capital subsequent recourse government infusion capital. thus, indian context, major fiscal cost attributable sterilisation context external sector management clearly show government’s budget, mechanism mss, add fiscal transparency. incidentally, desirability ms discuss afresh government june 2004, new cabinet swear reconfirm ms arrangement desirable one. fourth, contextually, study imf icrier quasi fiscal cost sterilization india. technically, possible look total account returns. however, assume whenever central bank accumulate reserve adverse impact balance sheet, may, however, turn universally right. for instance, till last year, china’s domestic interest rate low return foreign currency assets. in case, carry cost reserve negative chinese central bank, result quasi fiscal benefit. fifth, relate issue regard valuation forex reserve marked-to-market basis balance sheet rbi. an appreciation reserve currency translate losses. but sens one argue loss notional. again, every central bank different way accounting. most central bank and, definitely, rbi, adopt conservative account practice unrealised gain shown. the issue one calculate cost hold reserve even “excess” reserves. since essentially opportunity cost, way calculate reasonably term interest rate local currency asset vis-à-vis foreign currency assets. but interestingly, question arise account macroeconomic benefits. many central banks, without concurrence government, add reserve hold reserve even though incur quasi fiscal cost. this clearly suggest must benefit widely adopt practice so, benefits? my submission benefit unfortunately quantifiable. but quantifiable, i think appropriate ignore them. the list benefit summarise follows. one, enhance confidence economy, particularly emerge market economy result bi review 81/2008 9 good sovereign rating. this, turn, translate fine spread public private sector raise money. two, enhance capacity absorb shocks. the shock two types: real sector shock term oil shocks, food grain shock financial shock term financial flows. on both, real sector financial sector, scope smoothen volatility adequate reserves. apart these, one arguably fundamental issue whether excess volatility moderate order avoid destabilise effect growth employment. therefore, recognise cost – cost hold reserve may negative positive – quantifiable also benefit quantifiable. these public policy implication fiscal policy element, namely quasi-fiscal cost reserves. sixth, another link fiscal policy reserves. if one read rat agencies’ sovereign rating, one may find mention forex reserve perceive provide cushion fiscal conditions. in sense, therefore, even fiscal cost carry reserves, also give benefit fisc recognize analysts. maintain orderly condition forex market viewed, senses, public good provision public good market participant involve addition depletion forex reserves, incur attendant fiscal costs, any, hold reserve may justifiable. let come conclude section rbi’s approach fiscal policy. rbi’s perspective fiscal policy the rbi’s approach fiscal reform agree need eliminate revenue deficit, agree nominal limit fiscal deficit, even important mode finance fiscal deficit use resource raise put to. in addition, focus fiscal empowerment clearly articulate around 2000 annual report board director rbi. exclusive focus fiscal deficit may tend reduce role government, consequently, position aid process growth, particular, inclusive growth. re-prioritisation expenditure may achieve reduction elimination subsidy deployment resource thus release needy sectors. high level resource may also available reduction tax exemption. so whole idea that, economy like require structural transformation investment social financial infrastructure, strive appropriate level fiscal activity particularly public good provide would enable u maintain fiscal discipline macro-stability rather aim mechanical reduction fiscal revenue deficit low level fiscal activity. in light financial turbulence across world recent period, relevance fisc management macro economy become even important. when see financial turbulence country, important remember else fails, fiscal take hit come rescue. i would like read sentence one rat agency make comment, conclude. it says, “india’s monetary management conservative prudent, together low external debt position relative ease local currency funding, help alleviate fiscal weakness.” the important point rbi’s policy help alleviate fiscal weakness, conservative? it perhaps need describe “appropriate”. this address dedicate mr. s.l.n. simha, whose instance transcript edit publication. mr. simha, de facto author volume one history reserve bank india (1935-1951), highly respect central banker take lively interest theory practice central bank even age ninety. reserve bank 10 bi review 81/2008 owe lot distinguish employee like current status respect public institution india. bi review 81/2008 11 heng swee keat:

medium news conference, geneva, 19 june 2008. * * * the swiss national bank publish sixth annual report financial stability today. my comment base report. i begin brief assessment current state financial system. then i present important lesson swiss national bank learn credit market turmoil. a know, situation swiss bank sector worsen significantly 2007 result correction u real estate market. in second half year, profit fell swiss big bank substantial deterioration capital base. the swiss banks, contrast, hardly affect turmoil. most able benefit buoyant swiss economy surpass good result achieve previous year. since begin 2008, development big bank mixed. on one hand, first quarter 2008, suffer loss international credit market due deterioration international credit markets. on hand, strengthen capital base partially reduce risk positions. in past months, overall market environment calm somewhat. nonetheless, early sound all-clear. the ongoing price correction u real estate market probably continue put strain u economy. ultimately, spill country outside us, although accord assessment affect limited. consequently, although snb expect slow momentum come quarters, expect decline economic growth le pronounce us. however, considerable uncertainty attach current forecast. this mean market participants, particular banks, also need take le favourable scenario account. a clear escalation crisis u real estate market would heavily depress economic growth u this, turn, would leave pronounce mark switzerland. moreover, real estate price rise appreciably recent year us, countries. price correction already observe real estate market countries. further development kind cannot rule out. we see great risk swiss real estate market present time. a already mentioned, swiss big bank reduce risk position recent months. however, remain expose regard international developments. so far, financial market turmoil mainly affect trade portfolio big banks, hardly loss record traditional lend business. this could change. should general economic situation indeed deteriorate further, solvency borrower would also worsen. this would result loss big banks’ lend portfolios. the effect bank domestic business focus would depend extent deterioration international environment. enter risk bank’s core business and, such, desirable. what important risk calculate carried. however, experience show always case. in three recent international financial crises, swiss big bank particularly hard hit. each time crisis occur increase amount equity wipe out. this serve warning. if wheel set motion now, impact next crisis could even severe. should big bank collapse, consequence switzerland would dire. therefore, measure need take order ensure swiss big bank sufficiently bi review 80/2008 1 resilient future. the snb swiss federal bank commission recognise need action – basically – four areas: capital, liquidity, monitor crisis management. in stability report discus measure four areas. today i would like focus important measure area capital. it nature financial market always crises. even best risk management, bank hit suddenly unexpected event developments. i convince management continue misjudge situation future. this something live with. the financial system therefore need make resilient possible shocks. this mean buff financial system increased. fine-tune current regulation necessary many respects. however, view insufficient response steadily increase complexity financial markets. it therefore questionable whether current regulatory approach, increasingly complex provision intervene ever deep level daily business banks, right one. the authority are, nature, always step behind late developments. even complex model never infallible. in current crisis, model-based form risk measurement failed. the snb therefore belief two fundamental adjustment need make capital requirement swiss big banks. first, risk-weighted capital requirement swiss big bank need tightened. one way achieve would use appropriate multiplier increase capital requirement basel 2. second, limit leverage – often refer “leverage ratio” – need introduce big bank complement risk-weighted capital requirements. a clearly outline financial stability report, leverage swiss big bank high, since mid-1990s, average indebtedness two big bank rise 90% 97%. that mean chf 97 borrow capital every chf 3 equity. this ratio also high international standards. in term return equity, high leverage may appear attractive. in term financial stability, however, also source risk. thus, current crisis, loss arise swiss big bank risk position relatively small comparison total assets. however, leverage high, case ubs loss destroy almost half bank’s equity. the two measure mention complementary effect. the risk-based requirement ensure best possible risk-sensitivity capital adequacy purposes. alongside this, leverage ratio would guarantee minimum safety buff depend complex models. thus, leverage ratio would protection unexpected shock sufficiently cover risk-weighted requirements. this limitation set degree indebtedness would mean capital requirement would increase activity base large amount borrow funds, proprietary trading. in us, bank long subject leverage ratio. they comply capital-to-assets ratio least 5% order consider well capitalised. the swiss federal bank commission (sfbc) – authority responsibility area – currently process spell detail measure need area capital adequacy requirements. careful plan particularly important respect implementation new measures. first all, current crisis see through. the appropriate measure need introduce progressively number years. in project, sfbc count full support snb, interest secure long-term strengthen swiss financial system. 2 bi review 80/2008 mark carney: capitalize commodity boom – role monetary policy remark mr mark carney, governor bank canada, haskayne school business, calgary, alberta, 19 june 2008. * * * everyone remember bumper sticker. for two decades, albertans promise waste next boom one granted. with us$130 oil, us$10 natural gas, us$200 coal, us$8 wheat, next one clearly arrived. the question make good promise. this evening, i concentrate one aspect answer: monetary policy help create condition allow canadian benefit sustain high commodity prices. i grateful opportunity monetary policy effective well understood. seldom understand important economy face type supply demand shock engender series sharp increase commodity prices. outlook commodity price we experience commodity super cycle. throughout current boom, scale price increase higher, range affect commodity broader, previous upturns. since 2002, grain oilseed price doubled, base metal price tripled, oil price quadrupled. beyond breadth magnitude price increases, current boom also unusual begin early global economic cycle last longer. while boom usually herald downturn, one appear evidence unusually robust momentum global growth.1these dynamic suggest combination favourable mutually reinforce factor work. these include burgeon demand, subdue supply response, important link among commodity markets, supportive financial conditions. an environment secular increase commodity price build since middle 1990s. that said, expect considerable volatility around longer-term trend must remember supply demand may inelastic short term, decidedly flexible long periods. current commodity-price dynamic intimately link globalization process. in particular, rapid growth emerging-market demand drive prices. positive underlie demand fundamental emerge market include sustain growth per caput income, rapid industrialization, intensive use commodity production. research

in face demand, supply response disappointing. consider oil. opec's annual production decline 2 per cent since 2005 and, exceptions, non-opec supply fail meet expectations. among oecd countries, oil output fall 8 per cent since 2002. a consequence, inventory remain tight 31 days, spare capacity limited. with inelastic demand short term, actual perceive supply disruption lead sharp price spike continue volatility. there many reason supply response limit thus far. first, access many world's promise region often tightly control wholly restrict state-owned enterprises. second, nominal investment surged, costs.5 many room know direct experience hard find skilled workers, drill rigs, pipeline capacity. exploration development cost conventional crude doubled, oil sand cost tripled. across global industry, surge investment cost mean real investment remain flat. the net result 70 per cent nominal increase non-opec capital expenditure since 2003 barely replace decline production

addition, interfere price signals, policy delay necessary economic adjustment increase risk dramatic difficult reversal future. encouragingly, recent weeks, several country take important step ease controls. demand expect follow. a wake previous commodity-price spikes, demand response ultimately include adoption new technologies. indeed, commodity-intensive economy likely replace energy-inefficient capital rapidly peer three decade ago. with today's major marginal commodity consumer operate level well peak efficiency, question quickly adopt efficient, exist technology determine relative price adjustment sustained. there much discussion contribution financial factor commodity boom. it appear low long-term interest rate past weakness u.s. dollar may play minor supportive roles. the impact outright speculation index investment le clear cut.10 if speculation keep spot price commodity substantially high level supply demand naturally intersect, inventory build incentive increase supply outstrip desire increase consumption. however, little evidence commodity diverse crude oil, wheat, aluminum. at point, bulk evidence suggest increase commodity price due fundamental strong demand weak supply. this appear durable relative price shift. that necessarily imply persistent price increases. demand supply adjust, particularly price pass through. in short term, low inventory suggest continue price volatility, may amplify trend-following speculation. what current boom mean canada although natural resource whole represent 6 per cent direct employment 12 per cent gdp, sector important influence canadian economic activity number channels. resource account roughly one-third business investment 45 per cent exports. a such, benefit current commodity boom felt across canada – resource-heavy sector regions. above all, rise commodity price make canada wealthy nation. since 2002, rise commodity price fuel 25 per cent improvement term trade, alone responsible roughly two-thirds 15 per cent gain real per caput disposable income record period. these income gain help reduce corporate leverage low level quarter century help government record consistent fiscal surpluses. high commodity price bring increase investment, entail direct indirect benefit sector question, also service sector support them. a well, many individual canadian – pension fund – benefit greatly gain value investment commodity-producing firms.11 finally, rise term trade bring associate appreciation currency benefit everyone low cost import good services. with downward pressure import prices, productivity- 10 for example, price many non-indexed commodity rise rapidly index ones. 11 the tsx energy sector rise roughly 18 per cent per year since begin 2002, metal mine sector 11 per cent annually fertilizer agricultural chemical sector 44 per cent annually. these sector combine weight 50.3 per cent tsx composite index. bi review 80/2008 3 enhance machinery equipment – much import – become le expensive firms, commodity producers. these benefit important. however, unavoidable large, sustain change term trade – whether favourable unfavourable – cause stress dislocation significant shift production employment among economic sectors. in macroeconomic terms, terms-of-trade shock trigger shift resource activity generate high income. from perspective, postpone adjustment would mean forgo potential income gain reallocation resource bring. adjustment always difficult, vital long-term economic prosperity. despite difficulty involved, adjustment process past year go smoothly previous periods. canada's labour force participation rate rise record high, jobless rate fall 33-year low. while manufacture sector lose one seven job since 2002 – total 335,000 job – total employment canada rise 1.6 million job period. equally encourage quality job created. more 80 per cent new job sector average hourly wage high manufacturing. canada's ability capitalize high commodity price (or mitigate impact low ones) depend crucially continue ability economy adjust. product labour market flexibility essential. the trade, investment, labour mobility agreement (tilma) alberta british columbia good example type response needed. it encourage government contemplate similar liberalizations. lesson previous boom before turn monetary policy considerations, i would like recall lesson last sustain upturn commodity prices. during 1970s, number commodity price spike – include oil prices, rise five-fold decade. like today, common driver include low real interest rate globally supply factors, particular, emergence opec. the decline newly float u.s. dollar also push oil price higher, along persistence inflation g-7 country inflation expectation begin rise. authority many oil-producing country act high price would persist indefinitely. they increase spend rapidly, would prove calamitous price reverse large structural deficit revealed. in canada, total program spend federal government rise 17 per cent gdp early 1970s 21 per cent decade later. in 1985, general government structural deficit peak 8 per cent potential gdp. we keep fresh mind memory herculean effort require eliminate drain future generations. the management monetary policy, hindsight, much better. authority many country mistakenly assume productivity gain experience previous quarter century would continue. rise unemployment taken, falsely, sign rise excess capacity. this ignore fact much industrial activity, indeed much society, base assumption perpetually cheap energy. the monetary authority day react oil-price shock accommodate price increase. view high price contractionary, loosen monetary policy avoid slowdown. the absence explicit nominal anchor policy make decision easy consequence far worse. a know now, assume excess supply illusory. the fallout error monetary fiscal policy severe. the global recession 1981-82 was, large measure, end result. in canada, consumer price inflation 4 bi review 80/2008 unemployment rate reach double digit early 1980s. the damage inflation expectation mean inflation would remain real present danger years. implication monetary policy current situation this experience relevant current situation. at fundamental level, underscore primary goal monetary policy keep inflation low, stable, predictable. while commodity-price shock raise complex issues, relentless focus inflation clarify policy decisions, make communication easier, maximize likelihood expectation remain well anchored. a credible inflation target help keep cost capital highlight relative price movements, thus allow individual firm make good investment decisions. in canada, develop well-functioning monetary policy framework base inflation target support flexible exchange rate. inflation target naturally lead monetary authority take discipline rigorous approach understand driver inflation. however, even best framework, execution everything. in face large commodity-price shock lifetimes, cannot complacent. indeed, current period exceptional volatility commodity price raise several issue conduct monetary policy. first, commodity boom underscore importance well-anchored inflation expectations. people's expectation future inflation influence actual future inflation rates. thus, risk high visibility energy price could lead increase inflation expectation general inflationary pressures. on hand, people recognize one-time increase commodity price temporary impact total cpi, price wage unaffected. the demand supply fundamental i discuss start give reason expect firm commodity prices, necessarily persistent – let alone accelerate – commodity-price increases. quite simply, high commodity price necessarily mean rise commodity prices. in fact, high price make commodity-price inflation le likely demand supply response provoke. the bank canada's clear commitment inflation target consistent past success achieve it, keep inflation expectation well anchored. the bank continue monitor movement inflation expectation use wide range survey market indicators. second, relatedly, bank need mindful possibility rise commodity price may affect relationship total core cpi. the experience canada total cpi persistently move towards core measure time.12 moreover, experience commodity-price inflation one least persistent form inflation. a consequence, pursuit 2 per cent target total cpi, use core measure operational guide. this because, years, core cpi good gauge underlie trend inflation good predictor future change total index total cpi itself. in practice, target total cpi inflation require high degree confidence future path commodity prices. the relationship core total cpi mark canada countries, reflect success anchor inflation expectation around 2 per cent fact that, major commodity exporter, movement dollar response commodity-price change generally provide offset reduce canadian-dollar price 12 see j. armour, "an evaluation core inflation measures" (working paper 2006-10, bank canada, 2006) j. hoddenbagh, m. johnson, e. santor, "total core inflation: recent international evidence" (bank canada work paper, forthcoming). bi review 80/2008 5 imports, include commodities. for example, past appreciation canadian dollar one reason food-price inflation markedly low canada rest develop world.13 overall, bank canada's commodity-price index (bcpi) rise half much canadian-dollar term u.s.-dollar terms, since 2002. the bank continue monitor stability relationship core total cpi. the bank also continue look range measure ass underlie trend inflation. considerable judgment must always applied, one measure rely exclusively. third, need consider possible impact high commodity price canada's potential growth. the bank spend great deal effort try understand factor shape potential output components. this focus potential mean le likely misread outlook productivity potential growth face large relative price shifts, thus avoid key policy mistake 1970s. in particular, need consider possibility combination canada's relatively high energy intensity,14 exploitation marginal resource deposit high price encourage, significant shift productive resource across economy could temporarily lead low productivity potential growth. there are, course, countervail force could raise potential growth, include strong capital investment incentive arise strong dollar tightness labour market. we make determination carefully provide update view october monetary policy report. fourth, pace nature recent commodity-price move important positive demand implications. a i mention earlier, large improvement term trade mean large increase canadian real income wealth. this fuel domestic demand, especially non-traded good services, provide timely offset weak external demand large trade partner, unite states. finally, central lesson past commodity boom (and busts) value flexible exchange rate shock absorber. a float exchange rate key element monetary policy framework allow canada pursue independent monetary policy appropriate economic circumstances. to absolutely clear, irrespective path commodity price specifically, global price movement generally, float exchange rate mean continue achieve inflation target. exchange rate movement act signal shift resource sector demand strongest. during asian crisis late 1990s, commodity price fell sharply. the result depreciation canadian dollar help significant necessary reallocation resource resource sector sectors, manufacturing, whose competitive position improved. in recent years, process work reverse. it important remember change term trade, adjustment follow. it question how. our float exchange rate help achieve appropriate adjustment without force difficult change overall level wages, output, prices. 13 canadian food-price inflation average 1.4 per cent past year, versus oecd average 4.3 per cent. reason include past appreciation canadian dollar, increase competition among food retailers, special factor excess supply meat. although factor consider temporary, may well apply future path food-price increases. 14 for instance, evidence unite state productivity slowdown 1970s concentrate sector energy intensive therefore hard hit energy shock. see w. nordhaus, "retrospective 1970s productivity slowdown" (working paper no. 10950, national bureau economic research, 2004). 6 bi review 80/2008 conclusion: current environment let close word current stance monetary policy. in addition sharply improve term trade drive commodity prices, canadian economy hit two major relate shocks: mark prolong slowdown u.s. economy severe dislocation financial markets. the challenge bank ass combine implication three force factor balance aggregate supply demand canadian economy prospect inflation canada. reflect severity persistence downside shocks, bank reduce key policy rate cumulative 150 basis point since december. in april monetary policy report, review force length lay base-case projection economy contain upside downside risk inflation. those risk judge balanced. we say time "some monetary stimulus likely required," note time "any monetary stimulus depend evolution global economy domestic demand, impact inflation canada." since then, development global economy relative expectation april lead bank decide 10 june maintain target overnight rate 3 per cent. commodity prices, measure bcpi, rise 10 per cent period decisions, future curve oil move sharply higher. this support domestic demand. other consideration include strong global growth previously expect high global inflation, increase risk higher-than-projected cost canadian imports. in addition, many downside risk inflation eased. for instance, price discount car books, follow move canadian dollar parity u.s. dollar, appear spread materially products. in addition, i note moment ago, risk remain potential growth weak currently assumed. although global financial condition remain strained, evolution line expectations. credit condition canada good elsewhere, evidence bank's decision may become first g-7 central bank begin withdraw extraordinary provision liquidity markets. thus, development since april shift balance risk inflation projection april mpr slightly upside. this evolution global economy domestic demand sufficient alter view "some monetary stimulus likely required." a result, bank judge current accommodative stance monetary policy appropriate bring aggregate demand supply back balance achieve 2 per cent inflation target. go forward, remain important downside upside risk inflation, risk judge evenly balanced. the bank continue monitor closely evolution development canadian global economy order ass implication aggregate supply demand outlook inflation. one thing certain: time, balance risk change again. monetary policy adjust accordingly, always remain focus achieve inflation target. in manner, bank canada make best contribution help canadian capitalize current commodity boom, famous bumper sticker remain relic. bi review 80/2008 7 donald l kohn: risk management implication systemic risk testimony mr donald l kohn, vice chairman board governor u federal reserve system, subcommittee securities, insurance, investment, committee banking, housing, urban affairs, u senate, washington dc, 19 june 2008. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * chairman reed, rank member allard member subcommittee, pleasure appear today discus several issue relate oversight financial institutions. first, i discus circumstance lead establishment temporary facility lend primary security dealer arrangement monitor financial condition. then, i describe federal reserve activity relate bank institution supervise, include concrete step address identify issue help institution improve risk management practices. finally, i briefly summarize plan enhancement consolidate supervision bank financial hold companies. federal reserve monitor activity relate primary dealer credit facility three month ago, board approve establishment primary dealer credit facility (pdcf). this action take pursuant section 13(3) federal reserve act, empower board governor authorize federal reserve bank lend corporation, include security firm, "unusual exigent" circumstance corporation cannot "secure adequate credit accommodation bank institutions." in so, board governor make necessary statutory find market circumstance indeed unusual exigent. we judge without increase access federal reserve liquidity major security firms, overall financial market condition would deteriorate would substantially adverse effect economy. we fully recognize use legal authority extraordinary step, consider necessary give circumstances. to quickly design implement facility provide liquidity, make use exist business relationship group 20 security firms, know primary dealers. the open market desk federal reserve bank new york trade u.s. government security primary dealer implement monetary policy behalf federal reserve system. the pdcf make available overnight fund sound primary dealer form loan secure collateral eligible pledge open market operations, plus investment-grade corporate, municipal, mortgage-backed asset-backed securities. the pdcf authorize minimum period six months. most primary dealer own either u.s. foreign bank organization approve u.s. financial hold companies. the u.s. financial hold company own primary dealer subject consolidate supervision federal reserve, primary dealer within financial hold company rely extensively security exchange commission (sec) functional regulator. the sec, rather federal reserve, serf consolidate supervisor major u.s. investment bank primary dealers. in connection establishment pdcf, create program monitor financial fund position primary dealers, focus primary dealer own financial hold companies. from beginning, coordinate closely sec, currently work agreement bi review 80/2008 1 agency enhance information share primary dealer part financial hold company not. the objective pdcf monitor program are: (1) establish basis inform judgment federal reserve liquidity capital position primary dealer access pdcf; (2) minimize risk availability finance pdcf undermine incentive consolidate entity manage capital liquidity level appropriate sustain period market disruption. the federal reserve's monitor program primary dealer include limit on-site presence four large investment bank narrow focus broad supervision examination state member banks, bank hold companies, u.s. operation foreign bank organizations. specifically, federal reserve supervise investment firm comprehensively ass risk management. rather, purpose specifically ass adequacy liquidity capital. to support monitor efforts, closely coordinate sec, receive internal information firm daily basis enable u identify change level composition firms' hold cash unencumbered, highly liquid assets. we also receive qualitative information regard posture counterparties client toward firms, include extent, any, firm encounter difficulty roll secure unsecured funding. in addition, along sec, assess firms' current plan capital position light near-term earn prospects. in area – liquidity capital – evaluate firms' effort and, sec, provide feedback senior management teams. broadly speaking, believe primary dealer strengthen liquidity capital position good protect extreme events. we also believe management learn valuable lesson event recent financial turmoil translate good risk management. we continue monitor effect pdcf study range option go forward. federal reserve supervisory activity i would like discus federal reserve's recent activity relate bank institution supervise. a i note testimony full committee june 5, recent event highlight number risk management lesson bank organizations, many document recent public reports.1 in testimony, i outline federal reserve's broad supervisory response recent events, include require bank institution improve risk management, augment exist supervisory guidance, necessary, enhance supervisory processes. naturally, risk management lesson recent event vary institution, since type deficiency differ institution fare good others. thus, supervisory efforts, take broad lesson apply institution needed. but point general area focus supervisory attention encourage good risk management bank institutions. for one, supervisor reinforce strengthen assessment test fundamental 1 president's work group financial market (2008), "policy statement financial market developments", march 13; financial stability forum (2008), "report financial stability forum enhance market institutional resilience", april 7; senior supervisor group (2008). "observations risk management practice recent market turbulence", march 6. 2 bi review 80/2008 risk management processes, require vigorous corrective action weakness identified. we ensure institution take comprehensive forward-looking approach risk management across entire firm, intensely verify assertion make bank management robustness risk management capabilities. supervisor also ensure bank understand full spectrum scale risk inherent increasingly complex bank activity potential risk crystallize time stress. in particular, bank must focus inter-relationships among risk types, respect area precipitate recent events, broadly. in light recent events, redouble effort ensure senior management properly define overall risk preference create incentive employee abide preferences, effective firm-wide limit controls. we remind bank importance information-sharing throughout entire organization danger information silos. in addition, strongly encourage institution improve and/or build risk functions, independent risk manager empower dig deep latent risks, include concentration often arise time stress. have give general think current supervisory issue supervisory approach improve risk management, i would like turn specific area address challenge face institution help bring improvement risk management. residential lend risk associate residential mortgage home equity lend remain top supervisory priority due continue negative trend home prices, elevate level delinquency foreclosures, slack demand residential mortgage security secondary markets. bank continue experience loss residential first mortgage loans, especially, exclusively, nonprime lending. loss home equity loan also increase significantly, even lender heavily involve subprime lending, loss severity percentage outstanding exposure product great first lien loans. and mortgage security market whose instrument support government-sponsored entity continue adversely affect problem house market, complicate banks' risk management sector. supervisor act several front address problem relate residential first second mortgages. first, make sure institution comply exist guidance nontraditional mortgage home equity loans, issue 2006 2005, respectively, well guidance subprime lend issue last year. and evaluate institution base risk management practice discuss guidance documents. we expect institution conduct rigorous stress test potential future loss relate residential mortgage loans, home equity lines, mortgage-backed securities. we continue encourage lender mortgage servicers work constructively borrower risk default consider prudent workout arrangement avoid unnecessary foreclosures. a know, federal reserve belief prudent workout arrangement consistent safe sound lend practice generally long-term best interest financial institution borrower. furthermore, work finalize propose amendment rule home ownership equity protection act propose december. the propose amendments, would apply creditors, would good protect consumer range unfair deceptive mortgage lend advertise practice source considerable concern criticism. our proposal include key protection higher-priced mortgage loan secure consumer's principal dwell address concern lender's assessment borrower's ability make schedule bi review 80/2008 3 payments, include verification consumer's income assets. the proposal also address concern prepayment penalty adverse impact consumer lender fail escrow tax insurance. protect consumer also benefit lender reduce delinquency default occur consumer understand cannot afford certain type loans. we work toward issue final regulation july. commercial real estate lend commercial real estate (cre) lend another area require close supervisory attention. in 2006, well cre market begin soften, property value begin level decline certain markets, fundamental begin turn somewhat negative, federal reserve bank agency issue guidance cre concentrations. we concern increase concentration cre loan portfolio many banks, especially small medium-sized lenders, make vulnerable soften market risk well managed. since then, delinquency construction loan begin rise, particularly residential construction loans, expect rise further. those institution high cre concentration geographic area suffer real estate pressure likely bear losses. further, significant slowdown origination commercial mortgage-backed security reduce banks' option manage cre portfolio risk secondary market. a i note march testimony condition u.s. bank industry, step review state member bank bank hold company exhibit concentration cre, especially area country exhibit sign weakness. we continue monitor banks' adherence supervisory guidance i noted. these effort include monitor carefully potential impact low valuation cre exposures. through reviews, identify weakness banks' risk management practices, include underwrite practices, appraisal processes, stress testing, market analysis. base results, update supervisory plan examination schedule focus resource effectively institution present great risk need improvement. finally, conclude federal reserve examiner train effort cre topics, include appraisal practices, loan loss allowances, stress testing, board management oversight. the train focus importance ensure prudent risk management practices, without unduly curtail credit availability. counterparty credit risk concern financial market creditworthiness financial intermediary ease somewhat since first half march, concern remain relatively high. more fundamentally, proper management counterparty credit risk – risk loss counterparty's failure perform financial obligation – prerequisite protect entire system contagion one institution fails. consistent recommendation recent reports, look firm address weakness counterparty credit risk management practice highlight recent events, include measurement aggregation exposure stem wide range transaction unregulated regulate entities. for instance, emphasize firm use variety technique measure potential exposure over-the-counter (otc) derivatives, repurchase agreements, contracts, aggregate exposure counterparty. in context, closely monitor counterparty exposure arise transaction monoline financial guarantor discuss bank measurement management positions. 4 bi review 80/2008 in addition, work strengthen market infrastructure financial transaction make robust resilient. in particular, federal reserve bank new york continue work domestic international prudential supervisor otc derivative dealer strengthen infrastructure large rapidly grow markets. the supervisor emphasize major dealer active market participant importance set standard accuracy timeliness trade data submission timeliness resolution error trade match otc derivative contracts. furthermore, consistent recommendation make recent report turbulence financial markets, supervisor encourage development industry longer-term plan integrate operational infrastructure support otc derivative capture significant process event entire lifecycle trades, deliver operational reliability, maximize efficiency obtainable automation electronic process platforms. in addition support robust exposure measurement capture, enhancement strengthen participants' ability manage counterparty risk loss mitigation technique use net collateral agreements. we encourage recent industry effort address counterparty credit risk, plan extend central counterparty clearinghouse service credit derivative initiatives. credit card credit card charge-offs continue rise past several quarters, although charge-offs remain well early 2002 peak. not surprisingly, bank report delinquency rate unsecured consumer debt generally high area experience significant home price depreciation increase unemployment. in response trends, many issuer tighten credit standard reduce exposure high risk markets. rise delinquency increase card usage report recent month likely push charge-off level high future quarters. therefore, continue monitor credit card market consumer lend sector potential weaknesses. the federal reserve also take step toward improve consumer protection credit card users. our first step board's 2007 proposal substantially revise improve credit card disclosure truth lend act. in prepare proposal, conduct extensive consumer test determine type format information consumer find useful shop choose credit card. this extensive consumer test – thousand public comment proposal – suggest disclosure may provide sufficient consumer protection regard certain practices. therefore, recently propose rule federal trade commission act protect consumer financial harm cause practices. if implemented, propose rule would require financial institution make change business model alter practices. the federal reserve develop proposal jointly office thrift supervision national credit union administration. we continue use consumer test work toward issue final rule credit card year-end. commercial lend commercial lend activity, aside sector leverage lending, markedly affect recent volatility financial markets, may encounter difficulty slow economic growth persist. lender investor demand strict underwrite standard high return commercial loans. with regard condition exist commercial loan portfolios, delinquency rise recently volume criticize assets. this evident leverage loan market, lend standard appear weaken noticeably recent years, tend susceptible soft economic conditions. bi review 80/2008 5 supervisor monitor banks' commercial lend activities, particularly leverage loan portfolios, detect weakness asset quality may result slow economic condition ensure appropriate risk management practices. in part, agency rely share national credit (snc) program ass credit quality banks' commercial loan portfolios. the 2008 review underway provide additional insight condition large syndicate credit share three banks, include evaluation underwrite practice trend leverage loan market broad syndicate loan market. adequacy loan loss allowance a bank system face difficult environment recent quarters, examiner identify significant weakness institution identify reserve problem loans, case lead deficiency allowance level supervise institutions. in response, examiner continue remind banker allowance level reflective loan portfolio quality, base sound processes, consistent current supervisory guidance. we recently provide additional clarity examiner regard exist interagency guidance loan loss allowance factor current examination inspection state member banks, bank hold companies, nonbank subsidiaries. we believe clarity examination staff help regular discussion banker ensure reserve practice robust loan loss allowance indeed adequate circumstance face institution. liquidity risk management recent report cite need enhancement liquidity risk management one key lesson recent events. financial institution must understand liquidity need legal entity enterprise-wide level prepare possibility market liquidity may erode quickly, unexpectedly, protract time. a widely recognized, many contingency fund plan adequately prepare possibility certain off-balance-sheet exposure might bring onto firm's balance sheet, call available liquidity. nor adequately account possibility widespread protract decline asset market liquidity. while liquidity pressure bank financial market ease late, recognize institution must prepare possibility liquidity problem could return, either market-wide individual institution. supervisor work institution improve liquidity risk management practices. for instance, review banks' contingent fund need source funding. we ensure banker develop appropriate short-term long-term liquidity risk management strategies. consistent find recent reports, emphasize importance appropriate stress test liquidity need maintenance robust liquidity buffers. in addition, work colleague basel committee bank supervision enhance exist guidance management liquidity risks, release two day ago. that work draw recent ongoing effort liquidity risk public private sector intend strengthen banks' liquidity risk management improve global supervisory practices. of course, federal reserve undertake number program bolster market liquidity. capital need clearly, capital critical defense unexpected losses. even recent turmoil, u.s. bank system remain well capitalized. however, i note june 5 testimony, encourage institution raise capital needed, part well position take advantage future opportunity support strengthen 6 bi review 80/2008 financial condition rebound economic growth. and recent capital injection bank organization financial institution good sign investor see value institution bank industry whole. to ass sufficiency firms' capacity absorb unexpected loss wide range sources, federal reserve supervisor heighten review capital analysis forecast bank organizations. examiner review reasonableness assumption bank organization use ass capital need emphasize forward-looking analysis. for example, evaluate banks' use stress scenario see adequately incorporate range possible event properly identify potential capital need capacity across firms. the scenario address number possible factor include unexpected balance sheet expansion, earn deterioration across key business lines, stress-level loss generate variety position multiple sources. in addition, last year federal reserve conduct review across number large bank organization ass firms' use so-called "economic capital" practices, mean firm calculate, internal purposes, capital need give risk profile. consistent findings, find bank rely extensively output internal models, view model output appropriate skepticism. model dependent data use construct them. when data history short draw mostly period benign economic conditions, model result may fully applicable institution's risk profile. we conclude bank would generally benefit good evaluation input use internal capital models, strong validation models, broad use stress test scenario analysis supplement inherent limitation models. we incorporate result horizontal review current assessment banks' overall capital adequacy, well use evaluate banks' readiness meet requirement pillar 2 basel ii bank develop internal process ass overall capital adequacy, beyond regulatory capital measures. consolidate supervision program the supervisory activity describe intend address many risk management lapse see past year, pertain shortcoming firm-wide risk identification measurement. consistent regular effort improve supervisory practices, realize program consolidate supervision could enhance make systematic. supervise consolidate bank organization require review risk enterprise-wide basis, review risk contain subsidiary legal entity. to end, federal reserve near completion enhancement supervisory guidance clarify role consolidate supervisor bank financial hold companies. the update consolidate supervision guidance, publicly available, primarily intend provide great clarity examination staff. for example, provide consistent federal reserve supervisory practice assessment across institution similar activity risks, detail expectation understand assess primary governance function risk controls, material business lines, nonbank operations, fund liquidity management, consumer compliance, key activity risks. in sense forthcoming guidance consistent federal reserve supervisory action i

federal reserve's umbrella supervision role closely complement central bank responsibilities, include objective foster financial stability deter manage financial crises. the information, expertise,

mr durmuş yılmaz, governor central bank republic turkey, euromoney turkey finance & investment forum, istanbul, 18 june 2008. * * * dear guests, i delight address distinguish audience istanbul. i hope timely important forum contribute much debate future growth prospect turkey, explore many prominent issues. let begin recent development international market impact turkish economy. a may know, develop emerge country suffer high inflation low growth rate while. there two main reason behind undesirable economic situation. one turbulence emerge second half 2007 financial markets; one continuously increase global commodity prices. the second half 2007 easy period central banker – 2008 likely even challenging. there apparent acceleration consumer price inflation world annual inflation even develop country high level last 16 years. improvement wealth big develop country china india create demand-driven pressure commodity prices. moreover, utilization foodstuff bio-fuels production combine unfavorable weather condition last year lead increase commodity prices. despite economic slowdown expectation develop countries, surge commodity price continue 2008 oil price reach usd 140 per barrel. on hand, sub-prime mortgage crisis start u.s. mid 2007 grow level threaten stability financial system many countries. the growth expectation scale back significantly. the turbulence might also negative implication turkish economy. nevertheless, economic indicator show turkish economy’s resistant fluctuation global market increase substantially, compare previous episode turbulences. the current relative resilience outcome successfully decisively implement macroeconomic policy since 2001 together comprehensive structural reforms. still, face challenge now. the year-on-year consumer price inflation climb double-digit level may probably remain high till last quarter year decline gradually. moreover, growth rate gdp stand 4.5% 2007, compare 2001-2006 period, 7.2% average. dear guests, turkey several comparative advantage compare many counterpart support high growth rate medium term. the first one demographic structure. turkey young skilled population one important ingredient economic growth. more half turkey’s population age 30. however, unemployment rate young population stand 21.2%. in order unleash potential, need keep investment high level utilize human capital effectively. since domestic save rate turkey high enough finance investments, need attract foreign savings, imply bi review 79/2008 1 current account deficit. but good news quality finance improve significantly recent years. the fdi inflow usd 20 billion last two years. nevertheless, i say ratio greenfield fdi total fdi relatively low yet. i believe greenfield fdi also increase follow year keep macroeconomic political stability place continue improve business environment. the second comparative advantage i would like underline convergence story turkey european union. step take negotiation process undoubtedly increase momentum turkey help unlock growth potential country. european union membership medium-term anchor party turkey adhere aim decisively. dear guests, the best way central bank could support sustainable growth reach maintain price stability, especially country experience high chronic inflation decades. a may know, turkey adopt full-fledged inflation-targeting regime 2006. look back, one notice protract period rise food energy price lead significant shoot inflation target since adoption inflation target regime. this increase stickiness inflation expectations, economic agent become backward looking. under normal conditions, supply shock expect alter relative price rather underlie inflation trend. nevertheless, fact several long last shock appear concurrently increase risk price set behavior. our revise projection incorporate late development suggest take relatively long time inflation reach 4 percent level. even importantly, current inflation target long seem serve nominal anchor short term. inflation target regime one monetary policy regime regime rule frameworks. our main policy document publish december 2005 describe framework inflation-targeting regime. 24th paragraph document state that: “a pre-announced inflation target shall change event sharp long-term deviation target expect medium-term target long make sense due factor beyond control monetary policy. at point, new target set government respect law.” the paragraph i read completely define recent condition explain revise inflation target 2009 2010. under conditions, revision inflation target become technical necessity. therefore, central bank turkey propose government revise target 2009 2010 7.5 6.5 percent, respectively; set target 2011 5.5 percent, government accept proposal. i would like re-emphasize that, treat revise target symmetrically. monetary policy aim keep inflation revise target path. dear guests, we stick price stability objective. at time, aware challenge face. first all, rapid rise food price may permanent expect due rapid economic growth, slowdown agricultural productivity employment shift agriculture industries. consider fact food high share consumption basket develop economies, include turkey, would lead decouple inflation rate industrialize world develop country year come. 2 bi review 79/2008 similarly, commodity price may remain elevate foreseeable future, may prove challenge turkey particular. note turkey net commodity importer contrast many develop countries. last, least, price stability necessitate stability financial markets. we need put house order attract foreign capital long-term horizon, rather highly mobile short-term capital. i believe structural reform together macroeconomic stability, fiscal discipline prudent monetary policy create necessary economic environment achieve maintain sustainable growth rate price stability future. thank you. bi review 79/2008 3 gertrude tumpel-gugerell: european financial integration harmonisation speech m gertrude tumpel-gugerell, member executive board european central bank, international bankers’ club, luxembourg, 16 june 2008. * * * lady gentlemen, first all, i would like thank mr. carlo thill board director international bankers’ club luxembourg invite speak occasion today. i glad share view distinguish audience international bankers’ club luxembourg, always show strong interest european union matters. in speech today i focus need european financial integration harmonisation, ecb’s endeavour support objectives, particular two important central bank services: target2 target2-securities. let say always pleasure luxembourg, country whose historic strategic importance date back found roman era fortress site, country represent junction roman europe germanic europe, unite custom draw rather distinct traditions. luxembourg prove pioneer. it found member european union, unite nations, participate emu first day 1999. the evolution city significant financial centre strengthen character international metropolis. a jean monnet said: "the small city become cross-road europe". i see luxembourg microcosm europe tomorrow i sincerely hope success, high gdp per caput world, inspire part europe. in respect, topic create single european financial market relevant since help increase economic growth prosperity every member state. it increase consumer choice, open multitude new investment opportunities, strengthen eu bank sector make europe centre financial innovation. i sure share ambition – question – course – arise make happen? well, proverb says: “where there’s there's way”. that means, determine undergo necessary change lead integrate harmonize european financial market. that seem “way” go! let clear. the single european financial market require support emerge itself. integration harmonization intend promote economic well-being increasingly integrate financial market ignore national boundary broaden geographic domain financial institution customer make decisions. competition inescapable global dimension, even many small businesses. lady gentlemen, i explain neither benefit intense competition, risk adapt. we eurosystem want support private sector’s adaptation success promote integration harmonization financial system. both enable realisation economy scales; foster competition expansion markets, facilitate efficient allocation better-priced capital. a may recall, european financial integration objective address detail lisbon march 2000, eu leader adopt ten-year programme (the lisbon bi review 78/2008 1 agenda). the financial service action plan consist set 42 measures, design strengthen european financial industry encourage free market access, competition creation efficient markets. some measure take shape eu law, either regulation directive, market financial instrument directive (mifid) collateral directive. these undoubtedly liberate competitive forces, positive result europe. other initiative allocate user markets. in particular, provider security market infrastructure adopted, encouragement commissioner mr mccreevey, code conduct, commit meet certain standard area price transparency, open access interoperability, service unbundling. while progress, jury still whether provider co-operate enough achieve high level interoperability require integrate infrastructure. a alexander schaub european commission say several year ago dublin, “financial integration simply question turn declare single market open business”.1 we need accelerate harmonization, removal, issue barrier cross-border business – market practices, discriminatory provision domestic protectionist barrier – cross-border business europe become truly domestic. indeed, already helped, various ways, removal barrier efficient competitive market identify giovannini group, example provide advice european commission regulatory aspect need addressed. let turn target2, new rtgs system settlement real time predominantly high-value euro payment central bank money perfect example ecb’s contribution integrate harmonize financial markets. target2 provide single integrate platform replace 20 decentralize technical target platforms. it work well start provide core, integrate borderless infrastructure europe needs. to give flavour scale service, first week complete final migration target2 process 1.72 million payment amount total 16.5 trillion euro. target2 practical example successful delivery eurosystem banks, work together, integrate infrastructure embody process harmonization. i also wish congratulate banque centrale du luxembourg luxembourguise bank community occasion remarkable contribution excellent preparatory work, help pioneer migration new system november last year. i would like turn another large integration project – namely target2 securities, t2s, commonly known. in contrast current fragment scenario, t2s deliver single technical platform provide secure real time delivery versus payment class european security central bank money, replace dozen local platforms. this create single pool securities, available market user service provider choose csd. with t2s, concept cross-border settlement europe disappear. t2s integrate security settlement infrastructure well embody harmonization important area common interfaces, common set rule intra-day settlement finality, common daily timetable, common messages. these feature immediate contribution elimination 6 15 so-called giovannini barriers. 1 alexander schaub- european commission: “removing regulatory barrier international finance: pointer eu single market”. dublin, 30th march. 2 bi review 78/2008 this – course – create substantial gain financial sector, also society whole, reduction cost good allocation resources. there doubt economic gain substantial. t2s contribute increase competition, transparent price facilitate overall trade activity. since t2s operate public entity, eurosystem, t2s rely operate fair way profit basis. furthermore, central banker’s perspective, effective post trade structure – achieve t2s – contribute global resilience financial market hence constitute important element safeguard financial stability. moreover, t2s contribute low cost capital, hence contribute general growth financial market overall economic growth. let add post trade cost u much low level europe. therefore, need make europe competitive global financial market, t2s important contribution regard. thank effort make hundred expert 80 european institution eurosystem last year, govern council ecb able last week invite european csds express support t2s. we distribute european csds detail user requirements, economic impact analysis, description governance next project phase, presentation harmonization effort context t2s, outcome transparent constructive consultation process, cooperate csds market users. let point element economic impact study also find website. the analysis conclude cost settlement reduce substantially 73 cent csd charge average today 32 cent per transaction t2s. these cost even reduce csds decide join t2s project. these number represent narrow business case capture – course – full dynamic impact t2s arise enhance competition single market security settlement. let stress one skeptical precise number i mentioned, definitely skeptical overall benefit competitive integrate european financial market. t2s develop pure harmonization spirit exclude – course – specific functionality support local practices. this mean t2s prevent csds support local practices; however give concern – include legislator regulator – opportunity consider whether preservation long term interest relevant economy. we work t2s stakeholder identify topic harmonize future. these topic fall three categories: harmonization within scope t2s, harmonization implement private sector harmonization may require action public authorities. it clear eurosystem promote implement issue directly harmonize within t2s. a regard private sector, expect market transformation induce t2s offer market participant develop implement harmonization initiatives, example field corporate actions. the eurosystem welcome much effort towards harmonization stand ready give support needed. a regard harmonization carry public authorities, would fall responsibility european commission body work groups, cesame, legal certainty group (lcg) fiscal compliance expert group fisco. work industry leader expert t2s advisory group, we, ecb eurosystem advise cooperate bodies, firm eye need progress. to focus effort, intend present progress report achieve degree harmonization ecb’s govern council early 2009. bi review 78/2008 3 overall, integration harmonization become core objective european union; european body determine support european financial industry increase competitiveness give access efficient, state art financial infrastructure support true single market. the eurosystem ready firmly commit deliver t2s state-of-the-art settlement system market via csds 2013 latest. it also clear, eurosystem cannot alone. a substantial financial investment need make build t2s, need support commitment csds. we ask european csds express – 4 july – support t2s project. we sure csds consult client stakeholders, many already express strong support, often also public. the govern council take account feedback meet 17th july decide eurosystem support t2s project. a president trichet say many occasion “it not, respect, time complacency”. while please get far fast, need keep fast pace. we ready start next phase project immediately – hopefully – positive decision govern council order meet next milestone: define next level detail form general functional specification. this make possible t2s live late 2013. lady gentlemen, behalf eurosystem, let conclude thank distinguish representative bank sector contribution successful completion work do far, ask continue support co-operation. thank much. 4 bi review 78/2008 anselmo l s teng: risk compensation management open remark mr anselmo l s teng, chairman monetary authority macao, macau management association (mma) 2008 annual management conference, macao, 14 june 2008. * * * council chairman lau distinguish guest dear delegate lady gentlemen, good morning! 1. i honour invite macau management association make open remark conference, theme which, “navigating complex change corporate strategies”, timely relevant, especially organizations, big small, face lot threat challenges, internal external, globalise environment nowadays. a aware, business definition corporate strategy direction organization take objective achieve business success long term. i’ll use sub-prime fallout example illustrate two important aspect within corporate strategies, i.e. risk relate aspect human resource relate aspects. 2. the turbulence international financial market cause subprime fallout probably linger another 1-2 years. the rescue action adopt central bank develop economy prevent major financial calamity happen impact global economy financial market remain quite while. there exact figure overall subprime losses. the estimate make financial expert international institution range usd400 billion usd1 trillion. the loss bear financial institution individual investors. the investor suffer loss inevitably cut back investment perhaps consumption. the loss incur financial institution develop economy however inflict serious repercussions. the immediate effect overall shrinkage liquidity international financial markets. the devastate impact reduction lend capacity financial institution write-off provision delinquent loan and/or investment directly eat shareholders’ fund financial institution. 3. after subprime crisis, financial expert around world start find reason happen propose way prevent similar mistake happen again. there lot find boil big topic – “risk management”. in past years, financial technological innovation give rise number subprime relate product come financial institutions. these include subprime loans, collateralize debt obligation (cdo), structure investment vehicle (siv) exotic financial products. a matter fact, large number risk management tool risk management models, ratings, credit default swap (cds) emerge subprime cycle. but unfortunately fallout still occur essence reflect inadequate risk management. financial post mortem analysis suggest financial institution suffer seriously subprime fallout fail mitigate number risks, market risk, liquidity risk, concentration risk counter party risk etc. that say, corporate strategy far risk mitigation concern incomplete, untimely commensurate business bi review 78/2008 1 profile development. a financial institutions, organization different business nature, offer sophisticate product service order achieve business success, associate risk on-going risk management framework. this particularly true grow size complexity, ability identify, define, measure, manage, organize manage risks; reflect element appropriate corporate strategy utmost importance. 4. besides risk management, however, also one aspect apply management virtually trades. the human resource part corporate strategy relate management coherent organization’s value asset – people work individually collectively contribute achievement objective business. the goal human resource management strategy help organization meet strategic goal attracting, maintain employee also manage effectively. in practice, human resource management incorporate vast number issue include, confine to, recruitment, workforce planning, orientation, skill, train last, least, compensation. we admit compensation, amongst motivate factors, effective drive force behind person’s desire perform workplace. there many paper write appropriate compensation scheme. one many school think performance relate pay money pay someone relate well performs. car salesmen, real estate agents, production line workers, example, may pay way, commission. this compensation scheme base belief money main incentive increase productivity. this scheme cannot apply universally limitation although widely adopt number field prove successful. the tool however double edge knife financial sector vindicate conviction. 5. one cause subprime bubble pay structure adopt financial institution launch subprime products. during subprime cycle, financial institution pursue compensation scheme give incentive personnel involve subprime product chase high income risky trading, launch risky product generally provide high rate return. bonus payment successful senior investment bankers, include business hold subprime positions, substantial. essentially, bonus measure gross revenue personnel costs, formal account take quality sustainability earnings. we admit greed part human nature. in face profit, quality product hence revenue derive therefrom could compromised. the phenomenon common among institution staff involve subprime trade, top management, originators, agent traders. 6. all enterprises, confine financial institutions, learn lesson that, maintain sustainable growth entity, compensation scheme future adequately reflect performance medium long term well. a matter fact, compensation scheme staff involve subprime bubble common feature enormous reward deal also failure impose penalty symmetrically loss occurred. to put nutshell, viable compensation scheme well structure gear long term corporate target strategy rather short term profit. 2 bi review 78/2008 7. i hope open remark risk management compensation management kick series discussion management facet business. expert season practitioner different trade go share u views, experience insight resonate today’s theme “navigating complex challenge corporate strategies”. i sure conclusion conference enable attendee formulate correct corporate strategy navigate uncharted water contemporary global economy. finally, please accept best wish huge success visionary conference. thank you. bi review 78/2008 3 nout wellink: the significant role microfinance supervisory issue speech dr nout wellink, president netherlands bank chairman basel committee bank supervision, ing microfinance seminar “a billion gain – next phase”, amsterdam, 16 june 2008. * * * introduction 1. i please join today speak many microfinance experts. before start i would like commend conference organiser put together comprehensive programme important topic. microfinance become ever relevant, therefore doubt need keep agendas. today, i want touch upon two issues. i start significant increase role microfinance combat poverty world. this role cannot call “micro” anymore. then, i discus supervisory issue follow microfinance concept. microfinance boom 2. to start with: microfinance booming! it start 1970s nobel price laureate mohamed yunus, first experiment provision small –or micro- loan people bangladesh. he found famous grameen bank. and nowadays, cannot deny microfinance successfully enable extremely impoverish people, especially women, engage self-employment projects. these people previously consider unbankable, typically meet even minimal qualification gain access traditional credit, steady employment verifiable credit history. microfinance allow generate income begin build wealth ultimately exit poverty. the term microfinance generally use provision financial services, case micro-loans, poor, many people begin realise opportunities. indeed, concept microfinance accept effective mean reach poor. and conviction confine charitable institutions, beyond doubt call worldwide drive. microfinance institution notably expand loan portfolios. data the microfinance information exchange show period 2001-2006, number micro credit borrower year increase average 19%. over time period, average loan portfolio grow annual 30%. this huge. for comparison, eu-25, average loan portfolio growth reach mere 6.4%. by end 2006, globally 1100 mfis active, comprise 59 million borrowers. also save account surge, total 16 billion u dollar 2006 68 million savers. 3. meanwhile, also private organisation investor find way microfinance microfinance institutions, devote ample resource them. although exact figure available, estimate 2006 worldwide $ 4 5 billion invest microfinance institutions. especially investor long-term perspective, pension funds, consider microfinance attractive investment. this wonder: usually return line market averages, risk relatively low. moreover, microfinance show low correlation international financial market hence provide diversification benefits. 4. and top this, see today, microfinance start attract increase interest commercial banks, include ing. one element evidence interest financial support provide way loan investment microfinance institutions. but opinion, second element far important: namely share expertise bi review 78/2008 1 bank business provision assistance training. enhance cooperation exist financial institution microfinance institution contribute development local financial markets. for example, commercial bank may help microfinance institution expand portfolio save services, vary loan product insurance, microfinance institution turn may facilitate development commercial banks’ customer base. furthermore, microfinance institution may build upon exist it risk management infrastructure commercial banks. 5. another reason remarkable growth microfinance sector new technological development quickly pick up. recently, i come across internet organisation set enable private individual lend money poor people develop countries. the creditor actually see choose person lend. the money transfer person via local microfinance institution. another innovative feature concept loan provider receive regular update borrower. this bring benefit microfinance really doorstep! and look, instance, telecommunication industry. rapid innovation make possible conduct bank operation via mobile phone. for banks, offer opportunity transmit loan application check credit detail instantly. for microfinance, mean real breakthrough. a know, core problem microfinance institution geographically wide dispersion client base. this make difficult serve client remote area drive expenditures. operational cost high 15 20% loans, compare le 5% bank industrialise countries. the introduction mobile phone bank make possible reach million people, fraction second without high cost establish extensive network offices. such cost save important microfinance institutions, allow reduce interest rate margin impair profitability. 6. these positive figure truly good news. a central banker, i care economic growth reliable function financial markets. and microfinance clearly contribute goals. for one, microfinance stimulate household start business activities. access credit allow poor people take advantage economic opportunities, thus contribute local economic development job creation. second, microfinance fill gap traditional financial infrastructure, provide lend poor. indeed, broad access financial service key characteristic deep efficient financial system. it encourage see market take role previously perform government ngos. and third, microfinance institution become real financial intermediary also offer deposit facility households. a such, microfinance help household smoothen consumption time, reduce save borrow constraints. such constraint particularly relevant poor household income often uncertain generally lack collateral. at time, deposit form additional fund base microfinance institution decrease dependency external funding. in ways, microfinance enhance economic growth, enrich financial market increase welfare individual households. role prudential supervisor 7. but one reason interest microfinance. the one follow role prudential supervisor. this bring second remark i want make today. so far, growth microfinance has, large, occur outside regulatory framework. but depositor, expect bank safe take undue risk, retrieve money times. if bank accept much risk, may long able meet obligation depositors. therefore, countries, license bank allow attract deposit public. license bank subject prudential supervision comply extensive strict set regulations. the prudential supervisor require banks, example, place effective risk management 2 bi review 78/2008 system screen, price manage risks. for microfinance institutions, protection depositor especially important. if microfinance institution run trouble cannot repay depositors, affect large group people buff cushion loss. the effect failure individual borrowers´ families´ life disastrous. 8. the need depositor protection underline find quality micro credit portfolio may deteriorate rapidly. if debtor unable repay loans, may induce debtor default loan well. this perverse incentive may especially strong case credit provide group persons. furthermore, micro credit risk usually correlate traditional bank, since loan portfolio generally consist relatively homogenous group people depend regional economy. also, cost generally high microfinance institution may small financial buffers. at time, many case difficult microfinance institution raise additional capital short notice. for deposit-taking microfinance institutions, prudential supervision hence high relevance. 9. though agree prudential supervision microfinance institution needed, yet clear supervision actually comprise. compliance prudential rule costly supervise entity may especially burdensome microfinance institutions. under circumstances, supervision may even stifle valuable boom sector microfinance. in devise supervisory framework microfinance activities, therefore take unique characteristic microfinance account. most conspicuous characteristic perhaps lack physical collateral. other characteristic specific microfinance institution need take account quick turnover rate, high operational cost different lend process. also know-your-customer requirement burdensome, many poor people passport proof identity. 10. we also need mindful large difference microfinance activity microfinance institution one country another. for instance brazil, popular form microfinance use correspondent banking, term “branchless banking”. due sheer size country, commercial bank locate main city could offer financial service people distinct village 1999. with lift several regulation year, commercial bank allow set relationship non-financial non-bank firm provide wide range services. many bank contract local chains, instance grocery stores, pharmacies, etc., allow handle simple bank operation behalf financial institution. however, financial institution ultimate provider financial service remain responsible end. in india, 1999s, microfinance evolve quite successfully so-called self help groups. in groups, 10 20 person pool savings, collectively obtain loan lend other. and bolivia, successful microfinance institution incorporate commercial bank 1992. 11. but despite differences, microfinance supervision cannot complete divergent regime. a different supervisory framework microfinance activity carry risk unbalance international level play field. moreover, many bank standard already offer flexibility allow level complexity size institutions, level risk existence international activities. and same, supervision microfinance institution need harmful per se. adequate supervision may also enhance perceive legitimacy microfinance institution improve operational management, due instance high standard report financial control. this may broaden access funding, allow expand financial activity serve clients. furthermore, may exist positive relationship development supervisory guidance microfinance activity supervision general. so take together, search tailor-made solution within scope exist regulation. bi review 78/2008 3 12. one solution find basel core principles. to support supervisor worldwide build improve set prudential regulations, basel committee bank supervision develop set minimum standard sound supervision. the core principle provide benchmark wide range supervisory aspects, area licensing, capital adequacy, risk management, more. in total 25 principles. but, i stress, principles, rules, require specification. the basel committee consider many principle would also appropriate non-bank financial institution offer deposit lend service similar provide banks. but committee also recognize category institution may regulate differently bank long hold, collectively, significant proportion deposit financial system. however, need form regulation commensurate type size transactions. how tailor regulation unique characteristic microfinance activities? the basel committee currently work illustrate form regulation take, keep mind diversity sector. that effort collective one, committee work together supervisor world committee’s international liaison group, well imf, world bank, cgap regional group bank supervisors. conclude remark 13. lady gentlemen, i conclude. microfinance booming. it widely acknowledge effective way reach poor. and, i say beginning, belief confine charitable institutions, felt world over. still, current market size form small part estimate global demand microfinance services. a such, broaden financial service offer microfinance institutions, specifically deposit-taking facility offer many microfinance institutions, welcome development. in parallel this, role prudential supervisor become ever relevant. prudential supervision contribute inclusive financial system take account specific characteristic microfinance disturb international level play field. the effort basel international liaison group important step forward regard. furthermore, adequate supervision may enhance perceive legitimacy microfinance institutions, improve operational management extend access funding. in way, microfinance contribute economic development country, also enrich financial system financial supervision. so maybe, rather “a billion gain”, it’s question “billions gain”! thank you. 4 bi review 78/2008 ben s bernanke: challenge health-care reform speech mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, senate finance committee health reform summit, washington dc, 16 june 2008. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * improve performance health-care system without doubt one important challenge nation faces. in recent decades, improvement medical knowledge standard care allow people live healthier, longer, productive lives. new medical technology treatment promise good come. from social point view, hope many people possible benefit advances. but health care scientific social issue; economic issue well. the decision make health-care reform affect many aspect economy, include pace economic growth, wage live standards, government budgets, name few. by measure, health-care sector represent major segment economy. spend health-care service currently exceed 15 percent gross domestic product (gdp). indeed, health-care spend single large component personal consumption – large spend either house food. importantly, health care also long been, continue be, one fastest-growing sector economy: over past four decades, sector grown, average, rate 2-1/2 percentage point fast gdp. should rate growth continue, health spend would exceed 22 percent gdp 2020 reach almost 30 percent gdp 2030.1health-related spend also large grow share government budgets. last year, health care account one-quarter total federal spending. the congressional budget office (cbo) project that, current policies, health spend account almost one-half federal non-interest outlay 2050.2as public interest issue testifies, stake associate health-care reform, economic social, high. but must keep mind that, problems, u.s. health-care system also many strengths. we must take care lose good system try address significant concern certainly exist. in remainder remarks, i discus three key challenge health-care reform. these challenge are, short, issue access, quality, cost. challenge health-care reform access access health care first major challenge health-care reform must address. in 2006, total 47 million americans, almost 16 percent population, lack health insurance. although federal state government spend $35 billion finance uncompensated care 2004, evidence nonetheless indicate uninsured person 1 congressional budget office (2007). 2 ibid. bi review 78/2008 1 receive le health care insure health suffer consequence. per caput expenditure health care uninsured individual are, average, roughly half fully insure individuals.3 people uninsured le likely receive preventive screen services, le likely receive appropriate care manage chronic illnesses, likely die prematurely cancer – largely tend diagnose disease advanced.4 one recent study find uninsured victim automobile accident receive 20 percent le treatment hospital 37 percent likely die injury insured.5 quality the second key challenge improve quality health care. the quality medical research, training, technology unite state generally high. however, quality health care determine by, say, technological advance prevent treat disease also ability deliver benefit advance patients. for maximum impact, advance medical knowledge must widely disseminate consistently efficiently implemented. but evidence suggest disturb gap quality health service provide principle quality health service actually provide practice. for example, 2000, institute medicine issue landmark report conclude 98,000 american die year hospital result medical errors.6 many error identify report – example, error cause adverse drug events, improper transfusions, wrong-site surgery, mistake patient identity – could prevent hospital adopt appropriate safety systems. although hospital implement number new safety practice since time report, scope improve patient safety remain large.7inconsistent use best practice doctor hospital also surprisingly widespread. for example, numerous study point lack adherence evidence-based guideline treatment heart attacks. in particular, long well establish restore blood flow heart use aspirin, beta blockers, ace inhibitor appropriate time significantly reduce death result heart attacks.8 yet study show dissemination treatment occur slowly.9 more widespread application evidence-based medicine could help health-care worker make good use medical knowledge already improve patients' outcomes. although patient receive care need, others receive (and expensive) care necessary. research geographic variation health-care practice cost confirm point. for example, medicare expenditure per eligible recipient vary widely across regions, yet area high expenditure appear good health outcome low expenditures; indeed, reverse seem true.10 3 hadley holohan (2004). 4 institute medicine (2002). 5 doyle (2005). 6 institute medicine (2000). 7 leape berwick (2005). 8 beta blocker ace inhibitor drug relieve stress heart. 9 joint commission (2007). 10 skinner, staiger, fischer (2006). 2 bi review 78/2008 cost this observation bring third important challenge health-care reform: control costs. the problem current level health-care spend (u.s. spend exceed industrial countries) but, even great degree, continue rapid growth spending. per caput health-care spend unite state increase fast rate per caput income number decades. should trend continue, many economist predict will, share income devote pay health care rise relentlessly. a piece wisdom attribute economist herbert stein hold something cannot go forever, stop. at point, health-care spend share gdp stop rising, difficult guess be, little sign yet. although high cost health care frequently hear complaint, important note substantial portion cost increase see recent decade reflect improvement quality quantity care deliver rather high cost deliver give level care. notably, new technologies, despite greatly add cost many cases, also yield significant benefit form good health. people put great value health, surprise that, society become wealthier, would choose spend health-care services. indeed, although quantify economic value improve health great expect longevity difficult, researcher undertake exercise type find that, average, health benefit new technology advance significantly exceed economic costs.11that said, evidence also suggest cost health care unite state great necessary allow u achieve level health longevity enjoy. i already mention research find large regional difference cost treat give condition, high-cost area show good results. the slow diffusion use aspirin beta blocker treat heart-attack patient show cheap, effective treatment always used, potentially lead high cost bad outcomes. moreover, insurance company government play prominent role finance health care, patient doctor far le incentive consider extra cost optional test treatments. but, know, although test treatment decision may undertake presumption "someone else pay," public eventually pay costs, either high insurance premium high taxes. the effect high health-care cost government budget deserve special note. in unite states, large grow portion federal state expenditure subsidize health insurance. in 1975, federal spend medicare medicaid 6 percent total non-interest federal spending. today, share 23 percent. because rise cost health care age population, cbo project that, without reform, medicare medicaid 35 percent non-interest federal spend 2025.12 this trend imply increasingly difficult tradeoff legislator taxpayers, high government spend health-care spend will, necessity, require reduction government programs, high taxes, large budget deficits. rapid increase health spend also portend increasingly difficult access health service people low incomes.13 a health spend continue outpace income, 11 cutler mcclellan (2001). 12 cbo (2007). 13 for purpose speech, "low income" mean bottom 20th percentile income distribution. bi review 78/2008 3 health insurance out-of-pocket payment become increasingly unaffordable.14 one way society address problem past expand government subsidy health spending. the medicare part d program, assist senior cost prescription drugs, example. however, continue limit effect rise medical cost household budgets, government may absorb increase proportion nation's total bill health care, put even great pressure government budget official projection suggest. take challenge daunting. because health-care system complex, challenge diverse, knowledge incomplete, expect single set reform address concerns. rather, eclectic approach probably needed. in particular, may need first address problem seem easily manage rather wait solution address problem once. think solution in health-care reform, certainly easy pose question provide answers. moreover, even put aside scope technical complexity problem face, type reform choose depend importantly value judgment tradeoff make among social objectives. such choice appropriately leave public elect representatives. consequently, i little say regard specific proposals. however, i suggest question consideration seek reform might wish keep mind. regard access, one important consideration people uninsured alike. they include people low incomes, people may poor costly pre-existing health conditions, whose employer offer group health insurance cannot afford buy insurance more-expensive nongroup market, people eligible medicaid program reason enrolled. some people afford health insurance purchase it, presumably anticipate significant medical expenses. broaden access health care may thus require u consider mix policies. the follow question wrestle. first, enrollment health insurance program mandated, least strongly encouraged, example, tax incentives? supporter argue mandate lead good risk pool prevent could afford insurance choose buy "free-riding" public safety net. opponent argue mandate infringe individual choice may require substantial government budgetary commitment help cannot afford insurance meet mandate. second, continue rely employer-provided health insurance key element system? the employee large company particular typically constitute good risk-sharing pool, allow insurance provide low overall cost. but dominance insurance market employer-provided plan mean market individual small-group policy underdevelop cost coverage high. employer-based system also reduce portability health insurance jobs, reduce labor mobility efficiency labor market well create burden change jobs. third, help people costly pre-existing conditions, impose requirement insurance company accept applicant mandate condition must 14 for example, recent study estimate that, without increase share health spend publicly financed, budget share health spend low-income elderly household would increase 25 percent income today 35 percent 2040 (follette sheiner, 2007). 4 bi review 78/2008 covered? do would help people obtain coverage, result increase insurance premium might exclude others. an alternative approach would promote bare-bones, high-deductible policy affordable attractive healthy people offer government help need coverage costly conditions. finally, extent will use public fund reduce number uninsured, example, provide subsidy low-income people cover medicaid people, self-employed, find difficult obtain affordable coverage non-group market? how would finance additional spending? for instance, would consider limit employers' tax exemption cost employee health insurance? the issue access health care, though difficult politically, sense technically least complex three challenge i identified; mostly financing, possibly regulation, rather medicine. of course, access health care closely entwine issues, notably issue cost. in particular, restrain growth health-care cost would increase number people afford insurance coverage. on second challenge, improve quality health care, number private public initiative undertake recent years. these include program monitor hospitals' performance ensure patient safety adherence best practices; great effort identify disseminate best practices, determine clinical trials; public private initiative increase use information technology health care. researcher also examine structure health-care delivery system affect quality care. for example, evidence suggest vertically integrate system like veteran administration quick adopt health information technology successful apply it. some instance initiative aim encourage quality financial incentive disincentive – so-called pay-for-performance – begin emerge. example include accreditation practice require hospital comply establish standard best practices, recent decision medicare cover cost cause certain medical errors. effort improve quality health care vital component comprehensive reform likely yield high social returns. additional research experimentation help u address difficult question best measure quality cost-effectiveness health-care delivery give doctor hospital incentive adopt best practice improve information technologies. the solution choose access quality interact important way third critical issue – issue cost. great access health care improve health outcomes, almost certainly raise financial costs. increase quality health care, although highly desirable, could also result high total health-care spending. for example, increase patient screen may avoid serious problem thus cost-saving, could also identify problem might otherwise go untreated – good outcome, certainly, one increase overall spending. these certainly argument increase access improve quality. my point improve access quality may increase rather reduce total costs. from economist's perspective, question whether spend much health care cannot ultimately answer look total expenditure relative gdp federal budget. rather, question, whatever spend, whether get money's worth. in general, good information appropriate incentive necessary allocate resource efficiently. in health care, necessary information include clinical effectiveness certain test course treatment also cost-effectiveness. a regional comparison health-care cost illustrates, cost-effective approach may least useful costly approach deliver good health outcomes. bi review 78/2008 5 knowledge cost alternative approach likely insufficient itself. patients, doctors, hospital must also give incentive choose cost-effective approaches. however, question structure incentive monitor performance hotly debated. for example, advocate "consumer-driven" health care argue that, give appropriate information incentives, patient – cases, private insurer act behalf – effectively impose least degree market discipline health-care providers. others see inevitable role government set standard care measure performance. professional associations, hospitals, medical researchers, stakeholder may also role play. at heart debate fundamental social question determine various medical service worth cost measure reward good performance providers. rise health spend increase stress private public budgets, thus stakeholder sphere aim reduce costs. cost-saving reform private sector inevitably reverberate public sector vice versa. for example, shift toward manage care private sector also result manage care public sector. similarly, innovation public insurance programs, introduction reimbursement diagnosis-related group medicare, change way private insurance payment structured.15 our health-care system is, de facto, private-public partnership; result, government view health-care cost narrowly budgetary issue. rather, consider totality government intervention health-care market – include tax policies, insurance regulation, structure medicare medicaid – affect sector whole. the best way reduce fiscal burden health care deliver cost-effective health care throughout entire system. conclusion let conclude restate point i make beginning: a focus problem health system, easy forget much good it. our health system produce innovation basic science, understand diagnose disease, pharmacology medical technology. these advance result more-effective treatment significant reduction mortality across wide spectrum diseases. in devise policy reform health-care system, must take care maintain

bank – improve exchange information remark mr lorenzo bini smaghi, member executive board european central bank, workshop “financial turmoil miss risks: new challenge banker regulators”, milan, 12 june 2008. * * * 1. introduction1ladies gentlemen, it honour pleasure speak today event. a title session indicates, time banker authority need think hard lesson draw financial market turmoil, even challenge conventional wisdom necessary. in last years, relationship supervision central bank evolved. follow example uk, supervisory responsibility allocate country independent authorities, separate central bank. in countries, netherlands, prudential supervision financial institution fully integrate central bank. i want repeat argument separation supervision central bank (they thoughtfully analyse charles goodhart donato masciandaro, among others). but i recall ecb take position 2001 fundamental role central bank prudential supervision, stress importance confidential supervisory information conduct central bank functions.2 the recent financial market turmoil confirm importance smooth efficient relationship central bank supervisory functions; also lead debate reform current supervisory structure country uk us. the report financial stability forum (fsf) entitle “enhancing market institutional resilience” present g7 last april include number policy recommendation help prevent recurrence financial stress similar one experience current turmoil. among many recommendations, fsf refer need supervisory authority central bank improve cooperation exchange information. it call particular exchange rapid period market strain. today, i focus remark supervisory information relevant central bank general, ecb particular, three core central bank functions: monetary policy, liquidity policy financial stability assessment. i consider turn. 2. monetary policy let start consider usefulness supervisory information conduct monetary policy. i analyse, particular, two points. first, possible role supervisory information gain good understand behaviour monetary credit aggregates. second, potential usefulness information understand banks’ 1 the view express author. i thank c. kok sørensen, c. beuve, c. ohlerich, s. kerjean, n. valckx f. recine input preparation remarks. 2 see ecb, “recent development supervisory structure eu accede countries”, october 2006, available ecb's website. bi review 77/2008 1 lend behaviour, transmission monetary policy bank system finance condition household firms. since inception, european central bank regularly utilise wide array bank data monetary analysis. the data mainly base aggregate balance sheet statistic euro area monetary financial institution (mfi) collect compile ecb/eurosystem. another important source information situation euro area bank sector compile eurosystem quarterly bank lend survey, provide qualitative information change banks’ credit standard loan demand, describe factor contribute changes. supervisory information use limit extent. let make four general point usefulness supervisory information monetary policy decision-making. first, ecb strongly encourage ongoing effort conduct aegis committee european bank supervisor (cebs) achieve great convergence supervisory report bank across eu; second, supervisory data, provide information distribution key balance sheet profit ratio across different group banks, point development specific area economy detectable aggregate statistics; third, access bank level-based supervisory data would allow central bank clearly identify empirical regularity good understand interrelation various factor affect drive banks’ activities; fourth, finally, i would like stress mutual benefit arise enhance dialogue banks, supervisor central banks. from monetary policy perspective, direct interaction bank supervisor would clearly enhance scope analysis decision-making give central bank good feel (in real time) underlie driver monetary credit developments. a surely know, ecb’s monetary analysis consist extract information risk price stability analysis development monetary aggregate counterparts, particular credit private sector, exploit long-run link money prices. the eurosystem mfi balance sheet statistic design monetary analysis mind, hence fulfil requirement conduct analysis. however, cases, supervisory information, embed so-called corep (“common solvency ratio reporting”) finrep (“financial reporting”) templates, bring together harmonise information solvency ratio financial statement data eu banks, could add substantial value analysis. in particular, supervisory-based information provide detail breakdown bank asset liability mfi balance sheet statistics, thus make easy interpret monetary credit aggregates. for example, supervisory information banks’ securitisation activity help improve analysis credit development avoid bias would incur include asset transfer banks’ balance sheets. in addition, access supervisory information distribution across bank key bank ratios, capital position write-down losses, would help detect whether certain group bank (catering specific type borrowers) le likely cut back (or increase) lending, particular follow change policy rates. the need understand reason recent strong corporate loan growth clear example regular dialogue bank supervisor might contribute improve monetary analysis ecb. indeed, supervisory information might lead good understand relative importance pre-committed credit line precautionary nature recent corporate lending. hence, certain case supervisory information help improve analysis “special factors” influence money credit demand. the value supervisory data euro area bank sector arguably even great respect ecb’s economic analysis. consider various channel bank may affect way monetary policy action transmit real side economy. in euro area, bank major source finance firm 2 bi review 77/2008 households. the extent bank adjust lend price loan response monetary policy action influence various channel monetary policy affect economy. one transmission channel affect bank behaviour degree speed bank pas change policy rates. bank tend adjust lend rate sluggishly response change monetary policy rates.3 the stickiness bank rate hinge among thing financial structure competition within bank sector well competition market-based sources, include securitisation.4 supervisory information bank activities, use credit transfer instrument relative importance asset liability hold trading, useful enhance analysis. another transmission channel often cite literature receive increase attention past two decade credit channel. owe informational asymmetry principal-agent problem bank borrowers, monetary policy may impact supply loans. this happen narrow broad credit channel.5 in narrow credit channel, monetary policy tighten may mean bank face balance sheet constraints, low liquidity capital holdings, hence may choose restrain lending. supervisory information health bank system provide valuable input assessment potential loan supply constraints. this analysis would base data solvency liquidity ratios, capital buffers, securitisation credit risk transfer instruments. whereas, example, eurosystem bank lend survey provide input disentangle loan supply demand effects, thus help identify relevant supply-side effects, survey remain qualitative nature. supervisory information base direct dialogue bank supervisor provide enlighten evidence issues. this type information may prove particularly relevant time turbulence. in broad credit channel, monetary policy influence creditworthiness bank borrowers, example, change asset hence collateral values, lead change external finance premium. this, turn, may induce bank alter supply loan borrowers. supervisory information could bear question cannot derive either mfi balance sheet statistic market-based source extent bank hold collateralised exposure size exposure small medium size enterprises. all all, stress information currently available ecb/eurosystem provide good basis economic monetary analyses, quality assessment economic monetary development could certain area improve access supervisory information. this would particularly beneficial time bank distress. in particular, access euro area-wide bank-level data key element understand empirical regularity project development monetary credit aggregates. research u show bank supervisory information help central bank forecast macroeconomic variable guide monetary policy.6 3 for us, see e.g. hannan berger (1991), berger udell (1992), m saunders (1995), berlin m (1999). for recent study euro area, see e.g. mojon (2001), de bondt (2005), gambacorta (2004), sander kleimeier (2004) kok sørensen werner (2006). 4 see e.g. cottarelli kourelis (1995), mojon (2001), estrella (2002), gropp et al. (2006) van leuvensteijn et al. (2007). 5 see bernanke blind (1988), bernanke gertler (1989, 1995), bernanke gertler gilchrist (1999) kashyap stein (2000) seminal contribution line literature. empirical find euro area find ehrmann et al. (2001), angeloni ehrmann (2003), gambacorta mistrulli (2004), altunbas et al. (2007). 6 see peek, rosengren tootell (1999). bi review 77/2008 3 likewise, research base euro area bank illustrate usefulness supervisory information explore link macroeconomic developments, monetary policy bank sector.7 for example, draw individual bank data variable risk characteristic loans, non-performing loan ratios, solvency ratio measure bank distress, many study find relationship monetary policy action banks’ risk-taking lend behaviour. importantly, bank-level supervisory data would also make possible detect whether relationship differ across bank different type size. 3. liquidity policy i examine supervisory information important assess credit risk (e.g. quality collateral) central bank faces, especially time financial turbulence. let start state general principle: effective, monetary policy implementation lie sound financial institutions. if financial institution sound, hard evaluate demand central bank money, also risk supply them. in euro area, main demand central bank money impose eurosystem bank via reserve requirements, need fulfil commercial bank average so-called maintenance period, i.e. monthly basis. the ecb supply amount central bank money enable bank smoothly fulfil reserve requirements. through operations, eurosystem provide liquidity large group banks, redistribute liquidity institution across euro area. this why, accord procedures,8 counterparties eurosystem monetary policy operation must fulfil certain eligibility criteria. first foremost, counterparties must financially sound. therefore, up-to-date constant supervisory information absolutely critical order identify distortion smooth function money markets, may impair monetary policy implementation. indeed, eligibility counterparties constant review. such information crucial especially since start financial turmoil. it allow u identify root cause tension money market choose appropriate remedies. a know, substantial change affect size, composition fund asset side banks’ balance sheet since august 2007. the size banks’ balance sheet increase bank retain asset initially intend securitisation sale transfer underlie asset off-balance sheet vehicle back balance sheets. the source fund also change since securitisation stop repo market non-government bond dry up. a result, bank raise liquidity buff reduce fund maturity gap apply large liquidity shock stress scenarios. a result, bank hoard cash cut back lend activity reduce counterparty limit range collateral accept repo operations. this type behaviour base information asymmetry, namely fact one counterpart (the borrower) good information creditworthiness counterpart (the lender) owe lack transparency true valuation assets. in way, bank try protect danger increase adverse selection, i.e. high probability select risky counterpart. 7 for examples, see e.g. quagliariello (2006, 2007); jimenez, ongena, peydro saurina (2007); jimenez saurina (2005); de graeve, kick koetter (2008). 8 see general documentation attach guideline ecb monetary policy instrument procedure eurosystem (available www.ecb.europa.eu). 4 bi review 77/2008 on top that, traditional group investors, supplier liquidity bank sector, alter investment strategies. there evidence money market fund central bank (in management foreign reserves) shift investment bank system safe-haven asset like treasury bill overnight repo transactions. these development friction inhibit smooth distribution liquidity inter-bank market, lead segmentation euro cash money market. this segmentation lead dramatic widen spread unsecured (euribor) secure (ois) markets. against background, number bank feel must secure bid eurosystem’s tender operation order get liquidity need eurosystem, see (almost) unique provider euro liquidity. they thus ready bid aggressively, particular “excluded” inter-bank repo markets. in addition, bank eager pledge asset collateral u private repo market continue standstill. the ecb normally collect type information money market contact group bilateral contact bank treasurers. supervisory information could provide useful additional information, particularly change banks’ fund conditions. since mid-march, bank show ability enhance balance sheet raise capital, issue long-term debt sell portfolio leverage loans. at end may, usd 276 billion capital raise banks, may compare approximately usd 387 billion write-down loss already announced. this type news, combine various action take central banks, contribute recovery price risky assets. overall, supervisory information would important input ecb’s effort ensure effective implementation monetary policy. it prove particularly crucial turmoil. look ahead, cooperation supervisor body responsible monetary policy implementation could enhance frequent transmission information relate composition fund balance sheet financial institution (like change so-called fund gaps). 4. financial stability assessment i turn ass extent supervisory information may help financial stability monitor assessment conduct central banks, include ecb. the ecb fact develop activity line treaty, stipulate escb “shall contribute smooth conduct policy pursue competent authority relate prudential supervision credit institution stability financial system” (art. 105.5).9with respect financial stability, i address two questions. first, precise information need carry financial stability assessment function? second, would information, it? the ecb regularly monitor stability financial system – comprise financial intermediaries, market market infrastructure – euro area publish since december 2004 assessment every six month financial stability review. the review draw attention main source risk vulnerabilities, ass whether euro area financial system capable withstand shock disruption severe enough significantly impair intermediation function. this periodic assessment base information stem manifold sources, include supervisory nature. in particular, regular aggregate information solvency 9 this provision replicate art. 3.3. protocol statute european system central bank european central bank. bi review 77/2008 5 profitability bank sector well ad hoc information specific exposure bank sector collect ecb cooperation bank supervision committee. there certainly room enhance access supervisory information ecb’s financial stability assessment. in normal times, wide access – term timeliness frequency information banks’ exposure risk concentration – would improve identification potential risk stability euro area financial system well assessment potential impact system possible materialisation identify risks. a feed chairman bernanke recently said: “for risk financial stability successfully managed, must first identify measured. recent development reveal deficiency respect”. before outbreak market turmoil mid-2007, conventional wisdom hold bank successfully remove credit risk balance sheets, thank financial innovation mortgage-backed securities, collateralised debt obligation use structure investment vehicle (sivs). relatively little know role activity sivs exact nature relationship banks. one could argue that, in-depth supervisory information available aspects, central banks, include ecb, could see banks’ credit risk transfer sivs investor many case incomplete bank remain liable sivs’ liabilities. of course, it’s easy say hindsight learn experience. in situation financial stress, supervisory information remain essential central bank financial stability assessment effective. however, nature financial stress likely differ previous ones. therefore, information need identify case-by-case basis. in context current turmoil, key supervisory information bank direct exposure u sub-prime sector structure financial product well effect write-down banks’ capital position. overall, wide access central banks, include ecb, supervisory information would render financial stability assessment effective monitor prevent financial stresses. at time, outcome central banks’ financial stability assessment use supervisory authorities, instance, help focus monitor activity certain category risk. this rationale behind specific fsf recommendation i mention beginning, namely, enhance interplay central bank supervisory authorities. 5. legal institutional aspect come close end remarks, let turn institutional arrangements. the task contribute smooth conduct supervisory policies, mention art. 105.5 eu treaty, give escb several grounds. central bank large body inside knowledge may help exercise prudential supervision, measure counter financial market fragility may, hand, monetary aspect discuss central banks.10 moreover, information hold escb, instance, context role oversight payment system may great use supervisory authorities. payment system oversight prudential supervision focus avoid systemic risk safeguard soundness financial institutions. at time, stress flow information (instead to) supervisory authority mutually fruitful cooperation supervisory authority central bank crucial, latter entrust contributory task field macro-prudential supervision.11 the ecb point various opinion 10 see r. smits, the european central bank, institutional aspect (kluwer international, 2000), p.340. 11 r. smits (ibid), p.342. 6 bi review 77/2008 “central bank access prudential information cooperation financial supervisory authority central bank essential conduct macro-prudential monitoring, oversight payment system safeguard market infrastructures, turn essential smooth conduct monetary policy”. if examine closely current eu legal framework applicable exchange information central bank supervisory authorities, note eu treaty “asymmetric” since contain provision require bank supervisory authority contribute performance task responsibility ecb escb, way ecb escb contribute smooth function supervisory policies. this may historical roots: national supervisory authorities, unlike ecb escb, community law body european mandate enshrine treaty. however, entail limitation ability ecb escb perform tasks. one take account series fact make problem le acute. first, number central bank euro area perform supervisory function therefore easy access supervisory information. second, european secondary legislation, namely number community directive applicable financial sector – and, instance, capital requirement directive (crd) – address issue cooperation exchange information eu level supervisory authority also bank supervisory authority central banks. the crd identify number exception “gateways” member state may authorise confidential information disclosed, case subject condition professional secrecy. this directive provide particular exchange information authorise supervisory authority central bank capacity monetary authorities. third, previous opinion draft national laws, ecb observe virtually member state adopt supervisory model base independent financial supervisory authority include provision stipulate duty cooperation authorise exchange information central bank supervisory authorities.12against backdrop, essential eliminate legislative obstacle prevent supervisory authority provide information ecb eurosystem central bank specific bank financial institution well guarantee generally duty cooperation central bank supervisory authorities, whose ultimate purpose put place effective practical arrangement cooperation information-sharing. this priority european union. the european commission recently launch public consultation possible target amendment crd13 include aspect relate cooperation exchange information bank supervisory authority central banks. more specifically, propose amendment crd include two new provisions. first, “ emergency situation, member state shall allow competent authority communicate information central bank eu information relevant exercise respective statutory tasks, include conduct monetary policy, oversight payment security settlement systems, safeguard financial stability”. second, consolidate supervisor alert relevant central bank communicate information essential pursuance task emergency situation, 12 see, instance, opinion ecb 5 november 2007 request austrian ministry finance draft law amend law banking, law save banks, law financial market supervisory authority law

development financial markets, arise within bank group potentially jeopardise stability financial system member state entity group located. 6. conclusion in 2001 eurosystem highlight importance role play central bank supervision. the experience gain central bank financial market turmoil confirm fundamental appropriateness eurosystem’s position, also share across atlantic. in us, discussion already start improve coordination various authority put federal reserve position good contribute financial market stability. tim geithner recently call power give federal reserve field oversight. in european union, european commission launch initiative reinforce legal underpinnings cooperation exchange information supervisory authority central banks, build consistent institutional framework exchange. these initiative strongly support ecb implement soon. improve institutional framework necessary, sufficient. it follow effective implementation provision activation available channel communication supervisor central banks, include ecb. a substantial amount work already underway. it u make sure finalise time address challenge global financial market may pose stability. thank

2008. * * * thank invitation address melbourne today. i read amcham large international chamber commerce operate australia, work promote trade, investment general business link unite state australia since 1961. over period nearly five decades, u australia enjoy mutually beneficial trade relationship, enshrine recently free trade agreement. during time, lot shift occurred, significance u both. in 1961, nearly quarter australian export go unite kingdom, number one trade partner. trade china inconsequential size. japan become prominent destination export then, would go become far large trade partner end decade, due expansion mine sector. in 2007, uk number six destination. the u number three (little change 40 year earlier). china equal japan first place two way trade, easily outstrip japan year. of course, unite state still far away large economy world, remain quite while. nonetheless, change trade experience australia – hardly alone – indicator way weight world economy gradually shift asian region. on financial front, contrast, asia remain many respect underdeveloped, especially term prominence local-currency capital markets. u capital market remain largest, deep influential, drive development stock, bond money markets, various derivative offshoots, around world. that contrast – increase economic weight asia continue dominance american behaviour financial market – many way centre set challenge face australia, i suspect countries, right now. before come that, however, fit begin remark u economy. i talk global economy broadly, particularly effect u slowdown rest world focus particularly australia current challenge economic management face. the unite state economy a well know, u economy struggle period weakness present. growth slow subdue pace, confidence well down. there continue debate whether witness call recession. in respects, rather silly preoccupation doubt condition weak, worth spill much ink whether growth rate zero. that said, u economy has, thus far, do little good many people feared. of course episode yet over; period adjustment still lie ahead. the epicentre adjustment house sector, deteriorate lend standard speculative boom part country year ago lead build-up excess physical stock over-stretched borrowers. subsequently, need work overhang see construction rate new home fall half, price establish home many major city decline first time many years. rise default foreclosure likely dampen price further. the non-recourse nature mortgage u state bi review 77/2008 1 potentially destabilise factor well, since even people service loan incentive walk away equity fall zero. tight credit condition dampen factor u economy generally, lender work limit risk order repair balance sheets. so real question precondition renew expansion come place. it perhaps bite soon conclude reach point. there certainly helpful dynamic work: bad fear serious financial collapse abate somewhat past couple months, process balance sheet repair key institution well way, macroeconomic policy put expansionary mode initiative offer modest support house market train. considerable uncertainty, nonetheless, surround outlook unite state next year so. the global economy what effect rest world? in previous response question,1 i suggest two key channel consider. the first trade spillovers, fall u income mean u demand le way product countries. the decline u dollar also work direction. the second potential channel financial contagion, possibility country may experience financial dynamic work unite states. my view second channel likely important one episode. the trade channel certainly work – low u demand felt weak export unite state part world. but force also work, strength region mean many export-driven economies, certainly asia, continue record quite solid growth early month 2008. some country also develop good deal momentum domestic demand. so date, trade per se major issue. but financial exposure problem asset spread around global system. credit-related loss disclose financial institution around world date amount something approach us$400 billion, half institution domicile outside unite states. more loss reside entity outside core financial system. so pressure balance sheet arise decline credit standard middle current decade extend beyond u itself, least europe uk. give integrate nature financial market develop world, moreover, pressure term borrow cost bank see many place past nine months, even le acute way observe country centre crisis. these force contractionary nature, global growth widely expect low 2008 strong result 2007. accord imf, global gdp growth moderate 3¾ per cent 2008 2009, slow concentrate among develop economy north america, europe japan. this forecast embody mild u recession 2008. but outcome global growth would well exceptional pace 5 per cent see 2006 2007, actually line average rate growth world economy past 15 years. and although imf suggest april short-term risk surround forecast concentrate downside, 25 per cent chance global recession (which define global growth 3 per cent), 1 ‘economic prospect 2008: an antipodean view’, january 2008 (available http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2008/sp_gov_190108.html). 2 bi review 77/2008 recent development suggest risk likely realise case couple month ago. to date, fact, financial development occupy mind develop world policy-makers big issue many country emerge world, least important australia. bank case serious fund problems, perhaps part exposure bad asset minimal. capital markets, le important avenue fund many develop economies, source significant disruption. admittedly, share market emerge economy decline noticeably, credit expansion continue unimpeded and, i indicate moment ago, economic growth appear remain pretty solid. in fact, around much emerge world moment, big problem seem neither near actual recession unite states, credit crunch hear much discussion major countries, inflation. from asia latin america africa, well many industrial countries, hear lot inflation now. food price rise loom large develop countries’ consumer basket, big rise grain price past year prominent. several potential driver increase nominated. one change towards protein-intensive diet develop countries’ income rise, increase demand grain fee animal keep meat. this doubt factor, long run trend evidence meat consumption explode past year.2 another diversion grain towards production bio fuels, half increase consumption crop 2006-2007 go source, thus constrain supply available additional food production.3 but play role margins, supply disruption arguably important cause big price rise past year. in particular, supply disrupt adverse weather condition key production areas, example, drought australia. to extent effect temporary, could expect food price continue rise pace. temporary supply factor may, margin, also work push oil price late. in addition, inflow financial capital energy derivative market fund expand asset universe include commodity source demand. this seem people mind suggest oil price subject speculative pressure. but surely impossible avoid conclusion trend rise oil price number year due rise demand end users. supply rise too, contrast occur opec shock 1970s, struggle keep pace cost supply marginal unit risen. the said, moreover, resource commodities, include thermal metallurgical coal iron ore – commodity important australia producer. chinese demand resource construct first-world standard city extremely strong, account large share increase demand past several years. anyone visit chinese city see results. such visitor also tend, often not, get sense demand could continue, structural phenomenon, quite long time. 2 indeed, food demand emerge economy begin increase strongly 1990s, long current run-up prices, see imf world economic outlook, october 2007 (available at: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/02/pdf/text.pdf). 3 see imf world economic outlook, april 2008 (available at: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/01/pdf/text.pdf). bi review 77/2008 3 at present, strong sense overheat chinese economy. it would even clear statistic administrative control many prices. a is, china’s official cpi rise close 8 per cent per annum. the effect china rest asia, moreover, expansionary. couple fairly easy monetary policy set much region, tend occur many emerge economy u policy rate low importance exchange rate consideration asian policy-makers, likely limit downside risk growth short term. it pose risk, though, inflation continue pick up. this confine asia, either: inflation pressure evident much latin america south africa, region high resource price deliver term trade gain substantial proportions. i would venture guess, fact, number country inflation major problem greatly exceeds, present, number predominant concern inadequate growth. it may slow growth train major country lead energy price commodity price moderating. on hand, forecast moderation global growth take back average pace. with bulk new demand energy resource come country yet show much sign cyclical slowdown, whose energy intensity demand continue increase secularly, near-term soften price might modest. hence fact low level interest rate major country results, de facto, set monetary condition pretty easy many develop country well, start raise warn flag among observer see inflation pressure already building. this could pose quite difficult choice policy-makers, particularly emerge world, next year. long term, course, likely ongoing growth demand energy develop country surely pose major adjustment challenge rest us. the australian economy the external environment certainly pose big, immediate, challenge australian economy experience long expansion largely use reserve spare capacity. the force work abroad pull different directions, extent see occasion past. on one hand, seriousness sub-prime credit crisis, associate weak outcome experience us, think prospect uk part europe, well understand australian household businesses. the financial turmoil past nine month also see market-driven tighten financial condition addition result tighten monetary policy. combined, development dampen effect demand. household have, recent months, adopt cautious attitude borrow spending, evidence string flat result retail sales, significant decline flow new loan approval housing. credit approval business also decline significantly. while partly reflect wind process rapid reintermediation occur business turn bank away capital market around turn year, total business fund slowed. in short, thing happen suggest moderation growth domestic demand occurring, sign begin appear national account data release last week. at stage, inevitably, extent likely duration moderation remain uncertain. there much uncertainty, though, need moderation. inflation increase 2007, underlie term reach high rate 15 year more. it true boost international rise oil commodity prices, australia’s inflation rate rise usual peer group measure 4 bi review 77/2008 comparable basis. it also pretty clear strong domestic factor work, growth local demand pace exceeding, large margin, plausible estimate economy’s long-run potential growth rate output, time capacity already tight. have rise exchange rate occur past couple years, moreover, australian dollar price energy raw material (as well tradeable good services) would even higher. so inflation pick up, needs, time, reduced. reduction inflation usually require period slow demand growth, episode different. at time seek moderation domestic spending, rise resource price occur courtesy strong demand abroad complex effect australian economy. since australian pay world price petroleum products, rise global oil price add cost business consumers. this inflationary immediate impact, though also act brake spend good services, unless people prepare reduce save borrow sustain spend previous levels. other thing equal, brake dampen inflation impulse areas. term trade - select country percentage change, 2002-2007 _____________________________________ chile 78 russia* 64

also receive high income result high resource prices. a shareholder experience high profits. employee resource sector, well construction sector various area supply good service mining, receive large pay packets. government receive high revenue flows, case spend, least part. so net terms, term trade effect expansionary. in normal course events, would add demand high commodity price would take out. with rise bulk commodity price take effect now, australia’s term trade rise 20 per cent, top substantial lift occur past several years. since 2002, total rise term trade will, end year, order 65–70 per cent. some country also experience significant term trade rises. but see anything big australia’s five-year period. there obvious contrast unite states, whose term trade fall 6 per cent period, owe importance energy import country. the strong contrast, though, country japan korea, which, unlike us, significant resource endowment own. turn back australia, effect 65–70 per cent increase term trade five year lift purchase power gdp around 13 per cent. in terminology national accounts, boost real gross domestic income real gdi. of course, resource sector significant foreign ownership, significant part gain accrue foreigner boost real income australian resident large. over 2008, boost real gdi estimate around 4 per cent, boost national income somewhat le this, still substantial. the expansionary term trade shock occur obviously would potential, absent adjustment, seriously destabilising. by design, certain feature macroeconomic policy framework help handle shock. a high exchange rate play valuable role dampen expansionary impact, low price trade good service spill demand abroad. in year ahead, government say so-called “automatic stabilisers” federal budget, refer feature tax system withdraw income economy fast grows, allow operate, also helpful. it fall monetary policy play proper restrain role well, dampen private demand inflation already pick up, seek head problem could easily emerge give expansionary effect term trade. this tight monetary policy set essential. it reserve bank lift interest rates, even federal reserve reduce them. not overall pace demand growth need slow, accept change composition. there major process investment go on, business well governments. business investment high level relative gdp, business aggregate say intend increase investment next year. government state level intend substantial infrastructure spend well, though experience current year trouble implement plan demand already make engineer construction sector. in economies, usually possible, certainly prudent, try consumption boom time investment boom. of course, australia access save foreigner fund additional investment – process run current account deficit – finance totality additional investment ourselves. this something unknown u economy either (in fact, common feature anglophone market economy past decade). but even so, probably sensible limit here. practically speaking, domestic consumption, together house demand, area business investment 6 bi review 77/2008 link resource sector, ask make room, period time, rise form investment sustain high income live standard future. give economy pretty fully employed, total investment level already high, nation’s call net capital inflow abroad 6 per cent gdp inflation already 4 per cent, difficult see serious alternative adjustment nature. to try absorb expansionary term trade impact without macroeconomic policy restraint really alternative all. in inflationary scenario, i expect would still find resource sector part region economy benefit directly flow-on effect would attract additional labour capital, become proportionately large national economy time. other sector region would, proportionately, still diminish size. the process would simply le efficient: price signal resource allocation pretty clear present would difficult detect condition high inflation. indeed, one problem high inflation brings. this course would also leave rest economy legacy embed high inflation, commensurately high nominal interest rate on. that would harmful live standard time. a such, allow occur would policy mistake. conclusion both unite state australia face significant economic challenges. for us, deal fall-out financial excess early year loom large present. this make easy simultaneous lift global commodity prices, raise consumer price but, us, also dampen economic activity. for australia, financial fall-out le severe, mainly participation early excess much smaller, large change price mineral energy resource expansionary external shock affect economy 50 year more. it occur time productive capacity economy already stretch long expansion. hence, prospect inflation present large immediate danger u has, thus far, us. one way another, near term continue present challenge side pacific, two respective economy adjust shock hit us. but economy pretty adaptable. there reason why, sensible policy frameworks, competitive innovative firms, capable industrious workforces, continue prosper long term. bi review 77/2008 7 jürgen stark: lesson central banker history phillips curve speech mr jürgen stark, member executive board european central bank, federal reserve bank boston’s annual economic conference “understanding inflation implication monetary policy: a phillips curve retrospective”, chatham, massachusetts, 11 june 2008. * * * it great pleasure today conference. i try look historical evolution phillips curve interaction macroeconomic outcome slightly eccentric angle. forty year ago suddenly become difficult even navigate policymakers raise revere intellectual tradition monetary orthodoxy resist revolutionary notion stable trade-off inflation unemployment. some reject notion – common sense practical experience – scholar university could prove theoretically fragile empirically elusive. i view episode – honest civil servant ahead time reject faulty proposition – highly symbolic. the episode representative key swing ambivalent relationship cutting-edge economic research long establish central bank principles. at end, i submit reflection relationship ought govern modern policy-making institution ecb – part – insure major policy failure revolutionary idea inflict apply untested. 1. the evolution phillips curve: interplay idea macroeconomic outcome the two top panel figure 1 show kind evidence a.w. phillips available publish ground-breaking paper fifty year ago.1 the two panel show rate unemployment annual wholesale price

noteworthy consider second sample period comprise great depression. just two year publication phillips’ paper, eponymous curve make centrepiece cutting-edge macro-economic think two future nobel prize winners, paul samuelson robert solow.2 although samuelson solow careful conjecture change inflation expectation might shift unemployment-inflation trade-off upwards downwards, care ultimately lose fast-growing industry macro-analyses spawn article. samuelson-solow’s follower take phillips curve literally offer “menu” combination inflation unemployment policymakers could choose – is, exploitable trade-off. in february 1963, three year publication samuelson solow’s paper, federal reserve chairman william mcchesney martin openly reject notion exploitable 1 in fact, phillips’ (1958) paper base

presidential address american economic association, (re-)introduced notion long-run vertical phillips curve macroeconomics,4 chairman martin discuss role inflation expectation shift unemployment-inflation equilibrium along line friedman edmund phelps5 would expound analytical terms:6 “if labor reason fear persistent substantial rise cost living, would felt compel seek compensatory increase wages; management reason expect general increase price level, would felt compel resist demands. in case, wage would certainly rise fast productivity; price would raise consequence; fear inflationary spiral would become actuality.”7 subsequent development well known. on theoretical front, 1967 1968 saw independent enunciation “natural rate hypothesis”, friedman’s presidential address american economic association – i mention already – work ultimately edmund phelps nobel prize. underlie natural rate hypothesis two key concepts. • first, monetary neutrality: long run, phillips curve perfectly vertical, another way express robert lucas’s famous dictum “you can’t buy permanent economic high print money.” • second, temporary departure natural rate unemployment take place extent agents’ expectation are, reason, line economy’s authentic dynamics. when, 1972, robert lucas apply phillips curve hypothesis rational expectations, notion exploitable trade-off banish frontier research. lucas (1972a), particular, show traditional “solow-tobin” test natural rate hypothesis – base simple regression inflation lag rate unemployment – flaw principle, result crucially depend nature monetary policy regime, could therefore use validate invalidate natural rate hypothesis. rerun history obviously impossible. it conviction, however, theoretical developments, themselves, would likely succeed displace old consensus exploitable trade-off swiftness see reality, dramatic, concomitant real-world development: great inflation. 3 see martin (1963). 4 see friedman (1968). although publish 1968, friedman’s presidential address deliver american economic association december 29, 1967. 5 see phelps (1968). 6 see martin (1965). 7 he late summarise position issue follow terms: ‘ my view inflation clear. to believe full employment require inflation, answer unless inflation restrain full employment impossible.’ see martin (1971). 2 bi review 76/2008 indeed, great inflation episode associate breakdown empirical phillips curves, equation estimate previous, stable period lose predictive power adjust judgementally forecaster policy institutions. the shift nature unemployment-inflation relationship around time great inflation clearly apparent even naked eye bottom-right panel figure 1. whereas second half 19th century mid-1960s inflation unemployment systematically negatively co-moved unite kingdom unite states, around time great inflation start move upward lockstep. a point lucas sargent paper present 1978 conference organise boston fed,8 inflation 1970s represented, respect, sort large-scale experiment old consensus. for lucas sargent verdict experiment clear: “halcyon days”9 post-keynesian macroeconomics, belief exploitability phillips trade-off, go ever. over subsequent years, mid-1990s, phillips curve essentially disappear frontier research. alienate disappoint performance phillips curve, follow lead kydland prescott,10 frontier researcher preoccupy build flexible-price general equilibrium model drive technological impulses. within new framework, indeed place phillips curve speak of. the revival

kydland prescott (1982). 11 see e.g. stock watson (1999). further, although, bottom-right panel figure 1 shows, inflation-unemployment correlation clearly appear break around time great inflation, show king watson relationship appear experience major instability one focus upon business-cycle frequencies, i.e. relevant monetary policy. 12 see hairault portier (1993) yun (1996). bi review 76/2008 3 inflation persistence typical post-wwii era. several solution propose introduce persistence model-implied time process inflation, best know idea price reset optimally period somehow “indexed” past inflation.13 formulation along line suffer however several problems. • first, except labour markets, little evidence economy document price-indexing practice type describe theory. • second, fundamentally, even concede practice might wide-spread high-inflation regimes, hard believe would survive stable monetary conditions.14 and recent research, indeed, show backward-looking phillips curve component disappear stable monetary regimes, i.e. regime inflation strongly mean-reverting around quantitative definition price stability entertain central bank.15 further, control fluctuation trend inflation, phillips curve appear indeed purely forward-looking.16 although line research recent, result ought therefore necessarily regard tentative, find reinforce notion fundamental power monetary institution permeate economic behaviour profoundly, direct expectation – ultimately – determine intimate fabric market economies. the history phillips curve i briefly summarise suggest several reflections. the fact prominent central banker wed classical principle monetary neutrality ultimately vindicate bear degree significance transcend confine central bank chronicles. i view episode highly symbolic manifestation fundamental problem central banker continually face: namely, govern relationship policy-making cutting-edge economic research. let turn point next. 2. the relationship economic research economic policymaking before new medicine launch market, extensively tested. introduce new drug market without extensive testing, without government vetting, would consider kind social hazard would undermine foundation modern collective life. beyond precautionary testing, application medicine large number patient provide source ongoing information-gathering expand knowledge heal properties. so, time time learn food drug administration interrupt sale drug market years, grind provide new evidence concern previously unknown deleterious side effects.17 compare medical research, economics – notably economics econometrics phillips curve relationship – present additional, insurmountable problem new 13 see christiano, eichenbaum, evans (2005), smets wouters (2003). 14 see woodford (2007). 15 see benati (2008a). 16 see cogley sbordone (2008). trend inflation is, accord line research, ultimately impart inflation persistence. 17 there clear parallel risk side effect pharmaceutical mean chairman martin’s word ‘ collateral, perhaps deleterious, side effect objectives’ testimony front u.s. congress february 1963, flatly reject idea could possible permanently trade-off percentage point unemployment percentage point inflation. 4 bi review 76/2008 theory cannot even test application. to sure, history offer “natural experiments”: example, hyperinflations sweep europe first world war prominent collective test, whose lesson absorbed, today deeply entrench collective psyche many european peoples. but fundamental irreproducibility control experiment social science remains. true, recent years, limit number theory field social science subject experiments. and, recent strand macroeconomic literature18 even argue presence uncertainty structure economy monetary authority “experiment”, run monetary policy way create sufficient variation data. by standard econometric arguments, indeed allow good identification relevant, unknown deep parameter future policy conduct. when present line arguments, however, policymaker’s instinctive reaction cannot possibly right. • first foremost, experiment economy would inevitably fatally run risk destabilise expectations. indeed, result optimal experiment economy originally obtain within model public play purely passive role behaviour policymaker could alter public’s belief expectations. • second, assumption recently relax model public allow learn behaviour policymaker,19 result overturned. optimal policy become distinctly conservative, sense policymakers wary respectful fundamental fragility macroeconomic equilibrium perturbation policy experiment could introduce. in nutshell, initial, radical result favour monetary policy experimentation reversed. the fragility early result – transience many results, history theory economic policy, appear rock-solid first sight – memento policy practitioners. this, course, pose issue concern right balance creativity pragmatism policy-making institutions. isn’t case excessive intellectual conservatism might end leave policy-making institution “behind curve”, cling dead theories, unable cope new challenge ever-changing world? to sure, highly innovative idea systematically prove wrong: heliocentrism – revolutionary paradigm first expound – finally definitely displace previously dominant geocentrism. we careful censor research sake intellectual conservatism. however, intrinsically entrepreneurial nature research, whatever specific field endeavour, mean incidence failure bind high. failure economic policy mean potential economic damage. a safe principle always work past introduction new idea concept central bank’s monetary policy framework evolutionary, oppose revolutionary. historically, typical example introduction, towards end 1999, explicit numerical objective inflation part swiss national bank (snb). since foundation, 1907, snb bulwark inflation, deliver annual inflation rate that, entire century – exclude war year – 2.1 per cent average. further, back 1970s, around time great inflation plague many countries, snb – together bundesbank – 18 see e.g. bertocchi spagat (1993). 19 see ellison valla (2001) rosal spagat (2006). bi review 76/2008 5 “showed way” inflation could resist – amidst international turbulence – appropriately restrictive policies. in way introduction explicit numerical objective inflation therefore radically alter monetary policy framework: rather, provide “focal point” inflation expectations, goal innovation improve framework’s performance, facilitate central bank’s task within framework. this naturally lead final part speech. in recent years, amend phillips curve – shift state expectation – make model centrepiece innovative proposal conduct monetary policy without explicit reference monetary aggregates. part academic community, particular, advise european central bank abandon prominent role assign careful analysis monetary aggregates. base previous discussion, key question becomes: “is radical extent innovation justified”? i offer think question remainder remarks. 3. money phillips curve base model inflation there role monetary analysis model inflation determination centre around new-keynesian phillips curve. the announcement inflation target together promise move real interest rate sufficiently forcefully response deviation observe inflation target necessary sufficient strategy price stability model. the real shock buffet economy cause time variation monetary aggregates, movement uninformative: real shock manifest variable system well, variable sufficient statistic underlie state model economy. conversely, shock originate money market often un-modelled within framework, inconsequential. in model, monetary authority set interest rate function inflation deviation target automatically offset shock insulate economy potentially malign influence real variable inflation. a taylor rule job thus make monetary shock completely uninteresting monetary policy stabilisation standpoint. the question whether central bank content stylise representation economy. there two issues. • first, model trust get fact right long run? • second, monetary shock ignore even business cycle frequencies? the first issue concern long-run behaviour model. in long run, model replicate statistical association money growth inflation. but reproduce lead-lag structure link two variables. the model assume give inflation target define numerical terms. by simulate model, one prove – provide mild condition taylor rule satisfy – inflation consistently fluctuate around objective business cycle money long term grow rate consistent objective well. only exogenous innovation numerical objective – time – result last change inflation and, consequence, persistent change money growth. however, lag structure imply model – change inflation objective precede change inflation, turn precede change money growth – odds empirical evidence. one extremely robust feature possible detect statistical association money growth inflation across diverse monetary regime historical period persistent change (trend) money growth precede – rather follow – change trend inflation. this interpret money lead 6 bi review 76/2008 role signal future change inflation, even active role determine change medium term.20 i extract one lesson observation. money growth might indeed something make price stability objective credible. in model, credibility announcement stake. in reality, credibility need buttress – eye economic agent – mutually reinforce “strategic instruments”. i interpret evidence suggest money indeed act second “strategic instrument,” par clear announcement quantitative definition price stability, support definition long run. for concern behaviour model business cycle frequencies, i mention already model feature money market financial sector. consequently, simply assume away shock that, even short run, originate sectors. this two main implications: one demand money side, side liquidity credit provision. on demand side, model substantiate money’s role principal vehicle settle transaction provide “store value”, example, face heighten uncertainty. however, precisely condition see money play active role primary attractor investor financial intermediary alike search portfolio security liquidity. in mainstream model,

review 76/2008 nout wellink: the interaction economic science policy make speech dr nout wellink, president netherlands bank chairman basel committee bank supervision, receive honorary doctorate tilburg university, tilburg, 12 june 2008. * * * i would like congratulate center 20th anniversary, also academic record. i consider outstanding achievement top three economics faculty europe number 24 world. i hope achieve objective enter top 20 soon. a me, i especially grateful receive honorary doctorate renowned catholic university. be roman catholic myself, i deem appropriate start confession. at start professional career, i ask become academic tilburg university. i hesitate while, eventually i decline job. at first, i therefore sense slight feel guilt concern honour confer upon today: receive academic recognition exactly university, little twist fate i could spend work life, contribute scientific knowledge. but then, reflection, i start like idea. although i become full time academic, i always keep strong interest scientific research. in fact i believe throughout year policy work benefit greatly scientific input. the organiser interpret fact way around, emphasize contribution application scientific insight solve real world problems. i thank this. i accept honorary doctorate delight. i would like dedicate interaction economic science policy making. tension economic science policy? in view, interaction science policy bring tremendous progress fields. we careful maintain improve interaction possible. although point may seem self-evident first sight, question some. several observer notice increase gap highly formalise theory practical need policy making. an illustration perceive gap field monetary economics give recent overview paper gregory mankiw, academic well chairman council economic advisor washington. on basis thorough review highly-ranked journal, conclude recent development macro economic model “close zero impact practical policy making”. another example give british colleague mervyn king respect modern communication strategies. he argue success strategy stabilise inflation expectation low level yet fully understand scientific perspective. his claim is, therefore, monetary policy ahead economic science respect. let clear points. there indeed limit extent policy judgement base science. in almost policy decision, experience, intuition, “fingerspitzengefühl”, whatever name put it, play crucial role. perhaps role element even increase recent times. the outside world become increasingly international economic system become complex. let give one example. at dnb, job ass pass-through credit market crisis past year onto real economy. the scientific approach would rely model estimates. but unfortunately, degree uncertainty always surround bi review 76/2008 1 estimate jump even high level time financial stress. this illustrate judgement cannot base science alone. but imply gap science policy? i think so. after all, research department respond gap knowledge shift attention economic interaction extreme events. i would therefore rather stress natural interaction science policy existence gap. foster interaction science policy on interaction science policy, first thing note macro-economic science actually emerge need address practical policy issue relate great depression 1930s. science policy perform complementary tasks. without understand real world operates, would rather difficult influence it. similarly, seem le relevant understand go on, insight use good policies. scientist policy maker therefore need make effort understand other. policy maker learn structure think ensure consistency. scientist learn incorporate flexibility practical relevance need solve real world problem political constraints. i therefore believe model university focus exclusively science policy make institution abstain role scientific research. the potential synergy function large, take continuous effort realise those. in the netherlands strong tradition base policy scientific insights, thank effort make tinbergen netherlands bureau economic policy analysis (cpb). a central banks, i believe worldwide movement towards independence one drive factor great orientation towards scientific foundation policies. be free political influence preferences, legitimacy partly depend it. a such, find practical way foster mutual understand science policy. one direct way. several central bank appoint renowned academic top positions. ben bernanke fed, mervyn king bank england, athanasios orphanides central bank cyprus stanley fischer bank israel. it policy discussion benefit contribution people; also use network bring topical policy issue scientific debate. another way bring science policy close hire specialist central bank understand language specific discipline. this dnb. we employ researcher field relate core tasks. for example, research recent year focus mervyn king’s point modern monetary policy strategy may work stabilise inflation expectations. but also deal decision-making within committee structures, economic modelling, payment systems, behavioural finance, efficiency banks, financial conglomerate on. researcher dnb actually challenge job bridge science policy. they keep date scientific development field; work independently; policy-relevant topics; ask translate find practical policy advice. this last element probably distinguish research central bank research universities, incentive specialise fundamental type research stronger. impact economic science policy i argue science policy perform complementary functions, central bank perform key function foster mutual understanding. let address impact science policy. i much believe maxim “most fundamental idea science essentially simple, may, rule, express language comprehensible everyone”. this something i make myself, actually quote einstein. in field monetary policy fundamental idea 2 bi review 76/2008 science indeed intuitive simple. they tremendous impact policy. i guess familiar many key insights. on relevance price stability; cost inflation; inability monetary policy raise structural growth rate economy; importance central bank independence political influence. the point essentially simple insight distil huge often complicate body research. i think contribution 1960s 1970s shape phillips curve, research time inconsistency emerge late 1970s onwards, research central bank independence 1980s 1990s, recent discussion central bank accountability communication. perhaps current researcher take comfort fact one day outcome current scientific debate may also become glaringly obvious. but meantime need struggle science reveal answer us. conclusion let conclude forward look perspective. it seem obvious globalisation financial innovation continue, complexity economic financial system continue increase. take financial turmoil past year, i refer already. obviously need tailor policies, example financial supervision monetary policy, dynamic witness financial sector. but order need thorough understand go on. with complex dynamic financial system, demand high quality analysis research increase. at time, demand increasing, resource pressure. the efficiency operation current government apply ministry cpb also apply dnb. while i fully support need efficient government efficient central bank, i also see risk knowledge-intensive function could disproportionate pressure. a key characteristic research require relatively long time horizons, pay-off emerge medium rather short run. a result, easily crowd many policy issue continue require immediate attention. the challenge protect key research area pressures, maintain human capital base institutions. the need research always remain, whether policy maker immediately like answer not. for question answer, new one arise. i truly believe interaction science policy bring tremendous progress fields. we continue effort foster mutual understanding. let show gratitude honour confer upon thank attention. bi review 76/2008 3 ben s bernanke: dedication new federal reserve bank kansa city build speech mr ben s bernanke, chairman

commend staff, well designer builders, impressive structure. it serve kansa city entire 10th district well. permit start bite history i hope underscore crucial role play regional reserve banks. when federal reserve create 1913, nation's third attempt central bank. the first bank unite states, charter 1791, second bank unite states, charter 1816, last. they fail gain trust public fearful concentrate power. to address concern, creator federal reserve craft plan central bank unique structure: call decentralize central bank. an independent federal agency washington, d.c., board governor federal reserve system oversee 12 regional banks, serve operate arm system blend public private elements. importantly, president reserve bank participate, along washington-based board members, monetary policy deliberation federal open market committee. the president bring wealth knowledge acquire regional contacts. thus, make policy, able view economy washington perspective, wall street perspective, also main street perspective. this system serve central bank nation well nearly century. last night i attend dinner bank's current director well many former member bank's board. nationally, 278 private citizen – include business people, bankers, nonprofit executives, community, agricultural labor leader – serve board 12 bank branches. these individual provide u extensive current information economic condition unique local perspective. often, provide early warn shift economic condition show official government statistics. i commend service central bank nation. here kansa city, districts, bank branch director play important role since federal reserve's inception. a might expect, last night's dinner, talk degree bank's history, current challenges, future. in prepare event, i read little bite dedication ceremony previous kansa city feed headquarter 925 grand boulevard. one predecessor chairman, william p.g. harding, speak dedication november 16, 1921, i happy follow footsteps. consider federal reserve's history, location appropriate site federal reserve bank, new neighbor national world war i museum liberty memorial. those appreciation u.s. history know federal reserve play important role support fund first world war war force early federal reserve contend uncertain global environment wide-ranging monetary economic ramifications. the federal

mission, goal remain unchanged. and bank's former home grand boulevard serve well, today celebrate open build well serve country, region. look federal reserve broadly, must continue change, also must recognize one federal reserve's key strength continue strong regional connection foster reserve banks. to quote federal reserve board's first annual report, publish january 15, 1915: "it never lose sight reserve bank invest much quality public trust. they create existence certain common need interests, administer common welfare – good all." in spirit, let u use ceremony recognize federal

cepr/esi 12th annual conference “the evolve financial system transmission mechanism monetary policy”, co-organised bank international settlements, basel, 25-26 september 2008. * * * 1 introduction let start disclaimer: since one week away monetary policy decision speech today make reference actual monetary policy stance monetary policy decisions. rather remark fundamental nature. the financial market development past 12 month culmination event last fortnight attract lot interest general public. these event highlight interlinkages financial real sphere implication linkage monetary policy. understand development financial market cornerstone monetary policy making. this true normal times, even extraordinary time live today. an analysis monetary transmission process therefore utmost importance central bankers. and thorough understand way financial market development might influence impact monetary policy measure cornerstone recent research efforts. however, financial market also important information pool monetary policy decision-makers. the current tension financial market also complicate task derive information embed financial markets. in follow i try elaborate two relate aspect – financial market monetary policy transmission, information content financial market decision-making. i attempt always relate experience past 12 month order give real-world example illustrate general aspect topics. in order so, i give brief outline underlie cause recent financial market tensions. 2 the underlie cause recent financial market turmoil when look underlie cause recent tension global financial system, one particular development clearly identify root cause. numerous culprit put forward: securitisation, quality risk management, credit rat agencies, compensation schemes, account standard – name few. but i extremely sceptical monocausal explanations. instead, i believe cocktail various ingredient trigger shock wave rock financial system. many factor relate financial innovation or, precise, combination new complex instrument transfer credit risk “originate distribute” business model. the disruption past month highlight heighten complexity credit risk transfer (crt) instruments. this would le problematic risk management system financial intermediary keep pace change characteristic financial landscape. however, did. at time, investor base become diffuse, participant recently enter crt markets, maybe sufficiently familiar instrument hand. all suggest several investor may fully appreciate higher-risk nature crt product therefore overly optimistic assessment risk involved. bi review 116/2008 1 securitisation activity foster “originate distribute” model place large bank security firms. on positive note, securitising, tranching trade credit risk lead fairly broad risk dispersion – feature market participant observer deem purely positive. however, become clear now, “originate distribute” model actually improve resilience financial system high-quality standard maintain level transfer process new concentration risk arise. the past years, however, characterise series distort incentives, manifest lax origination standard product subprime mortgage excessive reliance credit rat investors. a final point, let add that, end day, “originate distribute” model lead – rather unexpectedly – huge reintermediation credit risk banks’ balance sheets; sense, therefore, clock turn back. in words, financial market turmoil demonstrate (1) risk disappear (2) remove asset bank balance sheet mean bank long expose risk associate them. hence, designer risk management system reconsider view credit guarantee credit line off-balance-sheet entity structure investment vehicle conduit reputational risk associate them. in nutshell, securitisation, claudio borio aptly put 2008, has, ultimately, “distributed fear rather risks”. however, financial innovation undoubtedly increase vulnerability global financial system, present financial market turmoil proliferation structure finance products. the “originate distribute” model would arguably possible without benign economic financial backdrop notably robust global economic growth, low inflation, low level interest rates, low default rate rise asset price many countries, usa. this goldilocks economy, condition neither “too cold” “too hot”, – side effect – mask gradual build-up financial imbalances; development many u see already turmoil. and bi one prominent example make clear already early stage process. hence, lend risk-taking experience rapid growth, word warn central bank institution largely go unheeded argument “this time, development surely different past”. the fact minor financial market tension spring 2005 2006 leave financial market le unscathed serve reinforce impression. however, vulnerability global financial system reveal august last year financial imbalance start unwinding, witness environment change considerably since then. 3 recent financial market tensions: lesson monetary policy the list lesson learn current financial turmoil cover many areas. i want discus detail many proposal currently debate different national international bodies. a g-7 finance minister governor recently stated, important recognise need effective regulation. in context remain fully commit recommendation financial stability forum improve resilience international financial system. while i deny importance aspects, follow i would like focus aspect relate general theme today’s conference, namely lesson learn monetary policy maker core business set short-term interest rate safeguard macroeconomic stability. i therefore intend describe reaction central bank current turmoil term money market operations, take step back sort crisis management general issue conduct monetary policy face procyclical behaviour financial market participants. 2 bi review 116/2008 in first half decade, monetary policy expansive industrial countries. this true interest rate base measure monetary policy stance, also evident indicator money credit aggregates. the expansive monetary policy stance new economy bubble burst well document unite states. but traditional indicator also signal expansionary policy stance prolong period time euro area. at time, risk premia financial market historically low reason could explain aid traditional macroeconomic factors. a empirical evidence protract low interest rate may foster financial market participants’ grog risk appetite contribute dynamic growth credit aggregate worldwide via risk-taking channel monetary policy transmission, event past 12 month also throw serious question role monetary policy. the debate monetary policy financial market often slant towards question deal asset price bubbles. here, current majority view is: a) monetary policy cannot target asset prices; b) monetary policy prick asset price bubbles; c) monetary policy focus limit fallout burst bubble ex post. in opinion, view monetary policy asset price narrow. a fruitful debate appropriate monetary policy reaction development financial market would possible focus redirect financial bubble issue procyclicality. monetary policy maker view boom bust episode financial market unrelated events. in medium term, monetary policy reaction downturn asset market influence market participants’ risk perception follow upturn. this especially evident monetary policy maker apply risk management approach asymmetrically low rate time severe financial market downturns, would deem necessary give baseline outlook price growth. a symmetric approach would treat boom bust episode isolate event would try look financial cycle order steady policy. to specific, symmetric policy would also realise implicit risk time money credit growth dynamic, asset price go risk perception decline, possibly create need act despite sufficiently low current inflation rates. this, however, mean monetary policy downgrade price stability objective sake objectives. rather, mean central bank take longer-term perspective take account future inflationary consequence unfavourable developments. and indeed, empirical work pioneer bi find excessive money credit growth significant lead indicator property sharp correction asset market severe repercussion rest economy. a financial crisis increase volatility macroeconomic variable inflation growth, give monetary policy operate traditional loss functions, result indicate symmetric policy would improve welfare macroeconomic stability. moreover, could argue variance macroeconomic variable independent monetary policy strategy chosen. a symmetric monetary policy approach financial cycle therefore additional endogenous impact. give macroeconomic relevance financial crises, good reason widen monetary policy time horizon give low-frequency movement credit monetary aggregate weight analytical framework monetary policy decision-making processes. that say approach would eliminate financial cycle altogether. however, medium long term, monetary policy follow symmetric course would dampen damage financial cycle monetary bi review 116/2008 3 policy merely try limit damage event use aggressive interest rate measures. give eye current storm u real estate market u federal reserve well know actively pursue risk-management approach, come surprise debate currently focus u monetary policy. but give prolong period low interest rate euro area past couple years, issue must also address monetary policy maker eurosystem. here, eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy already possesses, shape monetary analysis, stabilise element, especially suit analysis long-term developments. the recent financial turmoil show often criticise monetary credit analysis valuable role play monetary policy analysis. 4 mtm financial development the relationship monetary policy financial markets, however, mean one interest policy maker face crisis. development financial market potential modify core economic relationship therefore utmost interest monetary policy. let therefore move away somewhat recent stress episode discus structural issue relate financial innovation monetary policy transmission. the remarkable financial development past decade bring wide range new financial products, great competition, notable increase securitisation activities, disintermediation, consolidation process bank sector. this broaden range financial market participants’ activity possibly also change reaction shocks, e.g. monetary policy innovations. a priori, overall impact change cause financial development unclear, empirical literature provide u useful hints: increase competition bank together enhance availability alternative capital market-based instrument financial investment likely amplify and/or accelerate effect monetary policy change bank interest rate (and, ceteris paribus, output inflation). the bank lend channel generally think lose importance, • … banks’ flexibility react interest rate hike increase … • … financial development broaden borrowers’ finance options, reduce dependency bank loans. • with grow use derivative instruments, banks’ lend policy might also become le vulnerable monetary policy tighten (e.g. purnanandam (2007)). the additional fund opportunity entail large share market-based (rather bank-based) products; standardise le idiosyncratic, collateral may play important role now, potentially increase importance balance sheet channel. however, much evidence euro area whether financial development change overall monetary policy transmission process term output inflation (and specific transmission channels). we bundesbank recently take aggregate look data without impose many priori restriction estimate series canonical var order capture overall monetary transmission process euro area. more specifically, check whether notable change general way monetary policy affect output inflation. use data-driven search base aggregate data, find euro-area 4 bi review 116/2008 transmission indeed undergo notable change mid-1990s; specifically, evidence structural break around 1996 possibly second one around 1999. interestingly, change monetary transmission process seem alter long-run response real output inflation monetary policy: notably, long-run neutrality still holds, monetary policy able control inflation long term. but, maybe surprisingly, monetary transmission period 1980-1996 significantly different period 1999-2006. we interpret evidence “atypical interim period” characterise “fluctuations” “perturbations” last 1996 end 1998. during period, monetary transmission process euro area differ significantly period afterwards. however, result necessarily mean financial development leave monetary transmission unchanged: financial development may offset effect different transmission channels, e.g. speed interest rate channel, lessen importance bank lend channel boost role balance sheet channel. moreover, could well influence work well, possibly mitigate effect financial development transmission process, creation euro area or, secular trend, globalisation. to sum up: since good knowledge monetary transmission process essential monetary policy, central bank must monitor development financial market closely potential seriously affect monetary transmission process. this conference add great deal issue. at time, exist evidence must “processed” order obtain reliable empirical assessment possible change transmission process whole. for time being, monetary policy base broad range different indicator avoid run risk misread important information. 5 financial market indicator monetary policy decision make 5.1 financial market indicator information variable monetary policy the previous section examine possible effect financial market development monetary policy transmission. although ongoing development financial market may induce change monetary policy transmission, i – central banker monetary policy decision maker – would like point another link monetary policy financial market development. that – – reverse causation: how financial development affect (the) monetary policy decision make (process). important information monetary policy decision undoubtedly derive financial market indicators. when consider usual monetary policy transmission change central bank interest rate ultimate monetary policy objective, information derive financial market indicator part regular monetary policy preparation divide follow categories. first, information market expectation interest rates, include central bank interest rate expect monetary policy moves. e.g., derive interest rate path expect financial market use eonia swaps. in addition path, ass financial markets’ uncertainty surround interest rate expectations. to end, derive risk-neutral density option three-month euribor future. second, information finance condition private sector (including risk premia financial markets) well market expectation concern development major real economic indicator – real interest rate, economic activity commodity prices. third, information financial markets’ expectation future price developments, especially indicator credibility monetary policy and, hence, indicator bi review 116/2008 5 second round effects. here, use information derive inflation-indexed bond inflation swaps. all indicator prove important assess current economic situation monetary policy decisions. consequently, financial market important transmission monetary policy, also supply u important information monetary policy decisions. furthermore, financial development increase number instrument information derived. however, financial market turmoil make analysis financial market indicator even important – time make interpretation much difficult – aspect i would like illustrate follow section. 5.2 current difficulty interpret financial market indicator 5.2.1 interest rate expectation financial market expectation concern future short-term interest rate constitute important input assess possible impact monetary policy measure economic developments. short-term interest rate expectation derive financial market data show whether possible interest rate step already price financial markets. thus, change key interest rate cause market interest rate react strongly, unexpected interest rate step is. precise knowledge interest rate expectation also help counteract undesired developments, perhaps use communication policy instrument bring market interest rate expectation line central bank’s view. e.g., financial market’s interest rate expectation euro area calculate use eonia swaps. this exercise yield expect interest rate path one-month interest rate. the key interest rate expect financial market deduce assumption fix interest rate spread one-month rate minimum bid rate. base expect interest rate path one can, e.g., calculate probability financial market attach interest rate change 25 base point next govern council meeting. it clear, however, probability critically dependent assumption fix interest rate spread expect one-month rate deduce expect minimum bid rate. a one base point change assume spread would lead change probability 25 base point hike 4 base points. give current money market distortions, however, considerable fluctuation spread one-month rate minimum bid rate cannot rule out. one reason could tension swap market owe decline market participants’ willingness ability take risks. our assessment financial markets’ uncertainty regard interest rate forecast could also distort current financial market turmoil variation risk premia contain three-month money market interest rates: in order estimate market participants' uncertainty regard interest rate forecast, derive risk-neutral density option three-month euribor future. the certain market participant point forecast three-month euribor, small standard deviation estimate be. we therefore usually interpret change expect three-month euribor distribution indicate change financial markets’ expectation eurosystem policy rates. however, currently cannot rule possibility financial market turbulence cause volatility risk premium currently contain interest rate unsecuritised three-month-money (euribor). in order obtain answer question factor drive expect change, continuously analyse development euribor-forward three-month eonia swap spreads. that difference imply three-month interest rate derive euribor rate one derive eonia swaps. in general, spread provide information liquidity premium different maturity money market. financial market expectation steady decline money market uncertainty would imply 6 bi review 116/2008 ongoing drop liquidity premium also low premium time period future compare le distant time spans. 5.2.2 financial-market-based expectation important economic indicator in addition money-market analysis, monitor development capital market-oriented measure risk premia. assume freedom arbitrage capital markets, affine term structure model use determine extent macroeconomic factors, inflation rate potential output utilisation, explain current term structure. conversely, model show contribution latent undetermined factor current term structure. in germany, example, historical data show that, long term maturity, small amount interest rate variation attributable macroeconomic factor is.1 information factor drive term structure important assess whether yield curve influence shock term premium. in case, monetary policy impulse may affect long-term interest rate different way previous periods. this aspect particularly important recent past prove difficult explain low level long-term rate unite state despite increase short-term rates. this information particularly relevant look current financial market turbulence. on hand, however, current turmoil complicate derivation risk premia upwardly “distorted” money market rate usually include within set choose interest rates. 5.2.3 financial-market-based inflation expectation it extremely important central banker know level inflation expectations. they provide information inflation rate take account wage negotiations, example, whether risk temporary inflation shock lead permanent increase inflation rate could tolerate monetary policy. long-term inflation expectation therefore good indicator credibility monetary policy. information economic agents’ inflation expectation gain mostly surveys. within euro area, consensus economics ecb regularly ask information. the plausibility survey-based information generally verify use inflation premium contain financial market prices. to determine financial-market-based inflation expectations, use breakeven inflation curve well information inflation swaps. the result beir term structure difference nominal real interest rate curve. the latter derive return inflation-linked bond aaa rat euro-area countries. look long-term risk price stability fact survey-based financial-market-based long-term inflation expectation noticeably high outbreak financial market turbulence cause concern. current financial-market-based indicator inflation expectation may, however, distort turbulence. like market interest rate swaps, market inflation swap may suffer small supply inflation protection. while bank usually supply inflation protection, decrease willingness ability take risk – i.e. give le room manoeuvre liquidity-absorbing asset swap activity – could increase inflation swap premium. this could one reason difference long-term measure inflation expectation use inflation swap use beir-curve widen substantially last couple weeks. 1 see ”the determinant term structure interest rate – approach combine arbitrage-free model monetary macroeconomics”, bundesbank monthly report, april 2006, pp 15-28. bi review 116/2008 7 on hand, however, strong safe effect nominal aaa-rated government bond may cause term premium respective security shift, result downwards distortion beir curve. it consequently immediately clear whether long-term inflation expectation base swap long-term inflation expectation base beir curve currently reliable. our reaction find increase weight attach survey-based indicator long-term inflation expectation – although, course, disadvantages. 6 conclusion i try illustrate aspect close relationship monetary policy financial markets. in doing, i try strike balance focus recent event financial market general aspects. financial development potential change transmission process. financial market provide valuable information decision-makers. however, episode financial turmoil, information embed asset price distort require careful interpretation. monetary policy react financial cycle symmetric way order reduce low-frequency volatility important macro variables. all point illustrate grow influence financial market development monetary policy. however, mean alter ultimate goal monetary policy. 8 bi review 116/2008 ajith nivard cabraal: the role productivity improvement achieve economic prosperity keynote address mr ajith nivard cabraal, governor central bank sri lanka, annual general meet 2007/08 international chamber commerce sri lanka, colombo, 17 september 2008. * * * mr. chairman, distinguish invitees, lady gentlemen, i consider unique honour invite deliver key note address annual general meet international chamber commerce sri lanka (icc sri lanka). i also consider great privilege share think view timely topic, “the role productivity improvement achieve economic prosperity” since productivity improvement essential micro macro perspective. therefore, outset, i wish thank icc sri lanka invite deliver keynote address vital theme important forum give opportunity plant seed distinguish mind seed may nurture future endeavour position country high level global environment. a agree, individuals, main objective experience good life think, act react aim achieve this. at time, main objective economic management enhance standard live people. hence, relevant stakeholder country formulate, implement, revise re-implement economic policy achieve goals. whatever policy formulate pursue, ultimate aim raise live standard nation. at time, aware compulsory high economic growth fair distribution benefit growth achieve high standard living. the issue is, achieve high rate economic growth? theory say savings, investments, diversification, technology, hard work, attitude perceptions. yes. all important certain importance country’s overall performance. however, highly competitive, globalize environment limit resource endowment factor would second productivity. for sustain prosperity, productivity key. why productivity important? economist agree that, long-run, productivity growth principal mean improve live standards. the rate productivity growth influence economy important ways, even short run, affect key variable output growth, employment growth, rate inflation. so, first step, let u examine need productivity improvement current global domestic economic context lesson success emphasize productivity, could deal topic wide perspective. in view, economy focus productivity due two important reasons. first, limit expand agriculture industry sector resultant hindrance economic expansion. second, current economic context, great emphasis place expand service sector, also improve productivity order achieve high economic growth. let elaborate two reason broad manner. the economic history country clearly show set pattern transformation structure economies, typically agriculture industry services. it happen due two major reasons. first, first stage, economic value entirely create agriculture, call pre-industrial era. thereafter, source country’s economic value shift industry fast bi review 116/2008 1 industrialization. however, value creation agriculture industry constrain certain point performance agriculture industry naturally depend mainly natural resource endowment. therefore, natural resource endowment country limit expansion agriculture industry, great need improve productivity arises. second, growth limit due constraint agriculture industry, vacuum fill efficient economic activity. otherwise, economy would stagnant. hence, existence efficient vibrant service sector become necessity growth economy whole agriculture industry sector particular. although service sector often criticize sector create real wealth, theory evidence prove wide-spread development also saturation agriculture industry lead creation new source wealth dynamic growth sector form services. the service sector currently large fast grow economic activity develop develop world. the world bank estimate share service gross domestic product develop country typically 60 70 percent. while figure generally low emerge least develop countries, steadily increase years. however, equally accept existence expand service sector alone cannot generate wealth. it dynamic, vibrant add high value economy. the service sector productive efficient. today’s customer demand services, demand productive, efficient reasonably price services. let’s take close look sri lanka …. undoubtedly, sri lanka’s agriculture sector make great contribution create wealth employment past. a aware, self sufficient rice production millenniums. we produce export agriculture commodity centuries. at time independence, agriculture sector dominate share 47 per cent gdp. however, keep global domestic economic trends, relative importance agriculture sector shrinking. accordingly, share agriculture reduce 12 per cent gdp end 2007. what impact? it able create sufficient value wealth reduce share sectoral importance. while recognize historic importance agriculture sector recognize fact limitation form low contribution national output low productivity current context. notably, one third labour force engage agriculture, total output distribute among large number workers. accord world development report 2006 world bank, agricultural value add per agricultural worker sri lanka, measure 2000 u dollars, u dollar 696 period 1989-91. this increase marginally u dollar 737 2001-03. however, comparable figure countries, even emerge countries, much high figures. what result? a result, income agricultural worker sri lanka low, keep poverty line. at time, underemployment natural consequence since employment agriculture seasonal high concentration large farm-based work-force limit extent cultivable land. even disastrously, under-employment agriculture sri lanka high also increase. accord consumer finance socio-economic survey central bank, underemployment agriculture sector 1996/97 stand 31 per cent employ rise 36 per cent 2003/04. in contrast, underemployment service 2 bi review 116/2008 sector fell 20 per cent 18 per cent two reference period industry remain unchanged 20 per cent. this see weakness opportunity. we know food price record unprecedented increase recent times. hence, immense opportunity arise increase price resultant increase production. at time, food security ensure order avoid adverse consequence increase food price also undue decline stocks. give limitations, obvious strategy increase productivity. accordingly, attempt need make concentrate land, water, agricultural methods, seeds, harvesting, credit agriculture, transport, harvest storage, stable prices, value addition etc. raise productivity agriculture. if growth constrain limit expansion agriculture, can’t focus industry sector? of course, can. unlike agriculture, constrain limit land availability, industry capacity demand limitations. even non-availability raw material essential input domestic demand output long inhibit industrial growth view globalization trade service advancement information communication technology. although importance agriculture sector sri lanka reducing, share industry improving. by end 2007, share industry remain around 30 per cent gdp compare 20 per cent 1950. however, still risk weakness industry sector well. the high reliance import raw material, increase cost economic infrastructure, high wage per unit output, overall increase cost structure, intense global competition possible abolition various concession certainly tell u urgent need improve productivity industry sector well. the demand country's industrial good always depend comparative competitive advantages. this require local industry raise productivity efficiency production successfully compete rival producer part world. since sri lanka unlimited natural resource base would difficult enhance growth industry agriculture alone. a mention above, service sector important industry agriculture sector performance. hence, need focus service sector. however, focus place “more productive” service sector. although always stress importance improve productivity agriculture industry sectors, similar significance assign service sector well. despite grow weight service economies, productivity growth service slow many country share working-age population employ service remain low many countries. if wish strengthen economic growth improve foundation future performance economy, service sector need better. but strengthen growth performance challenge facing. we also confront grow globalization service rapid technological change pose huge challenge keep momentum service sector. address challenge strengthen potential service foster employment would definitely increase productivity innovation. certainly productive service sector would deliver benefit highly competitive environment. sri lanka’s telecommunication sector good example. in area par? although sri lanka huge potential service education, health tourism, haven’t do enough. so, also, case ports, financial services, include banking. we able reduce price charge increase productivity. we may need open domestic service market create new job opportunity foster innovation productivity. further regulatory reform service market create fresh opportunity firm develop new services, meet emerge global demand increase bi review 116/2008 3 employment. it also increase incentive company innovate improve productivity growth. with these, country would reach high level economic growth. before i conclude, i would like address three broad issue base three important macroeconomic fundamentals. first, unemployment; second, exchange rate third inflation. what unemployment reduction do? the decline trend unemployment low record level sri lanka bring focus need efficient use labour productivity improvements. precisely, low unemployment indicate potential hindrance future high growth prospect unless labour productivity improve substantially. it encourage observe continuous improvement labour productivity years, especially industry service sectors, contribute well high economic growth. however, increase mismatch labour supply demand reflect high rate youth unemployment, include graduates, desire join already expand public service, certain sector private sector find difficult recruit necessary skilled labour. this together decline labour force available agriculture employment indicate need improve productivity prerequisite achieve envisage high growth target balance regional development. what exchange rate do? under float exchange rate regime, sri lankan currency long regard steadily continuously depreciate currency. with mature domestic foreign exchange market, exchange rate responsive to, determine through, market force supply demand, intervention central bank limit mitigate excessive volatility market build official external reserves. the stabilization sri lanka rupee utmost underline need export import compete sector focus productivity improvement market access order maintain external competitiveness. instead wait exchange rate depreciate business become competitive, time u improve productivity whatever manner can. the garment sector, i hear try gain high productivity also cost efficiencies. how inflation productivity affect other? increase productivity important prerequisite achieve low stable inflation level long-run. the low productivity allow cost increase flow product price thereby raise inflation. therefore, low productivity growth thus represent negative supply shock generate inflationary pressures. in context, necessary pay due attention improve productivity order prevent potential inflationary pressure associate high income arise fast nominal growth cost-push factor raise cost production. the long run containment inflation necessarily rely containment monetary expansion increase production country, particularly improve productivity. a central bank, do? obviously cannot produce good service consumption economy, certainly create right conducive environment enable country’s economic performance. why central bank interest productivity? our role maintain economic price stability financial system stability. we also provide necessary payment settlement infrastructure. we advise government economic affair policy making, provide important agency service exchange control, public debt management, provident fund management regional development activity. in functions, mission “contribute sri lanka’s prosperity”. at time, central bank widely pronounce theme “success productivity”. 4 bi review 116/2008 but, obviously cannot do ourselves… the success productivity need consolidate national effort. that push great productivity level. we to, • work smarter, • combine better, • deliver results, • get right. it note private sector continue make commendable effort order improve productivity country. what icc sri lanka do? icc sri lanka play prominent essential role. since organization establish business stance broad issue trade investment policy well vital technical sectoral subject include financial services, information technology, telecommunication, marketing, environment, transportation etc., vital role play articulate need improve productivity. do now. this major contribution make country. bi review 116/2008 5 josé manuel gonzález-páramo: central bank financial turmoil speech mr josé manuel gonzález-páramo, member executive board european central bank, eleventh annual international bank conference “credit market turmoil 2007-08: implication public policy”, federal reserve bank chicago, chicago, 25 september 2008. * * * 1. introduction1 lady gentlemen, it great pleasure chicago occasion federal reserve bank chicago’s eleventh annual international bank conference. since inception, conference series aim gather prominent academics, policy-makers market participant discus issue major importance bank industries, financial system economy large, asset price bubbles, systemic financial instability, cross-border banking, financial globalisation. over time, permanent concern organiser focus implication monetary regulatory policy and, generally, public policy phenomena. it fair say great deal knowledge accumulate time thank series conferences. it also reasonable reckon foundation body knowledge put test financial market turmoil past year. when tenth annual international bank conference take place september last year, market turmoil already break central bank already engage intervention aim minimise disruption money market preserve implementation desire monetary policy stance. while market data future interest rate suggest rather protract period tension money credit markets, obvious time financial turmoil would turn one challenge event last century financial systems. indeed, international financial landscape look today different compare one year ago almost every day new event contribute re-shape further. in particular, past two week adverse event occur almost daily basis lead increase uncertainty significant financial market volatility. a large bank failed, several financial institution partly entirely take others. in response renew tensions, public authority announce number measure initiative address problem stress market trouble individual institutions. in particular, central bank step effort inject liquidity global money market order guarantee smooth functioning. a i mention earlier, one main objective series conference discus main lesson public policy arise development international bank financial sector. the continuation market turmoil allow talk benefit detachment comfort ex-post assessment. however, i like take advantage occasion share consideration ecb’s response market turmoil draw experience past year. 1 i grateful cornelia holthausen valuable contributions. bi review 116/2008 1 2. the separation monetary policy formulation implementation central banker have, naturally, eye development past year financial turmoil –and, particularly, recent intensification – great concern, potential influence adversely ability central bank steer monetary policy rates, affect transmission mechanism monetary policy and, generally, may pose threat financial stability. once credit concern build sub-prime mortgage market segment start affect interest rate trade volume euro area money market, ecb respond highly unusual market event timely forcefully adjust liquidity policy. i deal specificity ecb’s liquidity management past year – carry ecb staff tomorrow’s session “the experience crisis management” – i would like stress one fundamental principle underlie response turmoil: “the separation principle”. this principle relate dichotomy ecb’s monetary policy liquidity policy or, words, formulation implementation monetary policy. during turmoil, separation principle prove effective. support flexibility operational framework, ecb able react flexible quick manner change market environment, allow steer interest rate close policy rate mean temporary quantity adjustments, albeit without increase aggregate supply euro liquidity bank sector. the main objective ecb’s immediate last response tension money market keep control short-term interest rate first step transmission monetary policy. broadly speaking, ecb’s liquidity policy response consist three elements: first, change time liquidity provision within maintenance period (the so-called “front-loading policy”), thereby allow bank build temporary liquidity buffers. second, lengthen average maturity tender operations: turmoil, bulk liquidity supply one-week operations, 30% auction three months. a turmoil unfolded, ecb gradually increase share three-month operation moreover introduce six-month maturity operation. finally, participate joint coordination effort increase number central bank around world within context term auction facility. more specifically, collaboration federal reserve, ecb offer u dollar liquidity european bank various maturity order satisfy exceptional demand funds. i believe action prove effective ease tension short-term end global money market maintain control short-term interest rate euro area. i sure global money fund market continue benefit close cooperation time come. still, term interest rate money market continue strongly influence credit concern and, surprisingly, prove marginally sensitive change liquidity policy. a result, transmission monetary policy economy large affect ongoing turmoil. i turn question. 3. the impact turmoil monetary transmission mechanism during current turmoil, role bank transmission mechanism monetary policy bring forefront. in europe, know, universal bank continue important player financial landscape. this also play crucial role transmission monetary policy, uphold several theories, notably bank lend 2 bi review 116/2008 channel, supportive empirical findings.2 accord theory, pass-through change monetary policy interest rate real sector economy influence banks’ ability provide credit firms. this applies, particular, bank le liquid balance sheets, often small banks.3 with bank lend channel, effect monetary tighten supply credit become pronounced. the european bank sector undergo phase structural change past years. in particular, part world, european market structure financial products, asset-backed security collateralize debt obligations, grow rapidly last decade. for instance, quarterly issuance euro-denominated asset-backed security increase €20 billion begin present decade €150 billion second quarter year.4 these development potentially influence banks’ ability grant credit.5 such change important conduct monetary policy because, first, affect monetary analysis (one pillar ecb’s monetary policy strategy), second, likely affect monetary transmission mechanism. on one hand, increase securitisation expect weaken effect bank lend channel dampen effect monetary tighten supply credit. indeed, evidence point fact supply loan positively affect securitisation.6 on hand, develop efficient financial system contribute effective smooth transmission monetary policy.7 at root problem lead current financial turmoil precisely grow segment financial industry. a valuation asset-backed security asset decline rapidly, and, fact, whole securitisation model shaken, outstanding amount structure product decrease significantly. obviously, affect bank credit: accord late bank lend survey conduct euro area, 80% bank judge difficulty raise fund via securitisation negative impact bank lending.8 overall, financial turmoil may affect efficient work bank sector might impact supply credit non-financial sector. in light fact bank lend remain strong (the annual rate growth loan non-financial corporation august 2008 still robust 12.6 per cent), early quantify extent turmoil may influence provision loans. needle say, eurosystem, undoubtedly central banks, continue closely monitor situation. 2 see bernanke, b. m. gertler (1995): “inside black box: credit channel monetary policy transmission”, journal economic perspective 9, pp. 27-48. for

central bank (2008c): “the euro area bank lend survey”, january 2008. bi review 116/2008 3 4. the role uncertainty one relevant feature current turmoil high degree asymmetric information enormous increase general uncertainty financial sector. i would like distinguish two follow way:9 uncertainty owe mainly imperfect information relation credit valuations. uncertainty generally increase summer 2007, market participant realise current practice use valuation – often base almost solely rat – long valid. with type uncertainty, market participant difficulty model expect occurrence defaults. credit spread widen, also short end.10 another typical effect flight-to-quality phenomenon: previous episode high uncertainty, turmoil saver shun equity credit risk product favour government bond commodity well cash bank deposits. a result, bank deposit increase significantly. the term asymmetric information, hand, apply adverse selection problem, notably interbank market, market player long distinguish solvent insolvent borrowers. such “lemon’s problem” induce bank demand high risk premia creditor lead general increase interbank market rates. moreover, lead ration credit provision. indeed, turmoil, general tighten credit standard occur intense wide-spread. counterparty credit risk uncertainty development entire segment financial market – notably complex instrument collateralised debt obligation relate product – important element development turmoil. central bank deal increase uncertainty several accounts. first, monetary policy need take account heighten uncertainty: central bank need refine monetary financial analysis, monitor extremely closely development financial system impact pass-through policy rate economy. second, turn begin remarks, liquidity management become active. counterparty credit risk well uncertainty development liquidity need lead bank hoard liquidity impair normal function money markets. a consequence, liquidity provide market circulate smoothly normal times. moreover, nervousness market player sometimes imply strong anticipate interest rate reactions. 5. conclusion i would like conclude say monetary policy implementation certainly become challenge task result current financial turmoil. at time, flexibility ecb’s operational framework much help u cop turmoil. the ecb able maintain control short end money market, though – surprisingly – influence long maturities, price drive mainly credit concerns, remain limited. at ecb believe separation principle, i.e. separation liquidity policy measure consideration monetary policy stance, serve u well. 9 on subject, see cassola, n., m. drehmann, p. hartmann, m. lo duca, m. scheicher (2008): “a research perspective propagation credit market turmoil”, ecb research bulletin no. 7, june 2008. 10 this model formally duffie lando (2001): “term structure credit spread incomplete account information”, econometrica 69, pp. 633-664. 4 bi review 116/2008 indeed, liquidity policy aid transmission monetary policy even turbulent time experience past year, monetary policy leave free focus override objective ensure price stability. i strongly believe especially time high uncertainty rise inflationary pressure like present, stable predictable central bank policy firm anchor inflationary expectation particular importance. there doubt challenge time economies. some scientist argue wildfire long run beneficial wildlife time barren burn area cover healthy new growth. without push far analogy, let’s hope equivalent apply weak segment financial systems. this much depend ability concern party – public private – draw right lesson thoroughly implement them. bear mind, i look forward second day conference, regulatory implication ongoing event shall discussed. i wish pleasant evening. bi review 116/2008 5 jean-claude trichet: interview hospodárske noviny interview mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, conduct 21 september 2008 bratislava m ľubomíra

soon slovakia enter 1st january next year. we presently 320 million 325.5 million. so sake 325.5 million take decisions. and base integrate analysis full body euro area, exactly like federal reserve look absolutely usa alaska, well florida, california massachusetts. so, soon in, integrate overall assessment appropriate 325,5 million fellow citizens, whose, fellow citizens, exactly definition price stability, since beginning. we start eleven, twelve, 13, 15, clearly definition price stability medium term, le 2%, close 2% level euro area whole. my colleague myself, governor šramko member govern council – 22 take decision, 21 – make judgement good 325,5 million citizens. people slovakia afraid rise price january 2009. even ecb describe doubt sustainability inflation slovakia convergence report. what government inflation? the ecb responsible price stability level euro area. price stability mean medium term le 2 percent, close two percent average euro area. we encourage slovakia, economy country enter euro area, care price stability sustainable medium long run. this strong message. and always give message particularly slovakia, countries. we always insist sustainability price stability. so would call upon authority prepare changeover best fashion possible, extreme care. we would also tell people, customers, households: vigilant, market economy price depend supply demand. they depend vigilance consumers, must maximum level vigilance moment changeover, truth. what government inflation? again, structural reform absolutely essence, improve competition competition necessary care stable prices. it crucial element permit stable prices. so would encourage government slovakia pursue reforms. we would also ask governments, particularly slovakia, include slovakia, strictly respect stability growth pact. it essential coordination solidity euro area. it also permit avoid inflationary pressures. bi review 115/2008 1 a look back two year current government, think enough fiscal policy structural reform fight inflation? one always encourage government go direction, i would say yes, number structural reform make encourage future, reason complacency continue actively. slovakia adopt law allow government regulate price cases. do think necessary law slovakia euro? it examine carefully. i say, stage i complete analysis legislation, look carefully. again, count essentially market economy level competition, producers, vigilance consumer exert maximum pressure competition work well. there suspicion insider trade slovakia second change central parity. do hear think? i hear public. i opinion that. we consider ecb matter examine authority slovakia. what impact could financial crisis eurozone impact would slovakia enter euro area? slovakia part global economy slovakia global economy, euro area course usa. so i don’t think, financial turbulence observe analyse connection transition entry euro area. all i would say stage probably slovakia, already eye market participant euro area, doesn’t feel turbulence perhaps others, yet consider euro area. the euro area certainly protection much turbulence present universe. but said, look carefully ecb situation. we say since begin financial turbulence would monetary policy stance, would design deliver price stability medium term would implement monetary policy refinance bank money market order short term interest rate money market close possible policy rates. this since beginning. we publish recently staff projection incorporate information coming, usa also asia, latin america, emerge market continent central eastern europe order best possible projections. we take account absolutely everything global level staff projections. some analyst say crisis may one year. what would think it? i would say ongoing process. it market correction great dimension ongoing episode turbulences, hectic behaviour markets. you mention already definition price stability, inflation euro area higher. what dangers? the present headline cpi level incorporate price oil, price commodities, shock global level cope with. and deliver 2 bi review 115/2008 price stability medium term, mean le two, close two percent. that said, order deliver price stability medium term, line definition, must avoid second round effect price set well wage negotiations. to contrary, necessary inflation go down, back definition price stability. a mandate requiring, fellow citizen ask us, keen ask u deliver price stability. this necessary sustainable growth sustainable job creation. and reason recommend towards social partner also price setter strictly avoid second round effects. bi review 115/2008 3 ardian fullani: the bank system – promoter economic development speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, regional meet “the bank system – promoter economic development”, kukës, 12 september 2008. * * * dear governor, dear mayor kukës municipality, dear mayor prizren municipality, dear mr. uldedaj, dear mr. basha, dear participants, i delight today many good reason i look forward gathering. for second time within relatively short period time i see gigantic engineer work grow every day take final shape. every single person visit road segment rëshen – kalimash understand front extraordinary engineering, civil, useful, far-sighted patriotic work. similarly, return kukës quite long time surprise me. there complete airport, cross-border activity intensified, climate extraordinary soon town turn city modern infrastructure. numerous opportunity ahead you. your cleverness stand perceive make use cleverly order enhance opportunity kukës community north-east region. the reason make feel delight presence kosovar counterpart, mr. hashim rexhepi. this meet special significance. the central bank republic kosovo grow consolidate day day management albanian professional unlike time ago management central bank task foreign central banker. meet kind turn tradition. after hold similar meet korça, gjirokastra, shkodra saranda introduce new reality north-east region, i believe town kukës play key role area. through regional meet aim touch economic financial reality different region albania. give weather, cultural, social, geographical, demographic, objective subjective characteristics, region different economic social development opportunity levels. from viewpoint, aim fully acquaint specific characteristics, identify financial natural resources, formulate “recipes” advice would help make rational use them. beyond i previously stated, i would like clarify exploration potential different region offer identification level use also essential term bank system’s activity, particular geographic expansion financial intermediation. another major reason motivate bank albania organize meet relate establishment effective communication channel bank albania public. we believe direct contact various social group different geographic region (that every family), addition traditional mean communication, press conferences, monetary policy financial stability reports, efficient tool frequently determinant. bi review 115/2008 1 i would like dwell today matter interest entire audience. first i would like make brief outline bank albania’s late analysis economic financial situation albania: in brief, three main development great interest audience: with regard international developments, economic financial situation complex last months. inflation turn point concern foreign economies, mainly drive high price raw materials, oil food. in addition, economic activity develop economy experience sharp turns. euro area economy present front many questions, u asian economy show slow rate economic growth. credit crisis cause many reputable international institution experience large financial loss contamination process still present. recently, two u mortgage giants, freddie mac fannie mae, verge collapse, subject unprecedented costly rescue plan design u treasury department. all issue trigger uncertainty markets, cause future forecast challenge participants’ exasperation peak. i would consider immunity show economy term price stability outstanding development. albania’s economic activity progress line previous expectations. a day ago, instat publish inflation figure august 2008, accord annual inflation mark 2.5%. follow 12-month period inflation rate stand around 4-4.5%, line forecasts, assess inflation fluctuate next month around 3%, quantitative objective. worth note, however, risk upward deviation still present mostly relate international development mention above. the main risk stem internal environment relate possible deterioration energy situation plausible implication fiscal situation future. for moment, main risk stem lag effect (otherwise refer second round effects) certain development rise wage beyond acknowledge logical level. any similar rise would generate new inflation, late impose another rise wages, turn would trigger inflation. i think right path. wage-inflation spiral study relatively early represent least appropriate recipe offset inflation effects. i would like move late performance bank system, good side risk associate them. the albanian bank system go phase swift development promotion new products. i believe notice many bank engage aggressive market strategy promote different type household loan term attractive interest rate deposit collection. in addition, banks’ branch agency constantly expanded. only present year, 73 new branch agency open 15 others process opened. the characteristic le apply district kukës well. currently, six private bank perform bank business kukës, two bank process commence operate. a end june 2008, bank system extend total 1.2 billion lek new credit (around 15 million usd) 66% household rest business area. it nice notice figure account 66% deposit collect region, provide evidence relatively high financial intermediation level. the rapid development bank system, high competition bank market banks’ eagerness win market share require great prudence. the bank albania take number measure increase prudence view attain bank system stability. in last meeting, supervisory council bank albania take follow decisions: 2 bi review 115/2008 • some amendment regulation “on risk management activity foreign banks’ branches”; • some amendment regulation “on capital adequacy ratio”; • some amendment regulation “on credit risk management”; • approval regulation “on minimum requirement information disclosure bank branch foreign banks”; • approval regulation “on transparency bank financial product services”. the entire package regulation launch open forum spring bank system. this package aim good discipline bank system term assess credit risks, set penalty bank non-performing loan increase, encourage lend lek enhance transparency bank client product service. dwell issue financial stability, i would like underline bank albania scrutinize cautiously development external sector economy, moment remain concern term long-term development economy. the stable growth import good service current deficit deepen require special attention. the main implication relate among others financial stability home root impose correction long-term imbalance within short period time. trigger increase real estate prices, steady appreciation lek, workers’ remittance rapid growth credit budget expenditure present year, high current deficit become dominant phenomenon external sector economy. their automatic abrupt adjustment would prompt correction exchange rate rapid strong depreciation lek, drop private public consumption reduce economic activity could generate crisis external sector spread economy, hence, jeopardize financial stability home. avail opportunity address audience i would like explore issue further. skip theoretical arguments, i would note high current deficit mainly originate consumers’ behaviour. in plain words, i try say general economic level consume produce. this extra consumption, mainly finance borrowing, mainly drive expectation high income future. that is, household level, deficit, trigger insufficient income cover household consumption. the international financial crisis negative consequence global economic financial activity stem household consumption beyond source (providing additional finance bank loans) rise real estate prices. this consumption approach follow increase current deficit long-term liability households. when liability exceed long-term equilibrium level, household sector could long pay accumulate debt. what consequences? an extreme constrain adjustment consumer behaviour approach. household could long pay debt bank maintain level consumption. these individual imbalance altogether appear macro level, mainly form abrupt fall demand, slow economic activity depreciation exchange rate (us dollar depreciation). naturally, financial system could escape affect challenge contagion. bi review 115/2008 3 what i state point necessity make thorough analysis micro level addition macro ones. that is, recipe attain stable macroeconomic situation begin sustain prudent analysis micro level. it reason i would like dwell explore one indicator affect structure model household budget. i refer workers’ remittance play key role smooth consumption low level, meet investment needs, mainly real estate small household businesses. remittance somehow offset low productivity negative effect trigger unemployment. in addition, help preserve financial stability, establish balance ratio income expenditure. give importance workers’ remittances, one would rightly raise follow question: what perspective? how manage effectively? for relatively long period time, vital country. accord bank albania survey first quarter 2008, 26% albanian household live territory republic albania recipient remittance abroad. households’ geographical distribution indicate 59% recipient family live rural area rest urban ones, receive 66% 34% total workers’ remittances, respectively. remittance represent important component rural families’ monthly income, account 40%. the large part workers’ remittance (about 70%) first quarter 2008 use non-productive purposes. about 48% use consumption, entail meet households’ everyday need food, clothes, furniture, etc., 16% construction reconstruction 10% education medical purposes. around 19% remittance use investment savings, provide evidence economic impact albania. despite figures, future prospective yet unclear. the integration albanian host countries, economic financial situation similar reason negative impact long term. our analysis assessment show difficult economic situation develop economy experiencing, express economic slowdown, unemployment growth increase inflation, also provide impact performance remittance grow le year relative previous years. empirical study bank albania show cease flow would put consumption model long-term balance external sector economy difficult position. our concern relate household budget stand fact behaviour model adopt household level also affect behaviour model give regions. the albanian economy large make evident progress, detach ida country group. macroeconomic indicator relatively long period positive stable. however, beyond nationwide average indicators, detail statistic region indicate welfare mountain area progress slow rate relative regions. accord world bank assessments, average resident mountain area 12% le per caput real

bank supervision, international conference bank supervisor 2008, brussels, 24 september 2008. * * * introduction good morning welcome brussels fifteenth international conference bank supervisors. i would like begin thank governor guy quaden national bank belgian chairman jean-paul servais belgium’s banking, finance insurance commission graciously host conference. the organisation conference begin shortly icbs mexico ended. despite extensive preparation belgian hosts, i think kind plan could prepare u experience financial markets. the event witness past two week nothing short extraordinary. some world’s large financial institution declare bankruptcy, purchase throw government lifeline. considerable uncertainty market volatility persist likely continue time come. the official sector, include supervisory community, work promote deleveraging process limit much possible spillover financial real economy. a supervisors, central banker policy maker – make this? just caution banker good time prepare rough time inevitably lie ahead, must use opportunity ass lesson learn good prepare future. this morning i would like share view lesson crisis teach u and, importantly, use experience good prepare future. clearly, still midst process lesson likely arise. a know, belgium home country, netherlands, shore north sea, extremely stormy times. in past, people mercy storms. for instance, 1570 20,000 people die one bad storm history. so people react? they build dike protect floodwaters. despite buffers, bite 50 year ago, netherlands well belgium, uk germany catch enormous flood, flow dike – buff – build good years. i believe story good metaphor recently happen global financial system. from time time witness financial storms. a supervisor learn experience build dikes, buffers, protect future floods. nevertheless, land beneath dike – financial system economy – erode due pass time batter tremendous storm. a builder dikes, role continually monitor strength condition dikes; ass damage cause storm try anticipate next storm. banker important role preserve soundness dike – supervisor sole responsibility. origin storm a almost financial crisis, leverage risk concentration play central role current situation. i quick add, however, leverage problem. indeed, risk take leverage essential element banking. instead, i focus manner element manage controlled. a bi review 115/2008 1 financial storms, poor execution basic root today’s problems. complacency – part banker supervisor – certainly play role. the bank industry exceedingly optimistic time benign economic condition – sea calm. it difficult keep proper perspective exercise prudent judgment competitor generate huge volume business. a one banker famously say last year “as long music playing, you’ve get get dance”. well, role central banker take away punch bowl party get going, perhaps role supervisor silence band banker stop dancing. supervisor – part – tend focus bank-specific issues. but, learned, must also pay attention broad aspect financial stability. for example, excessive leverage, risk concentration maturity mismatch – whether on- off-balance sheet – example destructive force that, especially combination, severe consequence entire sector economies. one main lesson turmoil clear: banker supervisor need remain focus big picture long term horizon. risk management oversight let give example fundamental aspect risk management oversight violate many. a supervisors, see time time financial crisis characterise failure adhere basic risk management principles, especially time financial innovation. this crisis different. weakness fundamental underwrite principles, among factors, key contributor asset quality problems. so poor risk management, firm allow build-up massive risk concentration across firm compound already shaky asset quality. some bank catch completely unaware concentration subprime loan loan portfolios. others fully understand full exposure subprime mortgages, particularly purchase exposure contain dozen exposure – i course refer cdos abs. poor asset quality risk concentration heart turmoil involve subprime mortgage lead exceptional uncertainty volatility see today. these problem compound uncertainty relate valuation practices. what take away this? that bank – supervisor – must redouble effort ensure sound underwrite standard place adequate, systematic procedure identify firm-wide risk concentrations. originate-to-distribute business model what factor – aside complacency – hind adoption basic principles? perhaps one stumble block expand use originate-to-distribute model. manage model’s associate risk pose significant challenge and, cases, lead large risk exposure concentration firms’ senior management fail detect. the recent problem originate-to-distribute model one incentives. instead traditional focus borrower’s ability repay loan, many bank focus instead generate high volume loans, book income fee receive originate mortgages. many firm choose invest necessary time resource thorough credit analysis underwrite since someone else would purchase mortgage. 2 bi review 115/2008 investor perform due diligence. instead, rely due diligence originator packagers, lack interest exercise due diligence. they also place undue reliance judgment credit rat agencies, capacity modern technology diversification manage financial risks. what draw this? the combination excess lend obvious failure adhere fundamental sound risk management standard produce significant loss mortgage portfolios; also taint asset type key broad securitisation credit distribution process. the reckless use originate-to-distribute model increase uncertainty regard credit quality, risk reside impact deterioration. this heighten uncertainty suggest maintain capital buff – dike – bank need good job capture risk relate business model. we build high dike must forget importance build sound foundation, high quality capital. basel ii provide necessary framework within achieve enhancements. i return capital issue moment. liquidity liquidity another victim current storm demise hold valuable lesson supervisors. increase banks' liquidity cushion improve liquidity risk management supervision area sharp focus committee. we see massive illiquidity certain market segment (especially complex structure products) much long period market participant would predicted. complex illiquid investor-specific instruments, resecuritisations, experience significant market-value losses, lead loss confidence financial worthiness dry liquidity short-term interbank market. the recent turmoil show bank must strengthen liquidity buffers. one way increase hold high quality liquid security – particular, liquid central government securities. the committee’s guidance sound liquidity risk management supervision vigorous supervisory follow-up help raise bar area. we continue examine topic liquidity focus cross-border aspect liquidity supervision. while liquidity risk cannot mitigate capital, capital form liquidity since, unlike liabilities, repaid. furthermore, strong capital buff enhance bank’s creditworthiness and, market’s perspective, reduce counterparty risk. this help ensure continue access funding. capital adequacy and bring issue capital adequacy. after several year high profits, often record profits, know level risk grossly underestimate many financial institutions. this late storm therefore reveal crack dike supervisory community process patch cracks. high loss put pressure capital cushion many bank force go market replenish capital base. this critical contraction lend credit avoided. of great importance, though, crack dike yet evident. while know nature strength next storm, take measure today strengthen dike could withstand battering. one measure significantly strengthen banks’ capital buffers. in addition move ahead aggressively basel ii, committee issue proposal strengthen capital treatment risk capture basel ii’s exist trade book regime. in context, committee also carefully consider topic procyclicality, especially influence bank capital issues. there many dimension here, bi review 115/2008 3 level quality capital; provisioning, capital buff ability bank dip buffers. we continue review issue relate procyclicality process develop work programme address near term longer-term issues. the committee also develop enhance guidance pillar 2, supervisory review process. here, focus improve risk management practices, stress test management risk arise complex instruments, among things. we also develop proposal strengthen pillar 3 disclosures, especially securitisation activities. conclusion we learn much severe storm currently raging. i outline measure bank supervisor must take good prepare next storm. but become increasingly clear that, time, bank system need strengthen capital liquidity buff withstand prolong period stress financial system broad economy. this do manner aggravate current stress system. enhancement risk management market transparency help, must enhance banks’ buff reflect increase degree uncertainty system. the need increase margin protect uncertainty also become apparent rapid financial innovation continue uncertainty increase new products, valuations, market real economy interact time stress. this good reflect risk already inherent – perhaps easily recognise – banks' portfolios, either regulatory internal metrics. finally, enforcement bank supervisor basic sound risk management underwrite practice key promote return financial stability. 4 bi review 115/2008 jean-claude trichet: the entry slovakia euro area speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, “slovakia euro changeover conference”, bratislava, 22 september 2008. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure here, bratislava, conference take place week slovakia join euro area january 2009. let first congratulate party involve preparation implementation euro adoption strategy since 2004. today, look forward launch single currency slovakia next january. this country become 16th member euro area. 1. slovakia’s economic achievement way euro i would like stress transition euro national economy challenge need prepare carefully. slovakia, early difficulties, prove real success story recent years, enjoy strong economic growth mark increase employment. average annual real gdp growth reach remarkable 8.5% 2005 2007, average annual employment growth close 3% period. slovakia make notable progress nominal real convergence. in respect nominal convergence, inflation rather volatile first half decade. but recently, economy see gradual decline hicp inflation, reach 1.9% 2007, although first half 2008 rise 3.7%. a ecb always stressed, low-inflation environment attain recent past need confirm sustain year come. the convergence long-term interest rate even dynamic, around 5%, third le early decade. it’s change reflect confidence financial market participant policy pursue authorities. some progress also achieve regard consolidation public finances. however, ecofin council bring excessive deficit procedure slovakia end recently june year. look ahead, ambitious additional consolidation effort appear necessary slovakia reach medium-term objective structural deficit 0.8% gdp 2010. the vitality country’s economy see compare real gdp growth euro area. between 2000 2007 average economic growth slovakia 5.6%, significantly average economic growth euro area. this result real economic convergence gdp per inhabitant purchase power parity term percentage gdp per inhabitant “euro area” increase 44% 2000 62% 2007. the good time slovak economy exemplify rise real incomes. importantly, gain prosperity also spread beyond country’s economic heart bratislava, even though considerable disparity region still exist. slovakia experience limit external economic imbalance recent years. the current account deficit remain relatively contain past year and, due increase export capacities, fact shrink lately. unit labour cost recently favour competitiveness slovak producers. the koruna participate exchange rate mechanism ii since november 2005. the underlie strong macroeconomic performance lead gradual appreciation bi review 114/2008 1 nominal exchange rate euro, without impair competitiveness slovak exporters. reflect strong macroeconomic fundamentals, central parity slovak koruna euro revalue 8.5% 17.65% march 2007 may 2008, respectively. economic progress slovakia base series structural reforms. the substantial reform tax social benefit together great flexibility product labour market bring slovakia attention foreign investors. the ensue inflow foreign direct investment boost economy promote rapid real gdp growth. and days, ever, pace reform early year maintain order reap benefit euro adoption. 2. sustainable convergence key euro adoption slovakia imply benefit single market enhance single currency. the euro offer credible framework price stability remove exchange rate uncertainty within euro area. slovakia benefit stability-oriented policy ecb, help anchor inflation expectations. furthermore, euro adoption may help shield slovakia, small highly open economy, effect international financial turbulence, often disproportionate effect small economies. however, euro remain success story slovakia, national authority need alert pursue ambitious economic policy fronts. our main concern slovakia, catching-up economy, likely face inflationary pressure could derail economy sustainable convergence path euro adoption. top priority must therefore give sustainable economic convergence slovak economy towards mature country euro area. this certainly cannot see automatic outcome join euro area – indeed, require major effort year come party concerned. we appreciate fact slovak authority firmly commit pursue appropriate supportive policy – one aim particular maintain sustainable convergence, underpin external competitiveness strengthen economic resilience. fulfil commitment vital slovak economy function smoothly within euro area. let stress three area consider crucial preserve sustainable convergence slovakia. firstly, euro adoption, monetary policy long autonomous, rigorous credible implementation fiscal policy line stability growth pact commitment essential contain inflationary pressure economy. to purpose, fiscal adjustment structural term must least 0.5% gdp per year medium-term objective reach 2010. secondly, function slovakia’s labour market must improve high structural unemployment reduced. while reform educational system might help reduce unemployment medium term, make labour legislation flexible well eliminate exist wage rigidity would help alleviate pressure labour market rapidly. any temptation introduce wage indexation scheme resisted; social partner focus labour productivity growth competitiveness main factor wage adjustments. refrain kind mechanical wage indexation particularly important today avoid spillover recent elevate level inflation wage salaries. 2 bi review 114/2008 thirdly, authority must also focus improve business environment slovakia order enhance productivity growth continue attract foreign capital. the strengthen competitive environment see prerequisite initiatives. commitment policy actor key. only decisive approach government social partner area would, view, help keep slovakia’s inflation sustainable track future. the slovak authority must ambitious pursue sound economic policy that, jointly stability-oriented policy ecb, bring sustainable economic growth, job creation social cohesion people slovakia. 3. preparation changeover the ecb value fruitful cooperation develop národná

radovan jelašić: payment card business serbia speech mr radovan jelašić, governor national bank serbia, round table discussion payment card business, belgrade, 17 september 2008. * * * distinguish member press, colleague banker host event, i would like first warmly thank organizer round table payment card business invitation give introductory speech take part discussion event. payment card business, together overall system payment operations, represent backbone stable efficient financial industry market. supervision operation serbia, however, remit national bank. recently, witness major, technological regulatory change domain payment card business equally europe worldwide. it significance economy meet even exceed payment cash consequently grab attention financial market regulatory authority central banks. perhaps significant decision domain one take master card (under supervision, say pressure, european antimonopoly commission) cut cross-border interchange fee zero level, hence open new era relation payment card systems, financial market regulatory authorities, bank trader europe worldwide. besides, initiative european commission european central bank develop new european payment card system within implementation sepa agreement (if you’ll permit boast bit, follow footstep “dina card”) visa master card already establish strong position themselves, show important payment card become stability payment systems, financial, also social point view. today, shall also attempt discus current issue prevail economy. one topic discussion (and often bone contention) nb commercial bank course several recent year treatment payment card debit card overdrafts. i sincerely hope shall see discussion matter strongly contribute improvement quality system. on part, i wish reaffirm position nb continue best effort begin six year ago promote intense development card business serbia. let remind number transaction process dina card system (set nb five year ago) average 25 million per year, almost one million initiate mobile telephone. our project dina card system cooperation banks, trader telecom operator comprise: • mobile telephone top via sm message

payment card issue quadroupled, number card issuer increase 50% reference rate trim quarter value since 1990s date. now guess whether cost interchange circumstance decrease oligopolies, visa master card? the answer – cost interchange increased. to me, main issue long whether nb need take administrative measure enable fast development card business serbia. the answer yes, administrative measure need take nbs, question remain area way measure advantage disadvantages. should measure relate maximization interchange fee payment via debit payment via credit card, measure encourage trader charge

barbro wickman-parak, deputy governor sverige riksbank, handelsbanken, stockholm, 19 september 2008. * * * hawk dive – opinion may differ way try characterise colleague executive board riksbank, cannot deny major impact. how often term use medium vary somewhat time depend great difference opinion among executive board member assume moment. prior recent repo rate decision, term use quite frequently claim fight hawk dive board direction interest rate take. the minute late monetary policy meeting, publish day yesterday, reveal i one dive – i lapse ornithological terminology. this time, i would like add – intention characterise permanent dove, i intend become permanent hawk. a monetary policy decision-maker cannot sit predetermine rut, even though would make life easy like express clichés. the minute also reveal board divide right middle, indeed speculate beforehand. it governor's cast vote decide issue lead repo rate increase rather leave unchanged. before i explain lay behind decision present view, i would like say something general even result vote. there number observation reflection make i feel worth highlighting. i intend conclude say something new statistic present since meeting. a great deal happen recently, least financial markets. an entirely divide executive board unusual a first observation look past unusual board split middle. during almost ten year board exist approximately 85 monetary policy meet held, fact happen four times, count late meeting. the usual result, surprisingly, board unanimous. fairly frequently, however, third meetings, least one member enter reservation interest rate decision. a aside may worth point time perhaps noticeable disagreement. these days, also decide forecast repo rate. at meet july, example, board member agree increase interest rate. but three u felt forecast repo rate path period ahead some-what lower. this disunity attract lot attention medium also provide clue make easy forecast vote would late meeting. previously, begin publish interest rate forecasts, also different opinion among board member interest rate develop future. but forecast repo rate publish nothing concrete enter reservation against, difference opinion visible outside world. it probably also case future development repo rate discuss much internally today. bi review 113/2008 1 disagreement healthy sign another thing i feel worth point disagreement among member board see sign weakness. this would perhaps reasonable interpretation hold view board member wise simply "calculate" decision possible correct one agree it. unfortunately, world far complicate possible. and possible would real reason let monetary policy decision make board six members. it would enough single wise decision-maker. in recent decades, however, trend opposite direction. all world, become common let monetary policy decision make group individual – committee board – rather central bank governor alone. probably important explanation many central bank become independent period. this make seem natural delegate right make decision group people rather one individual. this development mean research monetary policy decision-making group accelerated.1 one result emerge group tend make good decision individuals.2 this may member group different backgrounds, knowledge experience bring monetary policy discussion. these difference mark decision group make different way decision tend good decision individual would make alone – whole become great parts. this apply irrespective decision make – voting, riksbank, way. so, fact disagree see sign everything work way suppose to. it would fact surprise entire board support every interest rate decision made. unusually difficult ass situation the third thing i would like point perhaps important. this even vote course anything else sign unusually difficult ass current situation – fine balance drawn. i think important say really picture emerge debate. instead, unchanged repo rate often portray reasonable self-evident alternative. even though i eventually come conclusion interest rate remain un-changed, i must say i feel entirely self-evident decision. the executive board thus decide small possible margin increase interest rate 0.25 percentage points. three main reason give this. first, inflation continue increase. in july reach high level measure since mid-1990s far inflation target. the much-publicised revision cpi statistic sweden last week significantly alter picture, way, even though figure june high july. secondly, inflation expectation also still high. different measure paint slightly different pictures, measure inflation target. thirdly, cost pressure 1 for review current research see, example, blinder, a., ”making monetary policy committee”, essay present conference ”international experience conduct monetary policy under inflation targeting”, 22-23 july, 2008, bank canada. 2 see, example, blinder, a. j. morgan, ”are two head good one? an experimental analysis group versus individual decision making”, journal money, credit bank 37, 2005, 789-811. 2 bi review 113/2008 increased. this largely relate fact growth productivity surprisingly weak time. the assessment make majority increase need prevent price rise energy food spread area – prevent high level inflation become entrenched. the increase expect help bring inflation back level close target within couple years. resource utilisation also expect fall roughly normal end forecast period. at time repo rate increased, repo rate path period ahead adjust downwards compare decision take july. this partly growth slow expect sweden abroad partly price oil price commodity fallen. the increase may way safeguard real economy long term a common reaction decision increase interest rate riksbank pay much attention inflation little attention real economy. i would like comment claim. one reason increase interest rate increase need prevent high level inflation become entrenched. this could happen price increase energy food begin spread areas. this could ultimately lead risk riksbank's ability hold inflation check call question inflation expectation remain consistently high level. this happen 1970s many part world, although inflation time become entrench much high level would case today. but even though level much low today, could still relatively costly get inflation back target. it cannot rule could require quite long period high interest rate restrict demand. there thus risk conduct expansionary policy today would sooner late give rise cost real economy that, furthermore, could quite considerable. i feel, therefore, correct say increase interest rate indication riksbank care real economy. it rather case focus clearly inflation target able avoid considerable cost real economy slightly long term. i perhaps add forecast monetary policy update, i mentioned, resource utilisation roughly normal, rather low, end forecast period. so perspective question claim riksbank pay little attention real economy. in view, argument increase interest rate put forward majority reasonable. so even though i vote leave repo rate unchanged i respect majority's view. but mean i share it. it possible different view great risk contagion effect is, i different view majority. my view so, think time? a i say minutes, i already saw clear sign slowdown swedish economy time monetary policy meet july. the outcome figure indicator present since july meet also clearly indicate weaken economic activity. resource utilisation, calculate riksbank use various measures, currently estimate high normal, fall rapidly. capacity utilisation accord statistic sweden national institute economic research, still high level move downwards. the downswing bi review 113/2008 3 swedish economy come sooner pronounce expect month ago. it cover manufacture industry well retail service industries. household clearly become pessimistic, least regard national economy labour market. for example, survey conduct national institute economic research end 2007 show excess amount 40 per cent household believe unemployment would low year's time. now, however, excess amount 50 per cent household belief unemployment high one year ahead. this deterioration general sentiment accompany fall-off private consumption. this apply mainly capital goods, common begin economic downswing. but private consumption declined; investment export also weakened. gdp growth revise downwards 2008 2009, although forecast predict recovery 2009 line development abroad believe sweden's export import drive force context. however, i far sure upswing economic activity actually take place. development usa play key role recovery expect begin next autumn presuppose house market stabilised, repercussion financial crisis fade employment begin increase again. a international forecast highly uncertain, also apply recovery predict take place sweden next year. when come inflation, course impossible deny uncomfortably high today. however, i believe outcome figure contain evidence show price increase oil commodity spread areas. the repo rate increase july also intend prevent contagion effects. the risk effect also decline recently, partly due fall price oil commodity partly economic activity declining. the development productivity disappointment really good explanation weak. weak productivity also help keep cost pressure high. however, i worry early economic activity high pressure labour market stronger. in current economic situation probably difficult company pas cost increase consumers. there every reason continue keep close eye inflation expectation still way inflation target. my assessment is, nevertheless, decline economic activity weaken actual rate inflation falls. to sum say executive board agree great deal – economic activity weakening, inflation decline possible reduce interest rate period ahead. our disagreement relate primarily different assessment strength process much monetary policy would need help reduce inflation. my final assessment inflation period ahead move towards target, roughly way illustrate monetary policy update, without need increase interest rate. i thus vote leave repo rate unchanged. nor i support repo rate path present monetary policy update. the path low compare assessment make july. but i felt force economic downswing may easily make necessary reduce interest rate indicate new path. 4 bi review 113/2008 new statistic development financial market some important statistic publish since make decision interest rate. these include inflation figure august show cpi increase 4.3 per cent last 12 months. this 0.2 percentage point low forecast monetary policy update. everyone produce inflation forecast know difficult exactly ass monthly change nothing remarkable forecast deviation 0.2 percentage points. a factor contribute forecast error statistic sweden, publish new figures, also downwardly revise inflation figure period january end july year. it course unfortunate miscalculation make variable central importance riksbank many others, point rare. the revision attract lot medium attention speculation riksbank would decide differently miscalculation know time decision made. the july figure cpi 4.4 per cent, revise figure 4.1 per cent. allow therefore comment briefly this. it need hardly say decision, two colleague also enter reservation, recommend unchanged interest rate would effected. whether would affect decision majority i cannot course say. but remember process analysis great quantity information lead overall assessment economic development inflation prospects. and forecast derive information largely determine interest rate decision. in late assessment base belief inflation somewhat high prof case. but monetary policy degree precision control inflation tenth degree. and, moreover, inflation july high far inflation target even downward revision figure. in discussion ahead interest rate decision, i member executive board highlight weak labour market indicator uniformly point weak development employment, also line riksbank's forecast. after decision, labour force survey august presented. this show employment increase moderate 0.5 per cent 12-month basis, marginally low riksbank's forecast. at september meeting, access initial version national account second quarter. these show gdp increase compare previous quarter increase 0.7 per cent calendar-adjusted12-month basis. now revise version national account published, see growth first two quarter marginally adjust downwards cases. this mean growth first quarter 2 per cent 12-month basis calendar effect take account. the correspond figure second quarter 0.6 per cent. the new figure thus confirm sharp downturn growth rate completely support picture could discern late meeting. increase cost pressure important factor behind series interest rate increase introduce riksbank. the new figure national account show figure hour work revise up-wards compare version available u september. together marginal downward revision figure growth, mean productivity decline indicate preliminary figures. a figure labour cost per hour work also adjust upwards, new figure show unit labour cost increase 5.3 per cent 12-month basis second quarter. this almost percentage point preliminary version national accounts. the fact productivity weak may company time adjust workforce downturn economic activity sudden. we see number vacancy fall plan recruit new personnel bi review 113/2008 5 tone down. an adjustment underway follow recovery productivity, line riksbank's forecast. rise cost course factor riksbank every reason monitor analyse carefully. but i mention earlier, view give down-turn economic activity become apparent difficult see company would able pas increase costs. at late meeting, price oil fall peak level july, fall since then. let say word development financial markets. we see new wave unrest sweep across international financial markets. this nothing new something live year now. from time time appear thing may calm somewhat, unrest return forms. over last days, major american investment bank number player experience acute problems. it difficult say moment end. we course follow development closely. so far, note financial stability sweden satisfactory. swedish bank marginally involve exposure u market limited. nevertheless, swedish market significantly affect event international stage. the cost borrow increase financial market work le efficiently normal. yesterday, national debt office, consultation riksbank, take step facilitate function market. the national debt office issue short-term treasury bill number extra auctions. this positive alleviate shortage market arise wake global financial turmoil. the riksbank's assessment unrest financial market affect financial stability sweden. we note swedish bank make good profit recent year financially robust. however, bank experience liquidity problem could threaten financial stability ready take measure provide liquidity assistance. it take time uncertainty financial market abate situation stabilise last way. we already see financial unrest leave mark development real economy, uncertainty affect growth prospect period ahead remains. at end october, executive board make overall assessment growth inflation prospects. exaggerate focus current interest rate decision i would like conclude final reflection. it natural important monetary policy debated. sometimes, however, feel though little much focus place current interest rate decision. to say lot write late interest rate increase would somewhat understatement. the discussion conduct certain quarter almost give impression increase throw sweden bottomless pit recession. opinion may differ value prophecies, i still think difficult see interest rate increase 0.25 per cent could decisive impact. in context important point fall background little. it individual interest rate decision series decision – interest rate path – determine effect monetary policy ultimately inflation real economy. if look back in, say, three year time, development see course depend solely fact riksbank raise interest rate september 2008 also happen interest rate thereafter, certain extent too. and forecast riksbank present couple week ago repo rate path low interest rate low july forecast entire forecast period. 6 bi review 113/2008 if, moreover, turn economic activity weaken even inflation fall rapidly riksbank predict course possible adapt policy line developments. it naturally possible withdraw interest rate increase "retroactively". one can, hand, become apparent economic activity declining, reduce interest rate rapidly originally intended. there is, words, degree flexibility monetary policy, upwards downwards course, underestimated. with comfort think mind i would like thank attention. bi review 113/2008 7 mario

rise credit relate losses, outlook bank profitability poor. the aggregate amount capital system great enough, reasonable scenarios, prevent system whole fall regulatory thresholds. but distribution capital obviously matters. and, large banks, capital level demand market go response great uncertainty reduce transparency balance sheets. we estimate bank likely need raise least amount capital raise

soundly manage contained, may able survive temporary decline capital level needed, still remain regulatory minimum. bi review 112/2008 3 a illustrates, recent turmoil raise fundamental question nature procyclicality, impact financial stability, feasibility policy address it. this bring two area i believe merit attention part policymakers go forward: • first, role official sector address procyclicality source financial instability? • and second, monetary policy embody objective function health financial system? review experience past two three decades, one strike repeat tendency financial system build risk leverage good times, shed rapidly condition change. while asset agent involve trigger mechanism differ one cycle next, cycle tend produce significant deadweight cost distortion real economy, upswing subsequent retrenchment. this especially significant financial system leveraged, see past year. while cannot would want eliminate bout optimism pessimism part human nature, must address pro-cyclical implication policy making. we decide address procyclicality per se april report (although recommendation touch it) urgency make concrete recommendation areas. but time u return topic. a area i describe earlier, goal strengthen resilience system without hind process market discipline innovation essential financial sector’s contribution economic growth. there shortage idea around aspect procyclicality relevant financial stability, range policy option could help dampen procyclicality. some area fsf decide look include: • the capital regime: basel ii framework tie require capital directly perceive riskiness asset, likely increase downturn fall expansions. this new, basel ii new need know mechanic – clear yet, particular, required, desire actual capital level evolve full cycle basel ii (although framework place track assess this). a consider strengthen regime, think need give promote high buff regulatory minimum good times, dip flexibly cyclical downturns. to degree, already possible discretionary way, although much divergence national implementation basel ii would raise issue transparency consistency international regulatory arrangement therefore constrained. ad hoc, uncoordinated reduction require minimum could view forbearance could give wrong signal authorities’ judgement overall strength system. how best dampen procyclicality bank capital inquiry engage internationally european context coordinate fashion. • a relate issue sound loan-loss provisioning: useful tool counter effect procyclicality, especially new lending. however, bank system come crisis historically low level provisions. to degree, attribute benign recent default environment. but also reflect new account principle prudential rules, effect

embed leverage system, global nature finance, transform function international financial system. these transformation fully appreciate implication monetary policy making. central bank inherently concern health financial system. because critical role perform – allocate capital risk economy – well-functioning financial sector key achievement primary macroeconomic objectives, stable price sustain growth; central banks, also fundamental effective transmission monetary policy decision real economy. contribute health financial system is, sense, encode gene central banks: one historical reason establish central bank indeed reinforce financial stability institution could act lender last resort. the policy follow european central bank since start turmoil much line historical role. the ecb remain passive. it use tool disposal, particular liquidity operations, support smooth function money market period acute stress. it operational framework prove robust flexible effectively respond challenge pose drying-up market liquidity. however – crucial aspect ecb policy – operate principle strict separation liquidity provision policy stance monetary policy. monetary policy, set level interest rate ecb, direct fulfil primary goal: maintain price stability. this principle crucial. charge monetary policy additional objectives, direct responsibility financial stability, would risk blur responsibilities, increase moral hazard create trade-off none. i fully agree remark often make otmar issing last trade-off price stability financial stability.1 even if, acknowledges, short-term conflict may occasionally arise, easily accommodate monetary policy strategy focus appropriate medium term horizon, one choose ecb. over horizons, price stability financial stability mutually reinforcing, rather alternative, goals. we forget damage prolong period financial distress (such great depression, japanese experience 90’s many currency crisis 1 o. issing (2003), “monetary financial stability: trade-off?” bi paper no. 18. bi review 112/2008 5 emerge market past century) associate – sometimes aggravate – inability control inflation process. rely clear separation role correct assignment instrument objective particularly important current juncture, face inflationary pressure combine weak economic activity financial turbulence. it precisely difficult situation benefit sound monetary framework become apparent. only ensure return price stability reasonable time frame able control inflation expectations, reduce uncertainty risk premia, sustain longer-term finance purchase power thus reinforce prospect real activity financial stability. the risk prolong period high inflation may destabilize expectation become entrench wage price set require resolute stance monetary policy. it essential economic actor adopt responsible behaviour. it also quite obvious current financial instability aggravate threaten lead deflationary situation, monetary policy would take account. while role monetary policy current circumstance clear, nevertheless wise, also field, draw lesson recent experience. an important one, relate topic procyclicality i mentioned, role unusually easy global credit condition many year build current turmoil. there clear asymmetry two phase boom-bust cycles. while effect bust phase visible, building-up imbalance boom phase easily detected. this course many factor – necessarily relate imbalance – contribute change asset price balance sheet positions, boom end busts. central bank thus easily force situation may need intervene crash, inject liquidity avoid financial crisis, even time loosen monetary policy avoid deflation, remain passive previous phase. the problem however monetary policy limit passive role – call “mop after” policy – may increase moral hazard plant seed acute imbalance future. the key challenge therefore understand whether monetary policy proactive “lean wind” also period grow financial imbalance pre-emptive manner, even absence immediate threat price stability. this open issue opinion diverge. i limit follow observations. first, risk premia equity, housing, government bond corporate debt market reach past ten year – different time – historical minimum. they consistently decline since mid-eighties. there structural reason behind trend: deepen broaden global financial markets; stable policy regimes, particular monetary policy, lead low macroeconomic volatility – therefore risk – last two decade (a phenomenon also know great moderation).2 but also transient, thus le comforting, factor work: low volatility economy may due “good luck”, i.e. historically unprecedented decline vigour exogenous shocks. this may generate false perception safety. most importantly point view monetary authorities, protract low interest rate global level may favour excessive appetite risk, reinforce flaw incentive risk management play pivotal role recent turmoil. indeed, existence “risk taking” channel – impact

procyclicality moral hazard financial sector. monetary analysis may important situation potential financial distress necessary lengthen horizon policy, hard mean forecast give complexity involved. this may even true allow possibility put forward observers, monetary policy highly credible, excessive liquidity expansion may find way first fuel asset price credit booms, rather create inflationary pressures.5 the analysis credit money also permit u form balance opinion effect financial turmoil. while see slowdown credit growth euro area, appear line regular impact slow economic activity tight policy conditions. up now, see sign additional effect come financial tensions, far capital position bank overall euro area remain sound. of course, crisis become systemic, counterparty risk could always spread world. third, i think central bank posse superior knowledge, relative private sector, able judge whether deviation fundamental occur price individual asset. have say that, central bank – strong technical skills, independent judgement system-wide, longer-term perspective – perhaps good place ass systemic risk emerge financial markets. this prompt inform communication financial system

toronto, 18 september 2008. * * * these past month busy central bankers, say least, past day certainly exception. while development wall street garner much attention, cost live also issue u all, whether we're buy gas pumps, book airline ticket, pick loaf bread grocery store. of course, cost live always front centre u bank canada, primary monetary policy objective ensure inflation remain low, stable, predictable medium term. some periods, however, clearly challenge others term meet objective. to set effective policy tranquil turbulent times, must understand drive inflation able anticipate future movements. so tonight i'd like talk depth inflation: exactly is, measure it, gauge underlie economic pressure cause rise fall. i'd particularly like discus bank canada's "core measure" inflation, explain use bank operational guide monetary policy. i've choose topic timely nature, see rise price pressure various forms. along way, i'd like use examination core inflation highlight important bank's research conduct canada's monetary policy. innovative research analysis relate core inflation, like research efforts, underpin bank's policy formulation implementation monetary policy, contribute significantly understand economy operates. at point, i emphasize bank consistently aim low stable inflation – sake, enhance economy's performance. aim explicit 2 per cent inflation target help stabilize prices, also help stabilize real output employment, allow economy grow maximum sustainable rate. experience show best contribution monetary policy make economic welfare canadians. development inflation around globe before i go detail particular canadian measure experience inflation, let take step back look larger, international picture. a i mention moment ago, canadian become increasingly aware price pressures, is, fact, global phenomenon. indeed, sharp increase inflation report advance emerging-market economy recent months. it true world price oil, natural gas, many minerals, food product ease past weeks. nevertheless, early dramatic increase price commodity account sharp increase inflation. in many cases, high rate inflation observe past 10 15 years. it important note inflation performance vary widely across countries. in cases, excessively loose monetary policies, implement attempt push economic growth high sustainable limit country's production capacity, also important contribute factor. in many countries, recent surge inflation couple dramatic slow real economic growth, rekindle memory 1970s concern stagflation – uncomfortable combination high inflation slow negative growth. most observer bi review 112/2008 1 believe would great stretch draw parallel current experience 1970s. still, recent development pose serious policy challenge central bankers, especially combine dislocation difficulty evident global financial markets. conventional monetary policy reaction might appropriate circumstance see combination rise inflation, slow gdp growth, concern financial instability. rise inflation, example, often lead call tight monetary policy. yet, would wise slow economy development expect reverse inflation pressure future? slow economic activity often lead call easy monetary policy. but would reaction wise inflation pressure believe rise rather receding? around world, monetary authority determine repeat policy error 1970s, overly stimulative measure lead double-digit inflation rise inflation expectations. we seek reliable indicator gauge serious long-lasting current inflation pressure might be. this kind information materially affect stance monetary policy. this illustrate monetary policy-makers must gather weigh much information possible decision make – inflation research important. define measure total core cpi inflation before i describe inflation research, let give background measure inflation use bank canada: measure base statistic canada's consumer price index (cpi). inflation is, course, define persistent increase average price good services; words, trend increase cost living. in broad terms, measure total, headline, cpi, track retail price representative "shopping basket" good service time. it also rate bank canada officially target monetary policy. here i would remind bank federal government formal agreement set target 2 per cent annual rate increase cpi. a i say earlier, pursue low stable inflation enhance performance economy. yet, much aim low, stable, predictable inflation, always sharp movement total headline inflation. these generally drive volatile price change small number good services. in canada, example, fully 90 per cent observe monthly variation cpi link price change 8 54 major good service category include cpi. further, price change often volatile often quickly reversed. they therefore add considerable "noise" total cpi, make difficult discern genuine movement trend inflation. for reason, many central bank calculate core inflation measures, design minimize influence volatile component cpi. although opinion differ among central banker concern usefulness core inflation measures, many monetary authority – include bank canada – find measure helpful two important reasons. first, focus stable component cpi, policy-makers able get good fix underlie trend inflation. this important, monetary policy operate long variable lags. it take long two year full effect policy change felt inflation. monetary policy must therefore forward-looking, focus one- two-year horizon. any attempt control short-term movement inflation likely prove counterproductive simply destabilize inflation real economic activity. core inflation can, therefore, serve useful operational guide policy look past short-term price movements. the second reason core inflation measure useful help anchor inflation expectation business households. have explicit 2 per cent target 2 bi review 112/2008 inflation, couple strong commitment achieve it, go distance towards realize objective. but provide reliable measure core inflation public readily use track trend movement cpi strengthen anchor expectation provide assurance bank allow rise volatile component spread prices. the bank canada's core inflation measure now, let talk core measure detail. measure core inflation usually calculate one two ways. the "exclusion method" straightforward and, name suggests, involve exclude price good service typically display predetermine amount variability. the "reweighting method," contrast, exclude price good services. instead, assign weight component inversely relate volatility. in words, volatile price series give low weight. the core inflation measure bank canada currently us call cpix base exclusion method. it remove eight volatile component total cpi, well effect change indirect tax gst. the exclude item cpix fruit, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage-interest costs, intercity transportation, tobacco products. it important note, however, bank calculate monitor several different measure trend inflation, cpix. it us these, along many source information, check prefer core measure. while measure trend inflation tend move similar fashion, difference informative. it also worth note bank change definition core inflation time, improve reliability. when bank first begin target inflation 1991, core inflation measure adopt similar use many central bank exclude food energy prices. a result, le inclusive current measure. after gain experience, process extensive research analysis, bank refine core inflation measure, well set additional measure currently follows. in 2001, bank move cpix demonstrate superiority empirical theoretical grounds. it advantage confirm additional research inflation target renew 2006, recently retested part comprehensive international study look range measure total core inflation. clearly, process refinement retesting never ends. this crucial able determine effective indicator underlie inflation might refine improve upon time. so next question becomes: distinguish good bad measures? an effective core measure must four key properties. first, obviously, core measure le volatile total inflation. second, must unbiased. by mean core inflation measure must track long-run movement total cpi closely. third, good core measure must also reliable predictor future trend movement total cpi. fourth, good core measure must easy understand explain public. when four requirement consider together, cpix show good as, good than, alternative measure bank might use. other measure may outperform cpix judge one two four criteria. cpiw, example, calculate use reweighting method, give slightly good prediction total cpi bear somewhat tight relationship long-run trend total cpi. these difference minor, however, offset consideration ease understanding. for reason, cpix still bank's prefer core measure. nevertheless, give demonstrate strength cpiw one bi review 112/2008 3 two trend measures, bank continue monitor set indicator rather rely single one. popular misconception core inflation our choice cpix operational guide monetary policy has, times, source controversy lead several popular misconceptions. journalist interest observer frequently question use cpix measure trend inflation operational guides. they argue measure give overly sanguine picture true inflation, especially episode sharply rise food energy prices. critic say cpix inflation frequently low total cpi inflation because, claim, bank strip fastest-rising prices. these critic cpix argue relate real-life experience typical households. "after all," point out, "what household buy food, drive car, mortgage?" i'll respond criticism three relate points. first, importantly, bank's official target 2 per cent inflation base total cpi inflation, cpix. the latter one several indicator use judge total cpi likely go future. it important indicator use judge inflation trend are, target. second, bank's decision use core inflation policy guide base exclusively empirical considerations. cpix use show track future movement total cpi good past movement total cpi itself. if change, cpix long outperform total cpi regard, would stop use it. finally, note earlier, critical bank continue focus future trend cpi inflation, oppose current level, monetary policy operate long variable lags. if bank react every observe change total cpi, would destabilize inflation real economic growth. it would react volatile change small subset price would likely reverse course near future. be core always good predictor total cpi inflation? experience canada show core inflation outperform total inflation operational guide policy. when two series deviate, total cpi inflation tend converge core inflation rather reverse. core inflation therefore good guide total inflation going. this phenomenon might reflect success bank enjoy past 17 year keep total cpi inflation close 2 per cent target. when total inflation temporarily move high low target, household business know probably return target within relatively short time. some country enjoy positive experience. they've find core inflation tend deviate persistently total cpi inflation reliable measure underlie inflation pressures. these difference document recently researcher bank, well understood.1 they appear systematic nature, oppose chance occurrences, bank researcher suspect reflect difference way core inflation defined, well structural difference 1 serious research bank canada alternative measure core inflation begin work laflèche (1997), crawford et al.

• economics fully employ economy; • end – perhaps? – long period household leverage finances; • shift perspective regulation financial sector economy. china i talk notion “de-coupling” on. that term actually unhelpful – nothing ever really de-coupled; everything connected. but connection complex, various force work reasonable people differ opinion thing play year two. at present, china slowing, partly result slowdown unite state europe, partly design domestic policy. the chinese policy-makers seek slow evident overheating, position remove restraint. but emergence china industrialise economy fundamental long-term change economic, financial political landscape whose full consequence i suspect barely appreciate yet. this happen couple decade now, nature impact gradually changing. for years, small notice – even country lot people small economically per caput income productivity low. then, time 1990s, china become quantitatively important enough rest world enjoy disinflationary effect add chinese production capacity, million low-cost worker turn manufactures, process low global prices. more recently, experience new effect growth, namely effect high chinese live standard price energy natural resources. f course, bi review 111/2008 1 confine china – happen around develop world great less extent. but china big example. commodity price come peak present, though key price australia still high. even mark cyclical turn prices, long term new claim energy resource go away. other country adapt that. the rise price energy raw material make hard country combine steady growth low inflation characterise period early 1990s middle decade. at time, extraordinary increase demand natural resource energy raise australia’s term trade close two-thirds space five year – large shock kind five decades. so economics australia therefore bite different “average” industrial country. like others, energy-using part economy, find difficult combine steady growth low inflation. but addition, absorb massive income boost.1 of course, bad problem have! nonetheless, significant adjustment occur – structure economy, population life national income earn distributed. unless resource price reverse long way, trend continue. china’s emergence surely far complete. china, like economies, cycles. but average growth rate likely pretty high year ahead, even high recently. this opportunity challenge australian business policy-makers, resource sector. economics full employment over recent years, australian labour market tight time see generation. the rate unemployment past 12 months, 4 per cent, low time since 1974. in survey discussion firms, difficulty secure labour common problem. the term “capacity constraint” part australian economic lexicon recent year way see long time. survey measure capacity utilisation high, fix investment increase capacity run strongly. let’s clear full employment good thing. it one statutory objective give reserve bank charter (though interestingly author act never quantify mean full employment, matter, “stability currency”). but economics full employment different economics try get full employment. this simple point, important one. when economy much spare capacity – say, aftermath business cycle downturn – aim macroeconomic policy push demand catch supply potential. there may several year demand growth exceed normal pace eat spare capacity. once spare capacity wind in, however, actual growth demand output slow, match growth rate potential supply. that growth potential supply give growth labour force, capital stock productivity factor production. typically think “potential gdp” australia rise something like 3 per cent year, give take bit. 1 for interested, i set view early address. see http://www.rba.gov.au/publicationsandresearch/bulletin/bu_jul08/com_prices_macro_pol_aus_perspectiv e.html 2 bi review 111/2008 this, predecessor ian macfarlane remark year ago, mean reserve spare capacity pretty much use up, expect accustom growth rate gdp start 2 3. there many 4 5s, year 1990s early decade. period growth noticeably 3 per cent roughly match frequency duration period – now. if set aspiration high – try above-average performance time – get inflation. that economics full employment. now may feel growth rate real gdp something like 3 per cent average high. be best do? can’t lift it? the way potential growth rate lift add factor production – labour capital – raise growth rate productivity. over long term, key productivity. on front, productivity growth seem past several year settle low average rate see since early 1990s. this may several causes, expert debate them. but year ahead, community must sure let effort keep productivity growing. i specific policy prescription – general one – try sustain competition, keep market open, maintain flexibility on. but general value worth recount time time. household balance sheet a feature economic landscape past decade half long gear households. in early 1990s, household gross debt australia equal 50 per cent average annual household disposable income. this year, reach 160 per cent. households’ asset rise generally parallel, though quite fast, total asset rise 460 per cent income 1990 800 per cent end 2007. (assets fall somewhat since then, decline share market soften house prices.) the ratio debt asset rise 10 per cent 1990 18 per cent 2008. the ratio house debt house asset reach 27 per cent. very similar trend see number comparable country around world, think causes, look exclusively domestic causes. but summary, main factor behind big increase size household sector’s balance sheet were: • general tendency financial activity wealth grow fast income, feature economy since least far back 1950s; • increase pace financial innovation – and, particular, lot credit available, particularly period since mid 1990s, households. in recent year around world, anyone creditworthy – – able access ample amount credit; • big decline inflation. this low nominal interest rate dramatically.2 this happen countries, though time differed. in australia big factor 1992; 2 with fall nominal interest rates, big front end load problem service conventional mortgage eliminated. see http://www.rba.gov.au/publicationsandresearch/bulletin/bu_oct97/bu_1097_6.pdf. bi review 111/2008 3 • period pretty low long-term interest rate globally, encourage borrow around world, though big factor unite state here. this lot build-up save relative investment asia; • desire devote high share rise income acquire house services. a people’s income increases, certain good service take decline share total spend – food, example, products, electrical good clothing, large fall relative price time. but type product take increase share income. house tend category. a become wealthier, aspiration house term position, quality size naturally enough increased. but various reason supply elastic – much well-located land, factor affect supply price dwell generally. in end, lot income devote housing, acquire service mortgages, case. the question whether long period gear household might approach end. certainly household credit growth much slow present years, run roughly line income growth. might see conservative approach debt among household persist? it hard know answer question. there much household balance sheet could, principle, turn collateral, gear might resume current turmoil passed. but also good chance household time seek contain consolidate debt, grow consumption spend pace close income, perhaps look save current income recent past. it possible witness early part new phase household spend borrow dynamic different past decade half. time tell. but trend next several years, growth opportunity business financial institution different. and whereas household balance sheet big financial story past 15 years, financial trend probably big story next decade. there development suggest balance sheet government might well expect expand good deal. the need support finance sector country like unite state unite kingdom one. the build-up public infrastructure australian city region may point direction, though less extent. if sudden aversion sort asset private investor continue length time, government may choose whether fund project themselves, defer them. fortunately, public balance sheet country much strong start position countries. financial stability regulation all issue surround use, not, government’s balance sheet support financial system prominent display recent months. we see action u treasury take run two large entity know “fannie” “freddie”. a secretary paulson commented, ambiguity bear risk entity problem long time, need resolved. the u government shoulder burden investor always assume would, has, quite appropriately, do way minimise extent bail-out private shareholder profit risk-taking behaviour. face problem entity concern regard effectively guarantee government one thing. the question support also arise entity always see purely private, hitherto not, least explicitly, 4 bi review 111/2008 regard central systemic stability failure could costly. the event past day illustrate difficult issue become. in case though, final analysis enough capital behind risk taken. the sophisticate financial system 21st century suppose spread risk, lot risk end concentrate book highly leverage institutions. high risk high leverage prove fatal combination. it always does. some significant question arise this. the main one, put broad simplest, whether something do dampen profound cycle financial behaviour, associate swing asset price credit, give damage potentially economy. this debate go quite years. there several point view. one counter-cyclical regulatory measure use power prudential regulator take dampen call “financial accelerator”. this process confidence boost asset prices, provide additional collateral borrowing, boost asset price – point whole process go reverse fall asset value de-leveraging, occur now. use prudential tool work tendency would departure way prudential supervision conduct present, goal soundness individual institutions, rather manage dynamic system stability time. a counter view feasible this, various reasons. one difficulty tax account rules. another key player outside regulatory net – hedge fund example. this view hold effective response financial cycle almost certainly involve monetary policy. this would mean raise interest rate time boom asset credit markets, even good service price inflation contained, order provide stabilise influence swing financial behaviour. some argue could reconcile standard inflation targeting, though central bank long time horizon great deal flexibility. a third view possible, policy-makers’ current state knowledge, know whether correct lean booms, fact could turn destabilise try. on view, thing do respond asset credit collapse occur, protect possible financial system economy generally. that is, clean mess afterwards, speak. this tend u official view, least now. this debate quite active period follow collapse dot-com boom early 2000s. but favour policy action aim moderate financial cycle carry day, i think mainly u economy recover pretty quickly quite mild downturn 2001. i sense now, however, among many thoughtful people question discussion. it fascinate watch debate unfolds. conclusion in barrage information must cope day day, often hard stand back see big force work. but force – response – ultimately shape course economy financial system short-term news. hopefully, still find time reflection matters, even volatile condition find present. it spirit i offer remark today. thank you. bi review 111/2008 5 bandid nijathaworn: how strong thai bank weather turmoil? keynote address dr bandid nijathaworn, deputy governor bank thailand, fitch thailand’s 2008 annual conference, 10 september 2008. * * * thank you, chairman. first, let thank fitch thailand invitation address year’s conference keynote speaker. our topic morning “how strong thai bank weather turmoil?” my answer short simple: thai bank strong enough weather current global turmoil. the sector also well position support economy. this message i give six week ago press brief bank thailand. although condition global economy financial market change somewhat since then, message resiliency strength i want echo morning. i agree two previous speaker global financial market condition growth prospect weaken especially past two months. in financial markets, continue see fall share price index increase spread large number u dollar products, include high-quality u corporate bonds, money market spreads, bank credit default swaps. doubt additional loss bank major economy also persist make difficult bank raise capital. a result, fund cost household business major economy rise bank continue tighten credit standards, positive growth. on account this, global growth prospect seem weakened, decline oil price help ease concern global inflation. future direction oil price, however, still much uncertain. the global economy condition global financial markets, therefore, become challenging, likely important implication emerge market usual trade financial channels. this is, therefore, important area need pay close attention next months. under current global setting, decline oil price positive emerge market like thailand, group, growth prospect emerge market remain satisfactory give ability support domestic demand. but question remain individual economy resilient would face shocks, include bank sector. in thai case, assessment thai bank sector strong enough weather current turmoil. this conclusion support follow five important reasons. first foremost low direct exposure thai bank sector sub-prime credit cdo. cdo exposure thai bank second quarter last year le 0.3 percent total asset. bank cdo exposure already make full provision recognize loss line ia 39, presently sub-prime relate cdo position unwound. more importantly, thai bank also investment u gse securities. this another positive point help insulate bank spillovers. reflect this, direct impact turmoil far, thai bank sector, limited. second, issue liquidity financing, bank thailand predominantly domestic-owned. hence, rely deposit fund rather external funding. domestic fund stable source fund affect turmoil. this feature help cushion thai bank effect global credit crunch. bi review 111/2008 1 third, fundamental thai bank system improve key fundamental sound resilient. a sector, bank thailand enjoy good profit past seven year well capitalize bi capital adequacy ratio 15.2 percent end june year. over years, good risk management, improve asset quality, great provision coverage losses, regulatory supervisory framework meet international standards, significantly improve overall risk profile sector. a recent quarter, net profit 57 billion baht register second quarter year. loan growth july increase 11.8 percent deposit include bill exchange grow 1.9 percent. liquidity system remain adequate, loan/deposit ratio exclude interbank transaction 90.1 percent july. on asset quality, gross npl ratio edge downward 6.4 percent june. these number show performance thai bank sector quite robust, well position support economy. fourth, difficult picture ass impact turmoil economy would translate impact bank sector. so far, notwithstanding le helpful global environment, thai economy perform relatively well, growth average 5.7 percent first half year. but go forward, market participant expect economy become affect slow global economy. our forecast also see growth le buoyant second half year, reflect adverse impact exports. but overall, momentum growth adversely affect give support growth could gain domestic demand support high farm income, continue credit availability, supportive fiscal policy. moreover, low oil price monetary policy focus inflation provide stable price environment conducive domestic demand export competitiveness. also, continue current account surpluses, low external indebtedness, high domestic save make economy’s financial condition stable, reduce dependency capital flows. in all, view improve economic fundamental flexible policy regime place economy good position weather current turmoil without much impact growth economic stability. and growth continuing, performance bank sector also benefit. my last point ability thai bank sector weather turmoil also confirm recent stress-testing exercise cover credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, link macroeconomic impact scenario. the result indicate thai bank system quite resilient. thai bank withstand sharp economic slowdown unfavorable market volatility quite well. this result strong profitability capital accumulation, well prudent credit investment policy years. and part, give increase uncertainty external environment, bank thailand continue monitor bank sector financial market closely, move forward regulatory reform enhance risk management efficiency bank system. in near-term, pipeline full implementation basel ii 2010, include introduction pillar i end year, implementation pillar iii middle next year, introduction pillar ii 2010. in addition, strengthen supervisory framework line financial risk structure financial groups, consolidate supervision phased-in two steps: first introduce qualitative measure year already done, second implementation quantitative measure 2010. to conclude, condition global economy global financial market become challenging. so, call time great caution move forward. also, mean ability bank sector withstand shock important prerequisite economy manage spillover slow global economy volatile 2 bi review 111/2008 financial markets. in thai case, strength resiliency bank sector us, thus well place weather turmoil, without adverse effect role support economy maintain financial stability. thank attention. bi review 111/2008 3 svein gjedrem: asset price economic policy address mr svein gjedrem,

board european central bank, eurofi conference, nice, 12 september 2008. * * * question 1: what priority develop competitiveness eu security infrastructures? answer 1: firstly, central bank perspective clear priority eu security infrastructure overcome current fragmentation lead unnecessarily high costs, especially cross-border transactions. i see t2s good example this. t2s, neutral borderless share settlement infrastructure, yield positive scale effects, promote competition asset servicing, csds strengthen offer service settlement. secondly, harmonisation, harmonisation lead cost savings, transparency foster competition value chain. we see significant initiative harmonisation effort throughout security life cycle, assist catalytic effect t2s. the eurosystem, itself, initiate work t2s advisory group together market participant develop action plan harmonise settlement-related process process relate corporate actions. thirdly, order secure competitive market place single market thereby maintain attract issuer investor europe, need re-think risk robustness resilience entire financial system, include security infrastructures. first need single set standard consistently implement european union. in respect, i welcome request ecofin escb cesr finalise recommendations. (this also facilitate harmonisation avoid regulatory arbitrage lead “race bottom”). second, current financial crisis show fast problem one market spread markets. in consequence, operational processes, risk management policy procedure system relate systems. therefore priority make obtain holistic systemic european (and maybe global) approach widen risk assessment concept coordination market participant within value chain, risk crisis management procedure optimised. after publication cps report interdependencies, central bank currently investigate need revise regulatory framework consistently new challenge stem grow interdependencies. enhance co-operation relevant authority surely one answers. question 2: what main expect impact transatlantic infrastructure competitiveness european market eu stakeholders? could global infrastructure emerge one day? answer 2: at trade level, significant change market structure underway several european transatlantic cooperation merger already take place foreseen. stock exchange new mtfs (multilateral trade facilities) extend bi review 110/2008 1 range instrument offer trade platform create genuine competition. this offer potential low cost intermediary class investors. it also improve prospect retail investor diversify security portfolio across europe, increase potential return investment diversify exposure financial risks. issuer also benefit great market depth fund raising. i think carefully reflect three issues: 1. how draw balance regional global needs? or terms, transatlantic infrastructure best (soundest efficient) answer “regional” market? or network interoperable regional infrastructure good fit? 2. a global market necessarily require one global infrastructure. on contrary competition among beneficial users. 3. so far transatlantic infrastructure us-based infrastructure also serve european markets. the high integration u market provide undoubtedly competitive advantage so. but nothing prevent transatlantic infrastructure offer service europe expand regions. the first two question market participant regulators. the last one eu (potential) provider. [t2-s potential one – future – transatlantic infrastructure.] the impact transatlantic infrastructure also require change way national authority operate, regulators, supervisory authority overseers, since systemic risk extend beyond national borders. in aspect, need establish effective co-operation arrangement among national transatlantic supervisory authority develop common practice supervisory structure financial services, include common report risk management standard without loose sight legitimate regional supervisory priorities. we could make parallel success cl system, indicate possible benefit reduce risk increase efficiency global financial services. cl also suggest lose sight global dimension; particular, asia large rapidly grow part financial markets. i understand market participant global business would like see progress towards global infrastructure; also clear tell u major cross-border cost security market arise lack harmonisation. it reason eurosystem pledge engage market user start harmonisation effort firstly within field settlement corporate action processes. market user right say consolidation attempt without harmonisation. global – transatlantic – harmonisation achieve single security infrastructure introduced. question 3: what evolution require post-trading arrangement support development transatlantic trade infrastructure ie nyse-euronext, nasdaq-omx? answer 3: the first area harmonisation ensure transatlantic global infrastructure properly oversee regulate accommodate legitimate regional supervisory priorities. i see two challenge here: first, regulator overseer generally tend lag behind financial innovation integration; second, europe currently still lack common regulatory supervisory structure framework, would important pre-requisite achieve regulatory level play field. in case transatlantic merger 2 bi review 110/2008 like nyse euronext merger, risk potential “regulatory spill-over” exist future u legislation regulation would small existence european sec without it. so i think truism get european house order prepare global challenge also true come security infrastructures. furthermore, doubtless work enhance develop relatively efficient settlement link bridge two u settlement engine various csds europe, provide degree integration post trade functionality. the global challenge may profound asset service settlement – however, i believe t2s value simplify help produce safe efficient solution core central functionality financial system. bi review 110/2008 3 bi review 109/2008 1 martín redrado:

opportunity international financial crisis provide u order reflect efficacy policy thus, base experience, improve quality instruments. we also undertake consolidate, argentina, international scenario debate international finance unique circumstance global economy. this contribute engagement world; often face many everyday challenge prevent u reflect global matter also affect us. that i would especially like thank central banker colleague friend academic world, i usually meet various international fora, promptly accept invitation come argentina. uncertainty persist duration depth current global financial crisis. with recession increase advance economies, remain unclear continue spread; clear u.s. economy disconnect rest world, randy kroszner state yesterday convince remarks. in framework, develop country relatively strong vis-à-vis past events. this reflect financial asset fluctuate le than, example, comparable u.s. european assets. country large fiscal current account deficit mainly finance short-term capital flow (e.g. eastern european, unlike latin american asian countries) hard hit. in fact, aggregate emerge country current account deficit 5 point gdp compare rest, see difference almost 500 bp cd spread whereas, end 2007, value similar. another recurrent theme day pervasive global inflationary scenario, pose challenge develop emerge world. in interest analysis inflation level emerge vis-à-vis develop countries, stephen cecchetti wonder level would look like develop country switch weight emerge country use consumption basket latter. clearly, impact shock consumption pattern vary accord economy economic policy responses. in field policies, another recurrent theme throughout debate economy unique characteristics. it obvious that, emerge economies, market le deep instruments, fragile. a minute ago, roberto frenkel point economy low degree financial intermediation, aggregate demand elastic relative interest rate, make fiscal policy responsible aggregate demand control. 2 bi review 109/2008 for example, trade-off ensure monetary stability rebuild time transmission mechanism unknown develop world. in turn, innovative product arrive economy delay, least massive way. that insist need have, least, good understand problem design global policy regulatory mechanisms. however, typical among emerge country (that is, bank run turn widespread crises, include attack currency, capital credit flight, decline activity), threaten develop countries. this nothing new, especially relevant light recent event global economy. a witness responses, see policy design implementation also adapt different characteristic country develop world. financial instability appear great demand risk rewards. on matter, professor edmund phelps remark set u right direction. the debate complex itself: favor ex ante preventive intervention underscore importance decisive ex post action mitigate effect financial collapse. in turn, advocate financial stability issue exclusively deal prudential regulation (so monetary policy may focus mainly achieve nominal stability objectives) whereas others claim monetary policy design must take account possible ex ante accumulation trend towards financial imbalance. finally, support great involvement fiscal authority deal solvency issues, emphasize need preserve monetary policy address liquidity problems. yesterday, tom hoenig say current crisis great opportunity debate federal reserve’s mandate. financial stability new objective add traditional price stability long term growth objectives. this bring question effectiveness monetary policy instruments, interest rate liquidity provision mechanisms, achieve simultaneous objectives. if comprehensive mechanism deal case like this, maybe would necessary make intensive use instruments. a jacob frenkel remark open session, “it prevent crisis make financial system resilient”. in emerge countries, clear systemic stability maintained, give history macroeconomic volatility recurrent crises. but industrialize countries, capital market deep highly integrate bank system, financial stability traditionally regard instrument objective itself. however, see fiscal, monetary financial instrument work “side side” towards common goal. a mario blejer state moment ago, “in time crisis need adapt action prevent crisis spread rest economy”. current regulatory policy procyclical component must deal upcoming reforms. josé antonio ocampo’s proposal countercyclical capital requirement subject discussion time, move provision spanish case. in view, order achieve financial stability, probably need reform exist regulations. in fact, several panellists, viñals ocampo, pave way debate increase policy coordination give increase interaction financial market difficulty imply independent action. a i see it, stop increase financial innovation process strengthen relate risk management. in bi review 109/2008 3 sense, degree interdependence global economy general, financial market particular, increasingly require joint international actions. a great harmonization domestic international regulation prevent regulatory arbitrage use obtain extraordinary revenues, one cause current crisis. cecchetti also deal issue give u something think — something also emphasize open address. the central bank interest rate complete indicator financial conditions. we need improve financial stability measures. in case develop economies, madame hu favor use reserve requirement instead interest rate deal evolution liquidity conditions. for many economists, argued, “old-fashioned”, china prove efficient. in fact, use interest rate segmented, shallow unconnected financial system obvious limitations. this show control monetary aggregate appropriate certain circumstance many emerge economies. this underscore point i usually make monetary policy, develop marty feldstein. the profession focus much rule reference interest rate monetary policy appear synonymous. marty claim monetary policy continue lack ability strengthen economy unusual condition house sector credit markets, rate low fail keep economy going. central bank tool perhaps traditional, fall abeyance countries, discount window reserve requirements. a see, discussion agenda long complex single optimal approach could define vacuum. the coexistence different policy recommendation confirm morning two prominent scholar bennett mccallum jan kregel analyze monetary policy theoretical perspective. in country, saw example commitment systemic stability past month full implementation robust consistent approach launch recent years. all instrument available. we focus effort restore money market equilibrium. our system able cushion impact external disruption macroeconomic performance, confirm central bank's prudential countercyclical policy right, monetary financial fields. something similar occur exchange rate channel. in opinion, current manage float exchange rate regime appropriate weather financial turmoil time economic history. analyze asian experience, zeti stress importance foreign exchange predictability company focus effort micro issues. this reinforce belief manage float exchange rate regime one possible current moment argentina sign history volatility. one distinctive feature aggregate operate dynamic argentina recurrent macroeconomic instability episodes. it accident that, past 25 years, economy spend third time dynamic stability path (defined range two standard deviation long-term trend), australia’s 18 percent brazil’s 25 percent. argentina similar resource position world countries, symmetry regard impact external shocks. these phenomenon severely harm long-term performance, free charge term welfare: excessive volatility probably main reason country’s economic stagnation last three decades. 4 bi review 109/2008 furthermore, economy still way long-term path exit unprecedented crisis, simultaneously include institutional breakdown, huge devaluation, destruction financial system default public debt. in argentina, monetary policy transmission channel rebuilt, since credit private sector account 12 percent gdp, still far latin american average. moreover, consumer credit react weakly interest rate fluctuations. therefore, hasty adoption certain instrument would useless also hamper future use. we cannot “take shortcuts”; rather, must patiently rebuild power monetary policy tools. for reason, compare situation various emerge country may lead wrong diagnosis policy recommendations. but reinsurance policy (reserve accumulation construction solid financial system) afford u high liquidity cushion prepare time like these. what would happen circumstance pure float exchange rate regime place? be prepare exchange rate fluctuate short time, neighbor countries? i think so, yet, give long history instability dollarization. this something learn time. it background argentina make decision settle debt paris club, reflect country’s willingness pay creditworthiness. this decision part comprehensive strategy access debt market voluntarily — government also private sector. furthermore, clear proof seminar aim at: opportunity turn new leaf is, undoubtedly, step forward country's international financial integration. after pay debt, argentina continue maintain robust international reserve level percentage gdp, comparison country previous historical levels. we build reserve thank trade balance surplus expect continue next years. even debt repayment without consider future trade surplus, international reserve stock well optimal level term import next months, short-term external liability monetary aggregates. in turn, national public sector hold ar$30 billion worth deposits, identical fund guarantee domestic market similarly size fiscal scenario. this exceed next year’s public debt maturity (capital interest). this decision fully consistent monthly trade surplus usd 1 billion expect next year — ensure one three basic pillar current monetary regime: prudential international reserve accumulation strategy also support monetary absorption instrument use regulate mean payment adjustment. therefore, decision keep commitment repeat next five year fiscal performance previous period — primary fiscal surplus 3.2% gdp —, economic program fully engage efficient prudent coordination various anti-inflationary policies. on one hand, fiscal revenue policy consonant behaviour primary spend revenues, respectively. on other, monetary policy keep foster recovery domestic money demand, also attempt consolidate remonetization argentine economy. the sound coordination policy likely extend twin surplus (fiscal external). for country, surplus become pillar sustain growth

highly inelastic short term, inventory remain tight emerging-market growth prospect uncertain, expect continue volatility commodity prices. let turn renew weakness u.s. economy. weakness u.s. economy a effect u.s. government's spring fiscal stimulus package wear off, fall u.s. domestic demand seem likely. household credit growth slow sharply likely slow further. indeed, credit condition face u.s. household tighten despite cumulative 3.25-percentage-point reduction policy interest rates. the recent survey u.s. senior loan officer show expectation still tight credit condition business consumer month ahead bank reduce tolerance risk react unfavourable economic outlook. recent financial market event reinforce tendencies. the u.s. house sector central country's economic financial outlooks.

marginally despite sharp reduction policy interest rates. most importantly, even residential construction stop shrink late next year, expect, usual sharp rebound house activity unlikely. the overhang inventory tight financial condition restrain house recovery time. any slowdown u.s. economy would consequence canada, current situation pose particular problems. the prolong house slump affect canadian export lumber build materials. in addition, fall u.s. motor vehicle sale – 35 per cent annual rate second quarter vehicle assemble north america – adversely affect auto sector. even spring

economy part preparation october monetary policy report. in interest rate announcement early month, identify possibility negative feedback loop weak u.s. economy 2 data second quarter show decline area large impact canadian exports, include industrial production, investment machinery equipment automobile sales. 2 bi review 116/2008 tight credit market main risk modest u.s. recovery next year. subsequent event weaken u.s. financial sector, make risk probable. global financial turmoil after 14 month turmoil, global financial market critical juncture. risk aversion across system rise unprecedented levels, aggressive deleveraging process way. many foreign financial institution need raise significantly capital time ongoing earn power appear permanently reduced. these dynamic could intensify current global slowdown impact cost capital canada, despite relative strength financial institutions. in order illustrate potential magnitude concerns, i would like emphasize three points. first, deleveraging process global system far finished. there three way financial institution reduce leverage: raise capital, sell asset (at price carry values) restrain rate credit growth. over past year, financial institution many country raise us$350 billion new equity, cover 70 per cent announce losses. a result, leverage actually increased. with virtually share trade issue price, ability firm raise capital appear constrained. similarly, private asset sale limit complexity underlie assets, ongoing impairment securitization markets, difficulty supply finance leverage buyer desire investor "time market." in sum, bank increase need capital, become difficult raise it. in environment, u.s. government's initiative buy distress asset critically important. the plan announce treasury secretary paulson develop discussion u.s. congress bold timely. the size breadth support provide measure help firm "rightsize" balance sheets, re-liquefy close market establish market price distress assets. this eventually encourage private buyer re-enter market complete deleveraging process. a well-executed program undoubtedly speed resolution crisis limit economic cost. asset sale alone insufficient, additional capital still needed. over time, acquisition weak strong play important role. at moment, valuation uncertainties, account standard investor caution restrain merger acquisition sector.3 in end, reflect likely scale shortfall, possible that, country canada, public capital may necessary complete deleveraging process orderly timely manner. the second point regard current financial situation canadian financial system need reduce leverage, immune fallout process elsewhere. canadian institution considerably good shape international peers. their loss structure product relatively modest.4 more importantly, absolute leverage markedly lower. a simple illustration, major canadian bank average asset-to-capital multiple 18. the comparable figure u.s. investment bank 25, european bank 30s, major 3 for example, change purchase-accounting rule goodwill would welcome current unique environment. 4 loss canadian financial institution roughly 10 per cent total capital, compare 28 per cent far unite states. bi review 116/2008 3 global bank 40.5 while foreign bank process move towards canadian levels, bank obviously face pressures. indeed, canadian bank could modestly increase leverage grow lend relative current capital base. this flexibility give economy rare advantage. reflect good domestic credit conditions, sign canadian financial institution restrict availability credit households. in fact, growth remain surprisingly robust date. while growth canadian business credit slow recent quarter rate around historical norms, evidence point corporation face unusual credit restrictions. that said, especially light intensify global financial strains, continue watch closely evolution credit availability canada, analysis monetary credit aggregates, industry visits, surveys. while globalization financial market service lead efficient allocation capital global scale, also make easy financial difficulty spread across national borders.6 the absolute borrow cost u.s. financial institution rise significantly, put upward pressure borrow cost canadian financial institutions. all else equal, would increase finance cost business households. however, else equal. the strong financial position canadian bank mean borrow rate considerably low many international peers. in addition, bank canada ease overnight rate substantially since onset crisis. a result, effective borrow cost face banks, business household estimate fall past year. this decline contrast experience develop countries.7 in upcoming monetary policy report light recent events, bank revisit current assumption borrow spread begin narrow 2009. my third point regard current financial situation market liquidity become strain time acute financial distress. the bank canada take several action past month maximize effectiveness monetary policy transmission mechanism. when necessary (such monday last week), reinforce target rate overnight operations. over past week, response exceptional circumstances, bank also provide term liquidity expand list eligible collateral. the bank continue provide additional term liquidity long condition financial market warrant. we withdraw term liquidity condition normalize, spring year.8 in addition, part unprecedented us$180 billion coordinate action world's major central banks, bank canada enter us$10 billion reciprocal currency-swap arrangement u.s. federal reserve. this prudential move volatile 5 one advantage canadian regulatory system banks' asset-to-capital multiple generally limit 20. 6 in case canada unite states, imf study find "while trade linkage sizeable, financial condition – broadly define change u.s. bond yields, equity prices, short-term interest rate – large source u.s. spillover canada." see international monetary fund, "canada: select issues" (country report no. 08/70, 2008). 7 since august 2007, absolute all-in borrow rate 60 basis point high aa- aaa-rated u.s. bank 250 basis point high bbb- a-rated u.s. banks, all-in borrow cost non-financial u.s. corporation 50 basis point higher. by comparison, effective all-in fund cost major canadian bank decline 50 basis points, all-in borrow cost non-financial firm 60 basis point lower. 8 a list type indicator bank look decide stop provision extraordinary liquidity find m. carney, "principles liquid markets" (speech new york association business economics, new york, new york, 22 may 2008). 4 bi review 116/2008 period. the facility would activate event acute shortage u.s. dollar canada. the agreement provide bank additional flexibility address rapidly evolve development financial markets. last week's coordinate action public demonstration extraordinary degree communication co-operation among g-10 central bank take place throughout crisis. this testament share recognition interdependence global financial system. i convince dialogue, concert action appropriate, lead good policy outcome help contain negative international spillover series financial shocks. i also believe rapid implementation measure propose financial stability forum9 enhance resilience global financial system help create stable international financial order. the message, express week's communiqué g-7 finance minister central bank governors, clear: g-7 ready take whatever action may necessary, individually collectively, ensure stability international financial system. conclusion the global economy undergo difficult period. moreover, recent days, several article faith financial system shaken. these include: good collateral always use raise liquidity; certain institution big interconnect fail; merely liquidity crisis. however, one constant canadian rely. the bank canada deviate relentless focus monetary policy mandate achieve low, stable predictable inflation. event beyond border important influence outlook inflation country. they must consider tandem domestic factors, include strength domestic demand, evolution potential growth, health financial system. a prepare publish monetary policy report october, continue monitor carefully economic financial development canadian global economies, together evolution risks. most importantly, continue set monetary policy consistent achieve 2 per cent inflation target medium term. this remain best contribution monetary policy make sustain growth. 9 available

europe 2.0, institute international & european affairs, dublin, 25 september 2008. * * * lady gentlemen, pleasure today celebrate europe’s 50th anniversary. it’s quite nice see ireland anniversary still reason celebration 18 month effective date, although i’m sure – judge recent poll – country late celebration particularly beneficial europe. on day 50th birthday people tend fall depression. to avoid it, first medical check-up. then go diet take new sport. i know it’s like. i last couple years! one thing i fear most, future, affect so-called “cognitive dissonance”, problem many people seem develop grow older.1 you start reminisce “good old days” – reality weren’t good. you tend remember nice thing past, see rose-tinted glasses. a rest, well, forget suppress it. this nostalgia come in. people end think past much good present, much pleasant future be. they’d like return past, past. they become afraid change turn increasingly pessimistic. it’s terrible way grow older! at 50, europe might affect syndrome. it come surprise, since 36% europe’s population 50, proportion rising. european seem nostalgic irretrievable past increasingly afraid future. they tend see development year way quite different reality. one victim syndrome european union. the ultimate victims, however, might european themselves. i won’t elaborate theory cognitive dissonance, i provide example symptom potential implication common future. i’ll consider four symptoms. the first amnesia; words, european seem forget european union (assuming know first place). the second symptom, derive amnesia, lack consistency, induce create link fact event occur time fact unrelated. the third symptom myopia, give people distort view world around them, thus impression nothing change time. the fourth symptom denial, particular concern people’s vitality. * * * let start first symptom: amnesia. people tend forget european union about. it’s even clear ever know enough it. this long-standing problem never really tackled. the fact matter citizen little idea eu functions. this lack awareness easily exploited, indeed exploited, paint distort picture union. 1 loosely speaking, cognitive dissonance uncomfortable feel stress cause hold two contradictory idea time. the theory cognitive dissonance propose people drive reduce dissonance modify exist belief, reject one contradictory ideas. this lead confirmation bias denial discomforting evidence. bi review 116/2008 1 the picture people eu show member state union almost oppose forces, rather former come together make latter. when union take decision, somehow look third entity – “brussels” – take it, rather representative member states. in fact, main decision-making body eu council, comprise representative member states, elect national level. the say parliament, directly elect people. and also commission consist person appoint government member states. when union take decision, fact member state take it, procedure establish union involve factor vote modality specific majority thresholds. when union fail take decision, ultimately member state fail so, either don’t want don’t gain majority support proposal. the union often accuse excessive regulation interference. whose fault it? it always seem fault brussels’ bureaucrats, decide regulations. they, most, make formal proposals. it’s government agency member state ultimately responsible create excessive regulation; one add extra condition take account national circumstance create exemption special regimes, go beyond requirement eu directive transpose national law. the confusion compound accusation overregulation come attend council meet lead particular decision, sometimes afterwards. vote favour measure brussels criticise decision back home favourite sport. no surprise european citizen confused. the union also often accuse immobility, able decide. but union doesn’t decide member state don’t decide, often, member state don’t want union take decisions. i come back issue later. the misrepresentation competence union. they much limit people generally think, often heart misunderstand frustration union creates. let concrete here, give examples. i understand one reason people vote lisbon treaty country fear brussels, i.e. member states, would decide taxation ireland. it clear decision taxation cannot take without unanimous consent member states. these fears, similar one transfer specific powers, thus unjustified. overall, range union’s competence quite restricted. in economic sphere, instance, exception monetary policy, competency limit coordination member states’ policies. again, one issue raise ireland opponent lisbon treaty seem eu’s inability deal economic problem face ordinary people, particular income employment. the motto would be: “europe nothing help u out!”. but protect people’s income livelihood competence member states, union. while certainly objective union achieve high live standard high employment, treaty says, instrument achieve objective hand member states. people know competence transfer union, like monetary policy conduct european central bank, remain hand member states. the confusion, time exacerbate member state themselves, penalise union, perceive over-powerful. one example energy sector. in face recent increase energy price overdependence european country limit number suppliers, numerous call 2 bi review 116/2008 make corner europe favour european energy policy. but nothing happened. when come take decisions, member state show desire hand power field. the lack european energy policy nevertheless see failure union, rather member states. europe complex construction, indeed. it treaties, draft international legal document rather simple constitutional principles, difficult read. this inevitable pretend citizen easily understand them, even politician cannot. however, difficult accept that, 50 years, basic principle union function competence remain poorly understand fellow citizens. whose task explain basic fact europe? should role european’s institutions, commission? the commission small representative office country, time busy try correct inaccuracy throw national debates. the task inform citizen europe effectively undertake member states, well-established educational programmes. the result – unfortunately – speak themselves. and without consequences, also politician member states. if people europe don’t understand union properly, won’t necessarily understand domestic political situation better. indeed, poll show even trust european institution declines, remain case well national ones. in fact, negative opinion express union, include electoral consultations, tend reflect negative view national politics. this bad world union: blame something it’s responsible for. * * * let turn second symptom, derive first one, i.e. inconsistency. over last ten year world economy undergo substantial changes. i won’t list all, but, sure, massive transfer resource within countries. the change term trade lead huge transfer purchase power advance economy oil commodity exporter globalisation bring considerable benefit low-cost exporter manufacture goods. just give estimate, transfer purchase power due increase oil price alone amount around 3 trillion u dollar last decade, 7% advance economies’ gdp.2 the period 2002 2007 saw world economy grow fast rate since 1970s. however, mask notable difference advance emerge economies. for develop world, growth strong since second world war. advance economies, hand, record worsen performance. for unite states, particular, last decade worst, term per caput income growth, 100 years, sole exception 1930s. growth europe also quite modest compare previous decades. a significant redistribution income also take place within countries. in advance economies, notably unite state unite kingdom, index income inequality risen.3 in general stagnation even tendency towards reduction purchase power lower-income groups, result weak income growth high price increase product food energy. income 2 base amount net oil import advance countries, compare scenario oil price unchanged 1999 level actual data. i thank michael fidora back-of-the-envelope calculation. 3 for extensive treatment see a. brandolini smeeding (2007): “inequality: international evidence”, prepare new palgrave dictionary economics. bi review 116/2008 3 growth disparity reflect increase difference human capital, access technology educational levels. theory past experience suggest competition low-cost country tend penalise low income employment advance economies’ sector low technological content. the acceleration technological change dismantle barrier trade increase international competition bring adjustment much short time expected. advance economy thus felt severe strain last decade, observe political social implication daily basis. the current u electoral campaign confirm issue similar side atlantic. with one difference. in europe, last ten year also mark birth euro. and lack consistency arises. the euro create bring monetary stability europe. and goal achieved. inflation low. interest rate low, reflect low inflation expectations. the european central bank acquire credibility conduct monetary policy aim primarily price stability. the euro become second international currency, trust investor world. the recent market turmoil encourage u think could happen without euro, term speculative pressure within europe, exchange rate variability interest rate levels. we would certainly bad off. most european tend forget advantage acquire years, even gain recently. be member european union euro area isn’t consider big deal. on hand, many problem everyday life blame europe euro. the euro sometimes consider responsible problem affect economy last years, increase house prices, high food petrol prices, especially time cash changeover, relatively subdue growth. a i mentioned, problem experience euro area advance economies, include don’t euro. i would contend problems, inflation income inequality, even great outside euro area. it nevertheless difficult explain citizen event take place time country unrelated. the euro easy scapegoat. attribute fault euro easy way individual government avoid take responsibility. the confusion who’s responsible union simultaneous occurrence euro’s creation event take place country last decade lead many people inconsistent assessment euro – europe generally – achieve years. * * * let turn third symptom, myopia. the difficulty fully understand causal relationship event affect society life derive part form short-sightedness concern world around us. a grow old tend think world always was. maybe it’s natural reaction grow older. but fact world around u changing, way affect life ability act. european particular tendency think world hasn’t change much last 10 20 years. more worryingly, tend believe thing won’t change much future. in reality, change around u accelerate many areas. i won’t dwell issue, bottom line europe get small smaller, continent economy growing. 20 year ago eu represent 28% world gdp. in 2020, recent trend continue, figure could le 18%. 4 bi review 116/2008 individual country within europe also become small le powerful. there nothing new this. 50 year ago, first president european parliament, paul-henri spaak, note “today, europe consist solely small countries. the relevant distinction remain country understand this, others still refuse acknowledge it”. 20 year ago france germany together represent close 10% world gdp. today percentage 7.5%. by 2020, recent trend continue, reduce 5%, le germany alone 20 year ago. other region country emerge major players, size comparable whole european union. individual european country bind less role play global arena. this already case trade, international finance, environment, energy. how long take european country realise that, term power, become close irrelevant? paul-henri spaak’s word might lead one think myopia affect large country europe. this might true. but small country suffer another type short-sightedness. small country use limit role international scene. they tend leave major decision large countries, act critical observers. they afford so. indeed, post-second world war world develop environment largely dominate unite states, cooperation european countries. the u influence shape relation field international finance, world trade macroeconomic policy. the rule policy push forward unite states, leadership implement them, broadly accept europeans. even military field, confrontation east take place protection u umbrella, even country declare neutral. in come year become difficult single country alone, even unite states, set standard lead policy rest world. the emergence region country large population soon similar income unite state challenge leadership. international relation base increasingly cooperation equal rather leadership one country, last 60 years. china, india possibly also brazil russia play great role global decisions. the key question scenario is: europe, european country individually, do? they ignore development continue act follower leadership become varied, accept balance interest agree unite state systemically important countries. they continue free-ride, outcome might quite different quite pleasant now. alternatively, organise form major player international community, possibly partnership unite states. all european countries, large ones, make choice. to make europe key player require members. my impression european citizen would le frighten challenge globalisation felt could participate governance. the problem globalisation can’t control level national governments, least europe. european participate governance globalisation stand united. let give example. the current financial market turmoil lead new financial regulation supervision. in increasingly integrate financial market, new regulation supervision result coordinate action part major economies. this involve account rules, prudential regimes, treatment offshore centre hedge funds, etc. the new rule discuss agree across atlantic. the experience past month suggest european contribution bi review 116/2008 5 particularly useful design stable prudent financial system. to promote view europe organise speak one voice negotiate table. if european divided, unable take decisions, accept what’s decide elsewhere. ultimately, speak one voice take decision mean decide (qualified) majority. it mean member accept put minority others, democracy. it means, ultimately, increase political integration europe. in words, either european country move towards increase political integration become irrelevant major issue relevance international scene. it may sound bite blunt, least it’s spell clearly! one objection choice great political integration fundamental competence inherent nation state cannot give without impair political integrity states. * * * this bring fourth, final, symptom seem affect europeans, i.e. denial. a people grow older, performance certain function – especially pleasant ones, case reflect power potency – tend impaired. science may extent help u delay slow inevitable decay. on hand, also lead u dangerous state denial. the seem apply political power. a europe european country grow older, also smaller, continue deny fact effective power shrinking, disappearing. for instance, many forum several european country participate lose relevance. and one reason european over-represented fora, reduce legitimacy. let give example international monetary fund eu country represent ten different constituencies, 24. the euro area country spread eight constituencies. some even constituency country non-european; ireland, example, constituency canada caribbean countries. give way european organised, it’s wonder imf largely influence unite state european tend punch much weight. furthermore, major decision concern imf increasingly take fora, typically g7 g20, four large european country represented. the eu also member g20, give rotate eu presidency, isn’t able substantial impact discussion. the logical thing would pool european representation imf thereby obtain power veto like unite state play great role. this would course require organisation within europe define common policy, do trade issue instance. a imf become institution focus primarily surveillance world economy, i see reason european countries, especially common currency, differ position major issue discuss imf. for example, i see reason country ireland position similar canada caribbean country member eu. if europe single seat table, national representative currently seat would leave it. and seem attach seats, believe – want believe – position able substantially influence decisions. they often don’t understand – don’t want understand – long seat table, others matter not, table really worth sit at. the main decision take elsewhere. 6 bi review 116/2008 again, give example, recent reform vote share imf, way reduce overall vote power europe, wasn’t really decide imf executive board agree fora, notably g7 g20. those would leave seat table obviously state denial, advance quite absurd arguments. the odd argument single european seat would create polarisation governance fund, two major shareholder – u europe – would undermine functioning. a unipolar governance, one major shareholder (the unite states), good perspective european country. * * * i talk enough today symptom syndromes. let conclude. like anyone 50, europe need make sure doesn’t become hypochondriac. a i mention start speech, europe might need go diet. and maybe get new look. the diet consist streamline activities. the eu seem much fat really is. european institution stop continuously look new roles. the celebration 10th anniversary euro end series recommendations, particular commission european parliament, new roles, resource powers. this give impression eu new competences, true. the union instead clarify role show slim is. it actually refuse take new task member state want give unless explicitly receive power conduct tasks. at 50, europe also need new look. any book film europe start sequence black white picture found fathers. most european – unfortunately – don’t even recognize face schuman, monnet, de gasperi adenauer. this shouldn’t surprising. they’d probably also fail recognise national politician days. history book certainly useful, picture effective thousand words. if i choose one picture explain current future generation europe about, i would take françois mitterrand helmut kohl join hand verdun, september 1984. some young people might recognise two faces, act unequivocal. join hand front coffin explain everything europe, come from. but that’s clearly enough. the people europe need good understand european union about, give going. the union see group state something help member states, citizens, address challenge times. the union somewhere else – brussels strasbourg – it’s every european town village, whose prosperity depend part unite europe. the future europe depend 500 million citizens. but, importantly, future 500 million citizen depend future union. the best way celebrate 50th anniversary make sure best year still come. look back do strengthen confidence achieve future, together. thank attention. bi review 116/2008 7 ben s bernanke: economic outlook testimony mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, joint economic committee, u congress, washington dc, 24 september 2008. * * * chairman schumer, vice chair maloney, representative saxton, member committee, i appreciate opportunity discus recent development financial market present update economic situation. a know, u.s. economy continue confront substantial challenges, include weaken labor market elevate inflation. notably, stress financial market high recently intensify significantly. if financial condition fail improve protract period, implication broad economy could quite adverse. the downturn house market key factor underlie strain condition financial market slowdown broad economy. in financial sphere, fall home price rise mortgage delinquency lead major loss many financial institutions, loss partially replace raise new capital. investor concern financial institution increase summer, mortgage-related asset deteriorate economic activity weakened. among firm great pressure fannie mae freddie mac, lehman brothers, and, recently, american international group (aig). a investor lose confidence them, company saw access liquidity capital market increasingly impair stock price drop sharply. the federal reserve belief that, whenever possible, difficulty address private-sector arrangement – example, raise new equity capital, negotiation lead merger acquisition, orderly wind-down. government assistance give great reluctance stability financial system, and, consequently, health broad economy, risk. in case fannie mae freddie mac, however, capital raise sufficient size appear infeasible size government-sponsored status two company preclude merger acquisition another company. to avoid unacceptably large dislocation financial sector, house market, economy whole, federal house finance agency (fhfa) place fannie mae freddie mac conservatorship, treasury use authority, grant congress july, make available financial support two firms. the federal reserve, fhfa consult conservatorship decision specify july legislation,

forthcoming. in case aig, federal reserve, support treasury, provide emergency credit line facilitate orderly resolution. the federal reserve take action judge that, light prevail market condition size composition aig's obligations, disorderly failure aig would severely threaten global financial stability and, consequently, performance u.s. economy. to mitigate concern action would exacerbate

institution. the failure lehman pose risks. but trouble lehman well know time, investor clearly recognize – evidenced, example, high cost insure lehman's debt market credit default swap – failure firm significant possibility. thus, judge investor counterparties time take precautionary measures. while perhaps manageable itself, lehman's default combine unexpectedly rapid collapse aig, together contribute development last week extraordinarily turbulent condition global financial markets. these condition cause equity price fall sharply, cost short-term credit – available – spike upward, liquidity dry many markets. loss large money market mutual fund spark extensive withdrawal number funds. a mark increase demand safe asset – flight quality – send yield treasury bill hundredth percent. by reduce asset value potentially restrict flow credit household businesses, development pose direct threat economic growth. the federal reserve take number action increase liquidity stabilize markets. notably, address dollar fund pressure worldwide, announce significant expansion reciprocal currency arrangement foreign central banks, include approximate double exist swap line european central bank swiss national bank authorization new swap facility bank japan, bank england, bank canada, among others. we continue work closely colleague central bank address ongoing liquidity pressures. the federal reserve also announce initiative assist money market mutual fund face heavy redemption increase liquidity short-term credit markets. despite effort federal reserve, treasury, agencies, global financial market remain extraordinary stress. action congress urgently require stabilize situation avert otherwise could serious consequence financial market economy. in regard, federal reserve support treasury's proposal buy illiquid asset financial institutions. purchase impair asset create liquidity promote price discovery market assets, reduce investor uncertainty current value prospect financial institutions. more generally, remove asset institutions’ balance sheet help restore confidence financial market enable bank institution raise capital expand credit support economic growth. i turn brief update economic situation. ongoing development financial market directly affect broad economy several channels, notably restrict availability credit. mortgage credit term tighten significantly fee risen, especially potential borrower lack substantial payment blemish credit histories. mortgage ineligible credit guarantee fannie mae freddie mac – 1 specifically, loan collateralize asset company primary non-regulated subsidiaries. these asset include equity substantially aig's regulate subsidiaries. 2 bi review 115/2008 example, nonconforming jumbo mortgage – cannot securitized thus carry much high interest rate conform mortgages. some lender reduce borrow limit home equity line credit. household also appear difficulty late obtain nonmortgage credit. for example, federal reserve's senior loan officer opinion survey report july increase proportion bank tighten standard credit card consumer loans. in business sector, august, financially strong firm remain able issue bond bond issuance speculative-grade firm remain light. more recently, however, deteriorate financial market condition disrupt commercial paper market form finance wide range firms, include investment-grade firms. finance commercial real estate project also tighten significantly. when worry lender tighten credit, spending, production, job creation slow. real economic activity

november 770,000. new claim unemployment insurance elevate level civilian unemployment rate rise 6.1 percent august. households' real disposable income boost significantly spring tax rebate payments,

month. although retrenchment household spend widespread, purchase motor vehicle drop particularly sharply. on positive note, oil gasoline price – still high levels, part reflect effect hurricane ike – come substantially peak reach early summer, contribute recent improvement consumer confidence. however, weakness fundamental underlie consumer spend suggest household expenditure sluggish, best, near term. the recent indicator demand new exist home hint stabilization sales, low mortgage rate likely provide support demand come months. moreover, although expectation house price continue fall

assume production sale slow anticipated. international trade provide considerable support u.s. economy first half year. economic activity buoy strong foreign demand wide range u.s. exports, include

greater-than-normal uncertainty surround forecast pace activity. in particular, intensification financial stress recent weeks, make lender still cautious extend credit household business, could prove significant drag growth. the downside risk outlook thus remain significant concern. inflation rise sharply period may july, reflect rapid increase energy food prices. during period, price inflation good service food energy also move low rate see spring, high cost energy, commodities, import good partially pass consumers. recently, however, news inflation favorable. the price oil commodities,

treasury securities. if reversed, developments, together pace growth likely fall short potential time, lead inflation moderate late year next year. nevertheless, inflation outlook remain highly uncertain. indeed, fluctuation oil price past day illustrate difficulty predict future course commodity prices. consequently, upside risk inflation remain significant concern well. over time, number factor promote return economy high level employment sustainable growth price stability, include stimulus provide monetary policy, low oil commodity prices, increase stability mortgage house markets, natural recuperative power economy. however, stabilization financial system essential precondition economic recovery. i urge congress act quickly address grave threat financial stability currently

particularly financial markets, escalate recent weeks. i would therefore like begin first say word this, measure take riksbank others counteract effect financial crisis unite states. the financial turbulence one say riksbank active two main areas. one monetary policy. the usually know financial stability – promote safe efficient payment system, write sverige riksbank act. to simplify, mean ensure payment swedish economy make securely efficiently. for instance, riksbank monitor analysis financial system, identify potential risk influence participant important financial stability. we shall work prevent financial crisis arising, nevertheless arise, task manage situation. what mean? for instance, must prepare act situation assessment financial stability threatened. let u assume, example, swedish bank supervision finansinspektionen, swedish financial supervisory authority, solvent asset great liabilities, experience serious problem liquidity thereby difficulty meet payments. if riksbank’s assessment situation stability financial system stake bank collapses, intervene measure aid liquidity. the unite state currently midst financial crisis, backwash sweep global financial system. although financial turbulence include analysis ever since last summer, way manifest intensity event vary along way. and recent week problem escalated. the recent wave financial turbulence bad far since original u mortgage crisis break out. so happen recently? for one thing, large agent u financial market suffer acute problems. the u central bank, federal reserve, take measure safeguard financial stability. the unease see market global level affect u all, financial crisis mainly centre unite states. we isolate the swedish financial system function well bank able finance sweden international capital markets. the overnight rate, short interest rate economy, remain stable around repo rate. in way riksbank’s system steer interest rate work well. but i said, scandinavia isolate happen world around us. swedish bi review 115/2008 1 bank affect tangibly global financial turbulence even though small exposure u mortgage market, centre crisis. interest rate rise substantially here, too, instance interbank market. this market bank borrow money one another cover short-term liquidity needs. let stress, however, high interest rate thing swedish bank experience problems, although become expensive borrow money. the swedish bank good development profit recent year financially strong. they good start position meet high costs. measure ensure market function efficiently but market function efficiently usual. for instance, interest rate interbank market rise result increase uncertainty. there also surge demand treasury bills. the swedish national debt office riksbank maintain regular dialogue regard money bond market need counteract effect u financial crisis. last week debt office decide consultation riksbank issue treasury bill number additional auction meet large increase demand. the fund auction invest know cover mortgage bonds. this improve way market function right now. to ensure financial system function well possible, riksbank also implement measure preventive purposes. on monday decided, put simply, increase access credit participant rix payment system. one say oil wheel system make easy participant make payment one another course day. they great extent use cover bonds, issue institution close links, collateral system. a cover bond collateral form of, instance, mortgage, provide credit institution issue bond. this mean credit granter protect case ordinary bonds. cover bond therefore good collateral many central bank accept bond large scale riksbank. in case permit share raise 25 per cent 75 per cent. this measure means, put simple terms, participant rix system use collateral borrow necessary. another measure that, instance, riksbank central bank denmark norway, together u federal reserve, reach agreement purpose increase access dollar scandinavian financial markets, necessary. for riksbank involve possibility obtain access u dollar addition foreign currency reserve. this know swap facility amount total sum correspond usd 10 billion. our assessment probably necessary use money. it nevertheless important demonstrate prepare act prove necessary. the agreement quickly put operation actually become necessary. financial stability satisfactory what happen come bolt blue. and question central bank sit arm fold ignore risk take commercial banks. in sweden, riksbank regularly highlight many risk financial system. we recently financial stability report. there point out, instance, financial turbulence might worsen banks' access fund could deteriorate. at time, along make assessment financial stability sweden satisfactory. we make assessment now, swedish bank financially strong. 2 bi review 115/2008 a seen, lot happen financial market recently. we follow development closely, constantly update analysis prepare take action necessary. we regular contact banks, market participant government agencies, well central bank colleague countries. there generally high level uncertainty world economy present probably persist good come. i would therefore like return i mention begin – inflation target stability offer economy, particularly storm rag around us. monetary policy – focus inflation target the objective monetary policy maintain price stability establish law since 1999. to precise, inflation measure term consumer price index, cpi, hold 2 per cent, tolerance interval +/- 1 percentage point. this riksbank formulate inflation target announce 1993. one say task ensure price remain stable delegate swedish people riksdag (swedish parliament) riksbank. and actually merely objective, also means. by keep inflation low stable, monetary policy help create best possible condition good sustainable economic growth. delegate monetary policy central bank way riksdag do sweden also reduce risk political pressures, short-sighted action rapid change monetary policy. our focus – govern interest rate decision – attain inflation target within couple year way provide balance development economy possible. this also case recent monetary policy meet september, repo rate raise 4.75 per cent. it difficult situation make decision, high inflation sweden abroad outset uncertain world economy. although executive board member agree many things, assessment differ regard interest rate path need bring inflation back target suitable pace. although difference assessment actually fairly modest, extremely important clear common individual motif behind stance take meeting. i therefore look forward first talk recently affect interest rate policy fundamental level factor behind decision take september. high inflation rise interest rate the riksbank ensure keep inflation sweden low stable rate. we indeed experience long period fairly low rate price increase, approximately 1.6 per cent average since inflation target announced. however, past year inflation higher. in august rate increase consumer price 4.3 per cent. this high inflation rate almost 15 years. give this, perhaps surprise expect inflation also rise short term. but expectation inflation several year ahead also clearly riksbank's target 2 per cent. it therefore surprise many people concerned. a inflation risen, riksbank raise interest loan banks, repo rate. this 4.75 per cent. the banks’ lend rate company household high also risen. they rise riksbank’s rate increases. this turn link uncertainty financial markets, increase banks’ borrow cost around world. at time, economic activity world general weakened, lead decline export swedish companies. we bi review 115/2008 3 experience many year extremely good economic growth low inflation. now must prepare high inflation, high interest rate low employment possibly lead deterioration finance many swedish household couple years. monetary policy often come focus type situation. the recent debate – riksbank chase inflation spectres? the riksbank’s interest rate increase much discuss recently. it say bank chase non-existent inflation spectre, inflation target scrap reformulated, riksbank take notice economic activity inflation. to begin with, inflation real problem many households. inflation mean everyone get le money. oil, electricity food price rise substantially. these good important part household consumption. together food energy comprise approximately one quarter cpi. the fact that, instance, oil food price rise much sweden largely good become expensive world market. should inflation target reformulated? some recent criticism concern whether inflation target apply measure cpi. the idea monetary policy stabilise around measure inflation exclude import prices. the riksbank case unable affect price world market. however, convince argument. swedish condition also affect price good import. the world market price product price swedish household see shops. the value krona relation currency example play part. demand factor transport, mark-ups wholesale retail channel also significant. what riksbank conduct well-balanced monetary policy consumer price average rise 2 per cent year. when riksbank raise repo rate, demand dampened, reduce scope price increase areas, include energy food. it important monetary policy aim keep general price increase inflation target redefine merely price rise others. households’ total purchase power affect price import good change, would case even inflation target exclude prices. when, instance, price oil rise long period time risk price increase spread area economy. this risk would hardly decline inflation target formulate differently. of course one must open change could improve current monetary policy regime. but important think thing carefully. and fix something broken. if look back period current inflation target, difficult describe anything successful. the inflation target monetary policy without doubt contribute provide stability economic policy lack swedish economy 1970s 1980s. temporary effect – right monetary policy what riksbank need keep check general price increases. monetary policy neither try counteract fact price good increase others. so, mainly product lead consumer price increase much, riksbank tighten monetary policy? the argument put forward critic increase oil food price affect inflation temporarily. the 4 bi review 115/2008 riksbank anything this. such view assume increase oil food price spread prices, demand wage compensation even high inflation. but something one automatically assume. there many example years. those around oil crisis 1970s perhaps remember substantial rise oil price impact rest economy. the inflation rate reach two figures. wise experience, i believe handle thing differently now. it task ensure temporary effect remain temporary become entrenched. do focus inflation? another question arise recent debate extent riksbank take production employment consideration. let first say come relation low stable inflation good growth, one exclude other. the actual purpose inflation target provide condition good economic growth sustainable long term. furthermore, riksbank shall also give consideration development production employment individual interest rate decisions, long appear possible attain inflation target. monetary policy flexible. we “inflation nutters” british colleague mervyn king put it. the riksbank cannot stabilise inflation 2 per cent time. sudden increase oil, food, clothe kind price push inflation. our interest rate policy design inflation expect back target within couple years, next week. the fact may take time inflation back 2 per cent provide scope take account production employment. the riksbank thus scope give consideration development economic activity. this something actually do. over past year, instance, interest rate raise dramatically, gradual pace, despite rapid increase inflation. the riksbank’s assessment cautious increase interest rate sufficient bring inflation back around target 2 per cent couple year ahead. however, riksbank’s task maintain price stability. this set limit restrictive one interest rate weapon. without interest rate increase inflation could soar similar way 1970s 1980s. at time economic policy prevent inflation become entrenched. the inflation target set create condition good growth sustainable long term. an expansionary monetary policy perhaps contribute favourable development economic activity short term provide major problem production employment long term. the recent decision when recent interest rate decision made, six member executive board hold differ opinions. i two colleague vote raise interest rate 4.75 per cent. there many case vote “draw” cast vote determine decision; happen four time since executive board form almost ten year ago. the result particularly strange surprise give situation decision made. we six different individual executive board. we different background different perspectives. sometimes lead assessment differing, even work towards objective. it apply particular uncertain situation like present one. but whole idea executive board disagreement permitted. different approach opinion enrich discussion hopefully lead good decisions. bi review 115/2008 5 my assessment so i reason recent meeting, i vote another increase quarter percentage point? well, begin important put individual decision right perspective. monetary policy act time lag affect inflation couple year ahead series interest rate decision rather individual interest rate increase, cut, matter. my decision september therefore closely connect interest rate policy conduct past year interest rate path i expect see future. a new phase we experience long period low inflation high growth global perspective, enter new phase. in develop economy like unite state euro area growth falling, remain high emerge economy china, india brazil. the effect high demand certain commodity rapidly-growing economy something central bank around world must manage future. another example imbalance global economy. access credit high long time many country contribute unsustainable development. the imbalance build corrected, still uncertain long adjustment take. what see world le stable see recent years. sweden small open economy riksbank conduct independent monetary policy. we inflation target endeavour attain. an inflation target become even important anchor monetary policy situation like present one. if financial imbalance large fluctuation commodity price create global shock long period time, inflation target calm effect economy. it therefore feel particularly important maintain focus inflation target right now. the interest rate decision in connection executive board’s monetary policy meet 3 september, saw sign inflation fall various part world. but fall inflation high level yet clear decline visible statistics. swedish inflation still high level since mid-1990s. at time, growth weak anticipated. productivity also weak lead rise production costs. the weak productivity appear persist lead continue high cost pressures. resource utilisation measure term number hour work still slightly high normal. however, expect decline. expectation inflation high, short long term. at time september meet still inflation target. expectation indication confidence monetary policy. both interest rate increase fall energy food price may contribute slight fall. but important remember inflation expectation still high. there considerable uncertainty regard commodity price global development i see cannot sound clear yet. to meet inflation target important conduct monetary policy contribute long-term inflation expectation close 2 per cent. my assessment increase require achieve this. when i look ahead i consider inflation inflation expectation must close target expansionary monetary policy reconcile bring inflation back 2 per cent within couple years. weak economic activity guarantee inflation “automatically” fall. this connect to, instance, risk contagion effect fact inflation become entrenched, 6 bi review 115/2008 i mention earlier. both sweden abroad many example inflation remain high growth slow falls. compare assessment make july, make downward adjustment forecast future repo rate. new statistic indicate global swedish economic activity weaken sooner expect therefore revise forecast growth. give this, i consider complete interest rate increases. i expect next stage cut monetary policy ease slightly 2009. i think difficult claim interest rate path present september strict. the interest rate particularly high, either historical perspective comparison many country float exchange rate. resource utilisation, good public sector finance surplus current account provide u good start point. the swedish economy necessary requirement meet limit downturn economic activity growth around long-term average towards end forecast horizon, time attain inflation target. in addition, current interest rate provide support exchange rate. this value regard meet inflation target. a final word let briefly summarise i talk today. the riksbank strive constantly attain inflation target manage task safeguard financial stability best possible way. if succeed, provide stability swedish economy, particularly time international turmoil. we probably live financial market turbulence crisis unite state good come. it early yet able foresee over. however, say take time. the next occasion weigh together new information receive assess development affect prospect growth inflation next monetary policy meet end october. until course continue follow development closely regular contact banks, market participant government agencies. we constantly try include important information analyses. this way always work, apply financial stability monetary policy. let conclude must important thing sweden right – observation financial stability home satisfactory sweden well-equipped meet global economic downturn occasion. bi review 115/2008 7 hermann remsperger: fundamental issue stabilise financial system keynote speech professor dr hermann remsperger, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, conference “determinants implication financial crisis” frankfurt school finance & management – bankakademie, hfb, frankfurt main, 17 september 2008. * * * lady gentleman what i afraid occurred. there hardly anything difficult speak michael heise. actually, already say say. but since i cannot simply stay silent, i would like discus fundamental issue stabilise financial system. and i hope think perhaps small value added, even though i quite deliberately wish go recent events. my topic therefore crisis management long-term prevention crises. i would certainly miss point topic i deal i list whole wealth exist proposal stabilise financial system. there isn’t enough time anyway. therefore, instead go details, i shall try highlight fundamental issue underlie many recommendation action. i choose take approach least i also constantly concern fundamental issue precisely result work involvement financial stability forum. for example, one question arise morning institutional structure maintain stability financial system configure long term, especially unite states. or, even basically: much freedom market participant financial system area degree freedom limited? these question reason why, talk, i finally choose matrix keyword head feature recommendation action encounter almost every day media. these head include “enhancing transparency”, “refining basel ii”, “reforming deposit guarantee schemes”, “regulating rat agencies”, “modifying monetary policymakers’ operational framework”. under headings, recommendation relate three set fundamental interconnect stability issues, namely 1 key issue area regulation 2 question institutional structure financial stability, 3 fundamental issue regard procyclicality. to put quite plainly, set individual topic fundamental issues, become clear last stabilisation financial system call holistic, system-oriented policy approach, base institution-oriented bank supervision also go beyond it. let start fundamental issue area regulation. i fundamental issue area regulation put nutshell, fundamental issue area regulation relate tension pole self-regulation sovereign regulation. in words, market solution possible sovereign regulation necessary? another question political level fundamental decision taken. be national, bi review 115/2008 1 european international level? this add further, complex dimension underlie tension strain self-regulation sovereign regulation. i shall return point moment. but allow first emphasise that, market-based system, approach involve self-regulation obvious course take. put simple terms, state case rely mainly fact market participants, first, set standard themselves; second, commit comply standard and, third, organise effective mean monitor compliance. now, give backdrop current events, i probably need over-emphasise fact that, regard necessary stability financial system, cannot trust self-regulation alone. sovereign regulation “orders” financial system also part market economy. i take view sovereign regulation particularly appropriate market player unable unwilling set effective rule override reason regulatory power government bring bear. bank supervision prime example this: bank key position financial system and, therefore, economy whole. they also access, albeit conditional one, central bank money. a result, unanimous agreement self-regulation option. a fundamental decision favour sovereign regulation bank supervision mean settle question whether regulation necessarily set detail prescriptive rules. indeed, regulation also organise principle-oriented way. in case, state demand market player follow certain principle transaction monitor compliance principles. this approach therefore confuse simple laissez faire. rather, place high demand involved. above all, principle-based regulation predicate supervisor supervise share understand prudential aims. if, principles, i look closely basel ii – regulatory framework apply bank since january – i find both: rules, one hand, principle-based provision room manoeuvre, other. for example, pillar 1 basel ii contain clear provision much capital maintain credit risks. and, bundesbank’s perspective, i would add regulation partially refine give experience financial market turbulence. among things, favour high capital cover re-securitisations. this include cdos asset-backed securities, example. in addition, advocate high capital requirement credit risk trade book adjustment area qualify liquidity facility standardise approach securitisation. pillar 2 basel ii contain qualitative requirement risk management financial institutions, specify germany principle-based minimum requirement risk management. the disclosure obligation pillar 3 also fall category principle-oriented regulation. they leave credit institution scope determine type scale information provide. in view, show that, although question “rules principles?” fundamental decision sovereign regulation, necessarily “either-or” decision. perhaps also explain why, reality, regularly encounter combination principle offer fix rule flexibility. i believe that, whole, likely best way serve requirement stable financial system understand it. nevertheless, i see approach debate flexibility second pillar basel ii least partially call question supplementary provisions. i would warn this. a aware, however, fundamental issue regulation stabilise financial system arise bank supervision also, say, securitisation business, hedge fund and, especially press issue, case rat agencies. 2 bi review 115/2008 in unite states, rat agency register sec. furthermore, bear mind basel ii rely rat classify bank loans. in europe therefore procedure agency authorise use rat determine bank’s minimum capital. follow experience rat recent financial crisis, current practice non-binding iosco code conduct generally perceive need reform. the rat agency process review internal procedure rat methods. in addition, may committee european security regulator (cesr) propose establishment international standard set monitor body (ssmb) iosco, agency set standard together regulators. compliance standard monitor ssmb, albeit without involvement agencies. this approach claim virtually midway solution self-regulation sovereign regulation. a aware, european commission put forward proposal consultation envisage authorisation procedure supervision rat agency – words, sovereign regulation. i would like make three fundamental comment this. first all, every effort undertake ensure solution european level consistent level play field internationally. the crucial point everything hinge iosco code conduct since anything else might result competitive disadvantage europe. second, emphasis place investors’ responsibility use ratings. eu registration must lead “rubber-stamped brussels” interpret seal quality individual ratings. third, eu registration procedure would decentralise structure; particular, new authority created. the basel ii authorisation procedure good reference point respect. in make comment, i basically arrive fundamental question suitable sovereign level regulation. national international regulation competition, third way exist europe form regulation eu level. the decentralise regulation is, good adapt characteristic financial system question. the centralise regulation is, regulatory condition prevail. deposit guarantee scheme good example tension national cross-border regulation resolved. in europe minimum level harmonisation form deposit guarantee scheme directive. in germany, besides statutory deposit protection minimum european level, exist additional, private protection scheme operate various category banks. not least wake bank run northern rock last summer, european commission consider revision deposit protection directive. it aim great degree harmonisation. in particular, concern high level minimum protection abolition co-insurance. a discussion eu stands, would mean principle subsidiarity would basically retained. we bundesbank attach great importance this. deposit protection consistent specific feature national bank systems. bi review 115/2008 3 ii fundamental institutional question with distribution power among sovereign regulatory levels, i close second set fundamental issues. i would like talk number fundamental institutional question stabilisation financial system. i because, financial crisis, become clear ever much institution matter. i therefore concern institutional framework monetary, supervisory regulatory infrastructure. in usa, shortcoming governance financial system reveal see crisis, time pose two major challenges. the first challenge arise fragment structure financial supervision. in cases, however, quite new institutional arrangement – is, institution – put place. with “blueprint”, u ministry finance present ambitious cogent overall strategy longer-term reform financial supervision. it envisage radically overhaul institutional structure complete change design tasks. i see one particularly important aspect blueprint fact feed role “market stability regulator” would, first time, institutionalise primarily macro-oriented perspective financial system. i await keen interest debate proceed. with regard second institutional challenge usa, namely review monetary policy instruments, lot already happened. to begin with, feed well equip instrument liquidity policy action necessitate subprime crisis. the feed quick create efficiently function instrument crisis, however. when i look institutional structure financial stability germany eurosystem, i would like highlight synergy effect operational money market management bank supervision. the financial market turbulence show u quite clearly synergy effect indeed large. a bundesbank closely integrate bank supervision, also fully exploit synergy effects. our deliberation time profile liquidity provision and, hence, stance eurosystem benefit general information bank supervision. conversely, insight gain contact bank industry practical conduct refinance operation payment helpful bank supervisors. these synergy effect quite certainly play part eurosystem able take early, resolute successful countermeasure distribution liquidity among bank long function normal. in term distribution power among institutions, therefore sensible national central bank closely integrate bank supervision. and i am, course, also glad say success central bank operation since august 2007 certainly due efficient division labour among various institutions. rather, eurosystem’s monetary policy framework play crucial part this. a i report experience, without give many secret away, eurosystem earn great deal respect international institution body deal depth financial crisis lesson implication draw it. a key role institutional structure body play financial stability forum, former bundesbank president, han tietmeyer, foresight initiate within g7 1999. the fsf demonstrate great value crisis agency informal cooperation national bodies, international organisation standard-setters. the list recommendation reach consensus adopt fsf heart international response turbulence. the recommendation work stages. a progress report appear three weeks. 4 bi review 115/2008 even so, undoubtedly surprise international governance financial system – every global crisis – subject critical scrutiny again. if think changes, i believe strengthen institutional structure job well financial market turbulence. for me, mean that, first foremost, fsf continue play key role term responsibility financial stability. it widely draw membership central banks, ministry finance, supervisors, regulator international institution mean holistic assessment financial system one key strength fsf. the international monetary fund engage force fsf, all, in-depth analysis way financial system interact real economy. for analysis interactions, imf draw decade experience article iv consultation decade assessment financial sector [fsap]. the imf therefore almost ideal condition place. despite financial crisis, however, i see compel reason additional finance facility imf, would bring quite close perform task central bank. iii fundamental issue procyclicality after outline fundamental issue area regulation institutional structure safeguard stability financial system, let turn third key issue, which, internationally, right top agenda and, view, also discussion time come. mario draghi, governor banca d'italia, make clear yesterday even bundesbank lecture berlin. basically, question whether regulatory framework financial system, well provision accounting, act procyclically – and, so, do counter that. to reduce complexity, i shall interpret term “procyclicality” quite narrowly once, namely reinforcement natural cycle financial system. procyclical policy procyclical element regulation would amplify natural upswings downswing financial system. if lead boom-bust cycles, functional viability financial system jeopardised. naturally, considerable caution call deal topic procyclicality still don’t know enough cyclical effect regulatory provisions. add fact potential mean procyclicality yet research test detail, component dampen procyclicality even automatic stabiliser regulatory framework anticyclical effect. my concern today therefore quite modest one. i merely wish raise even awareness issue associate proposition regulatory framework procyclical. to avoid misunderstanding, i wish stress regulatory framework risk-sensitive minimum capital requirement basel ii use fair value account irfs (or u gaap) contain cyclical elements. it unclear, however, far built-in element also develop procyclical potential. other expert argue, turn, cyclicality two framework side effect desire characteristics. it claim potential procylicality deliberately condone order make capital requirement risk-sensitive make capital requirement consistent market conditions. and, like you, i, too, become familiar debate proposition traditional micro view regulation gain upper hand macro systemic perspective. what generally agree risk-sensitive minimum capital requirement basel ii base probability default, fluctuate economic cycle. in downturn, probability default increase – along minimum capital requirements. buffers, design dampen procyclical potential, build basel ii. for example, long-term average use probability bi review 115/2008 5 default assign loss give default also take due account scenario potential economic downturn. so far, unclear – could possibly otherwise soon introduction basel ii? – whether cyclical fluctuation minimum capital requirement actually impact propensity lend – words, whether really procyclical effect. the extent happen hinge large number factor – example, far capital buff exceed regulatory minimum, willingness bank let buff “breathe”, and, naturally enough, use alternatives, raise additional capital. moreover, fluctuation actual lend supply side; demand, too, fluctuate considerably economic cycle. furthermore, cautious attitude question procyclicality also fact empirical study impact risk-sensitive minimum capital requirement need long time series. le one year introduction basel ii germany, database still narrow. it yet possible make detail assessment whether minimum capital requirement become bind therefore act procyclical manner. knee-jerk responses, general introduction additional general capital buff mean pillar 2 therefore, see it, appropriate. what is, fact, call close monitor development careful analysis incoming data. it important, first all, gain deep understand complex mechanism banks’ capital management basel ii’s impact adequate period time. the bank supervisor work hard this. their findings, well others, use ass systemic effect prudential requirements. if procyclical effect exist significant scale, take account system-oriented supervisory approach. now, i already indicate fundamental issue concern procyclicality also accounting. fair value account lead valuation fluctuate along market prices. this evidently heighten financial market turbulence. with mark-to-market valuation paper, loss result fall asset values, make reduction risk position seem advisable, thus trigger wave selling. computer-controlled procedure automatically limit loss give impetus procyclicality. conversely, rise asset value upswing make additional investment possible, drive market price even further. nevertheless, mean “prudential filters” bank supervisor ensure fluctuation balance sheet item impact fully regulatory capital. this mean nexus fall market price assets, decline fund restrict ability lend downswing dampened. in upswing reverse applies. this prudential correction mechanism therefore limit part effect fair-value-based accounting, namely impact potential supply credit. iv conclusion lady gentleman in conclusion, let return beginning. after well year financial market turbulence follow experience past days, i firmly believe stabilise financial system cannot consist solely work “to do” list recommendation action, however positive correct may be. rather, last stabilisation financial system call holistic policy approach link microprudential base – words, perspective individual institution – macroprudential perspective simultaneously integrate macroeconomic background development financial markets. 6 bi review 115/2008 realise holistic approach certainly easy task. but i regard right course arrive last stabilisation financial system. thank attention. bi review 115/2008 7 ben s bernanke: u financial market testimony mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, committee banking, housing, urban affairs, u senate, washington dc, 23 september 2008. * * * chairman dodd, senator shelby, member committee, i appreciate opportunity discus recent development financial market economy. a know, u.s. economy continue confront substantial challenges, include weaken labor market elevate inflation. notably, stress financial market high recently intensify significantly. if financial condition fail improve protract period, implication broad economy could quite adverse. the downturn house market key factor underlie strain condition financial market slowdown broad economy. in financial sphere, fall home price rise mortgage delinquency lead major loss many financial institutions, loss partially replace raise new capital. investor concern financial institution increase summer, mortgage-related asset deteriorate economic activity weakened. among firm great pressure fannie mae freddie mac, lehman brothers, and, recently, american international group (aig). a investor lose confidence them, company saw access liquidity capital market increasingly impair stock price drop sharply. the federal reserve belief that, whenever possible, difficulty address private-sector arrangement – example, raise new equity capital, negotiation lead merger acquisition, orderly wind-down. government assistance give great reluctance stability financial system, and, consequently, health broad economy, risk. in case fannie mae freddie mac, however, capital raise sufficient size appear infeasible size government-sponsored status two company preclude merger acquisition another company. to avoid unacceptably large dislocation financial sector, house market, economy whole, federal house finance agency (fhfa) place fannie mae freddie mac conservatorship, treasury use authority, grant congress july, make available financial support two firms. the federal reserve, fhfa consult conservatorship decision specify july legislation, support step necessary appropriate. we see benefit action form low mortgage rates, help house market. the federal reserve treasury attempt identify private-sector approach avoid imminent failure aig lehman brothers, none forthcoming. in case aig, federal reserve, support treasury, provide emergency credit line facilitate orderly resolution. the federal reserve take action judge that, light prevail market condition size composition aig's obligations, disorderly failure aig would severely threaten global financial stability and, consequently, performance u.s. economy. to mitigate concern action would exacerbate moral hazard encourage inappropriate risk-taking future, federal reserve ensure term credit

lehman brothers, major investment bank, federal reserve treasury decline commit public fund support institution. the failure lehman pose risks. but trouble lehman well know time, investor clearly recognize – evidenced, example, high cost insure lehman's debt market credit default swap – failure firm significant possibility. thus, judge investor counterparties time take precautionary measures. while perhaps manageable itself, lehman's default combine unexpectedly rapid collapse aig, together contribute development last week extraordinarily turbulent condition global financial markets. these condition cause equity price fall sharply, cost short-term credit – available – spike upward, liquidity dry many markets. loss large money market mutual fund spark extensive withdrawal number funds. a mark increase demand safe asset – flight quality – send yield treasury bill hundredth percent. by reduce asset value potentially restrict flow credit household businesses, development pose direct threat economic growth. the federal reserve take number action increase liquidity stabilize markets. notably, address dollar fund pressure worldwide, announce significant expansion reciprocal currency arrangement foreign central banks, include approximate double exist swap line european central bank swiss national bank authorization new swap facility bank japan, bank england, bank canada. we continue work closely colleague central bank address ongoing liquidity pressures. the federal reserve also announce initiative assist money market mutual fund face heavy redemption increase liquidity short-term credit markets. despite effort federal reserve, treasury, agencies, global financial market remain extraordinary stress. action congress urgently require stabilize situation avert otherwise could serious consequence financial market economy. in regard, federal reserve support treasury's proposal buy illiquid asset financial institutions. purchase impair asset create liquidity promote price discovery market assets, reduce investor uncertainty current value prospect financial institutions. more generally, remove asset institutions’ balance sheet help restore confidence financial market enable bank institution raise capital expand credit support economic growth. at juncture, light fast-moving development financial markets, essential deal crisis hand. certainly, shortcoming weakness financial market regulatory system must address avoid repetition transpire financial market past year. however, development comprehensive proposal reform would require careful extensive analysis would difficult compress short legislative timeframe available. look forward, federal reserve commit work closely congress, administration, 1 specifically, loan collateralize asset company

however, dependence capital market sustain market liquidity also increased, bank intermediary place great reliance ability “originate distribute” loan financial products. they also depend market

financial institution mega institutions. however, look write-down debt large debt write-down north america large banks. if large relative size, would great problem. indeed, preliminary indication need focus size, governability, adequacy internal control internal information flow increasingly important aspect financial governance oversight body mega-banks. bi review 114/2008 3 indeed many large bank increase capital go market, tap liquidity outside jurisdictions, even regulator demand it. there may issue light regulatory hand confidence role market. responsibility rest ceo evident fire three ceo

interest rate market interest rate lead close relationship market bank interest rates. consequently, deepen financial market serve amplify effect monetary policy bank interest rates, ceteris paribus variable inflation. however countervail truth also evident. the major monetary policy transmission channel bank lend become le important, yet new regulation still focus quality bank credit. widespread use credit derivative mean bank could respond flexibly change financial market conditions, may therefore pas every change central bank’s official short-term interest rate. moreover, financial development broaden banks’ option term respond interest rate changes; also broaden borrowers’ finance opportunities, reduce dependency bank loans. these development mean urgent need adequate amount data would provide policymakers sufficient ammunition try maintain financial stability. indeed, jurisdiction investment banks, key institution securitization boom fell outside prudential purview key financial regulator measure stability initiative build robust financial stability index thus far good enough easily understandable market. moreover interpret sufficient precision order home remedial area need, fuzzy exercise. the concept financial stability involve various financial intermediaries, financial market segment infrastructure, whole host different quantitative qualitative indicator used. a consequence, determine degree financial stability remain highly integrate complex task. it therefore mean governance system responsibility ensure financial stability must able monitor information analyse development several financial sector commercial banks. recognition multi-faceted nature ensure financial stability contribute concept single regulator evidence establishment financial service authority jurisdiction intend help deal problem widen scope financial transaction interconnectedness. it begin appear become increasingly difficult single regulatory authority fully grasp intricacy security regulation, insurance, bank derivative use financial institutional arrangement simultaneously. it seem therefore require great depth understand regulator specific financial area also 4 bi review 114/2008 great collaboration among regulator area view collaborate ensure great stability system whole. the role calculate feedback effect financial system behaviour real economy traditionally conduct central bank national scale imf global scale, latter still remain important role. the imf may well position evaluate effects, clear best position set regulatory criteria. there therefore seem role oversight monitor body multiple oversight responsibilities, ability access wide range input various single regulatory body single regulatory responsibilities. the body come close bi fsf, despite drawback truly global institutions. it useful note bi engine room fsf. give feedback effect play crucial role assess financial system’s vulnerability contagion systemic-wide stress area international oversight body need concentrate intensively. since require continuous monitor interactive dialogue risk management skills, joint fsf/imf collaboration may necessary. data availability relevant data identification with exception market price regulatory information, limit set data available timely manner manner facilitate international comparison. for instance, financial intermediaries’ financial report contain little information risk transfer mechanisms, use off-balance sheet financial derivatives. method find also handle shift demand data environment financial market constantly undergo change. this regulator challenge. at present, stability forecast often scatter respect risk categories, financial market segment structural regulatory issues. while every national regulator involve process, global recognition problem may need global level. this must confuse doubt skill knowledge special geographic groupings. central bank regulator financial service authority? have set guidelines, issue compliance important. over year simultaneous shift direct administer system market-determined marked-based system determine interest rates, exchange rate key financial variables. however, regulator policymaker must still remain vigilant time ensure private owner management financial intermediary operate within define risk parameters, observe standards, guideline code diligently, comply prudential regulation norms, follow best corporate governance practices. the regulator responsibility compliance may necessarily regulatory set guideline guideline span regulatory authorities. the need coordination therefore essential. even role government process underwrite balance sheet issue. in uk government give verbal undertake depositor safety funds. in us, question also arise around issue central bank bail financial institution (which banks) whether use fund would otherwise available treasury, appropriate. this issue bail financial institution central bank regulate also implication report obligation raise spectre wisdom practicality single regulatory authority moral hazard institution regulate provide financial bi review 114/2008 5 support,

introduction in recent day see extraordinary development u financial markets. at start last week saw collapse lehman brother merger merrill lynch bank america; friday u treasury rescue aig, issue guarantee money market fund outline plan resolution trust congress. and morning federal reserve announce goldman sachs morgan stanley would become regulate bank hold companies. but i want today concentrate broad economic impact crisis credit markets, begin year ago downturn u sub-prime house market. while epicentre remain us, already major impact structure bank sector. northern rock among first casualties. and year see significant consolidation within uk bank sector, santander purchase alliance & leicester, nationwide absorb two small build societies, recently merger hbos lloyd tsb. the turmoil also affect bank’s work; set interest rates, scale structure market operations, joint work fsa treasury deal institution stress help design effective international response crisis. for example, like central banks, adapt money market operation provide liquidity bank system whole required. first, allow bank increase reserve balance bank, increase size overall provision central bank money; second, within large total, shift balance towards longer-term lend term market finance shortened; third, widen collateral accept longer-term repos. and april, introduce special scheme provide bank three years’ finance legacy asset become illiquid. last week offer extra sterling liquidity usual open market operation provide u dollar liquidity part coordinate action federal reserve, ecb, bank japan swiss national bank. we also extend window bank swap legacy asset special liquidity scheme january next year. even window closes, scheme’s asset swap provide liquidity period three years, something many people fully appreciated. event still move quickly, i hope understand i go attempt live commentary events. i hope massive far-reaching measure u government announce restore great calm confidence bank system. stabilisation u market bank beneficial knock-on effect wide international market too. but continue monitor situation closely, consultation counterpart u elsewhere, order judge whether measure needed. inflation outlook this morning i want take wide perspective discus credit crunch affect wide uk economy draw medium-term lesson economic policy. bi review 114/2008 1 and first point make turmoil financial market shock economy last 12 months. in week attention would give fact second successive quarter governor write open letter chancellor behalf monetary policy committee explain inflation percentage point away target 2%. in fact inflation rise 2.1% december 4.7% august seem set peak 5% soon. the immediate driver increase international commodity cycle (chart 1). the rapid growth across large emerge market economy (emes) particular fuel global demand raw materials, short term relatively fix supply, pull price upwards. in august, oil price 60% high year earlier, wholesale gas price 90%, food price 40%. these sharp increase cost feed food petrol price pass along supply chain, drive price good include particular household gas electricity bill (chart 2). but long price wholesale energy foodstuff global market stabilise new high levels, direct impact inflation wash year. in words, late 2009 item would make contribution rate consumer price inflation: whereas, present, contribute almost 3 percentage points. moreover sign commodity cycle may turn down. since peak july, price food fall 10% price crude oil fall quarter, consistent indicator point slow growth emerge advance economies. that good news commodity price offset somewhat uk fall exchange rate. sterling trade around 1.8 u dollar – year ago 2.0. but arithmetic applies: price level shock need long-term impact inflation rate. in medium term real upside risk inflation lie home – whether see “second round” rise wage price domestic economy. it counter pressure mpc judge necessary last year growth slow create margin spare capacity economy. that make difficult company raise price put pressure restrain costs. it also re-emphasise determination get inflation back 2% target thus influence expectation financial markets, price setters, wage negotiator household generally. and expectation important impact inflation. broadly, high households’ expect inflation be, le likely save today. inflation expectation also shape workers’ wage demand try protect standard living. and companies’ expectation shape price set well willingness concede cost increases. we know inflation 70s, 80s, early 90 raise interest rate time bring inflation down, even expectation future inflation high. but also know painful process is. it work increase threat bankruptcy unemployment. that force change peoples’ behaviour heart mind expectation follow. conversely, confident people inflation fall back le rely slow economy force hold price wage down. that risk inflation expectation drift central concern mpc last year. in view particularly important recent months, forecast high one inflation figure exceed early forecast, confuse central message set policy bring inflation back target. we see households’ near-term expectation inflation rise year, inevitable give experience forecast (chart 3). what matter 2 bi review 114/2008 expectation inflation medium-term, whether consistent target, survey le alarming: accord yougov/citigroup survey, expectation fall back little gap open people’s perception current inflation expectation year ahead. we use economic data cross-check happen inflation expectations. if households’ expectation become detached, expect see household spend more, save less, push large nominal wage increases. if companies’ expectation become detached, expect see broad-based pickup cost price inflation. but consumer spend appear weak, nominal wage growth remain relatively mute strip impact rise commodity prices, output price inflation steady. to paraphrase sherlock holmes, expectation become detached, curious dog haven’t barked. so view news front encouraging. the impact credit crunch and course, balance upside risk inflation commodity price shock downside risk credit crisis would drive activity far push inflation target medium term. and news front remain worrying. the headline drama wall street failure rescue even big well know financial firm matter mainly knock impact wide economy. the last year bring home central bank concern financial stability well monetary stability inflation. for big risk financial sector also big downside risk economy: namely damage bank balance sheet would lead tight credit conditions, low asset prices, low consumption investment severe feedback loop loss bank spiral. that feedback already work degree u uk too. our investment bank suffer loss trade book wide group bank lose money treasury book fall value structure credit sorts. at time find major source finance, notably securitisation medium term unsecured lending, dry others, notably short term lend money markets, become much expensive (chart 4). what more, effect last long expect seem set continue time. bank respond hoard liquidity try reduce leverage raise new capital (not without difficulty cases) constrain growth lending. one direct effect mark tighten credit condition past year (chart 5), seem still underway. that turn push asset price demand. our forecast policy decision reflect best assessment likely impact feedback. we bring interest rate early year cushion impact change bank behaviour. in effect rely credit squeeze large measure produce slowdown consider necessary. but fully aware risk squeeze bank feedback economy could prove powerful expected. that risk arise drama last week two. we continue work return calm financial markets. but rely reverse quickly broad macroeconomic slowdown underway. indeed still risk downside i think might useful spell fee economy therefore make plain indicator i focus next months. bi review 114/2008 3 any contraction lend real economy amplify slowdown demand (chart 6). increase retail lend rate still get access credit discourage spending. increase credit ration dramatic impact. if household company unable tap source finance, spend fall back line income. spend high cost durable good – purchase car white good household machine company – likely particularly affected. and contraction mortgage lend push house prices, erode value collateral banks’ loan secured. tight credit condition raise income gearing, force household company devote large share income service debt. and impact tight credit condition bite economy, income likely squeeze time real income affect high food energy prices. the slowdown demand fall disproportionately certain industries, start house-building sector relate service lead fall employment. some household company likely drive default threshold. tight credit condition could also affect potential output economy – reduce capacity economy produce good services. the economy’s supply capacity reflect number people work number machine disposal, also productive company use labour capital produce output. and innovation new product new process drive productivity growth finance part bank lending. in short, process deleveraging design alleviate pressure banks’ capital position lead additional wave credit losses, couple high write-off rates, give low level property price (chart 7). and, welcome though reform basel ii account rule many respects, accentuate squeeze capital requirement base risk weight rise arrears increase collateral value falling. house price consumption one important feedback house market continue weaken. the number loan approval house purchase record low, ratio sale stock approach level early 1990s, price 12% peak late last year. of course fall house price tend coincide slowdown wide economy affect factor – notably fall real income employment. but also fee back activity. first slow house investment transaction flow hit builder relate service like estate agent conveyancers. the purchase white good furniture tend go hand hand transaction house market. so slowdown number people move home likely impact spend goods. fall house price limit much household small business borrow today pull consumption investment. also reduce expectation able borrow tomorrow either compensate reduction income need spend, household firm may increase precautionary savings. finally, fall house price redistribute wealth. those already house expect trade future realise capital gain, bad off. on side, hop trade yet house ladder good (although tight constraint lend may mean save big deposit enter market). the former tend reduce consumption; latter tend 4 bi review 114/2008 opposite. in perfect market two effect might balance out. but give beneficiary house price fall yet independent incomes, others long period ahead consume additional wealth, balance i would expect net effect consumption negative. more widely i would expect impact end wide perception house cake eat – return house investment time substantially offset cost house service. all feedback channel work economics good identify nature forecast scale. there alternative review indicator i mention month month make inform judgment. some policy lesson medium term we identify mispricing risk, particularly credit market financial stability report last two years. but reckon severe destabilise anyone anticipated. risk premia become compress leverage throughout financial market rise high. the pendulum swing back vengeance. a fsr note early year, risk premia appear overshoot market contribute slowdown real economy. could policymakers take early action correct imbalances? of course take decision basis available data time. but hindsight, see across world whole, case somewhat tight monetary policy prevent demand resource outstrip supply (although i would note interest rate consistently high recent year elsewhere advance economies). the rise oil food price appear external pressure country external u collectively. a particular problem – yet resolve – expansion dollar bloc. the emerge economy import loose monetary policy, scarcely seem appropriate domestic conditions. however hard believe somewhat tight monetary policy would guarantee head credit boom subsequent crunch altogether. put another way, monetary policy blunt instrument. to prevent excess financial markets, might generate unnecessary slowdown real economy. i share view therefore look new regulatory measure complement interest rates. there number specific lesson regulation already identified. the fsa, example, already strengthen prudential supervision. and internationally, need fill gap current framework – example mortgage origination us, increase capital requirement credit product loan commitments, ensure investor rat agency ass new product diligently. in uk also set proposal reform legal framework deal fail banks. through financial stability forum also need strengthen supervisory college cross-border crisis management arrangements. one general lesson recognise difference good risk management single company good system whole. for company ideal risk management system one enable take risks, reap reward get first music stops. and right capital liquidity one enough see subsequent downturn asset price transactions. but always someone end queue impossible sure be. moreover global market problem one institution bind spread quickly others along complex web interconnection many markets. for authority matter whether loss slow player damage system whole. one lesson recent event capital liquidity buff need bi review 114/2008 5 high everyone. the long decline hold liquid asset (chart 8) bank example reverse bite increase leverage likewise (chart 9). in financial stability forum, lead international regulatory response crisis, also look scope “macro prudential” instrument dampen destabilise procyclicality financial markets. to need simply raise minimum level capital liquidity regulators, rat agencies, market require. we need create reserve base macroeconomic factors, draw cycle turn replenish upswing profit high. the system dynamic provision spain seem work effectively respect may well offer guide way forward. conclusion to conclude, monetary policy, one instrument, one goal – ensure inflation stabilise target medium-term. while must remain vigilant sign inflation expectation drift upwards, news front encouraging. on side, risk must careful underestimate deflationary consequence credit crisis. at moment focus risk slowdown real economy amplify contraction banks’ balance sheets. but also set place long term measure prevent financial imbalance build next upswing. in view case macro-prudential policy alongside monetary policy compelling. chart 1: commodity price chart 2: cpi inflation 050100150200250300jan 07apr 07jul 07oct 07jan 08apr 08jul 08brent oil pricewholesale gas priceeconomist

interview dr mugur isărescu, governor national bank romania, mediafax news agency, bucharest, 8 september 2008. * * * mr. governor, foreign analyst place romania along four state – lithuania, latvia, estonia bulgaria – group country head hard landing. in fact economy estonia latvia contract sharply, growth plunge level around 10 percent negative territory; inflation reach two-digit level external deficit exceed 15 percent gross domestic product. be possible romania witness similar negative growth dynamics? be fair include romania group? read foreign analyst said, i hardly find solid rationale would justify romania's place within hard-landing risk zone. on contrary. turn comments, i underline similarity among country group: gdp per caput eu average, register high growth rate catching-up process. however, also fundamental differences, among important view monetary policy mechanism. three four country mention group currency board place, fourth, i.e. latvia, mechanism close currency board. of course, currency board clear benefits. let u remember that, example, bulgaria inflation rate top 1,000 percent economy shambles. the introduction currency board solution which, unavoidable social costs, bring bulgarian economy afloat, inflation fall steeply stay close eu level good couple years. but currency board limit constraints. the bnr constantly oppose adoption system romania give limit constraints. actually, country adopt currency board deprive monetary policy thus central bank become sort institute statistics. instead two-pedal vehicle – monetary fiscal policy – economy currency board country one pedal left, namely fiscal policy. assume risk extend comment, let u look happen four country happen romania past year rather unusual international context, euro appreciate simultaneously increase farm product energy prices. the appreciation euro trigger slide output competitiveness country exchange rate peg euro rise global price boost domestic inflation. currency board country could change neither exchange rate, interest rate link euro area levels, currently stand 4.25 percent year. therefore, inflation run 16-20 percent baltic states, interest rate become strongly negative real term monetary policy procyclical, boost consumption, fix exchange rate discourage production. basically, main weakness currency board, namely inability respond exogenous adverse factors, push economy country towards hard landing. let's look picture romania. our exchange rate regime, feature flexible exchange rate manage float system, allow market correct overappreciation leu register certain point via mechanisms, bnr able raise interest rate – seven time already past 10 month – order permanently keep real-positive territory curb inflation trigger external factor affect country mention before. the bnr even move forward order slow consumption maintain healthy portfolio commercial bank via recent prudential measure bi review 113/2008 1 regard loan households. all significantly contain risk hard land romanian economy, even risk still linger long gap current account deficit finance via fdi remain significant. nevertheless, foreign analyst include romania group five country expose hard land substantiate opinion. be completely wrong? let u make assessment. one reason bring forward romania's fiscal policy procyclical. well, although election year, reason believe 2008 budget deficit stay 3 percent. moreover, central bank additionally tighten monetary policy order offset insufficient restrictiveness fiscal policy. another reason income policy much expansionary, concern bnr. we send repeat warn respect, possible offset via tighten monetary policy could prove ineffective, also counterproductive, lead deterioration external competitiveness. re-establishing long-term balance income growth productivity dynamic therefore must. finally, i saw paper romania would downgrade external liquidity position. this indicator compute ratio country's international reserve overall foreign debt, public private, short-run. we sub-par ratio romania, short-term external debt high reserves. i believe also overstatement, romania's international reserve close upper limit optimal level take account indicators, ratio reserve imports. the short-term external debt high indeed, bulk belong private sector. and this, loan take foreign-based bank operate romania parent undertake abroad account large share. we start address issue take measure aim discourage foreign currency-denominated loans. if risk materialise parent bank diminish flow romania, effect would rather beneficial would remove base unsustainable expansion foreign currency-denominated credit headache many years. therefore, i consider argument solid place romania group country high likelihood witness hard landing. do think, therefore, high economic growth romania go on? i believe romania see economic growth come years. a growth much close potential expert estimate around 6 percent annually. it true that, weaken economic activity worldwide, especially eu main trade partner, economic growth might bite slow 6 percent. no doubt economic growth affect several factor next year, place 6 percent: oil price, farm year, heighten effort develop infrastructure also create condition boost labour productivity, level foreign investments, on. in case, 6 percent annual economic growth present context remarkable achievement. that would prevent analyst say that, gdp growth slow 6 9 percent, growth rate plunge 33 percent. an 8-9 percent growth mean overheating? what opinion? i never venture say one figure alone would mean economy overheated. i usually present thing nuanced manner, like reality. what 2 bi review 113/2008 overheat actually mean? a development substantially exceed growth potential, lead overheat output factors, especially chronic lack labour force fast increase wage prices. for year, i believe need sectoral approach. on one hand, significant rise farm output due mainly natural factors. and overheat there. on contrary, price agricultural product fall production factor – especially land, also labour force – obviously under-exploited. romania's great farm potential yet turn account. on hand, construction, another major contributor year's growth, visible sign overheating: scarce labour force, substantial increase price build materials, high wages, etc. of course, wise policy stimulate sector potential fully exploit (such agriculture) bottlenecks, case road infrastructure romania. however, numerous opinion accord rat agency could downgrade romania. which would main risk factor could lead downgrade? so far, rat agency change outlook, rating. to answer question – although i believe romania downgrade "investment grade" – main risk factor remain current account deficit. we implement tight monetary policy tackle issue. i believe end year see containment indicator 2007 figure 14 percent gdp compare analysts' expectation 15-16 percent. this positive thing start stop here. romania need policy would allow gradual predictable reduction current account deficit level almost entirely cover direct capital investment regain confidence rat agency ensure improvement external creditworthiness. we thus force implement gradual correction deficit, even percentage point next two three years, desirable happen context sustainable economic growth, close potential, consolidate disinflation resume autumn quarter considerable efforts. in respect, bnr opinion repeatedly express public, namely correction make via balance mix monetary, fiscal income policies, couple fast structural reform would lead high productivity. what would effect downgrade romania? let stress again, i believe downgrade. a i already mentioned, may see change outlook. if downgrade, consequence would rather serious. it would primarily reflect mark increase external finance costs, also deter fdis, would limit country's rapid growth potential. why think rat agency cautious romania countries? it may insufficient clarity regard real economic financial situation romania, may derive also inconsistent signal sometimes come inside country. thank much, mr. governor. bi review 113/2008

deutsche bundesbank, 5th bundesbank lecture, berlin-brandenburgische akademie d wissenschaften, berlin, 16 september 2008. * * * lady gentleman i please welcome year’s bundesbank lecture beautiful location heart berlin. i particularly grateful mr mario draghi, governor bank italy, speaker today. mario, special welcome thank lot hesitate one moment accept invitation lecturer event. it honour here. let briefly say word regard event speaker today. on event: the bundesbank lecture series aim achieve two things. first, intend provide high-level forum public debate economic monetary policy issues. second, want raise bundesbank’s profile german capital. with today’s gathering, lecture series, start 2004, celebrate fifth anniversary. alan greenspan, jean-claude trichet, tommaso padoa-schioppa, ben bernanke share think u previous lectures. we proud mario draghi speaker. the title speech “restoring stability financial system”. he distinguish expert financial stability issues. a current chairman financial stability forum focal position discus necessary measure restore financial stability. obviously, topic speech could topical give current development financial markets. the financial market crisis – alongside rise inflationary pressure – dominant topic year now. one prophet forecast likely stay u month ahead, too. of course, i want anticipate mario’s remarks, let say word current developments. the file chapter 11 bankruptcy petition lehman brother hold inc. sale merrill lynch bank america certainly increase uncertainty risk aversion financial markets. we observe flight quality behaviour investor rise spread credit markets. this expected. all all, however, market participant overreact remain cool-headed. this positive sign. central banks, include eurosystem, react decisively situation liquidity provision measures. german bank report liquidity problems. the german financial system stable past year resilience adverse shock markedly improved. moreover, universal bank model – characteristic feature german financial system – prove robustness stability. these structural achievement help cushion current tension due high perceive counterparty risk necessary unwind position market credit risk transfer – unavoidable outcome face insolvency one major market participants. the financial turbulence create challenge situation financial intermediaries, central banks, supervisory agencies, regulatory body decades. and since cause crisis deeply rooted, comprehensive coordinate response international level evidently warranted. bi review 112/2008 1 in context, financial stability forum – fsf – particular play crucial role process mitigate ongoing difficulty make financial system resilient future shocks. the fsf establish 1999, follow report bundesbank president, han tietmeyer. the fsf bring together senior representative national financial authority (for example, central banks, supervisory authority treasury departments), international financial institution (such imf bis), international regulatory supervisory group (for example, basel committee bank supervision, international account standard board), committee central bank expert (such committee global financial system) european central bank. the fsf’s mandate ass vulnerability affect international financial system, identify oversee action need address these, improve coordination information exchange among various authority responsible financial stability. in so, fsf aim promote international financial stability, improve function financial markets, reduce tendency financial shock spread country country, thus destabilise world economy. the fsf seek give momentum broad-based multilateral agenda strengthen financial system stability international financial markets. the necessary change enact relevant national international financial authorities. in nutshell, fsf act central hub issue relevant global financial stability perspective. on speaker: mario draghi, governor banca d’italia, chair fsf personal capacity since april 2006. this position – together economic international expertise gain career – make excellent speaker current times, give backdrop financial market turbulence. mario draghi graduate university rome, receive ph.d. economics massachusetts institute technology, subsequently serve professor economics university florence 1981 1991. prior take helm banca d’italia, vice-chairman manage director goldman sachs member firm-wide management committee (2002-2005). he director general italian treasury (1991-2001), chairman european economic financial committee, member g7 deputies, chairman oecd work party 3. finally, 1984 1990, executive director world bank. a week ago, annual central bankers’ meet jackson hole, mario deliver speech entitle “the current crisis beyond”. in speech, point three element mark cornerstone work plan fsf month ahead. more precisely, talk need look closely incentive appropriate risk control frameworks, effort improve resilience financial system shock framework dampen cyclicality risk-taking. not pleasure listen him, i also fully endorse proposal made. the title speech today “restoring stability financial system”, topic evidently highly relevant interest us. mario, i look forward insight fifth bundesbank lecture. the floor yours. 2 bi review 112/2008 amando m tetangco, jr: the philippine – address challenges. stay course speech mr amando m tetangco, jr, governor central bank philippine (bangko sentral ng pilipinas), philippine economic briefing, makati city, 17 september 2008. * * * good morning. thank join u mid-year economic briefing. i please speak development monetary, external bank sectors. after provide overview recent economic developments, i discus outlook next two year take account challenge economy facing. then, i walk bsp respond challenges. i close bsp’s policy thrust go forward. let start late price developments. inflation average 8.8 percent first 8 month year, rise 12.5 percent august 4.9 percent january 2008. core inflation, measure underlie trend inflation exclude specific food energy prices, climb 7.0 percent year-on-year august, 3.4 percent january. price pressure build since early year. initially price increase due supply-side factors, specifically elevate international oil non-oil commodity prices. however, second round price pressure subsequently become apparent, evident rise core inflation adjustment price service well wages. these result challenge inflation environment. meanwhile, country’s external payment profile remain major source strength economy. the bop remain surplus first eight month 2008 us$2.0 billion. remittance overseas filipino continue boost bop, reach us$9.6 billion first seven month 2008, high 18.2 percent relative year-ago level. the sustain bop surplus result continue build-up country’s gross international reserve (gir), stand us$36.7 billion end-august 2008. at level, gir equivalent 6.0 months’ worth import cover, 2.9 time country’s short-term external debt base residual maturity. the strong external position allow public private sector prepay fx obligations, result improvement country’s external debt ratio. a end march 2008, external debt ratio stand 35.6 percent, le half level 2001 72.9 percent. the peso weaken recent months. on year-to-date basis, peso depreciate u dollar 12.3 percent close p47.09/us$1 15 september 2008. this account rise risk aversion due worry global economic slowdown credit tightening. concern rise inflation add pressure peso. for period 2001-2008 (to-date), peso appreciate 9.1 percent, generally tandem currency region. the philippine peso generally competitive major trade partner competitor real terms. if take 2001-2002 comparator period give good gdp inflation numbers, couple manageable external payment position, end point remain broadly level. bi review 112/2008 1 on financial sector, bank system remain generally sound stable. the bank system’s asset base expand steadily. the continue asset clean-up banks, accomplish without use public funds, enhance asset quality, bring npl ratio close pre-asian crisis level around 4.0 percent. bank remain capitalize level bsp-regulatory requirement bi standard. owe reform early instituted, philippine bank system significantly affect financial stress experience u subprime mortgage market. furthermore, philippine domestic banks’ exposure structure products, clns cdos, issue investment house like lehman brother limit well cushion banks’ capital base. however, continue closely monitor development global financial markets, include risk aversion emerge market include philippines, may adversely impact growth bank sector. where heading? the inflation path expect hump-shaped, peak around sept/oct year, expect gradual level off. we expect see single-digit level late q1/early q2 next year. nevertheless, forecast still indicate inflation could exceed 2008 2009 targets. the bop surplus end 2008 estimate around us$2.0 billion. this would result gir level us$37 billion end 2008. what challenge face try achieve projections? the philippine – like many emerge country – face challenge rise inflation slow economic growth. the slowdown u global growth could result deceleration philippine export growth decline foreign investments. while global commodity price start show easing, world oil price expect remain volatile due low global production capacity rise demand emerge economies. non-oil commodity price may take long unwind strong demand grow consumption emerge country input biofuel production. the risk high inflation remain present. meanwhile, strain global financial market continue persist heighten risk aversion. while emerge markets, include philippines, fairly resilient global credit turmoil, could face great risk high borrow cost reversal capital flow how bsp address these? consistent primary mandate, respond policy appropriately aim sustain price stability. we believe essential ensure sustain long-term economic growth. a i mention earlier, bsp note spike price early 2008 supply-side origin. these mainly global root expect largely transitory. a well accepted, supply-side shock best address non-monetary measures. acknowledge impact monetary policy scenario would limited, bsp follow prudent approach accommodate first-round effects. in words, bsp treat result rise price shift relative prices, allow go through. thus, bsp keep policy set steady march april meetings. subsequently, however, note change inflation dynamics. first, inflation expectation rising. more specifically, consumer business expectation survey begin show respondent expect headline inflation go come months. bsp’s survey private sector economists/analysts show high inflation forecast 2008 2009. moreover, term spread secondary market yield government security rise, reflect market sentiment continue rise future. second, real interest rate continue negative territory. this would pose complication make decision savings, investment production, time could weigh capital flows, exchange rate ultimately, inflation. 2 bi review 112/2008 give new information, bsp respond combination policy rate hike careful communication bsp’s inflation-fighting resolve. during policy meet june, july august, bsp gradually raise policy rate 5 percent 6 percent. the cumulative 100 basis point hike recognition necessary act promptly preemptively to: 1) address price pressure come evidently second-round effects; 2) guide inflationary expectations, arrest self-perpetration high actual inflation; 3) rein inflation allow fall within target range policy horizon. late indicator show inflation lose speed risk remain. global commodity price start show easing. however, still need remain cautious give inherent volatility commodity prices. the bsp remain confident current monetary policy stance could accommodate resilient demand conditions. the buoyancy domestic demand suggest room measure interest rate action without cause serious effect real sector. meanwhile, continue institute reform strengthen bank system deepen domestic capital market. these reform focus enhance regulatory framework continue implementation basel ii framework; accelerate implementation risk-based supervision; improve corporate governance, include promote compliance international account financial report standards; continue promote microfinance lend improve small businesses’ access credit; support deepen domestic capital market. what expect bsp go forward? the policy thrust bsp aim ensure headway achieve nurture resilient economy sound bank sector continue even face challenge face. first, monetary policy continue sufficiently cautious vigilant emerge balance risks. it continually reassess evolve situation price pressure show initial sign slow demand condition moderate. this ensure responsive conduct appropriate monetary policy. in external sector, policy continue direct maintain market-determined exchange rate scope occasional official action address sharp volatility exchange rate; maintain comfortable level reserve self-insurance; ensure sustainability external debt. these policy continue promote strong fundamental help reduce economy’s vulnerability global economic risk support need dynamic globally integrate economy. in financial sector, remain firmly commit sustain key reform lead great efficiency, effective risk management, strong capital base improve corporate governance standard bank system. these financial bank sector reform continue raise save help boost finance productive activities. in summary, let assure bsp prepare take necessary action address threat high inflation promote price stability. we stress high inflation erode community’s purchase power, reduce consumption expenditure slow economic growth. we therefore mindful impact monetary policy action economy’s growth momentum. the resiliency economy allow u great flexibility respond challenge come way. thank much. bi review 112/2008 3 paul tucker: money credit, twelve month speech mr paul tucker, executive director member monetary policy committee bank england, money, macro finance research group 40th annual conference, birkbeck college, london, 12 september 2008. * * * a many people said, challenge time policymakers. but real challenge household firm real world navigate fallout extraordinary combination financial commodity shock ripple world economy. our job policymakers make process smooth medium term. and eye medium term mean must ensure gain past ten-to-fifteen year stabilise inflation fritter away. in confront task, policymakers make big picture judgment balance force buffet uk economy; apply area economic theory stretch frontier exist research. so, join research conference morning, i want sketch, broadly, current conjuncture suggests, policymaker’s perspective, feature future research agenda monetary economists. the current conjuncture, policy by way establish context, i begin bank england’s recent economic forecast. in august, monetary policy committee publish late projection output growth inflation. on profile market interest rates, committee whole1 judge that, likely, output growth would slow quite sharply current year would anaemic period thereafter. crucially, balance risk likely (or modal) outlook judge downside. in words, mean forecast output somewhat weak still. for inflation, meanwhile, likely outlook that, uncomfortably high protract spike, would fall back little 2% target end two years, would continue drift thereafter. in words, crucial judgment accumulation persistence slack economy would likely enough avoid inflation get control. that part august projection capture attention market commentators. but, collectively, also conclude balance risk inflation outlook upside, mean inflation actually 2% target around two year so. that’s without significance give analytical model suggest policymakers set policy light mean, mode – although good description mpc’s approach would say take account nature entire distribution risks.2 1 see tucker, pmwt, 2008 “making monetary policy committee” bank england quarterly bulletin 2008 q3 (forthcoming) think relatively collective nature mpc’s forecast give one person, one vote decision bank rate. 2 i say textbook stress mean (or expect value) might somewhat overdo circumstances, particular mean materially influence certain type low probability/high impact risks. i hope follow illustrate that. imagine, current context, risk dollar collapse euro, currency uk’s large trade partner, without similar risk sterling collapsing. say probability judge low, impact large; that, probability-weighted way, enough shift mean outlook future inflation. if (if) risk crystallised, bi review 112/2008 1 now, put together, follow inference drawn; i hope i shall excuse i plod slow motion. focus roughly two-year horizon, inflation likely target context august modal forecast output, would even target mpc’s view august downside risk growth materialise (ie consistent mean path output adverse shock costs). but, fact, mean path inflation target around two years. that underline hefty upside risk inflation feature committee’s august projections. indeed, cannot remotely complacent risk either direction. this delicate balance, one develop month month. it convenient way mislead shorthand characterise committee currently balance growth risk inflation risk. give mandate – and, indeed, give economy work – good think balance downside risk inflation medium-term upside risk inflation medium-term. so, perhaps contrary recent commentary, mpc remain focus medium-term inflation ever. no shift underlie reaction function. no shift aversion inflation (or deflation). but, course, current environment highly unusual reaction function cannot write fully specify state-contingent rule; everyone discover truly commit low inflation medium term. the mandate express term stable low inflation central bank deliver medium term, nominal stability precondition sustainable growth. there comfortable medium-term trade growth inflation. inflation opposite free lunch. if interest sustain growth short run, risk let inflation become establish high levels, thing could easily get control high medium-term inflation expectation would become embedded. we would find much hard bring inflation back target, could well end generate serious recession put genie back bottle. the experience thirty year current regime demonstrate economic social cost – households, livelihood business – entails. the mpc’s inflation target mandate expression lesson – tragically million people, give chance get stick unemployment – uk policymakers learn. we’re give mandate. success anchor inflation expectation line target give u scope time cushion economy adverse shock growth – course would want can, consistent medium-term stability. what does, course, shift month pas assessment, nine individuals, balance risk inflation, give change economic environment. and quite lot happen since august forecast. in six week since committee’s august report finalised, sign weaken uk’s major trade partner, euro area, intensified. growth appear slow part asia too. and us, house market yet obviously stabilised, probably precondition broad recovery there. domestically, output data soft side, move line battery survey bank’s regional agents. the labour market also appear softened, unemployment rise few vacancy advertised. it perhaps surprise that, compare recent slowdowns, le hoard labour firm expect adverse environment persist while; tight credit conditions, stretch export-oriented euro area would adversely affected, uk it. but, seriously, uk cut policy rate head risk dent output dollar collapse hadn’t yet occurred? i don’t think so. 2 bi review 112/2008 work capital, make hard firm finance retention less-than-fully-occupied labour force. in manufacture sector, input output price inflation edge slightly. in service sector, data le timely, though survey start indicate slow pace inflation. commodity price – energy, food – continue fall, perhaps reflect effect global demand early price rise reduction subsidy raft emerging-market countries. equity fall around 3%. but sterling’s exchange rate fall – around 4% since mpc’s august meeting; 15% since begin 2007, that, sterling terms, fall oil price le pronounce past month so. on balance, development mostly comprise downside news, since august inflation report, outlook demand inflation. but recent depreciation exchange rate offset that. and headline inflation reach 4.4%. it probably rise further. the committee ensure temporary state affairs. but, moment, inflation expectation continue flash amber light. meanwhile, credit remain tight, underlie money growth decelerated, imply monetary condition may lean incipient inflationary pressures. at end last year – months’ onset market turmoil – i set think guide interpretation monetary data relate policy decisions.3 i stress “we must try avoid vicious circle tight liquidity conditions, low asset values, impair capital resources, reduce credit supply, slow aggregate demand fee back other”. a vicious circle world financial system global economy far probably keep bay; global growth slow collapsed. but deny adverse feedback loop tighten credit conditions, macro slowdown, perception time impair banks’ asset portfolios. so seem timely revisit issue “money credit”. the taylor-rule framework think policy it well decade since john taylor set become part current orthodoxy monetary economics. his rule look something like this: = πt +r*t+ a(πt – π*t ) +b(yt-y*t ) this is, roots, wicksellian view world.4 by fix short-run nominal rate, central bank can, give stickiness price short run, shift short real interest rate – absolute term and, particularly, relative short-run real rate would equilibriate demand supply.5 so gap short real rate “equilibrium” think represent stance monetary policy, choose central bank light extent inflation deviate target, aggregate demand deviate supply capacity economy. implicit rule 3 see tucker, pmwt (2008) “ money credit: bank macroeconomy”, bank england quarterly bulletin, 2008 q1 pp 96-106. 4 see wicksell, k, 1898, “interest rate prices”. 5 typically, policymakers think term “output gap”, reflect firms’ capacity utilisation slack/pressure labour market. by contrast, academic literature – notably michael woodford’s interest price – benchmark set monetary policy order offset friction economy, obtain condition would prevail prices, wage etc fully flexible. policymakers academic need resolve big gap two approaches. bi review 112/2008 3 textbook policymaker know degree slack real economy act future inflation (or slope phillips curve). the two force sweep world economy test way policymakers typically apply various element set routine circumstances. for example, commodity price rise and, separately, credit crunch affect “equilibrium” short-term real rate? be actual short real rate still adequate proxy measure monetary conditions? be “normal” relationship economic slack future inflation intact? the cost shocks, monetary condition although fall nearly $50 since peak reach july, oil price still 200% since middle 2003; and, indeed, around 3% since begin year. a oil key input production, act like negative supply shock western economies: cost firm produce level output run oil prices. and, like tax, act redistribute spend power energy consumer energy producers. in circumstances, real-take home pay grow slowly order avoid capital stock shrink firm seek maintain internationally-determined require rate return. the role monetary policy facilitate process, recognise potential redundancy capital resource give high energy prices, upward pressure real interest rate household seek borrow tide tough times. in words, standard set up, take cost shock own, equilibrate short-term real rate (r star) rise economy’s potential supply (y star) probably fallen. so, ignore developments, policy would tight otherwise, even direct effect cost rise price level accommodated. but, course, thing go on, net effect policy rate matters. and involve make judgment tightness credit conditions. the credit shock monetary condition in conduct policy, commentator usually take short-run nominal interest rate, bank rate, summary measure monetary conditions. if bank rate increased, monetary condition tightened; condition loosen bank rate cut. there important simplify assumption make – assumption whose validity current circumstance doubtful. in first place, view world implicitly assume equilibrium real rate stable time, whereas fact move about.6 sometimes central bank need change policy rate simply order maintain unchanged monetary condition (as proxied literature r minus r star). in vein, near-term inflation expectation rise fall, nominal policy rate may need change leave actual short real rate unchanged. in words, fix one thing – short nominal rate – particular level bank rate mean monetary condition depend short-run inflation expectation equilibrium real rate need balance economy. both likely change materially face cost credit shocks. what bank rate mean monetary condition depend relate panoply interest rate financial contracts. in fully efficient markets, risk-free 6 see neiss, k nelson, e (2001) “the real interest rate inflation indicator”, bank england work paper no 130. 4 bi review 112/2008 rate fully satisfactory summary statistic; rate fall line arbitrage, difference reflect risk premia. more practically, typically assume rate charge private sector loan maintain fairly stable spread relative risk-free yield curve (ie give expect path policy rate). and, relate that, also typically assume degree credit ration economy broadly constant time. obviously, neither thing true present. the unusual, stretched, circumstance lie within global financial system itself. the premium unsecured interbank lend rise (chart 1); growth lend slowed. this reflect desire hoard liquidity hazardous environment; heighten aversion take unsecured credit exposure term maturities. bank are, consequence, deleveraging7 balance sheets. broadly, two way – raise extra capital, shrink (the pace growth in) balance sheets. both underway. the balance sheet shrinkage reduce supply credit household firms. but differentiation across bank industry, accord size strength. in environment, spread corporate bond higher. many corporate household lend rate affect rise libor relative risk-free rates. and retail rate – loans, deposit – rise relative relevant risk-free rate. effective rate type lend much change since last summer, cut bank rate 75bp risk-free curve shift (chart 2). all true u too, probably so. that lead john taylor suggest8 that, maintain unchanged policy stance, policy rate reduce extent widen spreads. in fact, i sure taylor recognises, nowhere near straightforward – reason that, real economy, severe feature credit shock rise incidence quantity rationing.9there appear discrimination lower-risk higher-risk borrower household sector. rate fixed-rate mortgage recently cut low loan-to-value borrowers. we add question current credit condition survey, due late month, gauge condition part market. plainly, condition tighten lot risky borrower – household firms. that mean need look quantity data well price credit. for companies, money growth fall sharply. lend hold while, possibly part firm draw commit line credit still available pre-turmoil terms. the credit condition survey signal clear tighten (chart 3). to translate back taylor-rule world, would need know so-called “shadow prices”. of course don’t know unobservable prices. but can, perhaps, get broadbrush handle materiality tighten use estimate equation credit (and money) demand, hold influence constant.10 there huge uncertainty 7 see tucker, pmwt (2008), “the credit crisis: lesson protract peacetime”, remark give chatham house conference “the new financial frontiers”. these remark also forthcoming 2008 q3 edition bank england quarterly bulletin. 8 see taylor, jb., (2008) “monetary policy state economy”, testimony committee financial services, u house representatives, february mculley, p touli, r (2008) “chasing neutral rate down: financial conditions, monetary policy, taylor rule”, global central bank focus, pimco. 9 another reason reflect curdia woodford (2008) paper fact borrower saver different propensity consume. consequently change spread affect “average rate” face borrower saver different way change policy rate. 10 based, example, brigden, a mizen, p (1999) “ money, credit investment uk corporate sector”, bank england work paper number 100. bi review 112/2008 5 estimate but, it’s worth, indicate material tighten source. alternatively, think equivalent fall real risk-free rate interest would equilibriate supply demand.11 take own, rather lean proposition, advance number commentators, monetary condition loose grind deduct cpi inflation 4 5% bank rate 5% leaf “real rate” close zero. first, i arguing, vital take account possibility real rate warrant current conjuncture fallen. second, headline cpi might best deflator calculate relevant real rate interest. cpi may necessarily price – “own real rate” – relevant individual households’ businesses’ spend decisions.12 for example, firms’ investment might dependent price capital goods. despite pickup oil prices, pace inflation capital good much low cpi. so might suggest correspondingly high real rate business one base cpi (chart 4). a similar question could pose real rate face households, give cpi currently exclude cost owner occupation. so one safely conclude straightforward present calibrate monetary conditions. for researchers, underline importance renew work direct gauge monetary conditions. a recent paper michael woodford13 conclude information money credit quantity could add anything spreads; and, more, useful spread quantity effect tighten become apparent lags. the set woodford’s paper not,

whatever incorporate forecast models, policymakers cannot sensibly take grant expectation anchored, inflation painlessly come back line target whenever drive away temporary cost shocks. what mean right arrest upside risk inflation cannot rely entirely real-economy interactions. so diagnostics get nominal trends, right now? on whole, signal imminent resurgence inflationary psychology. nominal

110/2008 1 lucas papademos: china european union – global economic challenge policy response speech mr lucas papademos, vice-president european central bank, hamburg summit: “china meet europe”, hamburg, 11 september 2008. * * * i. introduction dear lord mayor von beust, excellencies, lady gentlemen, it privilege pleasure hamburg today address distinguish audience important topical policy issue concern rapidly grow economic relation china europe. the free hanseatic city hamburg provide ideal stage address issues. hamburg’s history great port trade metropolis bear testimony openness commerce exchange generate growth prosperity. still today, hamburg second-largest port europe, rank ninth world. it thus surprise china hamburg’s important fast grow trade partner, account one third total shipments. hamburg is, therefore, one vital point europe meet china. today, i would like discus economic relation european union china context major policy challenge face economy environment increase global interdependence. i examine, particular, role economic reform monetary policy address challenge stem mark slowdown global economic growth persistently high inflation, ass effect china-eu economic relationship. let start brief review key feature bilateral trade eu china relate policy issues. ii. the trade dimension china-eu economic relationship trade 27 member european union china expand impressive pace, especially since china join world trade organisation (wto) end 2001. china indeed become second large trade partner eu since 2005, rank fourth 1999. from china’s perspective, relative importance eu total trade grow even impressively: eu first trade partner china, overtake unite state japan since 2005. increase trade china clearly imply major benefit europe. our economy benefited, least certain period time, favourable impact inflation result various channel low cost import manufacture intermediate goods. moreover, increase competition provide stimulus introduction structural reform enhance efficiency flexibility european economy. so, european occasionally express concern expand trade and, generally, economic tie eu china? i think many bad good reasons. the main reason, view, europe yet reap full potential benefit free trade owe certain “asymmetries” characterise eu-china trade relationship. let first illustrate figures. while china eu’s main import partner, fourth large export partner. in 2007, value eu import china 231 billion euro, almost four time high import japan. the eu’s export china amount almost 72 billion euro, is, le one third import china. the eu currently export switzerland, country 7.5 million inhabitants, china! a result asymmetry, eu’s trade deficit china 160 billion euro 2007, account 86% eu total trade bi review 110/2008 1 deficit. to put differently, total trade deficit eu 186 billion euro much reflect sizeable imbalance european-chinese trade. there several explanation eu-china trade imbalance. a significant part is, course, natural outcome market forces. for instance, large chinese trade surplus textile it sector explain china’s competitive advantage specialisation labour-intensive production. in addition, due increase role “assembling hub”, china become export platform asia, mean several good previously export directly asian country export china. at time, europe comparative advantage production high value-added goods, pharmaceutical machinery, observe significant surplus trade products. why europe export product comparative advantage china? and, generally, factor explain observe asymmetry eu-china economic relationship? one possible explanation european firm able successfully export high-tech good china due difficulty access domestic market. accord european commission, non-tariff barrier china indeed estimate result loss european export estimate 20 billion euro, 30% total trade.1 another likely reason relate exchange rate euro chinese renminbi. while bilateral exchange rate one factor affect grow trade deficit, difficult argue negligible impact year 2002-07: period, chinese trade surplus euro area almost triple chinese renminbi depreciate vis-à-vis euro cumulative 30%. in 2008, however, renminbi far appreciate euro 9.4%, welcome development balance trade relationship. iii. global economic challenges, structural reform monetary policy response more generally, observe “asymmetries” characterise eu-china economic relationship reflect large extent difference structure function market two area well difference economic monetary policy pursued. the latter partly consequence difference domestic economic circumstance difference policy response global economic challenges. at present juncture, china europe face three main common challenges, albeit vary degrees: first, mark slowdown global economy deteriorate economic outlook; second, persistently high inflation prolong period time, result past increase oil food price well rise underlie domestic inflationary pressures; and, third, continue tension global financial market intensify recent months. the magnitude nature economic challenge face domestically vary across country economic areas. in advance industrial economies, include euro area economy, deceleration economic growth turn mark abrupt previously expected. at time, pace economic activity many emerge market economy far remain relatively strong, although moderating. nevertheless, weaken economic activity advance industrial economy progressively spill-over effects, trade financial markets, emerge market economies. the hypothesis decouple growth performance advance emerge economy increasingly test across globe. the 1 see european commission (2007), “future opportunity challenge eu-china trade investment relation 2006-2010”. 2 bi review 110/2008 notable exception china continue experience robust growth, moderately low growth 11.5% record 2007. to address multiple challenges, policy instrument must use effective consistent way. effectiveness require choose appropriate policy instrument materially contribute achievement objective sustain manner. consistency require use available instrument way mutually reinforcing. the effective consistent use policy instrument produce outcome durable overall positive impact economic performance. let elaborate proposition examine appropriate policy response global economic challenge face euro area china, assess effect eu-china economic relationship. policy response euro area in euro area, although slowdown economy mainly consequence impact significant past increase oil commodity price direct indirect effect ongoing financial turmoil, growth performance economy medium long run fundamentally depend implementation reform raise trend productivity growth, increase investment innovation education, raise utilisation labour, enhance flexibility adaptability labour markets. such reform simultaneously contribute moderation unit labour cost growth efficient response product labour market adverse shock buffet european economies. a result, adjustment economy facilitate shock-absorption capacity strengthened. moreover, international competitiveness euro area increase help reduce asymmetry characterise china-eu relationship. the question raise whether reform implement period heighten uncertainty reduce consumer confidence. my answer properly designed, adequately explain effectively introduced, reform also help boost confidence performance prospect euro area economy, particularly member state experience substantial cumulative erosion competitiveness past years. fiscal policy euro area play stabilise role current slowdown automatically, tax system incorporate strong income-stabilising mechanism case advance industrial economies. at time, budgetary policy 2009 beyond reflect fully respect exist policy commitments. the implementation fiscal policy aim sound fiscal position medium-term contribute contain inflationary pressure enhance function automatic stabiliser mitigate impact shock economic cycle. what role ecb address unfavourable combination persistently high inflation, weaken economic growth continue tension financial markets? the objective single european monetary policy unambiguously clear. the override goal, accordance mandate, preserve price stability medium term. the stance monetary policy must ensure high inflation experience prolong period time get embed medium longer-term inflation expectations, keep firmly anchor price stability. broad-based second-round effect high energy commodity price price wage-setting avoided. in order address upside risk price stability, govern council raise key ecb interest rate 25 basis point early july. we believe current monetary policy stance contribute achieve objective. we continue monitor closely development period ahead necessary preserve price stability euro area medium term. bi review 110/2008 3 at time, ecb continue manage liquidity interbank money market order ensure short-term money market rate remain close ecb’s main policy rate, require efficient implementation monetary policy, alleviate persist pressure term money markets, mitigate impact financial turmoil bank system broad economy. over past year, ecb money market operation effectively contribute contain risk euro area’s financial stability without change stance monetary policy – define key ecb interest rate – remain firmly gear towards price stability objective. moreover, although ecb supply large amount liquidity bank system offset contain impact disturbance money market, injection additional liquidity temporary. a result, overall amount bank reserve – central bank money– economy augmented, intertemporal allocation maturity structure central bank fund provide affected. last week, announce certain change operational risk framework (collateral framework) eurosystem’s money market operations. these change alter key element framework – affect range eligible counterparties range eligible collateral – refine framework’s feature good contain certain potential risk light change financial market development practices. the change introduced, effective 1 february 2009, aim strike balance preserve stabilise feature collateral framework mitigate risk could face eurosystem environment protract financial market tensions. policy response china let turn china focus two policy issue particularly relevant global economic challenge face strengthen eu-china economic relationship. a bright spot cloud global economic environment continue resilience china’s growth. indeed, late consensus forecast project strong gdp growth 9.9% 2008 9.2% 2009, moderately low economic expansion 11.5% 2007. the remarkably robust growth outlook chinese economy however surround uncertainty light sharp slowdown advance industrial economy decline pace economic activity number emerge market economies. at time, inflation pressure china intensify late 2007 early 2008. although headline inflation decline recent months, average annual cpi inflation forecast2 6.9% 2008, 2 percentage point high average annual inflation rate previous year inflation target set begin 2008. moreover, rise underlie inflationary pressure visible nominal wage growth, accord estimate 18% second quarter year, reach peak 19% first quarter. if wage development indicative domestic underlie inflationary pressures, key issue china contain potentially significant inflation risk could undermine sustainability extraordinary growth performance. a second important issue implication combination fast growth rise inflation china global inflation prospects, potential effect price export and, especially, large share growth demand commodity china growth total global demand commodities.3 2 consensus forecast average annual cpi inflation 2008. 3 in 2007, estimate growth demand oil china account 47 % increase total global demand year. 4 bi review 110/2008 these two issue intimately link sustainability growth depend establish environment low inflation, price stability. moreover, “maintain stability value currency thereby promote economic growth” require preservation domestic price level stability. to secure goals, monetary policy fully gear towards achieve internal price stability objective, case euro area. but successfully achieve price stability require allow great exchange rate flexibility, since peg exchange rate vis-à-vis another currency basket currencies, tightly manage exchange rate, effectively limit room manoeuvre monetary policy. these argument underscore importance step take chinese authority since exchange rate reform july 2005: formally delinked hard peg u dollar, allow appreciation renminbi effective terms, promote development local foreign exchange market, set policy framework potential deliver even great exchange rate flexibility. a result measures, renminbi appreciate almost 17% real around 15% nominal effective terms. these development welcome praise since contribute achievement external internal stability. but step sufficient light global domestic challenge face? in july 2008, chinese authority emphasise high political level central policy objective “to maintain steady, comparatively fast growth fight inflation”.4 the continue emphasis fight inflation especially significant period still strong underlie inflationary pressure. but central banker, i would like add win battle inflation country require enhance room manoeuvre monetary policy effectiveness monetary policy instruments. this would imply allow great exchange rate flexibility, continue substantial foreign exchange inflow persistent current account surplus china keep augment domestic monetary liquidity increase cost sterilisation operations. moreover, would require great reliance indirect mean monetary control, notably use interest rate instrument good manage liquidity money market influence aggregate demand effectively. to end, structural change necessary enhance function interbank money market and, generally, promote development financial system. our colleague people’s bank china fully aware importance reform take pertinent measure strengthen effectiveness monetary policy instrument fight battle inflation. two question often ask concern two perceive trade-off may face central bank economic authorities: first, potential trade-off fast, sustain growth inflation, and, second, potential trade-off exchange rate stability internal price stability. these issue also debate extensively intensively china recent years. let say european experience, well evidence advance well emerge market economies, clearly demonstrate stable trade-off growth inflation effectively exploit policy-makers. contain inflationary pressure preserve price stability medium term best contribution monetary authority make achieve objective sustainable growth. the pace durable growth strengthen structural reform increase economy’s efficiency productive potential. on front, european make lot progress recent years, much remain done. with regard concern express potentially adverse effect currency appreciation export performance pace economic growth china, let point lesson history. it provide rich evidence many country 4 excerpt statement chinese politburo issue end-july 2008. bi review 110/2008 5 adjust economy successfully strong currency become prosperous domestic currency appreciate internal price stability secured. germany’s economic history past sixty year offer best example. it demonstrate benefit associate transition fix exchange rate peg u dollar, fix adjustable exchange rate, eventual adoption free float deutsche mark allow great monetary policy autonomy. this autonomy essential pursue primary objective domestic price stability germany face external price shock without hamper – indeed even help strengthen – overall competitiveness performance medium long run. but also success story achieve price stability without sacrifice competitiveness among emerge market economies, which, notwithstanding significant appreciation real effective exchange rates, experience strong non-inflationary growth instrumental secure countries’ competitiveness keep export growth. iv. conclude remark the world economy navigate heavy sea moment. both china european union confront number common challenge well specific domestic concerns. in order address effective consistent manner, available policy tool need use appropriate way. this require continue progress implement necessary reforms. i think fair say homework – though focus effort naturally differs. in europe, means, inter alia, focus labour product market reforms, order enhance growth potential economies; china, means, inter alia, reform financial market bank sector, order improve financial intermediation monetary control. a i highlight remarks, one common challenge face high inflationary pressure affect global economy. to master challenge, essential use monetary policy effective determine manner. the global phenomenon inflation perceive many country economic area consequence “external” shock. this harbour risk, shock accommodated, result sustain inflationary pressure adverse effect growth country beyond. therefore, concert effort monetary authority worldwide need fight global inflation. finally, combination stability-oriented monetary policy continue structural reform would also help address asymmetry i refer early thus strengthen bilateral economic relation europe china. thank much attention. 6 bi review 110/2008 bi review 109/2008 1 martín redrado: financial turbulence – impact develop emerge economy (opening address) open address mr martín redrado, governor central bank argentina, central bank argentina 2008 money bank conference “financial turbulence – impact develop emerge economies”, buenos aires, 1 september 2008. * * * during last years, consolidate conference international forum, include renowned academic monetary policymakers develop emerge economies. i well understand effort many make here, i would like thank participant and, especially, who, come abroad, join u every year. organize conference isolate effort. this part comprehensive strategy active professional member international financial community. the title conference choose last year, probably applicable then. the financial turmoil past year, clearly affect specific sector u.s., recede, keep spread market region world. there general consensus global economy pose one great challenge post-war period. financial disruptions, tight credit condition undermine confidence, imbue real economy recession main develop countries. the situation worsen renew inflationary pressures, partly due unprecedented rise commodity prices. in process, convergence structural factor cyclical force associate prosperity global economy previous period. due factor implementation sound prudent macroeconomic policies, emerge economy turn relatively resilient. however, realistic think completely “decoupled” event develop world, especially external context continue deteriorate. a characteristic crisis great effort devote go quickly possible. this may occasionally sow seed future problems. in turn, period plainly reveal structural weaknesses. look forward, one crucial issue focus unwind massive intervention collateral use important central banks. in view, extensive liquidity provide necessary response. it arguable whether late response would good preestablished framework. this might allow good assess effect provide predictable scenario specify advance measure reabsorb liquidity future. in emerge world, doubt structurally grow demand place, food also energy, minerals, metal sort commodities. expansion develop country mostly due process large emerge region catch improve live standards. against backdrop, recovery credit finance essential solve income price challenge face global economy. if clear message draw crisis, thing “one size fit all”. a day ago, jackson hole, focus prevent crisis worsen maintain stability new context. the important lesson i 2 bi review 109/2008 learn optimal solution abstracto. especially, deal complex economic policy dilemmas. this bring existence so-called “financial cycles” market tendency instability may result severe macroeconomic disruptions. the world face unprecedented combination negative economic events: financial crisis, recession inflation. this phenomenon rare develop economies. for emerge economies, unfortunately, trinity much familiar. in way, long experience deal consequence critical events. in fact, several problem currently discuss surprisingly recurrent show similarity crises. these factors, together new element make recent adjustment somewhat dramatic (such role new financial instrument players), force us, policymakers, implement original solutions. during past decades, crisis emerge world help clarify connection objective monetary financial stability. a currently take place develop world, also highlight importance liquidity capital regulation. in time hardship, necessary hand criterion temporarily apply “reduction ratios” adjust capital requirement instrument affect crisis resolution mechanisms. this base systemic factors, somehow involuntary institution operate conditions. this approach buy system time (a relatively le scarce resource time crisis) minimize need government capitalization. in new framework, central bank main develop economy also revise usual regulation, operation intervention mechanisms. by implement new facilities, significantly expand scope. a result difficulty experience bear stern and, despite fact prudential regulation supervision network focus behavior commercial banks, feed “throw away textbook”. because critical role process credit generation, involve complex network financial transactions, eventual bankruptcy investment bank context generalize leverage expect cause systemic events. this new prominence market-based intermediary long last effect creation theoretical scheme behind monetary policy. a usual, regardless undeniable costs, time crisis breed grind creativity, also inevitable revision previously accept principles. in time turmoil, theoretical consensus “what do” “how it” tend vanish. in words, relationship economic theory policy recommendation reasonably well define “normal” times, time turmoil, relationship become much weaker. admittedly, sometimes may due relative complacency characterize boom periods, inadvertent way change build up, consequence become apparent vividly perhaps already late. a i see it, “the perfect storm” reveal u non linearity reality, model need reformulate surely make complex. in words, every crisis see opportunity revise fundamental structures. it clear financial regulation policies, slight variation global level, revised. the excellent paper recently present adrian shin federal reserve new york definitely step right direction. this paper has, least, two element worth considering: first, reintroduce financial intermediation essential part economic model second, give monetary aggregate role play central bank policy function again. bi review 109/2008 3 in addition, arrive conclusion i claim discussion colleague time: far disconnected, financial stability objective rest traditional monetary policy objective two side coin. that is, reach point economic theory hard time keep praxis. for reason, cost benefit policy become blurring, pose significant challenge central bankers. the difference challenge face emerge countries, like past, also haunt develop world. this highlight importance “the risk management approach” design precautionary strategy monetary policy. in fact, crisis afford central bank develop economy flexibility instruments. we, monetary authority emerge countries, much use employ diverse tools. this reflect need pragmatic approach, derive le linear reality traditional transmission mechanism deep. even emerge country inflation target regime force make system flexible face new inflationary environment result change global economic structure. in end, operate similar principles, surround different realities, circumstance idiosyncracies. this remind josé ortega gasset's expression meditation quixote, “i plus circumstance”. with this, i propose return classical dilemma rule versus discretion monetary theory 1980s. i believe kydland prescott, well barro gordon convincing. in opinion, discus possibility give equal weight rule need flexible response specific events; event one precisely consider design rule due low likelihood occurrence. in policy design, monetary authority explicitly try avoid ex ante emergence imbalance could lead financial instability. the aim “reduce frequency severity bout financial instability future”, ben bernanke argues. recent literature show result ambiguous even contrary yield usual “technology”. a regard rule implement via interest rate channel, past 15 year conventional wisdom short-term interest rate could use change whole yield curve thus affect economic agents’ decisions. recent work show may case impact short-term rate real variable substantially different. in turn, 2007 paper black rosen show effect interest rate policy vary accord bank’s size asymmetric impact small large bank customers. my read clear: intellectual stature experience player involve controversy prove single policy one optimal approach could define vacuum. every policy option cost benefits: thing free lunch. the key choose whether want avoid “going long” “falling short”. naturally, beyond attempt mitigate trade-off, strategy policy choice crucially depend attitude government people towards risk. it also depend intertemporal considerations, profit loss profile alternative regime always coincide. furthermore, past trend relevant economy start condition naturally affect policy choice. our central bank’s approach monetary policy specific circumstance argentine economy understand framework. this approach three-fold: (1) robust monetary policy ensure equilibrium supply demand (2) 4 bi review 109/2008 counter-cyclical scheme foreign reserve accumulation mitigate vulnerability reduce macroeconomic volatility; (3) manage float exchange rate regime. our economy systematically prone recur mark macroeconomic instability episodes. the occurrence shock (in term trade condition access external financing, among others) existence shock-amplifying mechanism source recur macroeconomic instability past. these trend often underscore macroeconomic policy itself, tend behave procyclically. this explain preventive approach underlie current monetary policy design also reveal asymmetric approach shock affect domestic economy. on numerous occasion insist idea past haunt u lead u adopt prudent asymmetrical strategy response exogenous forces: enough evidence prof otherwise, force “dramatically shift burden proof” assume every negative shock permanent that, priori, positive force temporary. naturally, bear economic policy whole. therefore, prudent fiscal strategy build excess save good time natural consequence asymmetric approach shocks. the happen monetary financial field. the buildup liquidity buff good time allow u weather storm unprecedented way history, exogenous endogenous reasons. in past months, take strong measure ensure monetary financial stability. we notice mark mis-alignment demand money activate warn sign control panel. in words, diversion one variable value provide scheme base scenario. private sector deposit experience temporary decline 8% le month may. to put perspective, three months, deposit fell 17% tequila effect. take account, assess cost benefit use instrument, focus effort restore money market equilibrium. this professional response base risk management approach apply argentine monetary policy. the central bank surgically sequentially implement set ten measures. first, strengthen demand argentine peso foreign exchange market relatively calm, undertake action reinstate liquidity, ensure financial stability well function payment system. in fact, adopt follow prudential scheme: 1) first, adapt operation repo market: establish scheme offer liquidity fix (up 3 billion ar pesos) variable (badlar) interest rate. by offer wide variety options, ensure availability resource appropriate condition provide liquidity system. 2) we renew partially central bank security come due repurchase others near term maturities. 3) we extend limit operate future market, central bank counterparties. 4) we allow reference foreign exchange rate future forward transaction central bank counterparties settle emerge market trader association (emta). this measure clearly vote confidence approach. bi review 109/2008 5 5) we begin open market operation government security market purchase instrument liquidate peso dollar secondary market. this mechanism work additional tool provide liquidity beyond bank sector, time, enable intervention different segment yield curve, avoid distortion temporal structure. 6) to alleviate seasonal effect traditionally illiquid month july, unify financial institutions’ minimum cash requirement june july single bi-monthly term. this improve institutions’ liquidity management. 7) we develop mechanism u dollar-denominated repo supply. this additional way ensure dollar supply time dollar increase share investors’ portfolio necessary low depreciation expectations. 8) the central bank start participate ndf market operation 12 month counterparties whose credit quality low a-. 9) we open new repo window include collateral certain instrument (bogar guarantee loans) cannot use traditional repo operations. this enable institution significant central bank bill note position portfolio access liquidity provision mechanisms. 10) finally, offer new maturity option reverse repos, readjust cost line new term structure. that is, system adapt set ten measure stabilize foreign exchange market correct remain monetary financial variables. in nutshell, take necessary step ensure full systemic liquidity peso dollars. and, result, fluctuation financial variable limited, real economy negatively affected. this change policies. it framework implement last year face different scenario. the current situation stress test strength strategy, ratify consistency validity fundamental pillars. to sum up, conference one, feature many dear colleague usually interact seminar around world peculiar time like current one, breed grind analyze impact crisis scenarios. moreover, give current international economic scenario, history provide money bank conference unique opportunity, good understand reality, influence policy redesign emerge develop world. welcome thank much. hu xiaolian: recent economic financial development china remark m hu xiaolian, deputy governor people’s bank china, central bank argentina 2008 money bank conference “financial turbulence – impact develop emerge economies”, buenos aires, 1 september 2008. * * * respect governor martín redrado, lady gentlemen, i feel deeply honor invite come beautiful city buenos aire seminar. a know, recent development global economy charcterized broad-based slowdown, heighten financial market turbulence rise inflation pressure. i’m please able frank in-depth exchange view challenge china face measure take context. i. recent economic financial development china since begin 2008, chinese economy maintain stable rapid growth momentum process combat challenge result historically rare severe natural disaster turmoil international domestic economic financial conditions. investment, consumption export grow balance manner; domestic demand especially consumer demand become strong drive force economic growth; investment grow steadily investment structure improved; national economy develop desire direction. urban rural household income continue rise, domestic consumer demand remain strong. in first half year, per caput disposable income urban resident register 8065 yuan, year-on-year growth 14.4 percent 6.3 percent real terms; per caput cash income farmer 2528 yuan, year-on-year growth 19.8 percent 10.3 percent real terms. the steady income increase urban rural area support continue growth consumption. in first half 2008, gross volume retail sale reach 5.1 trillion yuan, represent nominal growth 21.4 percent real growth 12.9 percent, 0.2 percentage point high period last year. among total, retail sale urban china grow 22.1 percent 3.5 trillion yuan, retail sale counties, townships, village grow 20.0 percent 1.6 trillion yuan. the growth gap urban rural area 2.1 percentage points, 0.4 percentage point wide period last year. fixed-asset investment grow steadily improve investment structure. in first half year, fixed-asset investment total 6.8 trillion yuan, represent year-on-year growth 26.3 percent acceleration 0.4 percentage points. urban fixed-asset investment reach 5.8 trillion yuan, 26.8 percent year year, rural fixed-asset investment post 996.6 billion yuan, 23.2 percent, acceleration 0.1 1.7 percentage point respectively period last year. in term geographical distribution, fixed-asset investment eastern, central western china grow 22.4 percent, 35.3 percent 28.6 percent respectively, central western china grow much fast eastern china. in term sectoral distribution, fixed-asset investment growth three industry register 69.5 percent, 26.6 percent, 26.2 percent respectively, primary industry represent acceleration 32.0 percentage points, much high second tertiary industries, whose growth relatively stable. bi review 109/2008 1 in first half year, gdp grow 10.4 percent year year 13.1 trillion yuan, deceleration 1.8 percentage point previous year; consumer price index 7.9 percent, acceleration 4.7 percentage points; trade surplus post us$99 billion, decline 13.2 billion period last year; actually utilization foreign direct investment total us$52.4 billion, acceleration 33.4 percentage point previous year. ii. issue challenge face china’s economy 1. inflation become primary concern china’s economy. china currently face excessively increase pressure prices. since q4 2006, drive large increase food prices, cpi grow relatively rapid pace. in first half 2008, year-on-year cpi grow historically high rate 7.9 percent. the formation china’s current inflation complicated, result various factors. first, external factor impact domestic prices, large widespread rise price global commodities, food assets, inflation import develop emerge market economies. even though appreciation rmb somewhat offset impact, drive force import inflation remain strong. second, due limit supply, price important commodity pork rise rather quickly. third, rise cost labor price adjustment resource exert upward pressure prices. the cost labor import inflation reinforce result spiral prices. 2. the impact sub-prime mortgage crisis china’s economy cannot ignored. although sub-prime mortgage crisis limit direct impact china’s economy, never ignored. first, u.s. economic growth growth china’s export strongly positively related, low growth u.s. economy likely affect china’s export economic growth. second, uncertainty capital flow rise large amount international capital fly china, result successive cut policy rate federal reserve, continue depreciation u.s. dollar turmoil international financial markets. third, continue deprecation u.s. dollar increase price global commodity denominate u.s. dollar, put comparatively huge import inflationary pressure china. fourth, china’s foreign exchange reserve management face big challenge sub-prime crisis. change major international reserve currencies, euro u.s. dollar become unpredictable, thus complicate management china’s foreign exchange reserves. fifth, inflationary pressure sub-prime crisis heighten moderation risk china’s economic growth. external shock constitute great risk year china’s economy , become major pare global economy . although inflationary pressure sub-prime crisis negative impact, change fundamental china’s economy, maintain rather rapid growth rate. iii. china’s recent monetary policy the chinese government place anti-inflation top priority long time. in light apparent movement price level, end-2007 china make top priority “prevent rapid growth turn overheat prevent structural price rise become generalize inflation” macro adjustment policies. recently, china stress put maintain stable rapid economic growth curb excessive price hike 2 bi review 109/2008 top priority macroeconomic management, put rein inflation high agenda. in first half 2008, pbc take follow measure implement monetary policy: the first raise reserve requirement ratio absorb excess liquidity. the pbc raise reserve requirement ratio many occasions. after reserve requirement ratio raise one percentage point june 7, except certain financial institution quake-hit areas, reserve requirement ratio financial institution 17.5 percent. the rise reserve requirement ratio absorb lot liquidity, ease inflationary pressure, avoid rapid increase interest rate, contain hot-money inflows. the second flexibly conduct open market operations. in light short-term liquidity demand bank system change fund demand financial institution first half 2008, pbc flexibly use mix instruments, rationalize maturity structures, keep interest rate stable course open market operations, guide market expectation, conduct cash management state treasury appropriate. the third strengthen “window guidance” credit guidance. effort make guide financial institution strengthen credit regulation extend loan sound balance manner year, prevent volatile movement lend activities. measure take encourage growth sector discourage others rationalize credit structure. effort make restrict loan extend highly energy-consuming highly pollute industry industry overcapacity. credit support increase key areas, agriculture, rural area farmers, post-disaster reconstruction, small enterprises, service industry independent innovation, energy-conservation environment protection projects, credit line small- medium-sized enterprise raised. the fourth improve rmb exchange rate formation mechanism reform, speed reform foreign exchange system. effort make deepen reform foreign exchange system, appropriately guide market expectation rmb exchange rate, strengthen monitor over, analysis management cross-border capital flows, strengthen monitor abnormal cross-border capital flow trade sector areas; reform foreign exchange system trade service pilot basis regions; allow market participant foreign exchange market, promote equilibrium balance payments. the fifth steadily promote reform financial institutions. for time being, stock-holding reform state-owned bank deepened. the corporate governance, business transformation operation performance industrial commercial bank china, bank china, china construction bank bank communication upgrade continuous basis. the fundamental work reform agricultural bank china make significant progress. the commercialization china development bank steadily push ahead, reform rural credit cooperative make big progress achieve phase results. the aforesaid measure achieve remarkable results. a food price decelerate increase supply price oil commodity international market slide recently, china’s cpi decline 8.7 percent february 6.3 percent july, future inflationary pressure expect moderate. in meantime, monetary financial situation remain stable. at end-june, broad money m2 stand rmb 44.3 trillion yuan, represent increase 17.4 percent year-on-year, low end-2007. deposit loan financial institution increase stable manner. in first half 2008, outstanding deposit financial institution stand rmb 45.0 trillion yuan, increase 17.8 percent year-on-year; outstanding loan financial institution register rmb 30.5 trillion yuan, increase 15.2 percent year-on-year. the exchange rate rmb display overall appreciate trend. the flexibility rmb exchange rate improved, connection rmb major currency become apparent. a end-june, exchange rate rmb versus u.s. dollar rise 6.50 percent end last year, rmb depreciate 1.51 percent 0.63 percent japanese yen euro respectively end last year. from bi review 109/2008 3 foreign exchange rate system reform end june 2008, rmb appreciate 20.66 percent accumulatively u.s. dollar, depreciate 7.54 percent euro, appreciate 13.33 percent japanese yen. in first half 2008, daily fluctuation rmb central parity average 79 basis points, large 62 basis point 2007. the growth foreign reserve begin decelerate, expect decelerate further. iv. china’s policy stance adopt next stage an old chinese say go “ruling country like cook seafood delicacy”, follow rule country require meticulous effort cook palatable seafood. at present, destabilize factor international economic environment, problem china’s economy become apparent; therefore, need patience wisdom order maintain stable rapid economic development. in next stage, china put maintain stable rapid economic growth curb excessive price hike top priority macroeconomic management, put rein inflation high agenda. effort make maintain continuity stability monetary policy, increase foresightedness, pertinence flexibility adjustment policy, adopt fine-tune measure appropriate accord change situation home abroad, manage priorities, pace intensity macroeconomic adjustment, encourage growth sector discourage others, strengthen financial support key area weak aspect economy balance relationship contain inflation maintain rapid economic growth promote economy grow sound rapid manner. the year 2008 mark 30th anniversary china’s reform opening-up. in past 30 years, china successfully transform command economy market economy, close semi-closed economy fully opened-up economy, make outstanding economic social advancements. china’s gdp grow average annual rate 9.7 percent, foreign trade 17.4 percent, rank fourth third respectively world. people’s live condition achieve overall well off. but china stay primary stage socialism long time. there still lot poor people urban rural areas; urbanization inadequate; per caput gdp rank behind 100th world. constrain reality, solution many problem long-term systemic project. when make policies, consideration give china’s national situation, development stage affordability. we recognize increase economic globalization, financial integration drive financial innovation diversification transfer mode financial risks, regional global problem emerge, coordination macroeconomic policies, monetary policy particular, among different nation become important. go forward, address various problems, china rely accelerate reform development one hand, pay attention exchange cooperation country hand. china will continue increase understanding, share experience strengthen cooperation rest world create favorable international environment conducive development countries. finally, i wish complete success seminar. thank you! 4 bi review 109/2008 ardian fullani: achievement challenge albanian bank system speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, reception banker representative bank operate albania, organize albanian association banks, occasion close year 2008, tirana, 18 december 2008. * * * dear chairman albanian association banks, dear manager albanian bank system, thank invitation, i avail opportunity provide consideration path 2008 challenge ahead us. what fall sound unreal somewhat unbelievable. many taboo overturn list news enlarge day day, include also scheme financial mega-fraud. i commence speech way overlook unusual global event, provide outline general economic financial set surround environment all, underline immense truth: albanian bank system show admirable resilience immunity show matter luck. the year 2008 intensive year ceaseless changes, centre safeguard consolidation macroeconomic stability home bank system’s financial stability. take quick glance albanian economy present years, i state maintain project growth year 2008, stable consumer price domestic currency exchange rate. monetary policy throughout year 2008 cautious keep key policy rate unchanged 6.25 percent. in addition, fiscal policy characterize collection budget revenue beyond government’s projection concentration expenditure mainly infrastructure-related projects. a recent years, bank system sustain economic activity consumer demand loans, hence provide numerous incentive stable economic growth. the positive performance economy certain economic sector – particular trade construction – propel positive rate domestic demand home. lend maintain high annual growth rate 42 percent. a share gdp system’s assets, loan record growth 36 percent 41 percent, respectively. business main bank loans’ users, account 66 percent loan portfolio growth. this positive performance associate favourable macroeconomic financial setting. during second half year, cpi record annual drop 2.6 percent november. in addition, inflation measures, core inflation, trade non-traded inflation, attest downward intensity inflationary pressure home. the inflationary expectation economic agent also provide contribution stability. accord survey anchor around 3 per cent. these development attest fact monetary policy strengthen supervisory measure bank albania prove effective contain inflationary pressures. take account central bank’s role objective, i would like underline commitment success preserve price stability mirror anchor inflationary expectation close 3 percent target. the bank system’s performance present year prof positive. in early year 2008, credit registry start operate. it establishment represent key innovation bi review 163/2008 1 financial infrastructure albania. we attest fact put credit registry operation, contribute to: • have basic understand credibility borrower avoid careless borrowers; • reduce bank's cost collect information borrowers; • promote increase borrower discipline; • identify borrower liability provide information lenders; • improve bank industry database, develop borrower loan history. accord late data, bank system appear lucrative. return asset entire year 2008 expect 1.17 percent, return equity 14.7 percent. during present year, bank expand investment augment capital hand. capital adequacy account 17.5 percent total asset off-balance sheet item classify risk. the liquidity situation bank system year 2008 present good. despite downward trend show recent year (owing high credit growth rate), liquid asset total asset system account 46 percent, consider satisfactory. the main resource fund system – customer deposit – ever-increasingly consolidate upward trend, mirror public confidence albanian bank system. a end october, total deposit system amount 665.9 billion leks, 5.7 percent compare end-year 2007. follow open forum spring, supervisory council pave way approve package new regulations, aim harmonize regulatory supervisory framework best international practices. in accordance new bank law, new criterion establish measuring, supervise report bank’s large exposure person/customer group relate persons/customers special relationship bank, aim manage risk stem concentrate exposure them. the strengthen internal control bank branch foreign bank another focus bank albania present year. the new regulation consider internal control part bank’s accountable governance. it provide platform establish efficient internal control system key factor bank branch foreign banks’ governance

risk stem concentration banks’ investment international financial markets, supervisory council bank albania amend regulation management risk banks’ large exposures, aim reduce large exposures’ threshold. enhance efficiency financial market money market particular, also central bank’s focus. during year 2008 approve regulation master repurchase agreement, hence provide new instrument reduce risk borrow transaction banks. after short outline performance, bank albania bank system, come natural claim act rightly take number preventive measure help u absorb negative effect late events. dear bankers, year 2008 leave new year come now. like majority various world economies, even country front many uncertainties. i would like overlook domestic factors, however, currently consider hot issue, overall global environment. for long time now, various agencies, national international institution forecast year world contract overall production. it would utopian, certain extent lack prudence, think economy would slightly affect global crisis. though albania small economy, open, numerous relation exchange good financial funds. i emphasize public presentation actor prepare hard days. in light i would like notify number statements, find action (i mean bank albania bank system) go carry come months. 1. base late analysis country’s economic financial development inflation forecast two forthcoming years, i would like emphasise good anchor inflationary expectation around bank albania’s 3 percent target. late development information suggest risk balance future inflation shift downward trend, create space manoeuvre near future. 2. base recent empirical study bank albania, come relation credit economy country’s economic growth positive relatively strong. so, credit growth lead maintain current pace country’s economic activity. in recent year credit economy eclipse contribution public sector generate use financial funds, also base long process country’s fiscal consolidation. this process effective usage fund impact increase efficiency economic growth. a contraction credit economy carry risk reverse action, eclipse credit economy contribution public sector’s spending. in sense, aware difficulty ahead, i would insist request continue keep credit economy paces. 3. further previous requests, i would require active money market, interbank market security market. the bank albania repeat time satisfy financial market liquidity needs, hand require independent headquarters, policy apply relation domestic financial market, term bi review 163/2008 3 investment portfolio. you license operate albania, therefore, management albanian citizens’ save essential task every bank system financial intermediation country operating. the bank albania insist fast implementation repurchase agreement transaction carry interbank market. the bank albania make use systematic approach deal operate interbank market, necessarily require efficient liquidity re-allocation among banks. such thing carry apply repurchase agreement, thus prevent credit risk. in meantime, bank albania complete regulation dvp (delivery versus payment), simultaneously bring even settlement risk prevention. this constitute another step term financial infrastructure improvement efficient bank market. 4. the bank albania also look measure good precede optimal function bank system. under concrete terms, bank albania require dividend materialise 2008 destine increase capital bank manage. i constantly point system well-capitalised, however current condition i regard increase prudential measure. 5. one strategic goal central bank’s objective strengthen institutional independence credibility, central accountable institution mission entitle law. one factor impact directly indirectly strengthen independence also fulfilment improvement bank albania’s legal framework line contemporary standards. to end, work three main directions: • draft law “on payment system republic albania” include short-term priority republic albania, bank albania, undertake view obligation derive saa, european partnership, well short-term medium-term priority require national plan implementation saa. this draft law aim at: - strengthen system’s institutional framework; - enhance legal framework transparency task clarification participant system; - stipulate complete regime license supervise whole relevant systems. • alteration legal framework bank albania also associate effective regulatory framework improvement, bank supervision regulation focus. 6. the bank albania, start year-end, launch circulation new banknote face value 2000 leks, whole exist series re-printed. i would like highlight whole series re-printed banknote denomination 2000 lek equip modern security elements. in meantime i avail opportunity clarify public new denomination adjustment current structure, fill large gap exist denomination high nominal value. 4 bi review 163/2008 2009 difficult year, therefore everyone take appropriate measure correctly realise interpret role professionalism. to maintain dynamic country’s steady development toward full european convergence, bank system must perfect infrastructure. i would regard improvement customer service increase public education communication sound foundation infrastructure. all above-stated, along technology investments, would enable high transparency client competitive service costs. this would lead improve image public, enhance public confidence bank system. dear bankers, allow conclude speech emphasise great importance moment impose us. wherever are, inside country abroad, must regard challenge overcome crisis patriotic task, require commitment high moral, social political awareness. thank invitation, i avail opportunity wish happy year-end celebrations. bi review 163/2008 5 shamshad akhtar: the effectiveness monetary policy pakistan speech dr shamshad akhtar, governor state bank pakistan, convocation institute business management, karachi, 6 december 2008. * * * a. introduction economic policy aim increase welfare general public, monetary policy support broad objective focus effort promote price stability. embed objective belief persistent inflation would compromise long term economic prospect country. the objective monetary policy pakistan, lay sbp act 1956, achieve target inflation growth set annually government. in pursuit mandate, sbp formulate country’s monetary policy consistent announce targets. in remark today, i plan provide perspective on: • first, central bank focus price stability? • second, monetary policy transmission mechanism work? • third, principal feature pakistan’s monetary policy framework? • fourth, select think effectiveness pakistan’s monetary policy framework • finally, measure need improve effectiveness monetary policy framework pakistan? these question subject much debate lately, monetary tighten – inevitable policy response regain macroeconomic stability – arouse anxiety good public understand question help appreciate central bank’s monetary policy stance. b. why focus price stability? before get intricacy monetary policy, useful bring forth importance price stability override objective monetary policy. actual inflation outcome economy drive largely level output gap (the difference economy demand potentially produce) inflation expectations. when output gap widens, actual output economy sustain long run stable inflation. this reflect excessive demand available resource economy, push general prices. in order stem increase resource cost general price level economy, gap need narrow stabilized. this achieve either reduce demand short run increase productive capacity medium long run. reduce aggregate demand, however, entail reduction current output increase unemployment level economy. the famous classical phillips curve capture trade-off stabilize inflation control unemployment criticize phelps friedman late 1960s. they argue inflation expectation react change actual inflation, trade-off inflation unemployment would short-lived best. if wage set year reason output price increase, producer incentive increase output hire workers. however possible workers' expectation inflation remain unchanged period increase output prices. if worker adjust expectation accordance actual inflation demand high nominal wages, leaf relatively little incentive firm increase output. bi review 163/2008 1 therefore focus shift away trade-off new consensus emerge literature price stability key long run growth prospects. both theory evidence suggest monetary stimulus affect real economic activity short-run. in long run, however, conflict low inflation full utilization economic resources. ensure price stability, turn, require effective management anchor inflation expectations. with stable prices, economic decision make le uncertainty therefore market function without concern unpredictable fluctuation purchase power money. on hand, high unanticipated inflation low quality signal come price system producer consumer find difficult distinguish price change arise change supply demand product change arise high level general inflation. in market economy, price represent basic mean transmission information; increase noise associate high inflation low effectiveness market system. high unanticipated inflation make impossible plan relatively long outlook, create incentive household firm shorten decision horizon spend resource manage inflation risk rather focus productive activities. ben bernanke argue fed’s mandate goal price stability maximum employment almost entirely complementary: “price stability end monetary policy; also mean policy achieve objectives”.1 this argument also support keneth rogoff (1985) advocate central bank place large weight inflation stabilization, order increase welfare society. therefore, compete goal growth price stability, may seem odds other, fact boil single objective i.e. price stability. in backdrop, surprise central bank aim maintain low stable inflation. central bank place weight demonstrate increase willingness control inflation relative output growth, financial exchange rate stability. it important acknowledge, however, practical policy making, adhere reveal preference rather difficult. the reason central bank operate vacuum require coordination policy make institutions, particular fiscal authority. in addition, social cultural make-up country political economy consideration often require central bank accommodate conflict policies. in words, stick announce rule-based monetary policy difficult practice; “enlightened discretion” prefer central banks. thus, sbp’s decision focus arrest persistent inflationary trend tantamount pro-growth policy, growth retard one. c. monetary policy transmission mechanism the monetary transmission mechanism refer process monetary policy decision affect level economic activity economy inflation rate. understand transmission mechanism monetary policy crucial appropriate design efficient conduct monetary policy. a monetary policy action affect policy variable considerable lag high degree variability uncertainty, important predict possible impact extent monetary policy action real variables. thus, nature, monetary policy tend forward-looking. it also important know transmission channel effective term transmit change monetary policy action ultimate policy goals. since various financial sector development particularly regard introduction new financial products, technological changes, institutional strengthening, expectation future policy, etc. 1 http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke2006.02.24a.htm#f3#mainnav 2 bi review 163/2008 potentially change economic effect monetary policy measures, need regularly update, empirically test reinterpret monetary policy transmission channels. the impact monetary policy perceive transmit real economic activity five channels. • the first channel widely study understand channel monetary policy transmission rely link change short-term nominal interest rate (induced change policy rate) long-term real interest rate ultimately affect component aggregate demand consumption investment economy. a such, change long-term real interest rate impact aggregate consumption, business investment component aggregate demand. • the second channel, know credit channel, involve change monetary policy affect ability firm borrow money (by affect net worth) also affect ability bank lend money. the strength channel depend degree central bank allow bank extend loan dependence borrower bank loans. these factor clearly influence structure financial system regulation. • the third channel monetary policy transmission focus asset price (other interest rate) market value security (bonds equities) price real estate. a policy-induced change nominal interest rate affect price bond stock may change market value firm relative replacement cost capital, affect investment. moreover, change price security entail change wealth affect consumption households. • fourth, policy-induced change domestic interest rate also affect exchange rate turn affect foreign financial flows, net export thus aggregate demand. the strength exchange rate channel depend responsiveness exchange rate monetary shocks, degree openness economy, sensitivity foreign private inflow net export exchange rate variations, net worth firm thus borrow capacity take exposure foreign currency. moreover, exchange rate change lead change domestic price import consumption good import production input affect inflation directly. • since expectation influence inflation dynamics, fifth channel base economic agents’ expectation future prospect economy likely stance monetary policy. accord “expectations channel”, economic variable determine forward-looking manner affect expect monetary policy actions. thus, consistent, credible, transparent monetary policy potentially affect likely path economy simply affect expectations. d. monetary policy framework pakistan consider economic financial market structure pakistan, sbp sometime pursue monetary target regime broad money supply (m2) nominal anchor achieve objective control inflation without prejudice growth. the process monetary policy formulation usually begin start fiscal year sbp set target m2 growth line government’s target inflation growth (usually month may) estimation money demand economy. the basic idea keep money supply close estimate demand level, significant excess shortfall may lead considerable deviation actual outcome inflation real gdp bi review 163/2008 3 growth respective targets. underlie framework two strong assumptions: first, strong reliable relationship goal variable (inflation real gdp) m2; second, sbp control growth m2. while contain m2 growth close target level key consideration current monetary framework, composition money supply matter time require policy action even action lead deviation monetary growth target level. to understand point, necessary know major component money supply relative importance. net foreign asset (nfa) net domestic asset (nda) bank system two major component money supply. the nfa excess foreign exchange inflow outflow bank system, term reflection underlie trend country’s external balance payment (bop) position. it estimate project value major external transaction trade, workers’ remittances, debt servicing, foreign investment, debt flow etc. the nda bank system, primarily consist credit government private sector, reflect change fiscal real sector economy. it estimate residual m2 nfa. further breakup nda estimate basis project credit need government private sector. now come importance component money supply, depletion nfa generally consider unhealthy development. sharp nfa depletion reflect worsen bop position pressure exchange rate. in case, high nda growth, though help expand m2 reach target level, may deteriorate external accounts, sharp depreciation local currency, high depletion country’s foreign exchange reserves. although since fy07, indicative m2 growth target announced, sbp also take consideration causative factor monetary expansion purse target. consider change monetary aggregate economic variables, change monetary policy signal adjustment policy discount rate (3-day repo rate). further, change policy rate complement appropriate liquidity management mainly open market operation (omos) require change cash reserve requirement (crr) statutory liquid reserve requirement (slr) also made. e. effectiveness monetary policy pakistan significance various channel transmit monetary policy shock pakistan real economy analyze economists. ahmad et al. (2005) find credit channel important conduit transmit monetary policy action real economic activity. evidence confirm transmission active asset price channel exchange rate channel. accord study, monetary policy shock impact real output lag 7 11 months. tasneem waheed (2006), hand, investigate whether different sector economy respond differently monetary shocks. the presence sector wise difference monetary transmission mechanism profound implication macroeconomic management central bank weigh vary consequence action different sectors. investigate transmission change interest rate seven sub sector economy, author find evidence support sector-specific variation real effect monetary policy. they find interest rate shock manufacturing, wholesale retail trade, finance insurance sector transmit lag 6 12 months. on hand, monetary policy shock negligible impact agriculture, mine quarrying, construction ownership dwell sectors. generally, historical evidence reflect pakistan high inflation high interest economy give inherent structural weaknesses. the role effectiveness monetary policy appear visible 2000s financial sector reform start 4 bi review 163/2008 bear fruit term market base money foreign exchange markets. enter 21st century, loose monetary policy stance face low inflation, low growth low twin deficits, along structural measure open economy alleviate first round constraints, trigger economy long term growth trajectory 7 percent. monetary policy stance however alter inflationary pressure start build 2005. at end fiscal year, economy, show sustain steady growth since fy01, register historically high level growth (9 percent), average inflation rise sharply (9.3 percent) external current account balance turn deficit (-1.4 percent gdp). coincide developments, fiscal module start show sign stress fiscal balance convert deficit stock external debt liabilities, decline since fy00 paris club rescheduling, begin increasing. these indicator largely capture high grow aggregate demand economy account sustain increase peoples’ income. with emerge domestic global price pressures, sbp tighten monetary policy prolong gap years. the effort rein-in inflation, however, prove le effective due rebound international commodity price rise domestic food price late on. the rise international commodity prices, particularly oil, exacerbate fight inflation. the international oil price (arabian light) rise us$27.1 end 2004 us$50.9 end 2006, whereas international food price rise 24, 24 21 percent 2004, 2005 2006 respectively.2 realize complication monetary management adverse global domestic economic developments, implementation sbp monetary policy fy06 vary significantly precede fiscal years. in addition rise policy rate, central bank focus short-end yield curve, drain excess liquidity inter-bank money market push short-tenor rates. consequently, overnight rate remain close discount rate year, volatility rate also declined. these tight monetary condition along government’s administrative measure control food inflation help scale average inflation 9.3 percent fy05 7.9 percent fy06, within 8.0 percent annual target. this certainly encourage development, particularly achieve without affect economic growth real gdp growth remain strong 6.6 percent fy06. monetary policy tighten strengthen further. for fy07, government set inflation target 6.5 percent. to achieve this, moderation aggregate demand fy07 require core inflation witness relatively small decline fy06, indicate demand-side inflationary pressure strong. in perspective, sbp tighten monetary policy july 2006 raise crr slr schedule banks; policy rate 50 basis point (bps) 9.5 percent. moreover, proactive liquidity management help transmit monetary tighten signal key interest rate economy. for instance, karachi inter bank offer rate (kibor) 6 month tenor increase 9.6 percent june 2006 10.02 percent end-june 2007 banks’ weight average lend deposit rate (on outstanding amount) increase 0.93 percentage point 1.1 percentage points, respectively, fy07. in retrospect, appear evident monetary tighten fy07 put adverse impact economic growth, real gdp growth target 7.0 percent fy07 met, growth quite broad based. at time, impact monetary tighten evident continue deceleration core inflation 2 change annual average food price index; source: imf commodity price data. bi review 163/2008 5 fy07. one measure core inflation, non-food non-energy cpi, continue downtrend yoy high 7.8 percent october 2005, 6.3 percent end-fy06, 5.1 percent end fy07. however, much gain tight monetary policy overall cpi inflation offset unexpected rise food inflation. on downside, however, broad money supply (m2) grow 19.3 percent fy07, exceed annual target 5.8 percentage points. slippage money supply growth largely stem expansion nfa due high expect foreign exchange inflows. equally stressful impact government borrow central bank course year. the pressure fiscal account due mismatch external budgetary inflow expenditures. with privatization inflow receipt sovereign debt offer end-fy07, government manage end year retirement central bank borrowings, margin. by end-fy07, sbp hold government paper still around r 452 billion, despite net retirement r 56.0 billion year. another major aberration fy07 emanate high level sbp refinance extended, work capital long-term investment, exporters. aside monetary management complexities, scheme distort incentive structure economy. fy08 begin fy09 even challenge fy08 exceptionally difficult year. the domestic macroeconomic political vulnerability couple challenge global environment cause slippage macroeconomic target wide margin. after relatively long period macroeconomic stability prosperity, global economy face multifarious challenges: (i) hit sub prime mortgage crisis u.s 2007, international financial market turmoil, impact felt across market continents; (ii) rise global commodity prices, crude oil food staple price skyrocketing; (iii) gradual slide u.s dollar major currencies. combination event induce degree recessionary tendency inflationary pressure across develop develop countries. policy-makers grip dual challenge slowdown growth unprecedented rise inflationary pressures. central banker face demand task weigh trade-off growth price stability. with exception develop countries, central bank show strong bias towards address risk inflation respond tighten monetary policies. on domestic front, external current account deficit fiscal deficit widen considerably unsustainable level (8.4 7.4 percent gdp). the subsidy payment worth r 407 billion government, account almost half fiscal deficit, shield domestic consumer high international pol commodity price distort natural demand adjustment mechanism. while government pass price increase consumers, rise international oil importable price continue take toll economy. rise demand cost country dearly term foreign exchange spend import large volume commodities. rise fiscal deficit low require finance flow result exceptional recourse government highly inflationary central bank borrow finance deficit. at time surge import persisted. a result, inflation accelerate expectation strengthen due pas international oil price domestic market, increase electricity tariff general sale tax, rise exchange rate depreciation. these development result rise headline well core inflation (20 percent weight trim measure) 25 percent 21.7 percent respectively october 2008. consider size 6 bi review 163/2008 macroeconomic imbalance emerge inflationary pressures, sbp remain commit achieve price stability medium term thus launch steep monetary tighten tame demand pressure restore macroeconomic stability fy09. sbp thus increase policy rate 13.5 15 percent. f. what need do improve effectiveness monetary policy? apart take policy measure address emerge challenges, sbp also introduce structural change process monetary policy formulation conduct make monetary policy formulation implementation transparent, efficient, effective. specifically, last couple years, sbp focus • institutionalize process policy formulation conduct, • step movement towards market base credit allocation mechanism, • develop analytical operational capacity, • improve capability ass future development act proactively, • improve upon communication policy stance general public. however, follow area need attention key effective monetary management. 1. effectiveness monetary fiscal coordination would helpful. section 9a 9b sbp act (amended 1994) articulate institutional mechanism economic policy make coordination define grind rule process policy making. however, track record monetary fiscal policy coordination board (mfpcb), establish february 1994 require quarterly meet sbp government, le satisfactory. furthermore, sequence economy-wide projection do isolation budget monetary policy make process, budget make process respect monetary compulsions. with rise spend stagnate revenues, budget assume start year certain recourse central bank rather treat mere way mean advances. 2. for effective analysis development policy making, timely quality information extremely important. however, due weakness data collection report mechanism various agency country, information available desire frequency timeliness. also concern quality data. unlike many develop develop countries, data quarterly gdp, employment wages, etc. available case pakistan. moreover, data key macroeconomic variable (such government expenditure revenue, output large-scale manufacturing, crop estimates, etc.) usually available substantial lags. this constrain in-depth analysis current economic situation evolve trends, hind ability sbp develop forward-looking policy stance. 3. unlike many countries, develop developing, prescribe limit government borrow sbp define sbp act fiscal responsibility debt limitation (frdl) act 2005. besides highly inflationary, government borrow sbp also complicate liquidity management. borrow central bank inject liquidity system increase currency circulation deposit government banks. in cases, impact tight monetary stance dilute automatic creation money increase money supply without prior notice. moreover, access potentially unlimited borrow sbp provide little incentive government put fiscal account order. therefore, foremost task bi review 163/2008 7 improve effectiveness monetary policy prohibit practice government borrow sbp. in regard, appropriate provision require cease limit government recourse central bank finance amendment sbp act frdl act 2005. 4. another issue make clear distinction exchange rate management monetary management. currently, general perception state bank bind keep exchange rate predefined level movement away level consider inefficiency sbp. there need understand open economy, impossible pursue independent monetary exchange rate policy well allow capital move freely across border. since sbp endeavor achieve price stability achieve monetary target change policy rate, possible maintain exchange rate level free capital mobility. this achieve put complete restriction capital movements, possible. sbps responsibility ensure environment foreign exchange flow drive economic fundamental mis-guided rent seek speculation. 5. finally, base experience particularly gain last two month differentiate liquidity management monetary policy stance. recently, bank system experience extraordinary stress due shallow liquidity system, rumor monger heighten general public anxiety banks’ sustainability. consequently, sbp intervene market inject ample liquidity various measures. in quarters, change deem change bank’s tight monetary policy stance. however, case bank clearly repeatedly communicate exist stance continued. late on, bank tighten monetary policy. it must understand quite often, liquidity management drive market interest rate away direction desire monetary policy stance. however, temporary interest rate bind move policy stance direction. to resolve issue, sbp study various options, include introduction “standing deposit facility” keep inter-bank rate within corridor. in conclusion, imperative step take urgently. over period, however, need complement much deep structural reform synchronize reform medium term plan budget monetary policy formulation process. several study technical assistance provide extensive guidance area, lack capacity short term compulsion often withhold reforms. what important recognize medium term development strategy, independently work out, would help minimize one agency interest often source coordination difficulties. it would also help budget make process rule base incrementally drive process satisfy conflict demands. reference: ahmed n., h shah, a. i. agha, y. a. mubarik (2005), “transmission mechanism monetary policy pakistan,” sbp work paper series no. 09, state bank

since in-house meet professional colleagues, i propose frank forthright. i glad know bankers' club kolkata recently revive engage promote professional interaction within bank community. the global financial crisis staple front page news. bank around world, include india, forefront manage challenge crisis resolution. since topical, i would like take opportunity share perspective current global turmoil, impact india, outlook indian economy challenge lie ahead indian bank system, particular. global financial outlook the global financial situation continue uncertain unsettled. what start sub-prime crisis u house mortgage sector turn successively global bank crisis, global financial crisis global economic crisis. text book economics often cite house prime example non-tradable good. it paradoxical quintessentially non-tradable good house trigger crisis global dimensions. this crisis also first kind sense first financial crisis since great depression originate advance economy rapidly engulf whole world. such depth sweep financial globalisation. by far, frequently ask question (faq) today whether bad – term financial sector meltdown, particular, failure financial institution – behind us. no one really will take definitive call this, sign increase number unknown unknowns. even recently six month ago, view fallout crisis remain confine financial sector that, most, would shallow recession advance economies. these expectations, turn out, belied. the contagion traverse financial real sector; look like recession deep recovery long early anticipated. global economic outlook many economist predict “great recession” 2008/09 bad global recession since 1930s. the imf make customary forecast global growth world economic outlook publish october 2008. by early november, imf revise forecast global growth downwards – 3.9 per cent 3.7 per cent 2008, 3.0 per cent 2.2 per cent 2009. there two inference follow this. first, global situation deteriorate rapidly, space le two months. second, 2009 go challenge year 2008. emerge economy ironically, even late six month ago, intellectually fashionable subscribe “decoupling theory” – even advance country go downturn, emerge bi review 162/2008 1 economy will, worst, affect marginally, largely steam ahead own. in rapidly globalise world, decouple theory never persuasive; give evidence last month – capital flow reversals, sharp widen spread sovereign corporate debt, abrupt currency depreciation – decouple theory almost completely lose credibility. growth prospect emerge economy definitively undermine ongoing crisis with, course, considerable variation across countries. impact crisis india india weather negative impact crisis. a impact india unfolds, two frequently ask questions: first, india affect come asian crisis relatively unscathed? second, india affect even export account 15 per cent gdp? the answer question lie globalisation. we certainly integrate world economy today ten year ago time asian crisis. integration world imply exports. go common measure globalisation, india's two-way trade (merchandise export plus imports), proportion gdp, grow 21.2 per cent 1997-98, year asian crisis, 34.7 per cent

sustain growth momentum, reserve bank signal low interest rate structure reduce key policy rate viz., repo rate 250 basis point 9.0 per cent october 19 6.5 per cent december 8, 2008. although, remain vulnerable global financial economic developments, measure take far ease liquidity credit flow situation considerably. i must also add manage impact global crisis, mindful policy initiative totally costless. manage delicate balance cost benefit one challenges. the measure take rbi appreciate criticised. i would like assure give much importance critic admirers. while criticism fair value adding, stem inadequate appreciation rbi perspective. i think may useful give perspective inform public debate important monetary policy issues. everyone agree way forward crisis present time uncertain. even today, possible clearly see path crisis resolution come months. it possible precise road map lay unleash one go. this crisis allow u luxury. and, mind you, india unique respect. almost every country, whether directly affected, manage uncertainty. there simply many unknown unknowns. in circumstances, stance rbi respond evolve situation swiftly effectively, extent possible, anticipation immediate developments. we road map comprehensive practical. it would endeavour adapt road map evolve global development implement flexibly pragmatically. our approach, indeed every prudent central banker around world, "cross river feel stones". the rbi continue vigil everything possible within mandate mitigate impact crisis indian economy. the challenge ahead let turn major challenge face bank system country, particularly wake global financial crisis. the first challenge: maintain credit flow the outlook, world india, continue remain uncertain. the future trajectory global crisis yet clear. a i mention earlier, year 2009-10 challenge current one. there noticeable decline credit demand month november 2008 yet clear one episode reflect trend. if indicative slow economic activity, would major challenge bank ensure healthy flow credit productive sector economy. a know, economic growth, even normal times, require efficient financial intermediation. an economic downturn, therefore, require even efficient financial intermediation – 4 bi review 162/2008 major challenge bank community address. there need ensure steady credit flow real sector economy order sustain demand even maintain credit quality. there two aspect lend viz., availability cost credit. while availability credit issue, cost credit seem issue current juncture. there seem two reason inhibit bank extend credit: first, high weighted-average cost fund high interest rate deposits; second, concern credit quality, make bank risk averse, particularly lend certain segments. during last one month, sharp reversal trend and, note earlier, credit demand seem slackening. the reduce fund demand bank enable reduce interest rate deposit thereby reduce overall cost funds. in addition, macro perspective decelation headline inflation notice far expectation soften inflation month ahead enable reduction nominal interest rates. these development turn, would facilitate lend low interest rates, make fresh lend viable and, least partly obviate risk aversion banks. let assure rbi, part, continue maintain adequate liquidity system enable flow credit economy. the second challenge: reform financial sector regulation? by far, contentious voluble debate trigger crisis flaw regulatory architecture financial sector. several issue come fore. i mention few. how complex derivative products, transmit risk across system, make transparent? what financial stability implication structure product like credit derivatives? be exchange trade derivative good over-the-counter (otc) derivatives? how eliminate drawback “originate-to-distribute” model? be universal banking, model unite state turn to, appropriate? can apply regulatory regime wholesale retail banks? the burden question identify drawback present regulatory regime indicate possible solutions. there doubt must pursue questions. in so, i would urge remember two things. the first thing remember one size fit all. for example, universal bank may good country situations, others. the second thing remember regulations, arguably, behind curve. there deny regulation keep pace innovation financial market so, must mindful risk over-tightening regulation l stifle innovation. the third challenge: regulatory forbearance relax regulatory norm there sustain demand various quarter exercise regulatory forbearance regard extant prudential regulation applicable bank sector. a part counter-cyclical package, already make several change current prudential norms. these include: (a) reduction risk weight claim unrated corporates commercial real estate 100 per cent; (b) reduction provision requirement standard asset 0.40 per cent; (c) permit house loan restructure even revise payment period exceed ten years; (d) make restructure commercial real estate exposure eligible special treatment restructure june 30, 2009. there demand regulatory forbearance. for example, demand relax asset classification norm increase period delinquency bi review 162/2008 5 beyond current norm 90 day loan asset require classify non-performing. the objective underlie demand permit bank avoid recognise non-performing loan (npls) long period. be desirable change npl norm relax 90 day rule? the demand presumably premise argument relaxation norm make banks' financials look better, allow reserve less, conserve capital, may even allow offer credit (or least cut back credit). however, several forceful argument relaxation sought. let mention few. (i) delay recognition npl remove pressure bank deal promptly problem. history suggest delay recognition impairment value asset make problem worse. the sooner bank restructure loan (through, say, cdr mechanism) or, appropriate, send loan collection, better. (ii) this global downturn likely prolong one. if bank recognise problem loan now, deal expeditiously, problem get compound passage time keep haunt future. (iii) the prudential regulatory norm ought change lightly, especially market edge. if impression gain grind modify norm under-state extent impairment over-state asset quality bank sector, market could suspect bad needlessly penalise bank market discipline. these issue need reflect move towards regulatory forbearance. the fourth challenge: effective implementation basel ii framework a aware, part indian bank system already migrate basel ii framework effective march 31, 2008 remain commercial bank slat march 31, 2009. however, regard state preparedness system, have, present, adopt simple approach available framework. the rbi yet announce timeframe adoption advance approach indian bank system migration approach eventual goal – bank system need start preparation earnestness. the migration advance approach pose several significant challenge banker and, bank regulator supervisor, also rbi. the first challenge availability long time-series data compute risk parameter require advance approaches. good-quality, consistent reliable data information relate loan portfolio bank also sophisticate it resource critical proper risk assessment basel ii framework. data limitation key impediment design implementation credit risk models. this may prove major challenge u india, give wide-spread branch network – though increase computerisation bank industry prove great help. the second challenge advance approach credit risk operational risk envisage basel ii framework also require use risk model banks. this, turn, require internal validation model bank also supervisor model permit use regulatory capital purposes. such validation process demand expert skill need develop nurtured. third, since basel ii framework primarily ensure robust risk management banks, effective implementation, particularly advance approaches, demand rapid significant upgradation skill – level bank system also within rbi. in context, challenge bank likely face multi-faceted, viz., assess skill requirements, identify bridge gaps, identify talents, put 6 bi review 162/2008 available talent optimum use, attract fresh talents, retention talents, change management. bank would, therefore, need pay special attention strengthen risk management infrastructure, dimensions, include human resources. we, rbi, mindful part challenge regard take necessary measures. the implementation basel ii require close cooperation, information share co-ordination policy among sectoral supervisors, specially context financial conglomerates. the existence separate supervisory authority regulate different segment market within jurisdiction may create challenge implementation basel ii within jurisdiction also across jurisdiction – would require effective cross-border supervisory cooperation co-ordination. the fifth challenge: challenge bank development financial inclusion eastern india bank development eastern region country, measure several parameters, lag behind national average. let give evidence illustrate this. • in march 2008, all-india per branch population coverage 15,400. for eastern region, figure vary 25,000 bihar 9,600 sikkim.. • in march 2007, all-india level, per caput deposit rs. 28,600. the correspond figure eastern region rs. 14,400. similarly, per caput credit r 28,600 all-india level, correspond figure eastern region rs. 7,200. • in march 2007, all-india level, population people bank account 41 per cent. the correspond population eastern region 30.7 per cent, range 21.1 per cent bihar 39.6 per cent west bengal. • in march 2007, all-india level, credit-deposit ratio 74.5 per cent. for eastern region, ratio 50 per cent. in term infrastructure coverage development indicators, eastern region develop region country. admittedly, affect credit absorption capacity may also explain lag parameter mention above. however, excuse inaction. it impetus vigorous action. finance lead development much lead it. this specially true poor. nearly third people bihar west bengal poverty line. through great financial inclusion possible provide savings, loan insurance product affordable price generate income employment significant measure. we must recognise opportunity cost formal finance borrower high mere financial inclusion unlock value today accrue rentier informal finance providers. this apart, transaction cost reduce kind scale operation bank capable achieve become source value creation. financial inclusion reduce mere number game. the actual impact financial inclusion expand bank coverage must felt grass-root level. i find number measure initiate deepen bank penetration region. for example, west bengal, task force extend bank facility unbanked gram panchayat (gp) constitute state level bankers’ committee december 2007. the task force identify 511 gps bank branch open next three year 427 gp-centres follow three years. i understand bi review 162/2008 7 state government agree provide premise adjacent gp office extend facility like road connection power centres. where full fledge branch open immediately, bank could look cover unbanked area satellite offices, weekly branches, use business correspondent model ensure great coverage within short period. information technology (it) solution also explore provide back bone credit information, customer information apart facilitate efficient credit delivery reduce cost payment remittances. i understand interest innovative experiment undertake west bengal promote financial inclusion. a financial inclusion/literacy campaign launch urban slum area viz., basanti colony, ultadanga, kolkata mid-october 2008 association six commercial banks. these bank state bank india, unite bank india, uco bank, allahabad bank, bank india bank baroda – branch vicinity slum area. all six bank allot separate counter open account well campaign bank-specific products. free photo facility account holder provide cost share participate banks. the initiative pursue full range financial service provide areas. i understand local council extend support obtain identity document require open bank accounts. this experiment demonstrate bank responsive, sensitive, proactive result oriented. come sectoral flow credit, share agriculture state’s sdp high all-india level, share agricultural credit total credit roughly state. this point need look bankable scheme agriculture sector. also, nabard significant role play region. a micro small enterprise account 7.2 per cent total credit region, sidbi too, development finance institution, play prominent role accelerate catalyse flow bank credit mse sector region. although often acknowledged, effective financial intermediation one important factor behind india’s recent growth episode. efficient financial intermediation formidable challenge poverty disadvantage high. you, senior bank manager eastern region country, big challenge great opportunity. a big challenge even efficient elsewhere, great opportunity responsive sensitive, make "a big difference". conclusion go forward, development real economy, financial market global commodity price point period moderation growth decline inflation. what hearten though fundamental economy continue strong. once calm confidence restore global markets, economic activity india recover sharply. but period painful adjustment inevitable. it collective challenge – you, bankers, u rbi – respond extraordinary situation effectively return india path growth poverty reduction. thank you. 8 bi review 162/2008 rasheed mohammed al maraj: ensure stability – international perspective create effective regulatory framework inaugural plenary address his excellency rasheed mohammed al maraj, governor central bank bahrain, 15th world islamic bank conference 2008, manama, 24 november 2008. * * * your excellencies, lady gentlemen: “salaam alaikum” it pleasure participate open session, opportunity welcome 2008 world islamic bank conference. this 15th conference kind hold bahrain, july year, first wibc european summit hold london. the inaugural european summit yet indication islamic finance rapidly move financial mainstream. i like begin thank many distinguish speaker appear conference, well event organiser sponsors. collectively, contribution reason success event. i also particularly like extend warm welcome his excellency heng swee keat, manage director monetary authority singapore. thank u today. the theme session – “ensuring stability: international perspective create effective regulatory framework” – timely view. until recently, many commentator analyst believe economy gcc oasis calm ongoing global financial turmoil. however, since collapse lehman brother mid-september, become clear part world immune present crisis. we see vastly change financial landscape, little doubt availability fund cost borrow affect part world. against background global financial turmoil, seem good time take stock prospect islamic financial industry, consider particular best ensure stability industry future. in recent month global financial crisis deepened, many commentator point islamic financial institution escape relatively unscathed severe downturn affect conventional financial institutions. this certainly present industry opportunity continue rapid successful growth recent decades. however, fact shari’a compliant institution avoid significant loss result global financial crisis mean lesson learn fallout. let mention three particular i believe particularly relevant – risk herd behaviour, importance liquidity management, importance sound corporate governance. the first example i invite consider concern belief many conventional bank lend sub-prime borrower represent viable new business line would appropriate risk reward trade-off. the first mover market might find profitable niche – many bank try become player market, credit standard become lax loan make borrower little chance repay them. although bank recognize risk enough mitigate sufficiently early stage. the reason, former head major bank remark explain bank’s sub-prime relate write-offs, “if music playing, get dance.” bi review 162/2008 1 the sub-prime episode provide illustration herd instinct recurrent feature financial market since beginning. some bank discover profit opportunity, bank follow, long oversupply credit lead losses. although shari’a compliant financial institution insulate direct loss result recent financial crisis, mean much subject herd conventional financial institutions. a i point past, new entrant industry merely tend copy strategy see successfully pursue establish rivals. a result, industry’s asset become heavily weight towards property sector – real estate, commercial property construction. event part world recently remind u sector experience significant cycle activity. we also need remember business model look robust condition rise asset value abundant liquidity, may change economic environment. the industry need carefully consider risk widespread adoption business model. be genuine profit opportunity exploit competitors? or instead consequence merely decide follow herd? an important part regulator’s role lean tendency towards herd seem perennial feature financial markets. this always popular role essential one. for example, impose concentration limits, regulator require bank hold diversify therefore le risky portfolio assets. while recognise advantage bank develop expertise particular economic sectors, also significant risk chase profit opportunity others already exploited. while regulator help ensure financial institutions’ risk well diversified, main incentive risk diversification need come industry itself. the industry need develop great diversity business models, diverse stable income sources, robust risk management stress test techniques. the essential consideration islamic finance, form finance, find right balance business development risk management. a second issue bring prominence recent global financial turmoil concern financial institutions’ liquidity risk management. conventional financial institution regulator clearly pay sufficient attention liquidity risk run crisis. liquidity source potential risk islamic financial service industry time, particularly give relative unavailability short-term, liquid money market instrument shari’a compliant. to assist islamic financial institution overcome problem, cbb recently develop islamic sukuk liquidity instrument. this repurchase agreement design enable financial institution access short-term liquidity government bahrain long- short-term ijara sukuk. despite important innovation cbb’s stand facilities, continue need depth liquidity shari’a compliant money market cbb continue explore initiatives. a final issue recent global financial turmoil bring prominence concern corporate governance. the experience conventional financial sector reminder financial institution need high standard corporate governance entrust people’s money. while true financial institutions, need particularly great shari’a compliant due several issue specific business model. decision profit distribution, example, require careful balance interest multiple stakeholder group – shareholder conventional banks, 2 bi review 162/2008 interest holder investment account well. investment account holder expose many risk shareholders, lack control right – ability vote board member – attach equity ownership. balance different stake holder interests, require adoption strong corporate governance practices, standard develop aaoifi islamic financial service board, vital component solution. to conclude, although islamic financial service industry insulate to-date effect global financial crisis, many lesson shari’a compliant institution learn. the global financial crisis reminder importance risk diversification, good liquidity management, sound corporate governance. these lesson islamic financial industry need bear mind continue enjoy framework stability essential future prosperity. bi review 162/2008 3 yandraduth googoolye: supervision regulation state-owned bank address mr yandraduth googoolye, first deputy governor bank mauritius, financial stability institute, world bank international monetary fund seminar “supervision regulation state-owned banks”, host reserve bank india, mumbai, 5 november 2008. * * * distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, i please mumbai today share think supervision regulation government-owned banks. i must outset compliment financial stability institute, world bank international monetary fund choose issue theme seminar. no subject could topical current context give see west reverse process private bank get wholly semi-nationalized. therefore, lesson seminar, target emerge economies, could useful develop world well, meaningful way perhaps might week ago. before get theme regulation supervision government-owned banks, let u see different way government stake banks. firstly, government ownership arise initial shareholding stage, i.e. entity government majority shareholding apply bank licence. secondly, government may set bank nationalize exist bank(s) act parliament social developmental objectives, thirdly government could acquire share exist bank bail fail bank, something quite fashionable days! indeed extensive literature lot debate role government ownership banking. it would perhaps useful briefly touch upon theory put forward government ownership banking. the view frequently associate state ownership bank social view, political view agency view. the social view suggest government-owned bank contribute economic development improve general welfare (atkinson stiglitz (1980)). the political view highlight role politician pursue personal goals, example maximize employment electorate finance favour enterprise (shleifer (1998)). the agency view relate agency cost government bureaucracy may result managerial inefficiency (banerjee (1997), hart, shleifer vishny (1997)). various study also conduct ass impact government ownership banks. caprio marinez (2000) demonstrate government ownership significantly positively associate increase bank fragility; barth, caprio levine (2004) find conclusive evidence relationship government ownership bank likelihood bank crisis. those inconsistent result seem suggest spite implicit deposit protection arise government ownership banks, bank immune insolvency risk. even depositors’ interest jeopardized, might cost general public interest. these observation mean show implication government ownership bank bank system economic growth, put perspective critical importance regulation supervision government-owned banks. in fact, rather easy see best way get maximum benefit government ownership bank subject proper regulation supervision. bi review 162/2008 1 the whole issue regulation supervision public sector bank assume special significance notion regulator may de facto independence government, shareholder regulator, may influence regulatory process apply bank own (government). however, government-owned bank function commercially viable entities, regulatory process able shield use manner detrimental depositors’/public interest. this would also necessary point view create level play field government-owned bank private banks. the issue differentiate regulation regulatory process may take various forms. there could difference way director choose government. if board director government-controlled financial institution comprise representative government, may tendency broad goal government override commercial objective bank thereby depositors’ interest. the objectivity regulator deal nomination person might pas fit proper test case indicator independence regulator uniformity supervisory practices. another issue, also emanate corporate governance perspective, arise fact case enterprises, shareholder get prime place among various stakeholders, case bank, protection depositors’ interest central area focus. in case public sector bank shareholder/controller central bank regulator sole majority shareholder, question arise regulator (whether central bank authority) would focus depositors’ interest oppose shareholders’ interest. one might wonder whether interest conflict. it may time exist situation conflict might arise. for example, various principle prudence regulator require financial institution adhere might curtail risk-taking ability thus channel resource safer, remunerative activities. a third area perception different treatment arise regard lend policies. for instance, would regulatory authority view public sector bank lend socially justifiable objective may bankable strict sense term? would regulator treat lend bank alike would condone lend public sector bank extension social objective government? a fourth aspect could regulation public accountability associate government ownership. thus government may directly regulator impose many restriction function bank own could impede fleet footedness one would expect commercial entity display. for example, decision write offs, restructure involve financial sacrifice bank may go bureaucratic rigmarole lead delay failure clinch critical settlements. very often government ownership associate excessive emphasis process without regard often detriment expect outcome. the regulator may view passively, positively, decision indecision may justify principle propriety also comfort bail depositor event insolvency. the mauritian experience let turn situation mauritius. before i go detail regulatory supervisory process, i would like outline structure financial service industry country. the major financial institution mauritius banks, insurance companies- general life, non-bank deposit take financial institutions, cash dealer comprise money changer foreign exchange dealers. bank account 80% country’s financial sector. the legal framework regulation supervision financial 2 bi review 162/2008 institution provide mainly bank act 2004, bank mauritius act 2004 financial service act 2007. the bank act administer bank mauritius apply banks, non-bank deposit take institution cash dealer financial service act implement financial service commission oversee segment financial sector include insurance leasing. the non-bank deposit take institution engage lease business regulate supervise bank mauritius financial service commission, overlap uncommon jurisdiction well. there conglomerate business segment come within purview regulators. we joint coordination committee exchange note move towards concept lead regulator. the bank mauritius act basically set responsibility function bank thus provision bear bank’s regulatory supervisory role. there 19 bank 13 non-bank deposit take institutions. out institutions, present two bank three non-bank deposit take institution government majority stake – directly indirectly. the share bank government-controlled development financial institution hold majority stake divest private entity recently. the government’s interest five institution hold different ways. for instance, one bank government mauritius directly hold part share remain hold government-controlled organization like pension fund etc. in another case, government stake partly hold government-controlled post office. one bank list stock exchange well. two non4 bank subsidiary government undertakings. in final analysis though, manner government stake hold may bear control exercise government entities’ management. all institution regulate supervise bank mauritius like institution purview, i would explain late on. however, deposit-taking development financial institution public sector yet bring within purview bank. a uniform regulatory approach in certain jurisdictions, legal framework regulation supervision make distinction applicability certain provision legislation privately-owned public sector financial institutions. in india, provision bank regulation act (1949), particularly relate appointment chief executive directors, applicable public sector banks. however, mauritius, provision bank act apply manner extent type institutions. a regulatory authority bank mauritius apply aspect function public sector financial institution similar institution private sector. perhaps would worthwhile outline important aspect illustrate uniformity approach, namely area licensing, regulatory limits, audit, onsite examination, offsite surveillance corporate governance. the chairman, chief executive officer, director senior officer government-owned entity scrutinize fit proper test manner private sector entity, examine application bank licence. all guideline apply equally public sector bank private sector banks. a example extreme application uniformity, i cite fact lend government own bank public sector entity consider relate party exposure subject discipline govern connect lending. bi review 162/2008 3 the bank mauritius vet credential external auditor private sector bank public sector bank give approval appointment. the offsite surveillance onsite examination conduct manner private sector bank public sector banks. further, various principle corporate governance enunciate bank apply rigour public private sector financial institution. a public sector institution require even constitute conduct review committee examine relate party transaction – case would mainly mean credit facility transaction public sector enterprises. give importance corporate governance bank institutions, independent function board director cannot overemphasized. our guideline corporate governance require board bank institution healthy proportion independent director encourage minimum 40 per cent. the board also put place appropriate structure procedure achieve project independence. the director board meet “fit proper” criterion outset ongoing basis. these requirement contribute ensure political interest take precedence bank’s commercial interests. a uniformity, de jure enshrine legal framework, de facto extend supervisory process well. performance bank mauritius before move conclude remarks, i would briefly deal performance bank sector mauritius. it matter great comfort late sector witness robust growth parameter couple decline ratio non-performing loan total advances. the deposit bank increase mur435 billion mur537 billion end june 2007 end june 2008; advance grow mur305 billion mur356 billion period. the pre-tax profit increase mur9.9 billion year end march 2007 mur11.1 billion year end march 2008. non perform loan represent 2.4 per cent gross advance end june 2008. there 186 branch 382 atm country average one electronic card use per adult population. the public sector bank also turn good performance. in fact one two public sector bank second large bank country. the return asset year end march 2008 two public sector bank 2.84 per cent 0.74 per cent average 1.7 per cent industry. similarly return equity one 20.93 per cent industry average 23.26 per cent. it therefore evident bank sector, include entity government control interest, perform well. i must also assure resilient enough, thus vindicate faith apply uniform legal, regulatory supervisory framework. let make one final comment performance public sector banks. there general perception public sector institution innovative private sector entities. well may always true. in fact one public sector bank mauritius euromoney the banker award “best bank mauritius” number occasions. conclude remark it undoubtedly good practice let ownership structure influence regulatory supervisory process. this two positive effects. first, public sector entity function like commercial organization within risk management guideline issue regulator. secondly, privately-owned entity sector would feel discriminated. 4 bi review 162/2008 this necessary attract private capital sector. obviously, regulatory process favour one segment vis-à-vis within industry would conducive foster healthy competition. have say this, important issue, cannot lose sight of. one major comfort regulator seek part depositor interest centric function reputation financial strength promoter. from perspective nation’s sovereign main shareholder give lot comfort regulator. the recent events, even one may consider exceptional, demonstrate perceive invincible also financial muscle sovereign. however, regulator bask comfort sovereign promoter let instrument government abuse comfort. the punch line, one sum whole gamut issue relate regulation supervision public sector banks, could read – feel comfortable, don’t relax! thank attention. bi review 162/2008 5 christian noyer: a new regulatory framework new financial system speech mr christian noyer, governor bank france, round table discussion university paris-dauphine, paris, 11 december 2008. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure take part round table discussion. today, prevail view – justly – necessary rethink financial regulation. there two reason this: a) financial market bank are, le strongly, confront problem asymmetric information; b) operational inefficiency may arise, leading, extreme cases, seize certain market segments. needle say imperfection interconnected. in many respects, financial crisis expression imperfections. three example use illustration. the underestimation risk mispricing asset upswing financial cycle show market may generate excess investment certain sector economy (e.g. u real estate sector). furthermore, appear financial innovation change banks’ economic model result significant increase information asymmetry and, importantly, low incentive economic agent pay attention asymmetries. lastly, fact market segment seize crisis suggest infrastructure necessary function lacking. to simplify, i believe logic underlie current regulatory system consist ensure financial stability market segments, without adopt overall approach. however, crisis force u acknowledge fragment approach regulation necessarily ensure stability entire financial system. during crisis, fact financial institution considerably increase use leverage risk concentrate among relatively small number bank neither well assessed, well captured, prevent regulation. in view failure order mitigate impact term financial instability, government intervention designed, stabilize situation particular institution, prevent systemic risk materialising. a result, require macro-prudential regulation. this naturally lead u address issue scope financial regulation. who regulated? the problem new; also complex. like me, notice that, last summit meeting, g20 head state government lay clear principle matter. they indeed commit ensure “all financial markets, product participant regulate subject oversight, appropriate circumstances”. the crisis show quite clearly market institution systemic role must regulated. this criterion imply re-examine function certain otc markets, interbank money market credit derivative market. similarly, rat agency also regulated, give key role play correct information asymmetry financial markets. lastly, public authority pay great attention financial institution central supply market liquidity financing. an important start point acknowledge financial system participant different functions, pursue different strategy operate accord different economic models. this diversity crucial smooth function markets. a one-size-fits-all bi review 161/2008 1 regulatory framework apply participant would certainly give rise herd behaviour and, consequently, reinforce endogeneity certain risks. a gradation could reasonably apply regulation requirement impose financial system participants. three levels, range oversight regulation, naturally come mind. the first level would take form mandatory registration commitment comply code good practices. the second – restrictive – level would include disclosure obligation regard activity accounts, addition mandatory registration compliance good practices. hedge fund and, generally, institution pursue strategy essentially base leverage risk-taking could meet requirements. finally, last level would involve restrictive regulation regard activity risk-taking, well close oversight. in many respects, gradation system relevant regard prudential requirements. it also apply account rule example. beyond theoretical considerations, important financial regulation, forms, contribute maintain financial system diversity. thus, attempt measure asset liability fair value drawback – even entail risk – need take account lesson draw financial crisis account rules. to conclude, i would like stress important point regard new financial regulatory framework. it would unrealistic believe financial regulation answer, and, all, capable protect u risk financial instability. indeed, crisis largely attribute financial institutions’ inadequate risk management, stem irrational trust quantitative tools. financial regulation incentive financial system participant develop sound efficient management framework. it substitute. 2 bi review 161/2008 stanley fischer: impact global financial crisis israel’s economy address professor stanley fischer, governor bank israel, general assembly association publicly trade companies, jerusalem, 8 december 2008. * * * for year world confront one bad financial crisis seventy years. this crisis two phases: first, financial, second, real, word significant slowdown, possibly even global recession. both financial real effect global financial crisis israel's economy clearly evident. i would like stress, however, israel enter period favorable state countries. on financial side crisis reflect israel mainly fall price share corporate bonds, unlike advance economies. in addition, rate growth decline 2.3 percent (annual rate) third quarter, expect slowdown israel's growth rate continue, i.e., growth remain positive, slow further, (to 1.5 percent 2009), oppose significant slowdown, even recession, advance economies. israel's relatively favorable situation due several factors: 1) the government's fiscal policy last year responsible one. 2) the bank israel’s interest rate policy support financial stability ability economy deal successfully effect slowdown growth. this, without act counter return inflation within target range. 3) a surplus create current account balance payments. 4) israel's foreign exchange reserve high rising, result bank israel's plan increase them. 5) the level growth employment high onset crisis. 6) israel's bank system strong stable compare advance economies. 7) israel's capital market develop advanced, complex financial instrument whose inherent risk level difficult assess. 8) the average debt burden company household relatively low. the challenge present preserve economy's relatively favorable position, take advantage deal new situation, introduce measure need escape period slowdown without harm economy's ability return path rapid sustain growth. all this, despite forthcoming election fact 2009 budget approve yet. at stage bank israel, framework power instrument available, take follow steps: 1) it conduct active interest rate policy intend strengthen economy's ability handle crisis. 2) the bank supervision department intensify regular monitor development bank system. in addition, bank announce ready help bank mean disposal, necessary, order support depositors. bi review 161/2008 1 3) the bank's program buy foreign currency continue forex reserve reach level consider appropriate current circumstance – $40 billion $44 billion. what still do? 1) a cautious fiscal policy pursued. thus, assume growth rate 1.5 percent 2009, budget deficit expect reach 3 percent gdp, base automatic stabilizers, i.e., expect drop tax revenue result slowdown growth, one hand, certain rise government expenditure arising, example, increase unemployment, other. it would advisable allow deficit rise much beyond that; words, ability embark expansionary fiscal policy limited. nevertheless, tax cut plan 2009 proceed, manner consistent automatic stabilizers. 2) the measure formulate ministry finance cooperation security authority bank israel implemented. this program help economy weather storm. 3) it essential, i would place emphasis aspect, introduce measure financial side, particularly step intend increase source bank nonbank credit business sector, include small medium-sized businesses, stimulate foreign investment israel's capital market. yesterday prime minister decide support proposal put forward work team ministry finance, bank israel prime minister's office, regard "safety net" saver close retirement age. the bank favor proposal immediate implementation. however, view safety net temporary measure particular time. it important start think change structure pension system israel, ensure pay fund pension schemes, oppose cover unfunded schemes, place situation which, close retirement age, likely lose significant part savings. it important pension system structure time arrive saver receive reasonable pension rest lives. one possible pension scheme structure could adopt sicilian model, save close retirement age transfer relatively low-risk channels. to great regret, step formulate ministry finance, although approve prime minister, make little progress vis-à-vis knesset, implemented. thus, valuable time could use benefit economy wasted, particularly regard measure relate financial side. further delay apply measure likely erode economic achievement last year ability successfully meet challenge face us. this time, therefore, postpone decision making. the financial crisis here, wait us. the measure planned, remain start none-too-simple task make decision implement them. it essential time, approach election knesset, persist focused, act view medium long term. failure cost u dear. 2 bi review 161/2008 rasheed mohammed al maraj: bahrain develop financial centre gulf region address his excellency rasheed mohammed al maraj, governor central bank bahrain,

paris, 11 december 2008. * * * lady gentlemen, i delight take part european meet account profession. this discussion seem especially timely since current crisis raise whole series question relate le closely account policy. it coincidence late banque de france financial stability review devote issue valuation. i convince crisis force u carry in-depth assessment concept tool relate valuation. i accountant. the point view i put forward today central banker responsible particular financial stability. with perspective mind, i propose together take look three topics. • overview crisis point view valuation • issue neutrality account convention • consistency rule practice regard valuation financial crisis, crisis valuation in many respects, current crisis valuation. to sure, factor underlie account crisis numerous. however, one significant feature uncertainty surround “true” value complex financial instrument undermine confidence global markets, increase uncertainty counterparty risk lead contagion across asset classes, financial market economic regions. the crisis highlight fact valuation financial instrument question accounting. it raise issue risk measurement management financial institutions, prudential issue via definition capital requirement and, widely, financial stability issues. however, valuation also without doubt account issue. it therefore hardly surprise debate application account standard financial instrument highly topical one. i think interest note crisis occur financial system see two far-reaching developments. i refer first rapid growth securitisation product whose valuation complex. i dwell aspect subject today’s meeting. the aspect i would like focus transition “fair value” account financial instruments. the rationale behind account development understandable summarise follows. the aim enable investor financial system participants, include supervisors, good understand risk profile financial institution order good ass position. in order achieve this, financial statement must – case instrument economically relevant – sensitive price signal markets, reflect transaction values. i believe two element important argument. the first financial statement crucial merit provide information. the second rationale fair value valuation contain within limitations. the concept "transaction", bi review 160/2008 1 fundamental context and, result, "market", constitute limit scope application fair value accounting. be account choice neutral? it go without say great sensitivity balance sheet market fluctuation result fair value account obviously impact financial stability. a central banker may legitimately wonder whether account convention neutral respect behaviour financial player market dynamics. the current crisis volatility face past month suggest account convention impact term financial incentive may insignificant impact financial players' strategies. one example serf illustrate point. it macroeconomic nature relate risk-taking financial institutions. it possibility, case instruments, record first trade day discount future profit even though risk remain balance sheet. if believe financial industry itself, possibility impact investment strategies. it cannot rule rule make possible record substantial income flow cyclical upswings, contribute great risk-taking institution order maintain income flow year year. in general way, extension scope application fair value account probably, cyclical upswings, also contribute many asset account market value whereas intention market participant manage asset fair value basis clear. my aim make judgement relative merit account choices. it highlight fact choice implication go beyond account policy. in concrete terms, therefore, question need ask collectively is: optimum policy response? do account convention need modified? or regulatory framework correct effects? consistency valuation rule this lead last point i would like address today: consistency rule practice respect valuation. there currently difference approach account practices, prudential regulation risk management practices. it thus wholly accept financial industry inevitably uncertainty surround valuation financial instruments, particularly complex illiquid. in addition, limitation mathematical model recognised. these two factors, i.e. price volatility financial cycle limit quantitative technique highlight number divergence internal risk management fair value accounting. more generally, application account rules, give value company activity give moment, always allow forward-looking valuation financial instrument sound risk management practices. yet aspect important prudential authorities. conversely, choice term prudential regulation impact financial stability interact certain account rules. for instance, hitherto favourable treatment give prudential rule trade book without doubt encourage behaviour aim generate short-term profit via transaction book market value. like note that, press release november, g20 head state government give particular attention account issues. the work programme assign minister expert address several areas. it aim "harmonising account standards, particularly complex instruments, time stress". it also aim "address weakness account disclosure standard off-balance sheet 2 bi review 160/2008 vehicles". lastly, aim "enhance require disclosure complex financial instrument firms". the head state government assign ultimate objective account standard setters, i.e. creation "single high-quality global standard". it strike attention give account issue link financial stability considerations. to conclude address already rather lengthy, i like remove ambiguity may arise discussion intensify crisis. i think anyone's interest current period weaken account conventions. accurate, rigorous fully transparent financial statement bedrock financial activity. the aim work discussion actively pursue last month continue come period fact modest difficult one. it ensure account convention fully reflect reality financial activity overambitious. this undoubtedly mean review role fair value account treatment financial instruments. thank attention. bi review 160/2008 3 mark carney: from hindsight foresight remark mr mark carney, governor bank canada, woman capital markets, toronto, ontario, 17 december 2008. * * * it difficult year capital market professionals. the turmoil deteriorate full-blown financial crisis. most financial market experience historic fall prices, strain point closing. issue financial stability obsession pessimistic daily concern many. policy-makers respond bold measures. these work, although take time confidence return capital flow again. in interim, dramatic repricing risk across financial asset increasingly mirror real economy. business already begin postpone large investments, household hesitate major purchases. partly consequence financial instability, next year try one many canadians. few forecast events; although, outbreak retrospective foresight, increase number claim saw coming. the reality among banks, investors, academic policy-makers, handful able identify ahead time cause potential scale crisis.1 central banks, ministry finance international financial institution believe either risk adequately manage vulnerability lay elsewhere. around world, private bank exceed regulatory capital requirements. clearly, though, risk manage properly capital inadequate. now, rush respond, must avoid build financial equivalent maginot line – overpreparing repeat current event remain vulnerable root cause next crisis. rather, must develop early-warning system precision teeth. this require progress internationally domestically. internationally, financial stability forum (fsf) international monetary fund (imf) must become effective. there several way accomplish this. the first divide clearly responsibility bodies, imf primary responsibility surveillance (i.e., early-warning system) fsf coordinate development resilient financial system. second, policy-makers must become engaged. the value international organization bureaucracy posse unique power insight, rather convene senior policy-makers, challenge them, forge consensus foster sustainable global economic growth. third, country must recognize membership organization bring responsibilities. this canada successfully push recent g-20 summit mandatory regular review country's financial system imf (a process carry financial sector assessment program fsap). finally, matter around table. in washington last month, g-20 leader agree expand fsf include key emerge markets. these country first-hand experience financial crisis also major surplus country who, major capital providers, need part global solution.2 1 example include bill white, formerly bank canada bank international settlements; harvard university's ken rogoff; nouriel roubini new york university; wynne godley cambridge; bernard connolly aig financial products. 2 m. carney, "reflections recent international economic developments" (speech canadian club montreal, montréal, quebec, 25 september 2008). bi review 160/2008 1 domestic responsibility financial stability currently share among large number federal provincial bodies. this include bank canada, mandate legislation "promote economic financial welfare canada." today i would like focus bank fulfill broad mandate contribute financial stability canada. a macroprudential approach a clear lesson current crisis need take macroprudential approach financial stability. macroprudential surveillance ass current risk look broad economic financial condition contribute buildup risk financial system economy whole. macroprudential regulation seek improve resiliency financial system design standard code limit buildup financial economic imbalances. put simply, macroprudential approach focus forest, trees. two topical fallacy composition illustrate point. the first keynes term "paradox thrift." it may individually rational people want save business invest le uncertain economic times. if behaviour widespread, however, become collectively irrational. fear recession fee recession. similarly, bank may decide hoard capital anticipation increase loan loss slowdown. if bank same, action exacerbate downturn increase eventual losses. it well-known timely properly calibrate monetary fiscal policy address first issue. it le widely recognize macroprudential regulation address second. in many ways, central bank ideally suit bring macroprudential approach financial stability. our mandate demand take economy-wide perspective. further, strong motivation maintain stable, efficient financial system rely transmit monetary policy actions. however, many tool necessary secure financial stability. monetary policy blunt instrument, poorly suit address financial imbalances. instead, macrofinancial stability one core objective financial regulation. until is, current framework, bank promote financial stability two tools: liquidity advocacy. the bank ultimate source liquidity within economy. we use recently enhance power bank canada act extensively throughout crisis, measure total $36 billion term liquidity. there four important point context. first, supply net liquidity system – new central bank money. rather, redistribute liquidity exchange liquid asset high-quality, though less-liquid ones. second, substantially over-collateralized protect balance sheet.3 third, consistent canada's relatively strong bank system, liquidity provision large elsewhere. for example, bank canada currently provide liquidity equivalent around 1 per cent total domestic bank assets. the comparable figure 4 per cent europe, 5 per cent unite kingdom 6 per cent unite states. finally, provision extraordinary liquidity central bank limit damage crisis, long apparent official liquidity, irrespective size, cannot re-open market own. the bank's second tool – advocacy – receive profile first – fact i hope begin change today. the bank promote financial stability influence public sector policy private sector behaviour. we two ways; leverage 3 for example, end november, bank collateral term purchase resale agreement worth 105 per cent amount outstanding term pras. 2 bi review 160/2008 position key domestic international organizations, produce solid analysis research grind advice. domestically, work closely representative federal department finance, office superintendent financial institution (osfi), canada deposit insurance corporation, financial consumer agency canada. we meet regularly share information, coordinate actions, advise federal government financial sector policy. within group, bank canada organization bring solely macroprudential perspective table – perspective intend increasingly assert. improve analysis sharpen accountability in recent years, bank make financial stability strategic priority. strengthen priority one primary motivation behind internal reorganization last month. we department dedicate financial stability, invest heavily research analysis. we hire senior capital market professional draw lead academic special advisers. in addition, mandate bank's govern council sharpen add financial stability assessment responsibilities. the deputy governor i hold accountable analysis; others whether follow advice. to clear, seek identify every worthy reform financial sector (they legion). rather, seek identify stress economy well regulation practice potential serious macroeconomic consequences. in so, want occasionally change behaviours, convention even regulation mitigate threats. the late edition bank's financial system review (fsr), publish last week, first step. it contains, first time, judgment govern council main risk canadian financial stability. i return shortly. first, i say word regard article current fsr, detail effort bank staff construct early-warning indicator financial stress canada.4 an early-warning system the bank canada develop financial stress indicator, fsi, us number domestic variable measure degree financial stress economy.5 a would expect, fsi show record level stress. it correlate probably feel. while indicator excellent job measure stress real time, objective develop empirical measure could forewarn potential financial crises. in words, give fsi accurately measure financial stress, accurately predict change fsi? it clear time rapid growth credit sustain growth asset price often precede financial crises. bank researcher find promise tool assess canada's vulnerability crisis: combination growth domestic business credit real estate price tend good predictor change bank's financial stress indicator one two year future. however, combination unable predict current crisis root cause come outside canada. there ongoing work bank refine tools, could prove important, 4 m. misina, p. st-amant, g. tkacz, "credit, asset prices, financial stress canada", financial system review (ottawa: bank canada, december 2008): 29-33. 5 m. illing y. liu, "an index financial stress canada" (working paper no. 2003-14, bank canada, 2003). bi review 160/2008 3 predict future period financial instability thereby prompt timely corrective actions, also development countercyclical capital rule i discus minutes. current risk stability in fsr, five major risk financial stability identified: first, liquidity fund financial institutions; second, capital adequacy; third, state household balance sheets; fourth, possibility prolong downturn global economy; fifth, threat destabilize unwind global financial imbalances. let spend minute discuss first three risk detail, although i stress risks, likely outcomes. fund liquidity the current crisis begin summer 2007 liquidity dry up, lead major disruption money bond markets. in response, bank canada provide exceptional liquidity core financial institutions, expectation liquidity would cascade financial system. this indeed case past spring. with intensification crisis since september, liquidity effort significantly expanded. while action sharply low money market spread encourage lend long maturities, condition remain far normal. bond issuance slow return, put great pressure bank sole source lend growth. in tandem, financial institution curtail central role intermediary market-makers. this fee illiquidity volatility financial market delay return confidence financial system. this could aggravate adverse feedback loop financial system real economy. in essence, go one extreme – overabundant liquidity lead misallocation capital – another – where, systemically important markets, capital barely allocate all. the challenge policy-makers provide transition support effectively restart rather replace markets. a i argue elsewhere, may require structural change markets, include great use clear houses, re-thinking scale frequency central bank liquidity operations.6 procyclical capital adequacy the second risk identify fsr procyclicality bank capital. put simply, bank characteristically increase leverage boom, feed expansion, reduce leverage downturn, exacerbate slowdown. regulation often reinforce tendency lean them. this serious global problem. bank outside canada enormous pressure reduce leverage. give scope likely ultimate loss structure product alone, would take enormous amount capital reduce average leverage ratio canadian levels. bank canada research estimate u.s., u.k. european bank would need raise combine us$1.2 trillion bring leverage ratio canadian levels. these capital need rise linearly recession-induced writedowns. in environment, bank incline hoard capital, rather deploy it. in world guarantees, liquidity fund support, regulator reinforce tendency. 6 m. carney, "building continuous markets" (speech canada-united kingdom chamber commerce, london, england, 19 november 2008). 4 bi review 160/2008 in canada, bank face pressure de-lever counterpart abroad. still, loan portfolio would experience high credit loss deep prolong downturn. the risk identify fsr market force could compel bank maintain high capital ratio necessary guard possibility bad economic outcome. this could lead bank slow balance sheet growth, would tighten lend condition household business weaken economy. ultimately, financial institution would suffer self-fulfilling prophecy. give concerns, superintendent financial institution last month take welcome step give canadian bank flexibility allow raise proportion prefer share comprise tier 1 capital 30 per cent 40 per cent. the low absolute leverage canadian institution high quality tier 1 capital mean expand lend fast international peers. the value virtually unique advantage economy underestimated. the bank work international counterpart examine current regulatory capital framework may amplify fluctuation economic financial conditions.7 under current rules, capital requirement link credit risk institution's portfolio. in upturn, risk go down, bank require hold le capital, growth credit increases. the problem amplify swing financial condition lead emergence financial imbalances. recall link credit growth future financial stress i mentioned. then, downturn credit risk increases, bank require increase capital holdings, thus exacerbate economic weakness financial stress. this motivation proposal capital requirement move procyclically. bank could require build capital buff time rapid credit expansion. this would strengthen balance sheet reduce risk financial imbalance develop overly easy financial conditions. during downturn, bank could draw buffers, would reduce need liquidate asset restrict loan growth time credit condition asset price already stress. in way, capital requirement would moderate up down credit cycle – reverse currently happen – reduce risk future crisis. this macroprudential approach capital requirement tremendously important, also complex, number practical logistical concerns. such system could accomplish link capital requirement movement credit-cycle indicators, loan growth asset prices. for example, research determinant financial stress i mention moment ago help inform development regulatory guidelines. it probably unrealistic think ex ante perfect formula derived. ultimately, important question regard balance rule discretion and, regard latter, exercise discretion. household balance sheet the third risk relate health canadian household balance sheets. household credit make 60 per cent canadian bank sector's total loan exposure, loss household lend would likely immediate impact capital adequacy forward profitability. the household sector could important channel global economic weakness affect canadian financial sector widely. while canadian household sector remain relatively healthy, resilience test recession. various indicator financial stress, bankruptcy loan 7 see "recent proposal procyclical capital requirements", financial system review (ottawa: bank canada, december 2008): 15. bi review 160/2008 5 arrears, increase recently historically low levels. fall equity market soften house price put pressure household balance sheet time ratio debt income already record high 140 per cent. the household debt-to-asset ratio rise credit crisis intensified, reach 19 per cent end third quarter – high level since 1990. at time, debt-service ratio household actually decline modestly 7.5 per cent, well historical average 9.2 per cent see since 1992, owe low effective borrow costs. this give measure assurance household comfortably manage debts. the health canadian household obviously important bank sector. if global economic downturn significantly severe projected, household default canada could rise sharply. this risk would magnify bank begin tighten credit condition household significantly far. in fsr, examine risk use simulate stress test. specifically, examine extreme scenario nominal household income drop average annual rate 2 per cent six straight quarter result global economic weakness. such event could double – 3 per cent 6 per cent – proportion canadian household consider vulnerable; is, debt-service ratio 40 per cent income. further, vulnerable household would 13 per cent total household debt, figure double average past 10 years. if scenario materialize, would prompt significant loss among canada's banks. however, important overplay scenario, since actually illustrate strength system. first, scenario extreme – annual growth household income negative quarter 37 year data available. second, average tier 1 capital ratio bank would fall 9.7 per cent 8.8 per cent, figure still two time minimum ratio allow basel ii accord, well osfi's 7 per cent threshold. there number reason risk pose household balance sheet significantly low canada elsewhere, least canada's conservative lend culture. for example, subprime mortgage account le 5 per cent canadian mortgage lending, roughly one-third level unite states. further, since canada require insurance high-loan-to-value mortgage canada mortgage bond carry explicit sovereign guarantee, negative feedback loop house market financial sector apparent major economies. while canada's debt-service ratio remain historical average, i mentioned, debt-service ratio unite state remain historical average. further, absolute cost household debt canada – mortgage loan – fall 100 basis point since onset crisis last year. nonetheless, bank canada continue closely monitor risk pose financial stability household balance sheets. in addition, bank closely consider possibility household may sensitive shock income wealth develop outlook canadian growth inflation. conclusion in time crisis, easy understand link financial stability real economy. while apparent, sometimes hard see end crisis. but end will. the action policy-makers take effective. the global economy emerge period weakness. in year ahead, time better, need promote financial stability may clear-cut, even though le important. the bank canada continue take macroprudential approach. we use tool disposal promote financial stability home abroad and, doing, continue contribute economic financial welfare canada. 6 bi review 160/2008 caleb m fundanga: support

coordinate actions. moreover, ecb also central bank make extensive effort provide refinance long maturity expand list asset eligible collateral credit operations. not least thank actions, recent week see noticeable improvement euro money market. for example, past week, spread term deposit overnight index swap rate decline considerably, 15 20 basis point along maturities, reflect continue fall euribor rates. the spread fell 80 basis point one-month maturity 160 basis point 12-month maturity. an interest analysis relate current problem money market present box 7 review highlight link market liquidity fund liquidity risk, basis evidence recent data. the result show negative relationship high fund liquidity risk low market liquidity establish financial turmoil erupted, “normal” times, obvious relationship two measures. this support theoretical proposition (advanced recent academic research) interaction two measure emerge bank face fund constraints, is, shock banks’ fund liquidity lead force asset sale may depress asset prices, dire consequence market liquidity. the tension money market, generally fallout financial crisis, significant negative impact large complex bank group euro area. in first three quarter 2008, profitability suffer due unfavourable financial market condition and, increasingly, rise credit cost (i.e. gradually increase provision loan losses). chart 13 show wide dispersion rate return equity across euro area lcbgs observe second half 2007 persist also first three quarter 2008. institution low quartile profitability distribution major bank continue see significantly low profitability. moreover, lcbgs suffer substantial loss second half 2007 remain among weak one first three quarter 2008. at time, however, regulatory capital buff euro area lcbgs improve moderately consequence additional capital raise slow growth risk-weighted asset (as show chart 14). while largely due action individual bank aim reduce risk balance sheets, also reflected, certain degree, impact implementation basel ii. in addition, newly attract capital come form hybrid finance reach prudential limits. nevertheless, action take government central bank since october 2008 support bank system euro area countries, despite comfortable solvency ratios, highlight perceive fragility global financial markets. box 9 review analysis alternative way lcbgs reduce leverage

governor bank namibia, namswitch press conference, windhoek, 2 december 2008. * * * member medium md official bank institution my colleagues, official bank namibia present lady gentleman it great pleasure welcome bank namibia afternoon. we especially grateful medium practioners, share wonderful news member public, respond positively invitation. we also delight partner payment system reform initiative, bank institutions, join u press conference. once welcome. lady gentlemen, one bank namibia’s responsibility ensure financial stability. an efficient effective payment system key factor achieve financial stability. this mean individual business able pay good service transfer money one entity another entity manner safe, cost effective reasonably fast. for example person pay cheque, stable effective payment system would ensure payment secure money receive faster. lady gentlemen, invite share information milestone achieve namibian payment system reform initiative, undertake jointly bank namibia commercial banks. until long ago payment system highly integrate south africa. in fact namibia dependent heavily south africa’s payment system infrastructure clear settlement

challenge financial institution market dinner speech professor axel a weber, president deutsche bundesbank, joint bundesbank-cepr-cfs conference “risk transfer: challenge financial institution markets”, frankfurt main, 11 december 2008. * * * 1 introduction lady gentleman i wish extend warm welcome conference dinner occasion joint bundesbank-cepr-cfs conference frankfurt. the many aspect credit risk transfer (crt) address research paper – price subprime mortgage risk counterparty risk financial contract – reveal broad complex topic is. and current financial turmoil provide strike confirmation relevant topic is, crt may adversely affect financial stability. the different form crt play key role, least world wide discussion regulatory response crisis. i therefore believe conference present great opportunity researcher exchange find view risk transfer. however, i also hope make contribution current search adequate regulatory framework financial markets. in follow remarks, i would like comment briefly crt recent crisis measure taken. 2 credit risk transfer (crt) recent crisis when analyse economic event current financial crisis, usually helpful consult economic theory. in case crt general economic theory tell u crt is, principal, beneficial. first, may lead good risk allocation disconnect originator risky asset ultimate risk taker. second, refer result model hakenes schnabel present conference, good risk allocation provide scope socially beneficial project that, otherwise, would financed. finally, basel committee bank supervision point the joint forum credit risk transfer (2008), “crt make market price credit risk liquid transparent”. however, current financial crisis different method crt apply financial institution make negative headline newspapers: securitisation – financial institution (for example, ikb) engage american mortgage market financial product rmbs suffer major unexpected loss house price u start decline. credit default swap (cds) – some insurance company financial institution involve insure structure product link u mortgage market form cds. some experience large loss rescue government (for example, aig). the bankruptcy big credit risk insurer threaten insure financial institutions, often undervalue counterparty risk. the crisis may exacerbate way. off-balance-sheet vehicle – bank transfer credit risk off-balance-sheet vehicles, sivs conduits, order save capital costs. the business model vehicle build maturity transformation break lead liquidity problem bi review 158/2008 1 sivs conduits. owe reputation concerns, bank take suffer sivs conduit back balance sheet. this transfer credit liquidity risk back bank trigger loss confidence money market. all example show experience severe problem crt. i would therefore like pose two questions. what weakness crt markets? how change institutional framework order profit social benefit crt? 3 weakness crt market concern weakness crt markets, i would like draw attention general economic theory enable u identify fundamental problem well know economist. we deal problem wrong incentive economic agents, insufficient transparency, regulatory arbitrage. let point examples. moral hazard – one possible weakness crt market result securitisation subsequent distribution credit risk. once credit risk forwarded, incentive originator credit risk monitor debtor. hence, deal classical phenomenon moral hazard. the empirical result paper mora sowerbutts conference indicate theoretical reflection, present mechanism securitisation market. they show retain great fraction credit risk balance sheet originator significantly low probability default underlie loan. the problem may arise case crt via cds, parlour winton show paper. in theoretical model, monitor underlie loan inefficiently low bank free regulatory capital buy cds. the reason insure originator loan incentive monitor, insurer lack control rights. transparency – another weakness crt market result potential opaqueness. during past decade, experience hitherto unique process credit risk dispersion root u subprime market. the decodification actual degree entanglement still progress. in recently publish paper, gary b. gorton give detail description different step crt. and argue interlink securities, structure derivative make possible risk spread among many capital market participants, simultaneously result loss transparency risk ultimately end up. this loss transparency mean market participant evaluate credit risk adequately. in cdo market, example, inherent systemic risk certain cdo products, rmbs u house loans, take account. market participant often rely solely credit rat attract fact loan security large spread similarly-rated corporate bonds. the result increase demand product boost supply allow decline quality underlie loans. hence, securitisation “originate distribute” business model become attractive, highlight fact 2005-06 dealer firm transfer subprime risk investor originate period. in case credit derivatives, aspect heighten lack transparency. the vast majority agreement make counter. this aggravate misevaluation counterparty risk, also cause evaluation problem concern systemic risk cd market. this, turn, exacerbate uncertainty loss confidence among market participants. regulatory arbitrage – in addition, well-functioning market general stake market participant usually try find method evade regulatory regimes. financial institution shift credit risk off-balance-sheet vehicle typical form regulatory arbitrage. in so, bank use loophole old regulatory regime, 2 bi review 158/2008 capture vehicles. this loophole close introduction basel ii. 4 change institutional framework but change institutional framework order avoid mention friction financial market gain social benefit crt? for one year, international institutions, central banks, politician work together lesson learn financial crisis. at summit financial market world economy hold new york november year, head state g20 agree “common principle reform financial markets”. international institutions, imf fsf, publish valuable report recommendation possible improvement financial architecture. furthermore, national central bank contribute expertise discussion. however, order achieve improvement financial architecture substantially strengthen financial stability, in-depth analysis underlie reason crisis essential. in respect, economic research take place university various institution great importance. for reason, economic research strong voice current debate. i therefore believe event conference important. but let come back question adequate change institutional framework. a surely imagine, great number aspect i could mention point. however, i fear would go beyond scope speech. i shall therefore confine mention two measures, taken. central counterparty (ccp) otc derivative – the first measure aim enhance transparency cd market implement one ccps otc derivatives. the advantage would reduction market participants’ open position due net well good management possible reduction counterparty risk – example, guarantee fund insurance schemes. in addition, implementation ccp could accompany disclosure requirement cd position originator. these requirement could also mitigate mention moral hazard problem case forward credit risk via cds. a parlour winton show paper, reputation mechanism may partly solve problem inefficient monitor incentive originator. disclosure requirement prerequisite reputation mechanism, market participant know track record originator. regulator side atlantic unanimously agree need implementation ccp otc derivatives. however, ongoing debate specific design institution. the first step towards implementation ccp initiate new york feed aim single ccp locate us. more recently, govern council ecb discuss idea additional european ccp. the bundesbank favour “european solution” eurosystem able influence oversee market infrastructure without restrictions, especially time financial turmoil. retention share securitised product balance sheet originator – another concept objective solve moral hazard problem arise securitisation credit risk. the idea originator retain share securitised product balance sheet, incentive monitor underlie loan remains. european commissioner mccreevy propose 5% retention securitised product balance sheet originator ecofin council agree proposal meet 2 december. consequently, issue discuss european parliament. bi review 158/2008 3 the bundesbank general agree european commission’s proposal step right direction term avoid moral hazard problem arise securitisation. therefore, bundesbank welcome decision take ecofin. 5 conclude remark so storyline concern crt – story continual trade-off financial regulator benefit free market threat market failures. and i would like emphasise i believe struggle right regulatory framework go on. certainly, learn crisis enhance regulation supervision order erase source crisis. however, financial market generate new financial products; emerge new form incentive problems, insufficient transparency, regulatory arbitrage. financial regulator well researcher field financial regulation bear mind development financial market threaten financial stability identify soon possible. thank much attention. 4 bi review 158/2008 savenaca narube: launch fiji’s new coin address mr savenaca narube, governor reserve bank fiji, official launch fiji’s new coin series, suva, 11 december 2008. * * * cabinet minister member board reserve bank fiji distinguish guest introduction let add warm welcome thank accept invitation launch new coins. we believe noteworthy milestone history nation reserve bank fiji. a i explain later, change coin complicate difficult change currency notes. the logistics arrangement different. we change currency note several time perhaps every ten year so. however change coin rare thing do. we may therefore witness “once life time” event. for us, may never experience again. so, special occasion. we therefore extremely glad could join u celebration. christmas also around corner good time celebration well. history coin date back early record history. shell even turtle use trade early years. a trader come islands, bring foreign coins. british, german, mexican even russian coin co-circulated fiji time. fiji mint first coin 1934. some u may still remember penny half penny hole middle. they make popular souvenir days. i sure many u still remember three penny shillings. while change currency note several times, almost 40 year since change coin penny shill decimal currency 13 january 1969. in 1969 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cent 20 cents. the 50 cent one dollar still banknote paper form. we convert 50 cent note coin 1975 one dollar 1995. these coin remain basically today. a i said, change coin frequently change currency notes. there one good reason coin get counterfeit much currency note do. why? there two obvious reasons. the first mint coin saw video complicate expansive process. second, would imagine, return counterfeit coin pretty small. but interestingly stop set bogus mint press past. why change coin now? you may ask: why change coin now? let explain: bi review 158/2008 1 • firstly, price base metal use coin production increase dramatically. this increase make central bank change metal composition coins. this significantly reduce cost mint them. • secondly, technology allow innovative mint technique make efficient use base metals. again, reduce costs. • thirdly, reduce size coins. many country do this. small light coin much cheap mint. not that, handle cost also reduced. so, change coin basically reduce cost mint handling. these cost continue increase demand cash continue rise. the cashless society yet fully eventuate i think time yet. why drop one two cent coins? we take opportunity also review structure coins. in so, drop one two cents. this follow reasons: • one, value low denomination coin like one two cent drop significantly. this increase price good services. a result, one two cent coin circulate well. people simply leave jars, drawer forth. it therefore make good sense stop mint them. • two, cost mint low denomination coin face value. for instance, cost mint one cent coin four time face value even cheap metal composition. so, coin lie idle jar drawers, spend lot money mint new ones. this clear waste public funds. • third, business bank continue incur high cost handle transport fresh supply coin year year out. a significant change always incite people’s concerns. this understandable. so let take opportunity answer concern cessation one two cent coins. • some say inflationary. i say experience new zealand around world clearly show not. • others say that, allow continuous series currencies. i say nice theory. in reality, really need whatsoever continuous series. • lastly, others say gain multiplier effect money negate loss mint coins. i say gain much, much mint them. they circulate way point mint first place. i strongly believe benefit cease one two cent coin far outweigh cost retain decision fully serf interest nation. should coin two dollars? on end coin scale, rise prices, low denominate currency note convert coins, move cut costs. the note last five years. coin last much longer. for precise reason 2 bi review 158/2008 coin fifty cent 1975 one dollar note 1995. in public survey, ask people want also coin two dollar australia new zealand done, answer clear no. therefore, coin two dollar guess seriously consider sooner rather later. learn rest world i would like say benefit lot experience country notably new zealand issue new coin two year ago. the reserve bank new zealand do lot work evaluate various option coins. they willingly share result research us. they also help u provide technical expertise. i would therefore like express sincere appreciation gratitude reserve bank new zealand immense assistance support. we honour today company mr. brian lang, former head currency reserve bank new zealand. mr. lang visit fiji 2006 help u technical evaluations. currency review today, launch fiji’s new coin smaller, thin light exist ones. this change already commence cease issue one two cent coin commercial bank october 13 year. let put process big prospective. we decide back 2002 review entire currency – note coins. we decide work note first culminate last year issue new currency banknote include one hundred dollar note. i glad say new paper currency widely accept people fiji. the use one hundred dollar bill much rapid fifty dollar bill first introduced. today mark completion whole currency review launch new series coins. the entire journey take u 7 years. we please result far. i confident country also accept new coin launch today. unlike banknotes, change coin much complex process. the logistical issue many. for instance, stop issue one two cents, rush return coin commercial bank even though still legal tender. we have, now, collect around 120 ton one two cents. this lot weight transport. it also require lot space store 120 ton coins. a collect old coins, logistics intensify. cabinet approval i wish assure everyone obtain necessary approval law. under reserve bank fiji act, approval minister finance require change currency either note coins. we keep minister cabinet fully inform progress throughout currency review. we seek obtain cabinet’s approval new coin cessation one two cent 11 march 2008. bi review 158/2008 3 mint in march year, board award tender royal canadian mint production five year supply new coins. the contract value approximately 7.8 million fiji dollar (us $4.2 million). royal canadian mint mint fiji coin past recognise one lead innovative mint world. we extremely happy continue association royal canadian mint. how much save fiji? our new coin average nine (9) percent smaller, forty three (43) percent lighter, twenty one (21) percent thinner. how much save get change coins? if produce quantity current coins, would cost u eight million fiji dollar more. we save five million dollar mint one two cent coin three million dollar reduce size, weight metallic composition. these save also apply re-order coin future. hence, assume change coin another forty years, save amount 100 million dollars. save handling, transportation storage the benefit save end there. due significant reduction size weight new coins, individual business save substantial cost term transportation, handle storage. assistance visually impair some express concern visually impair find difficult differentiate value new coins. but, new currency notes, take account need u visually impaired. for first time, introduce vary edge designs. these serve effective identification differentiate feature visually impair well general public. coin differentiate size also edgings. different coin different edgings. this help greatly coin size. the five (5) cent coin plain edge ten (10) cent serrate rough edge. the twenty (20) cent close size ten (10) cent intermit serrations. design let turn briefly design coins. when change currency note also change designs. however, new coins, retain exist design front back. why? we think current design still relevant appropriate. they reflect directly culture heritage. in addition, leave design unchanged make change new coin much easier. they make new coin easy identify. multi-ply technology metal composition the metal composition coin different. our new coin manufacture royal canadian mint “multi-ply” layers. multi-ply technology patent royal canadian mint offer great security, reliability durability reduce mint costs. 4 bi review 158/2008 multi-ply technology give coin unique electromagnetic signature (ems) modern coin vend machine program differentiate different denominations. the technology enable coin similar size weight different electromagnetic signature allow vend machine program accept one other. simply put, cannot put foreign coin vend machine anymore. these machine easily program recognise accept fiji coin only. these would give few headache city council vend machine operator let alone increase revenue take. be say really work? yes do. we already test coin park meter vend machine encounter problem all. durability i mention achieve improvement low cost without sacrifice durability. rigorous test show coin resistant corrosion tropical country like household products. on average, coin life span approximately 25 years. these test result corroborate independent test conduct reserve bank new zealand evaluation. public awareness such major change require comprehensive public awareness campaigns. we start already. after launch today, go inform public new coin go next three months. the campaign commence newspaper advertisement supplement december. television advertisement start january 2009. all conduct three languages. we also send team rural area ensure message filter section community. issuance what plan implement change new coins? the new coin issue circulation 13 january 2009, 40th anniversary decimal currency fiji. the new old coin co-circulate three month 31 march 2009. this give reserve bank fiji time work commercial bank public logistics extract old coin circulation replace new. we receive excellent cooperation commercial bank cessation exercise look forward continue cooperation. when change currency note last year, old new note circulate side side now. you may ask: why thing new old coins? the answer new coin different dimension weight old ones. if old circulate new, create huge problem identification, counting, handle less extent coin machines. that allow short time two set coin circulate together withdraw old ones. old coin our old coins, include 1 2 cent coin officially demonetise 31 march 2009 mean cease legal tender 01 april 2009. from onwards get value old coin reserve bank fiji. a approach date, public remind public relation exercise. bi review 158/2008 5 what old coins? we intend sell metallic content receive several interest area. conclude remark i conclude say i believe excellent set currency note coin fully serve need well future. the new currency note well received. i confident new coin also receive acceptance. i much pleasure officially launch new coins. i wish merry christmas happy new year. 6 bi review 158/2008 jürgen stark: issue paper conference "the financial crisis consequence world economy" speech mr jürgen stark, member executive board european central bank, conference organise aktionsgemeinschaft soziale marktwirtschaft e.v. eberhard-karls-universität tübingen, tübingen, 10 december 2008. * * * i. background for one year experience correction process unsustainable trend financial sector. this correction process deepen – particular since lehman brother file chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 15 september 2008 – regard magnitude complexity evolve fully fledge financial crisis. the recent intensification increase fear global slowdown also negatively affect outlook economic growth euro area. the crisis start u rise delinquency subprime mortgage market trigger turbulence subprime mortgage-backed security market. these tension spread asset-backed markets, money markets, financial institutions, effect gradually felt market segments, across borders, economies. this crisis already lead substantial structural change financial sector particular us. some prominent financial firm disappear investment bank model us, introduce glass-seagall act 1933 response great depression tension u bank sector, long exists. in country financial sector likely shrink, least temporarily. although financial correction process painful, unavoidable constitute correction exuberance past induce search yield underestimation risk overly benign macroeconomic environment low interest inflation rates. ii. reason emergence financial crisis a distinction make macroeconomic microeconomic factors. for many year financial market participant use macroeconomic environment high global output growth, low inflation low interest rates. macroeconomic policy lead global domestic imbalance become increasingly unsustainable debt finance over-consumption one region high save regions. an overall benign macroeconomic environment lead (i) general carelessness tendency under-price risk (ii) search yield turn accelerate financial innovation. the main manifestation financial innovation extraordinary expansion credit risk transfer instrument permit transfer, hedge active trade credit risk separate asset class. the financial instrument become increasingly complex speed innovation amplified. example include credit default swap (cdss) and, particular, structure credit products, collateralised debt obligation (cdos), back cash instruments, primitive securities, loan asset-backed securities, derivative claims, cd cdos themselves. the expansion product contribute to, support strengthen originate-and-distribute (o&d) business model financial bi review 158/2008 1 intermediation. rather hold credit originated, credit institution increasingly sell – possibly repackaging – capital market. the advocator new financial instrument praise facilitator efficient distribution risk. however, instrument eliminate credit risk. therefore, high speed innovation instruments’ increase complexity well explode trade also point potential weakness require significant vigilance party involved, i.e. originators, investors, rat agency supervisors. thus, “creative destruction” turn “destructive creation”. however, crisis prof institutional framework keep pace fast speed innovation. in particular, lack adequate check balance level control lead increase vulnerability risks. • financial institutions: weak risk liquidity management frameworks; specifically, management supervisory board financial institution live ultimate responsibility regard risk management; risk management model keep pace increase complexity financial instrument properly take account potential illiquidity market segments. • rat agency external auditors: model assessment fail adequately evaluate financial risk attach financial innovations. • supervisory authorities: serious attempt make stem trend search yield accelerate financial innovation good times; adequate monitor system place particular regard ultimate exposure mortgage back security new complex structure financial product regard off-balance sheet entities. iii. effect financial crisis real economy external environment at global level, outlook advance economy worsen significantly financial crisis start spread emerge markets. in 2009, major advance economy experience weak zero growth time. the outlook u economy remain gloomy. forecast international organisation see 2009 average growth near zero. the growth outlook emerge market economy weaken dramatically. the imf eu commission see global growth 2.2 2.3% 2009, respectively, 3.7% year. the depth duration global economic downturn crucially depend development financial crisis. at current juncture, market volatility uncertainty remain extremely high. global inflationary pressure ease due global economic downturn fall commodity prices. all all, global inflation outlook improved. euro area the significant intensification financial crisis since mid september greatly affect outlook short-term economic growth euro area. however, economy already hit significant commodity price increase ongoing correction house market euro area countries. 2 bi review 158/2008 after two negative quarter economic growth, gdp growth 4th quarter 2008 come quarter weak. this reflect subdue outlook external domestic demand tight finance conditions. the assumption december 2008 broad macroeconomic projection exercise significantly revise compare september 2008 ecb staff macroeconomic projection exercise. however, bear mind uncertainty surround projection particularly high juncture. accord projection result euro area, gdp growth project experience protract period subdue growth (2008: 0.8%-1.2%; 2009: -1.0%-0.0%; 2010: 0.5%-1.5%), dampen domestic external demand. the european commission forecast growth near zero 2009 quarterly growth rate remain low q2 2010. more recently, imf oecd see euro area recession 2009 (around -1/2%). uncertainty extremely high risk downside. inflationary pressure risk euro area diminish amidst weaken demand, decline commodity price recede pipeline pressures. since july year – hicp inflation 4% – inflation recently substantially declined, read 2.1% november. in process disinflation might even see negative inflation rate couple month region euro area. over policy-relevant horizon, inflation rate expect line price stability, support purchase power income savings. the eurosystem staff projection foresee annual hicp inflation rate 3.2% 3.4% 2008 decline rate 1.1% 1.7% 2009. monthly inflation expect reach trough summer rebound end 2009. for 2010, hicp project lie 1.5% 2.1%. in context, financial analyst discus risk deflation. however, term use caution mix disinflation. it important distinguish between: • on one hand “strong disinflation” “temporary mild deflation”, transitory nature stem primarily substantial decline energy prices. • on hand, genuine “deflationary dynamics”, characterise persistent self-sustaining character, broad base effect across price components, entrenchment expectations. however, stress risk appear limit give continue anchor longer-term inflation expectation level consistent price stability, wage price stickiness still sustain pace monetary dynamics. by contrast, upside tail-risks inflation receive le attention – may relevant strong source concern medium long term. various estimate underlie broad money point sustain moderate rate monetary expansion euro area. monetary trend therefore support view inflationary pressure diminish further, risk remain upside medium long term. the late monetary data end october 2008 point continue moderation growth rate loan non-financial sector. so far, hard data support view dry availability loans. iv. crisis management resolution whatever politician decide already go decide: consider medium long term effect actions. the measure take today prepare grind future imbalances. this true both, monetary fiscal policy. bi review 158/2008 3 what ecb do since begin financial turmoil the mandate ecb maintain price stability medium term. this mandate must adhere normal time time crisis. the monetary policy stance appropriate fulfil ecb’s mandate depend exclusively assessment balance risk price stability, nothing else. the ecb show remarkable flexibility term liquidity provision. this flexibility necessary order avoid breakdown interbank market, important transmission channel monetary policy. give extraordinary situation, take extraordinary decisions. however, measure temporary nature only, i.e. market participant get accustom enhance role central bank intermediation. since 8 october cut policy rate three time overall reduction 175 basis points. these move short period time unprecedented. a monetary policy decision forward look medium term oriented, recent rate cut 75 basis point take account inflation rate decline quarter come risk inflation downside medium term. by adopt forward look attitude “double counting” news, may first influence decision via anticipation materialise, avoided. after substantial rate cut remain room manoeuvre limited, potentially allow small step only. have one instrument hand limit achieve cannot achieve single instrument recognised. the key ecb interest rate currently 2.5%. the president ecb make clear decrease 175 basis point within two month exactly appropriate take account available information. new relevant information euro area allow serious re-assessment outlook price stability likely available february march 2009. fiscal policies’ reaction the write downs1 loss bank sector reduce capital base bank implicitly capacity lend. in welcome coordinate effort, euro area government provide support bank system, notably offer fund recapitalisation guarantee interbank loans. to date, envelope fund possible recapitalisations guarantee amount €2,000 billion, roughly 20% euro area gdp. these measure crucial protect economy harm, key stimulate economic activity. at time, may imply considerable fiscal burden. public debt deficit ratio may increase substantially, fiscal sustainability may come pressure. on top this, call substantial fiscal stimulus programme euro area countries, number country already announce approve significant fiscal support. for instance, german parliament approve fiscal stimulus package (1.3% gdp) 2009 2010 french government announce stimulus package total 1.5% gdp (2009-2011). but, many euro-area government fail use past boom time consolidate public finances. a consequence, enter current downturn high deficit 1 in euro area total writedowns capital raise large complex bank group bank since second quarter 2007 amount $129.2 bn $138.7 bn respectively (us: writedowns: $421.4 bn, capital raised: $354.7 bn; uk switzerland: writedowns: $136.4 bn, capital raised: $164.1 bn). source: bloomberg. 4 bi review 158/2008 debt ratios. give weak growth ahead cost bank bailouts, ratio set increase. it likely that, year’s time, deficit many euro-area country 5% 7% 3% now, public debt may rise 10 20 percentage points. against backdrop, current call particularly loose application european union’s framework fiscal rule question credibility politicians’ commitment sound public finances. in environment, clear risk additional stimulus programme may erode, rather restore, public confidence. a result, household may prefer raise savings, thus counteract fiscal stimulus know soon pay today’s fiscal deficits. from experience gain 1970s, know promise reverse stimulus measure crisis frequently kept. in many european countries, result ever-increasing public expenditure debt ratios, place burden economy even today. the introduction stability growth pact 1998 mark break undisciplined policy past. it also provide necessary flexibility allow budget adjust line economic fluctuations. but pact provide government attempt fine-tune economy mean fiscal policies. the experience first 10 year pact show government find challenge comply rule set themselves. but pact help correct high deficit reverse increase debt ratios. it essential public’s confidence soundness fiscal policy preserved. this require fiscal sustainability guaranteed. the stability growth pact must fully apply integrity preserved. the automatic fiscal stabilizer euro area amount 1% gdp. they provide powerful source fiscal support weaken economy. and type stimulus automatically reverse economic condition improve. only country scope take additional action. where room manoeuvre exists, additional budgetary measure targeted, timely temporary (“three t’s”) order effective. in current circumstances, cannot, not, risk add fiscal crisis financial turmoil economic downturn. v. lesson learn current financial turmoil there need new global financial system (bretton-woods ii) create new international institution scratch. rather, need strengthen exist institutional framework enhance general principle ensure smooth function market economies: stability-oriented macroeconomic policies; high competition markets; protection property rights; freedom contract; unlimited liability. a regard macroeconomic policies, medium term orient gear towards price stability sound public finances. the commitment price stability sound public finance best contribution monetary fiscal policy euro area make financial stability. there trade-off price stability financial stability also trade-off sound public finance financial stability. a regard institutional framework financial sector, accept even tight regulation cannot prevent financial crisis. however, clear benefit tight regulation large think quarter ago. hence, need realistic assessment cost benefit tight regulation. new regulation set general principle rather draw long list discretionary measures, necessarily incomplete invite renew regulatory arbitrage. new regulation bi review 158/2008 5 • cover possible state nature rather provide automatic stabiliser financial system general term; • strengthen incentive improve discipline force competition; • discourage “short-termism” promote medium long-term attitude financial agent towards success stability; • prevent financial innovation important growth employment; • strengthen time concept liability responsibility. it must clear engage risky activity hold accountable risk materialise. there already important initiative provide guidance consistent regulatory standard international basis: • the g20 approve set international standard code sound regulatory framework. however, implementation lag behind. • the financial stability forum already develop recommendation resilience market institution cause financial turmoil. there particular five area concern address strengthen institutional framework financial sector: • risk management banks: both bank management supervisor play active role scrutinise risk management practice (internal check balances, clear line responsibilities, etc.), especially regard off-balance sheet entity structure products. this hold true time crisis maybe even important good time risk le obvious. • management liquidity risk: bank management enhance liquidity management practice address liquidity risk day-to-day business along line “principles sound liquidity risk management supervision” provide basel committee. • credit rat agencies: rat methodology fail capture risk embody structure product investor rely heavily external ratings. rat agency enhance transparency comply relevant code conduct. more differentiate rat system structure product adopted. conflict interest avoid particular acute rat agency also offer consult services. • valuation, disclosure accounting: weakness account standard gap regard valuation structure product contribute current crisis. bank develop robust pricing, risk management stress test model improve disclosure practices. supervisor account standard setter advance transparency disclosure standard off-balance sheet vehicles. they reassess valuation assets, special focus mark-to-market approach give potentially pro-cyclical effects. • strengthen capital adequacy: supervisor adequately account risk associate new complex financial instruments. some financial engineer recent year focus repackaging weak credit high-rated securities, receive favourable risk weigh capital adequacy standards. the respective prudential norm rat scheme reassess also view make financial instrument le complex. 6 bi review 158/2008 the o&d business model financial intermediation disappear become transparent. it also consider whether originator always keep certain percentage offload credit package balance sheet. in order increase capital buff bank need hold regard illiquid structure product off-balance sheet activities, capital adequacy provision within basel ii framework also enhance areas. vi. conclusion the current global financial distress economic downturn pose challenge significant unprecedented nature ecb, central bank policy maker around globe. during financial turmoil euro area, monetary union institutional set prove resilience capacity act decisively promptly. national measure coordinate pragmatic manner view enhance effectiveness mutual reinforcement. all self-evident. we forget europe would look today without euro. the euro area country would significantly bad off. multiple crisis would arise simultaneously: currency crisis would go hand hand bank crisis real economy disruption country level, potentially end political tension countries. by eliminate exchange rate channel, euro mitigate risk contagion stem national economic financial crises. in sense, euro important stabilise element difficult times. bi review 158/2008 7 jean-claude trichet: european financial integration speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, 23. internationale zinsforum ”zinsen 2009”, frankfurt main, 11 december 2008. * * * lady gentlemen, i would like thank organiser invitation speak european financial integration zinsforum. the challenge time experience provide excellent opportunity exchange think topic great interest ecb. more integrate financial market important realise full potential single market. but also make execution single monetary policy euro area efficient, obviously key importance ecb. my speech today two major themes. i start address current stage financial integration process europe. the introduction euro single currency quantum leap integration process; i believe effort still need make objective competitive safe single market financial service come true. i convince process first foremost market-driven. but i also believe public authority role foster financial integration europe. this particularly true come support private sector coordinate action reduce policy-related obstacle cross-border activities. the second theme i address today backdrop european financial integration regulatory supervisory initiative take recently light ongoing financial crisis. these pertain manage crisis prevent recurrence future. i believe continue effort need regard, particular enhance cooperation among authorities. the state european financial integration but go assessment state financial integration, i briefly elaborate reason behind interest topic. for ecb, financial integration end itself, relevant number issue important us. first, financial integration matter ecb contribute efficient function monetary union. integrate financial market support effective transmission single monetary policy throughout euro area smooth operation underlie payment systems. financial integration also increase depth liquidity financial markets, consequently enhance resilience european financial system. in addition, offer possibility geographical risk diversification. obviously, resilient financial system highly relevant ecb’s task contribute safeguard financial stability. second, generally, integrate financial market help realise full economic potential european union, also recall lisbon strategy. financial integration contribute development financial system increase competition expand markets, result low intermediation cost efficient allocation capital. these effects, turn, raise potential increase economic growth.1 1 for example, study london economics estimate integration european bond equity market could result additional gdp growth around 1% ten-year period, bi review 157/2008 1 for reason i come mention, ecb always strong supporter european financial integration process. we therefore monitor development area closely, present view annual report financial integration europe.2 a matter fact, start work third report, intend publish spring 2009. let give overview assessment current state play various financial markets. we develop number quantitative indicator track integration money, bond, equity bank market euro area. these indicator show that, since introduction single currency, integration advance significantly. however, progress also uneven across financial markets. two main conclusion stand regard: first, integration typically advance market close single monetary policy. second, also depend degree integration relate market infrastructures. in order highlight role infrastructures, i would particular like mention long history success target, eurosystem real-time gross settlement facility euro payments. this system since 1999 enable safe efficient euro-area wide handle interbank payment transactions. the enhance version system, target2, provide since completion migration national central bank may 2008 single share platform euro wholesale payments. a result, even integrate efficient payment landscape. indeed, target2 first market infrastructure completely integrate harmonise european level! target2 process daily average nearly 400,000 transactions, daily average value 2.6 trillion euro. this position target2 one large payment system world – together fedwire unite states, cls, international system settle foreign exchange transactions. this success large-value payment system integration instrumental achieve sustain financial integration money market. the evolution towards single market observe term cross-country standard deviation unsecured interbank lend rates. these decrease negligible level two three basis point almost immediately introduction euro, indicate near-perfect integration. bond market also show clear sign integration. we observe past ten years, bond yield increasingly drive factor common euro area, rather purely local factors. at time, euro area investor see progressively diversify portfolio cross-border basis. currently, euro area resident almost 60% total bond portfolio euro area cross-border bond holdings. it interest see recent financial crisis affect evolution financial integration indicator money government bond markets. in markets, spread standard deviation rate across euro area country increase 2008. the turmoil 2007 seem affect unsecured money market rates. the recent intensification, however, lead rise cross-country standard deviation one- twelve-month secure money market rate well, usual level 1.5 basis point 5-6 basis points. the key question much recent divergence allocate factor relate financial integration, much origin factors. to approximately 100 billion euro. see london economics (2002), “quantification macroeconomic impact integration eu financial markets”, report european commission. 2 see report financial integration europe http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/financialintegrationineurope200804en.pdf. 2 bi review 157/2008 precise, high spread result high counterparty risk increase risk aversion necessarily point segment market, rather root general change investor behaviour. increase liquidity risk, hand, could well indicate market segmentation. our preliminary analysis confirm that, although general factor play large role increase spread standard deviations, also find indication increase liquidity risk. however, i would like stress assessment make juncture still preliminary. we yet storm, complete thorough analysis wait time come. my message point time u remain commit continuous integration process european financial markets, resist tendency focus national market tension. let u therefore lose momentum uncertain times. i turn equity markets, considerably hard measure financial integration. this least stock return le directly comparable across country return money government bond markets. notwithstanding difficulty, assessment show sign continuously increase integration, currently, indication trend affect financial crisis. for example, euro area resident double share euro area cross-border hold past ten year slightly one third total equity holdings. moreover, accord indicators, integration seem advance fast european global level. at time, country-specific factor still play significant role equity markets, least continue fragmentation post-trading infrastructure. a pan-european infrastructure security clear settlement eu would therefore certainly provide new impetus integration. equity market offer nice entry point make aware new type indicator currently developing. financial integration important, factor contribute efficiency financial system. there indeed relevant factors, degree financial development quality framework within financial market operate. in ecb process extend analysis financial integration development financial markets. we understand financial development broadly process financial innovation organisational improvements. this include development reduce asymmetric information; increase completeness markets; add possibility engage financial transaction contracts; reduce transaction costs; increase competition. the idea extend work financial integration financial development go back ecofin council’s invitation 2006 “monitor ass relevant institutional feature hind efficient function financial system”. one financial development indicator measure level venture capital financing. venture capital indeed attractive additional source corporate financing, provide finance young small, research-based firms, typically face constraint traditional markets. our indicator show rise venture capital finance europe recent years; however, start level low. more precisely, euro area average last five year amount 0.02% gdp, compare 0.1% unite states. therefore, i see room investigate way promote development type market well. the final market i want include overview state financial integration bank market. again, bank market offer nice illustration important underlie infrastructure is. the wholesale capital market-related segment support target2 and, surprisingly, well integrated. for example, cross-border interbank loan account quarter total interbank loans, banks’ intra euro area cross-border hold bank security almost triple past decade. by contrast, corporate retail bank market remain fragment far, bi review 157/2008 3 also reflect multiplicity exist payment systems. for instance, euro area cross-border loan non-banks remain low levels, currently 6% total. similarly, cross-country dispersion banks’ interest rate loan firm household remain relatively high, especially regard consumer loans. now, ecb eurosystem work hard address remain gap financial integration, particular come market infrastructures. the year 2008 mark launch two important project regard: target2-securities sepa. the eurosystem’s target2-securities, t2s, initiative establish pan-european security settlement platform, cross-border transaction settle price efficiently domestic transactions. moreover, t2s settlement cost significantly low cost domestic transaction today. in addition pure settlement cost, bank user would also achieve back-office collateral savings. the t2s user requirement result intensive cooperation hundred expert market participants, service provider central bankers. by july 2008, receive support euro area central security depository continuation project, subject certain conditions. consequently, 17 july govern council ecb formally approve t2s project. the pan-european settlement platform schedule go live 2013. importantly retail bank sector, single euro payment area, sepa, launch january 2008. sepa aim achieve fully integrate market retail payment service euro area, mean harmonise technical standard market practices. with sepa, distinction anymore cross-border domestic payments. the european commission estimate sepa could bring substantial benefit next six years. moreover, benefit would significantly increase sepa use electronic invoicing! the main priority stakeholder make every possible effort implement sepa timely full. the final hurdle – definition difficult market integration project ambition, size complexity – need overcome. without go much detail, bank competition authority urgently need come understand regard future inter-bank price model retail payment market. finally, study ecb european commission clearly show long parallel process old national new sepa instrument costly bank customers. consequently, period dual process keep short possible. the eurosystem therefore voice support set realistic ambitious end-date sepa migration. regulatory supervisory initiative i turn second major theme speech. these recent regulatory supervisory initiative europe closely relate financial integration particularly relevant light ongoing financial crisis. a i mention earlier, financial integration present large potential benefit european economy. at time, also pose important challenge supervisory authority central banks. indeed, integrate market increase shock-absorbing capacity financial system, shock may propagate quickly, thereby affect wide number range market participants. in way, large, systemically relevant cross-border financial institution would clearly implication financial stability event run problems. 4 bi review 157/2008 these challenge become quite evident past months. the financial crisis underscore importance appropriate public policy crisis prevention crisis management. i start crisis prevention. in face increase market integration, european supervisor confront long-standing challenge ensure action effective efficient. or put differently: balance need action contribute preserve financial stability, time avoid create unnecessary regulatory burden supervise entities. a major step achieve introduction lamfalussy process, promote efficient effective regulation supervision eu financial service sector past years. the lamfalussy process initially create purpose accelerate adoption regulatory measure relate financial service action plan security sector. over time addition assume important function supervisory convergence cooperation whole financial sector. the eurosystem outset fully support lamfalussy process. a review lamfalussy process eu institution lead ecofin adopt number recommendation december 2007 good exploit full potential approach. the implementation recommendation currently well way. to begin with, early year level 3 committee supervisor introduce possibility qualify majority vote charters; member comply oblige explain decision so. this improve effectiveness committees’ decision-making processes. moreover, committee submit annual work programme commission, european council european parliament, thereby enhance accountability activities. finally, european commission include explicit reference specific tasks, mediation facilitation information exchange, decision establish committees. a lot emphasis recently place creation strengthen college supervisor european cross-border banks. a may know, main task college organise cooperation share information home host supervisory authority member state cross-border bank significant activities. in may 2008, ecofin recommend strengthen role college extend use bank group cross-border activity eu. the establishment college supervisor accompany clarification legal framework. the commission propose amendment capital requirement directive (crd) enhance legal underpinnings colleges. these amendment pertain particular interplay consolidate supervisor, chair college, authority responsible significant branch subsidiary cross-border group. now allow make comment regard envisage role college supervisor commission’s proposal. in general, i believe college improve supervisory cooperation, particular regard effectiveness, efficiency consistency supervisory action. first, term effectiveness, college facilitate information exchange cross-border group enable involve supervisor full knowledge overall risk profile group. moreover, college improve coordination supervision risk assessment, regard consolidate solo supervision, arrange division tasks. second, college time become main supervisory interface bank groups. this would lead high efficiency, unnecessary duplication supervisory requirement avoided. bi review 157/2008 5 third, common legal underpinnings college revise crd ensure consistency across colleges. in addition, ecb support work cebs develop operational guidelines. these guideline aim align work procedure colleges, efficacy decision-making bodies, coherence practice use across colleges. however, remain see whether framework suffice, whether improvement needed. the key challenge lie implementation. let mention example regard. first, effectiveness college depend ability facilitate decision-making bank group whole. the crd expect introduce rule decision-making process authority disagree essential decision concern supervision cross-border bank groups. recent event clearly underscore swift decision-making essence; cannot afford cumbersome decision-making process case disagreements. second, coordination role level 3 committee would critical importance ensure consistency supervisory action across colleges. finally, let stress importance effective information exchange. first, communication home host supervisor within college crucial full understand risk profile group. second, financial turmoil highlight importance information share central bank supervisor identification assessment risk financial stability. move crisis prevention crisis management, i would like stress well coordinate action public authority instrumental limit possible cross-border spillover recent crisis. to illustrate point, let quickly recall eurosystem central bank ensure adequate access central bank fund liquidity-constrained solvent banks. governments, part, concert coordinate manner grant guarantee new issuance bank debt. they addition commit provide bank additional capital resources, jointly decide raise level protection deposits. the eurosystem contribute work propose set recommendation appropriate framework grant government guarantee recapitalisation measure financially sound banks. with regard government guarantees, eurosystem recommendation provide overarch objective also specific parameter price system. in recommendations, stress importance support solvent liquidity constrain bank preserve level play field. in addition, consistency eurosystem’s liquidity management ensure impair implementation single monetary policy. with regard recapitalisation measures, eurosystem, collaboration european commission, also contribute elaborate common framework price different form capitalisation instruments. these measure aim strengthen capital position fundamentally sound bank restore smooth flow credit economy. at time, aim preserve level play field avoid undue distortion competition. it addition important ensure temporary nature government measure preserve private investor discouraged. the methodology eurosystem incorporate commission’s communication recapitalisation financial institutions. finally, coordinate action important grant state deposit guarantees. we saw initially uncoordinated initiative immediately lead spill-overs potential 6 bi review 157/2008 detrimental effect bank country enjoy similar level protection. timely concert action among member state lead joint decision raise level protection deposits. the action accompany prompt initiative commission amend deposit guarantee scheme directive. this amendment full support ecb. the recent event show member state eu institution act rapid coordinate manner necessary. however, room complacency. consideration lesson financial crisis introduction improvement eu framework supervision crisis management already started. in october, european commission set independent high level group develop proposal strengthen supervision european financial institution market financial stability arrangements. the group shall present report european commission view spring european council 2009. i assure ecb govern council examine carefully proposal make high level group, well european parliament industry itself. conclusion lady gentlemen, continue financial integration key importance europe. the financial crisis currently face may cause freeze development markets; i urge u keep momentum important process. the ecb remain firmly commit foster financial integration. the success target target2 demonstrate importance work do field market infrastructures. we continue work hard order address still remain gaps. finally, financial crisis confirm importance appropriate public policy response, term crisis prevention crisis management, avoid cross-border spillover single market. strong coordination among member state eu institution crisis prevention crisis management needed. the ecb closely follow debate contribute necessary. i thank attention. bi review 157/2008 7 philipp hildebrand: current state swiss financial system lesson learn introductory remark mr philipp hildebrand, member govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 11 december 2008. * * * when publish report financial stability six month ago, i talk important lesson snb learn financial crisis. today, brief assessment current state financial system, i would like tell progress follow-up lessons. the focus capital liquidity regulation. finally, i speak briefly cheerful topic unrelated financial crisis – launch new series swiss banknotes. the economic environment sharply deteriorate ... a already hear mr roth, economic environment sharply deteriorated. the three big economic bloc – europe, japan u – recession, growth emerge economy slow markedly. for switzerland, also expect period negative growth. the situation u real estate market yet stabilised. future case-shiller index indicate drop price around 15% 2010. thereafter, contract suggest price stabilise. fall price also observe european countries, particular english irish real estate markets. the past week see calm global financial markets, still long way away normalisation. with worldwide deterioration economy, credit risk bank rise considerably. attention draw june 2008, last report financial stability. bank provision credit risk currently historically low level, need substantially increased. this negative impact profitability. in case big banks, situation also involve considerable risk trade portfolios. the worldwide economic downturn come time international financial system already bad shape. in particular big bank hit especially hard crisis could force curtail, curtail, lending. this, turn, could additional negative effect real economy. in order put halt negative spiral, consider important economy support monetary fiscal measures. the interest rate reduction carry swiss national bank (snb) see part measures. ... resilience big bank increase give situation, fact possible increase resilience swiss big bank crucial. credit suisse boost capital private investor total chf 10 billion. it thereby strengthen equity position substantially increase capacity absorb additional shocks. the loss chf 3 billion announce bank fourth quarter show important reinforce capital base. at ubs, government package provide significant relief balance sheet burden illiquid position particularly affect crisis. with package, snb make possible ubs transfer illiquid position special purpose vehicle. the ubs provide special purpose vehicle equity amount usd 6 billion. the confederation compensate ubs capital requirement arise purpose bi review 157/2008 1 subscribe mandatory convertible note (mcn). since announcement package, ubs liquidity situation stabilised. the numerous international measure aim stabilise financial system also positive effect position swiss big banks. nevertheless, loss cannot rule view difficult market conditions. the situation remain serious, snb continue monitor closely together swiss federal bank commission (sfbc) federal department finance. lesson crisis reform switzerland i would like speak lesson learn crisis. the continue financial crisis almost unprecedented, term extent duration. it also unprecedented term measure take authority central bank aim stabilise situation minimise impact real economy. this also apply switzerland. at presentation last report financial stability, express conviction financial system need make resilient possible shocks. this valid consider hundred billion taxpayers’ money spend worldwide stabilise financial system past months. the focus need improvement “shock absorbers”: capital liquidity. the crisis show current regulation area long sufficient case big banks. their level capital inadequate set relation risks. in area liquidity, event occur take account big banks’ scenarios. the reform capital adequacy regulation big banks, draw sfbc support snb, represent important step right direction – area capital. it specify increase risk-weighted capital together introduction leverage ratio. the leverage ratio supplementary instrument call question principle risk-sensitivity regard capital regulation. an essential constituent reform countercyclical mechanism whereby, good times, bank require considerably exceed minimum requirement capital leverage ratio. this ensure buff create absorb loss crises. this kind flexibility explicitly provide new sfbc capital regulation. the order already issue sfbc relate reform capital regulation state big bank require comply high risk-weighted capital ratio leverage ratio 2013. however, situation capital market individual earn position big bank make impossible achieve objective 2013, may possible defer date. the long time period allow implementation crucial. it prevent new regulation procyclical effect. in short term, priority clearly devote manage crisis. in area liquidity, sfbc snb process draw new regulation. the basic objective obtain high liquidity buff good reflect great complexity liquidity risks. when calculate liquidity requirement various crisis scenarios, authority use internal model calculation banks. in order ensure comparability transparency internal calculations, new regime foresee certain standardisations. the conclusion project schedule early 2009. both regulatory measure – capital regulation liquidity regulation – line proposal make financial stability forum g20 action plan. the reform also compatible strategy basel committee bank supervision implement lesson crisis. in recent speech beijing, chairman 2 bi review 157/2008 committee, nout wellink, say main objective strategy strengthen capital liquidity buff restrict leverage bank system.1 in area capital regulation, also stress importance countercyclical mechanism possibility combine risk-weighted simple unweighted instruments. we believe crisis prompt big bank consider core competence banker lie, leave authority alone think lesson draw turmoil. in view, long-term risk-adjusted consideration take lead role bankers’ decisions. in situation, believe, apparent contradiction supervisory demand capital liquidity, one hand, banks’ competitiveness, other, dissipated. preparation new series banknote run accord plan a announced, i would like close cheerful topic unrelated financial crisis. a number remember snb’s artistic design competition new series swiss banknotes, hold 2005. since then, design work continue technical requirement creation innovative series new banknote fulfilled. manuela pfrunder, graphic artist, develop draft complete design chf 50 note, take technical aspect banknote production account. at meet 29 august 2008, snb bank council approve design new chf 50 banknote give go-ahead work done. preparation technical aspect implementation banknote production full swing. a particular challenge pose security feature use new banknote series first time. base progress work date, snb confident first banknote new series ready production within plan time period. the chf 50 banknote mark begin new series banknote schedule issue autumn 2010. the appearance new banknote security detail entire series present shortly schedule issue date. 1 nout wellink, the importance bank supervision financial stability, high level meeting, 17 november 2008, beijing bi review 157/2008 3 glenn stevens: interest time address mr glenn stevens, governor reserve bank australia, australian business economist annual dinner, sydney, 9 december 2008. * * * it pleasure address australian business economists. it group i give first speech governor, october 2006. tonight 23rd speech since then. between two occasions, quite lot changed, globally domestically (though i doubt speech become exciting). many people say recently time “interesting”. my response are, perhaps, little interesting. i need remind audience international financial turmoil live past almost year half, intensity event since mid september year, particular. i know anyone predict course events. this give u cause reflect hard job make genuinely useful forecasts. what see truly “tail” outcome – kind outcome routine forecast process never predicts. but occurred, implications, must reflect it. in spirit, i shall set feature episode make “interesting”. the obvious one prominence financial event particularly financial sector impairment key countries. there episode individual financial institution sectors, even whole bank system small countries, need recapitalisation. but scale capital needed, number country need extent counterparty risk aversion concern solvency outside range experience past half century. in near term, financial stress bring obvious concern ability financial system provide credit economy question. a one measure concern, number loan approve house unite kingdom october 65 per cent low year earlier, 50 per cent low downturn early 1990s. the immediate need keep ample liquidity, strengthen banks’ balance sheet add capital help confidence, include lend strength sovereign’s credit rat necessary. all occurring. what may still need internationally attention remain problem assets, since price continue decline, capital position bank continue deteriorate. so uk solution emphasise new capital initial u approach emphasise excise “troubled” assets, swiss solution both: recapitalise banks, get bad bad asset balance sheets. the unite state move direction also recently. continue effort provide clarity state balance sheet also important. surely linger counterparty risk aversion reflect uncertainty score. long term, implication past year’s event see regulatory environment. in country public purse use support bank solvency, expect significant regulatory reform – rightly so. the real trick, however, make sure reform knee jerk reaction symptom financial excess – clear – well considered, durable tractable change appropriately contain, crush, financial system’s capacity appetite take risk. certainly, past five years, much risk taken, wrong sort. the danger next several years, however, much risk taking, little. regulator want avoid compound that. bi review 156/2008 1 while prominence financial event clear, also set “interesting” event real economy unfold time. the fortune chinese economy increasingly important, particularly australia country time zone. the strike real economic fact past several month continue u economic weakness, china’s economy slow much quickly anyone forecast. our estimate suggest chinese industrial production probably decline four month october. some might attributable effect olympics surely much. some reflect weaken chinese export major countries. but seem occurring. i sure many economic forecaster fully appreciate yet. there every chance rate growth china’s gdp currently noticeably 8 per cent pace embody various forecast 2009. the chinese authorities, seek slow economy clearly overheating, move policy quickly expansionary direction. so good chance china’s economy look strong year’s time today. it important, though, do right way – specifically boost domestic demand. china’s slow may part third strike fact, namely, simultaneity weaken economic activity around world recent months. when occurs, one naturally lead look common shock. the noticeable slow many economy june quarter seem time attributable sharp run oil prices. that rise reversed, slow has, anything, intensify past several months. the recent weaken might result widespread intense tighten credit condition occur major countries. but state domestic financial sector differ across countries. in australia japan much east asia canada, credit condition become difficult, bank much strong condition unite state europe unite kingdom. one thing stand closely relate across countries, however, fall share markets. these change extent reflection weak set expect economic outcomes. but closely link financial market rapid communication, change sentiment transmit quickly across country appear change sentiment affect behaviour. people have, understandably, become uncertain outlook correspondingly cautious spend behaviour. in essence, period essential nature event much crisis financial system. it crisis confidence part household businesses, global nature. hence need action internationally consistent deal situation. on score, fourth “interesting” feature speed official institution seem react economic fallout unfolding. to take one example, imf forecasts, associate policy advice, revise often fast i recall past. perhaps simply great number international meet fund ask view, sense international official body domestic counterpart shift assessment unusually quickly attempt grapple unfold situation. monetary policy ease aggressively around world. so fiscal policy. one strike feature recent g 20 meet way need fiscal stimulus, debt level permitted, readily agree participants, actively encourage imf. of course, agree thing general meet first, easiest, step. actual policy deliver timely effective – hopefully consistent – way. i use word “consistent” preferable, 2 bi review 156/2008 judgment, action broadly consistent timely, precisely co ordinate delayed. it also remain calibrate extent measure appropriately circumstances, easy matter. nonetheless, seem happen fast previous occasions. it would realistic suggest response been, ever could be, fast well target significant near term weakness global economy avoided. the data come day confirm international downturn take place, show every sign deep one rather shallow affair 2001. the question whether reasonable grind expect combination private public effort address financial problems, subsidence sheer panic financial market use macroeconomic policy provide stimulus weak economy establish sound foundation renew period expansion begin time 2009. the inauguration new u administration key opportunity. the economic downturn deepen transition period. but new team announce credible plan accommodate require adjustment u economy, confidence medium term prospect built. this would assist u economic recovery condition elsewhere. think ahead, next international expansion doubt different characteristic previous one. it cannot base continual gear consumer develop country associate asset price escalation. for reason, neither characterise continue large build balance payment surplus emerge world. the secular increase live standard emerge country ought play big role drive global demand – depend appropriate policy country develop world. it look like fairly prominent role near term, many advance countries, government sector recapitalisation and/or guarantee banks, fiscal expansion, both. but sustain growth, also need role innovation prudent risk take private sector – even though, present, retreat. turn close home, australian economy see significant change circumstance past six months. the big term trade boom half century over, partly unwound. i still think china’s emergence far complete that, result, term trade high average year ago. but next year well peak. our households, like elsewhere, observe financial turmoil decline share price become cautious. consumer spending, slow significantly period february june interest rate petrol price rose, remain slow since, even interest rate petrol price fall significantly. i think expect household cautious debt next couple years. business investment government spend remain pretty strong – domestic demand still 4 per cent high late data year earlier. but business currently process scale back plan investment hiring. this partly response slow consumer demand, dramatic change view international condition general uncertainty reflect financial market price surely play major role. so period ahead, private demand could look weak years. what need ensure far period weakness brief, prospect longer-term sustainable growth maintained? of course, cannot change course world economy. but keep house order maximise chance good performance. on score, i remark before, australia scope use macroeconomic policy support economy bi review 156/2008 3 weak part cycle. that scope earn prepare run budget surplus run public debt revenue strong, raise interest rate contain inflation economy overheated. the scope ease policy used. on fiscal side, “automatic stabilisers” reduce budget surplus economy weakens, cushion economy process. that design do. there also front loaded, discretionary ease start arrive recipients’ bank account week. of course, good deal may saved, even is, presumably take place private save would otherwise do long period, bring forward point household become confident enough lift spending. also fiscal front, reason worthwhile public investment decision currently plan proceed, long really worthwhile. on monetary front, interest rate right across spectrum fallen. some fairly elementary calculation suggest that, result decline interest rate occur already, fall household sector’s gross debt-servicing burden almost 3 per cent household income. this roughly equal see early 1990s, cash rate fell 18 per cent 4.75 per cent. but occasion take two half years; time take place four five months. the decline borrow cost business generally small slow appear, fast pas recent reduction cash rate. these transmission channel monetary policy still operate australia, unlike countries. in addition, exchange rate play normal role adjust change circumstance way stabilise economy. it decline 25 per cent trade weight term since mid year, large movement see short period. these quite big changes. they take time full effect, make significant difference condition next year. there scope macroeconomic policy settings, needed, give strength public account federal level, outlook decline inflation. in assess whether needed, so, much, naturally need maintain close watch data remember extent stimulus still pipeline result past actions. other supportive factor include state financial system. this say many time bear repeating. of course credit condition sectors, notably property, tightened. and overall, credit business rise much slowly year ago. but even so, three month october, credit provide intermediary rise annualised pace 12-13 per cent. on broad definition, include capital market raisings, pace 9 per cent. both number actually bite high around mid year. in develop countries, would consider satisfactory pace (if little fast). credit growth household recently slow, historical standards, 4 5 per cent. margin loan particular contract quickly people reduce leverage. lend house start pick now, however, early impact interest rate reductions. australian banks, raise large quantity deposit past couple months, turn back offshore markets, make use government guarantee. they appear much trouble raise capital private market want it. overall, without

draghi, governor yam, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, i honor delight among gather distinguish policymakers, financial expert academia, year’s hkma distinguish lecture would like thank governor yam kind invitation. this lecture truly provide excellent opportunity u share view topical issue center international financial community. ten year ago, asian financial crisis. in thailand, plenty discussion cause remedy crisis, still continue days. to me, thai crisis 4 main causes, namely, weakness macroeconomic management lead bubbles, lax supervision, excessive risk take financial sector private sector general, inadequate legal information infrastructure. the crisis face many surprise point governor draghi, i also see plenty similarity underlie root causes. because crisis’s global scale severity, time around see unprecedented effort take national, regional international levels. today, one decade asian financial crisis, emerge market look le vulnerable financial disturbances. emerge markets, particular asia, learn live heighten uncertainty world extent whereabouts benefit financial globalization promote growth development ensure economic financial stability. this, course, necessitate focus risk management. lady gentlemen, asian economy come long way since 1997 promote economic financial resiliency. we see region-wide move toward flexible exchange rate regime, discipline framework conduct monetary fiscal policies. a financial sector, framework policy move toward risk-based supervision, adherence international standards, undertake formal financial sector assessment financial sector assessment program fsap. the macroeconomic policy also become flexible, yet proactive, deal change market condition practices. when necessary, tradition fiscal-monetary policy mix augment appropriate prudential measure financial institutions. more importantly, legal information infrastructure, include credit bureaus, also put place strengthen foundation financial system capacity crisis prevention resolution. these intensive reform institution build past decade may make le likely financial turbulence trigger sharp broad-based dent real economic outcomes, especially, since significant build-up sectoral imbalance region. but, challenge remain learn key pressure point lead difficulty small-open economy externally-induced, particularly bi review 163/2008 1 know still catch eye financial storm whether turbulence ceased. let turn focus discussion need close cooperation face challenge combat global financial crisis. the ongoing global financial crisis dissimilar crisis follow intensive reform international level. it also highlight international cooperation remain important necessary maintain global financial stability. in fact, become important give globalization process, make u good interconnected. however, might take grant international cooperation first best solution could solve global crisis. we learn number occasions, solution needed, good implementation come little late. take international monetary fund’s (imf) short-term liquidity facility example, new facility somewhat similar swap line extend among central bank fellow member call typical imf-supported adjustment programs. emerge market proponent facility several years, imf previously reluctant endorse due fear moral hazard. it ironic problem advance economy lead contagion elsewhere large number central bank enter swap agreement federal reserve, imf agree instrument. this also reconfirm need great voice representation emerge market important international financial institution (ifis) highlight recent g-20 summit declaration. while reform underway imf, hope fora, including, fsf take issue consideration seriously. let elaborate importance emerge market participate systemically important international fora. i think agree advance economy emerge market prone sectoral imbalances, which, leave unchecked, lead full-blown crisis, anywhere, time, bubble burst. the impact crisis advanced, systemically important country much broad deeper, create large scale world-wide externality. emerge markets, unlike others, share cop new challenge bring phenomenon well create u one decade ago. it is, therefore, responsibility advance country charge global surveillance also responsibility emerge market share view experience reform good prepare great uncertainty. against background, call question whether surveillance mechanism available moment role play emerge market international cooperation adequate ensure international financial stability, essence mission ifis. it therefore time crisis value international cooperation measure voice representation emerge market hear ifis. the unprecedented event past month present historic opportunity international body rise challenge. the time come proactive become truly global institutions. apart strengthen role ifis, i believe regional cooperation play important role supplement national global responses. i’d like raise two observation issue. first, global financial crisis highlight need put place effective regional surveillance mechanism detect weakness early on. international financial institution remain useful global surveillance finance balance payment need necessary. however, wait global community 2 bi review 163/2008 international financial institution regional surveillance may little late timely policy measure safeguard region contagion part world. indeed, important policymakers common challenge put great effort clear depth understand one another’s policy practices. this will, turn, help raise comfort level usefully avoid potential policy misstep create policy synergy eventually foster confidence investors. this kind trust amount legal text, condition precedent, covenant match, develop friendship goodwill among friend within region. country region tend posse good understand coordination, therefore, policy initiative regional level effective timely. second, asian financial crisis wake call asia need regional liquidity facility, asian country need consider make facility sufficiently large effective timely disbursement light current global crisis. during asian financial crisis, 75% imf’s financial package thailand come fund within region. the present global situation also reconfirm vision set chiang mai initiative (cmi) asia need regional liquidity facility protect contagion, cause within region outside. it therefore timely coordination cooperation among country strengthen ensure prompt remedial action put place light ongoing global financial crisis. lady gentlemen, to conclude, i wish remind present situation call need great international cooperation, require concert effort international organizations, regional cooperation national governments, combat global financial crisis. regional cooperation must coherent national policy work hand-in-hand international cooperation. the impact crisis today effect unwind measure take would zero-sum game, player could potentially lose. thus, go forward, find right balance create tie three, namely international, regional national interests, important task national authorities. thank you. bi review 163/2008 3

turmoil. we also tend hear great deal so-called “decoupling” thesis. this idea emerge economy would continue recent strong growth despite economic downturn europe unite states. follow collapse lehman brother mid-september know scenario optimistic. it become clear part world immune current crisis, imf expect first time fifty year advance economy experience synchronize recession. this cannot fail impact rest global economy. although gcc country enjoy strong fundamentals, immune credit crisis. one consequence financial market disruption wake lehman collapse substantial outflow dollar liquidity emerge markets, include gcc. the liquidity impact crisis also combine general risk aversion adverse impact supply credit many emerge economies, include gcc countries. a result global financial market

adoption presentation mr mugur isărescu, governor national bank romania, occasion session organise romanian academy “the euro adoption strategy international financial crisis”, bucharest, 2 october 2008. * * * the romanian authority set strategic economic policy objective fulfilment requirement would allow adoption euro national currency 2014. although ambitious objective, achieve provide coherent economic policy mix adopt maintain support nominal real convergence euro area countries. mention make that, order join euro area, nominal convergence criterion need considered: stable exchange rate, subdue inflation, interest rate close apply euro area countries, moderate budget deficit public debt. nevertheless, maintenance convergence nominal indicator long run even turn good account advantage derive part well-functioning monetary system compel u equally consider accomplishment real convergence european develop economy romanian economy. in context, romania’s adoption single currency achieve minimum level real economic convergence would risky counterproductive. we make sure achieve nominal criterion substantial progress real convergence achieve well. thus, presentation today i think that, give analysis romanian economy’s path adoption european single currency, adequate focus nominal convergence, topic i repeatedly approached, also several issue pertain real economic convergence. or, means, plain language, put place condition necessary rapid, sound sustainable economic growth. the large disparity performance romanian economy european union country compel u that. in context, allow approach topic le debate public meet country, deeply link capacity romanian economy maintain rapid sustainable growth. it general problem relative structural reform and, particular, labour market flexibility, imperative need come line modern practice apply successful countries, take account reality romanian economy, requirement competition increasingly demand international market. at first glance, connection changeover euro labour market flexibility. in fact, connection strong, even essential, i would say. before proceed in-depth analysis topic, allow clarify issue subject previous public debate. the national bank romania nothing wage hikes. quite opposite, might say. the romanian economy could benefit increasingly fast rise wages, order enjoy high live standard, surmount historical disparity separate u western economy put stop labour force migration. nonetheless, must analyse clear mind assert bluntly mismatch pay rise labour productivity gain unsustainable. wage hike excess labour productivity likely bring high live standard, contrary, may lead low live standard, give that, sooner later, disparity two fundamental indicator entail fast-paced rise prices, weaken domestic currency, external indebtedness. all negative influence bi review 162/2008 1 investment delay achievement real convergence economy rather speed up. over past years, annual productivity gain come impressive 10% beyond year. multiple factor stand behind performance, initial low level, significant decline – even always illustrate statistical indicator – population work agriculture and, highly important, strong increase investment. however, increase exceed far wage hikes, explain sizeable widen external deficit, well increase inflationary pressure past year half. so, embark upon path, carry serious burden shoulders. i wonder happen moment increase labour productivity slow down. such trend closely connect economic rigidities, infrastructure-related issues, slowdown economic restructuring. in view issues, nbr embrace idea slow wage increases, rather advocate creation condition likely render hike sustainable maintain actual nature. after all, nominal point view, limit increase wages. however, market admit pay rise match labour productivity gains. the rest fuel inflation depreciation domestic currency, take real level wage rise match output labour productivity. next, i would like make reference factor establish direct connection nbr’s legal task concern wage increases, one hand, rise labour productivity, other. in vein, i must specify that, romania join european union national bank romania become member european system central banks, entitled, also bind present viewpoint see fundamental equilibrium economy may jeopardise particular development. hence, i refer nbr’s objective ensure maintain price stability bring inflation rate level compatible capacity member eurosystem. generally, low inflation rate associate slow economic growth even recession. however, phenomenon occur contradiction economic policy mix subdue inflation primary objective policies, particularly fiscal income policies. when policy mix balanced, inflation rate may curb maintain sustain growth pace. behind development stand mainly foreign direct investment inflow enhance productive capacity economy ensure sustainable finance relatively high external deficit. in romania’s case, expert work central bank well independent analyst estimate national economy may rise fast clip amid alleviate inflationary pressures, even context current account deficit 8-10% gdp. nevertheless, order capital inflow continue, romania’s economy must stay attractive. this attractiveness may long objectively relate low unit labour cost disproportionate tax facility would comply eu norms. therefore, investor-friendly environment result different set characteristic increase flexibility fiscal regime labour market. thus, nbr’s primary objective ensure maintain price stability closely link policy mix pursue romanian authorities. another nominal objective essential join euro area exchange rate stability. in recent years, improve performance romanian economy enable significant alleviation exchange rate fluctuation compare situation last decade. in fact, foreign exchange regime adopt romanian authorities, namely flexible exchange rate require far less intervention forex market central bank, bolster national economy. even over-appreciation episode early 2007, generate massive capital inflow follow romania’s accession eu, correct via autonomous forex market movements. we may state that, present, significant pressure-inducing factor relation exchange rate term 2 bi review 162/2008 appreciation depreciation, despite temporary two way movement cause global financial market turmoil. however, foreign exchange market come balance context policy mix feature restrictive monetary policy, high interest rates, insufficiently tight fiscal policy, subject pressure increase public spending, concurrently drop incomes, whereas pay rise excess productivity gain long time. this policy mix unsustainable. one could hardly speak long-run forex market equilibrium, even though near term, high interest rate may offset effect policies. nonetheless, clear exchange rate stability context worsen competitiveness romanian products, follow increase wage fast productivity, lead inevitably widen trade deficit ultimately exchange rate depreciation. should occur, i would surprise hear voice blame central bank outcome, without try identify actual, deep reason behind unfavourable developments. therefore, subdue inflation exchange rate stability strongly relate coherence policy mix adopt authorities. in particular, run-up election lay groundwork make empty promise even adopt piece legislation likely significant impact macroeconomic equilibria. in case, nbr’s task identify major risk arise implementation ill-designed policies. unfortunately, credibility hard gain, easy lose. lose credibility severe effect than, let u say, temporary government deficit widening. the world economy face tremendous difficulties. i express confidence that, coordinate appropriate policy develop international economy help prevent crisis similar size 1929-1933. it beyond shadow doubt period decisive impact world economic model. during hard time worldwide, necessary, ever, romanian authority exert caution wisdom concern public spend specific promises. the run-up election usually period hard keep promise easily made. at present, however, despite difficult international economic condition post-war period, pre-election public promise seem far unrealistic. i would like reiterate fact nbr policy focus euro adoption 2014. in medium run, envisage resumption disinflation bring price hike line european standards, also alleviation imbalances, especially gradual narrow external deficit, order render disinflation sustainable. in term monetary policy, crucial foster save view narrow current gap relation investment. the increase contribution domestic component, amid rise save ratio, ensure high investment rate. in fact, increase interest rates, part current monetary policy stance, aim foster savings. the result visible, even though – statistical reason – nbr calculation appear give different picture. in order avoid possible confusions, allow present several technical details. the data release indicate fast dynamic demand deposit compare time deposits, apparently hint emergence additional inflationary pressures. we deal fact two development relate statistical evidence rather real economic substance. one development transfer, since 2007, forex-denominated demand deposit “quasi-money”, part m2, m1 (narrow money). this merely matter compliance eu definitions. the economic substance changed: romanian resort foreign currency account current transactions, rather mean saving. another development weigh heavy also manifest case forex-denominated current accounts, extremely significant quantitative perspective ron-bis review 162/2008 3 denominate ones. since deposit account subject income tax, current account not, bank develop way attract customers: current account whose yield high deposit rates. this lead massive portfolio shift detriment traditional deposits, household place save so-called current accounts, even card accounts, highly remunerate conditional upon maintain balance high certain floor. central bank expert adjust figure base assumption actual demand account see growth similar currency circulation, case previous years. hence, would appear quasi-money rise 80% december 2004 august 2008 versus 40% indicate statistical data. in words, household corporate save domestic currency expand pace much fast time deposits. these statistic lead medium comment would-be stalemate ron-denominated savings. the nbr specialist make sure development explain detail. this fiscal policy slippage entail contraction budget revenue potential error assess monetary developments. give heighten turbulence international financial market last week fact nbr vigilantly monitor developments, i believe refer potential impact domestic financial system romanian economy whole. the romanian bank sector still affect mainly increase external finance costs. the limit impact due domestic financial environment characteristics, well prudential monetary policy financial stability strengthen measure adopt central bank years. let highlight important measures. first foremost, credit institution romania exposure subprime instruments, lie root turmoil. this particularly due profitability give wide interest rate margin domestic market well fast-paced increase lend via traditional bank products. secondly, overwhelm majority bank operate romania, include foreign capital, legal entity subject nbr licensing, regulation prudential supervision. similarly foreign bank branch main office eu member states, bank abide basel ii prudential capital adequacy standards. thirdly, regulation issue national bank romania often prove restrictive basel ii standards. more specifically, initial capital requirement license credit institution romania almost twice much minimum level lay eu regulations. moreover, worth mention nbr representative part competent eu structure involve review improvement eu regulation govern financial system architecture. last least, minimum reserve requirement ratio still high 20% ron-denominated liability maturity 2 year 40% foreign currency-denominated liabilities. in addition contribution curb credit expansion, reserve requirement also play prudential role credit institution maintain adequate liquidity level. finally, let point measure recently take central bank view ensure sustainable credit growth longer-run. these measure useful amid persistent turbulence global financial markets. a matter fact, liquidity credit institution sector romania – albeit relatively wane compare previous year – comfortable level guarantee smooth market functioning, nbr necessary tool mechanism available ensure liquidity line applicable european norms. all indication domestic bank system run relatively limit risk contagion amid persistent turmoil world financial markets. however, adverse 4 bi review 162/2008 effect may become manifest romania well, among which: (i) pronounce exchange rate volatility, follow trend see country region, give increase risk aversion investor emerge markets, (ii) still rise cost external finance decline volume, (iii) likely moderation volume autonomous capital inflow possible early repatriation capital gains, (iv) potentially flag demand romanian export amid downward growth prospect eu member states. the national bank romania continue carry mandate utmost vigilance regard price stability safeguard financial stability. allow conclude reiterate objective join euro area 2014 within reach. by pursue appropriate policies, authority could also meet objective rapidly raise standard living. however, break fundamental equilibrium inadequate measure entail welfare. on contrary, may put real nominal economic convergence jeopardy. the strategic objective euro adoption 2014 equally risk. bi review 162/2008 5 rasheed mohammed al maraj: impact current global financial crisis bahrain’s economy address his excellency rasheed mohammed al maraj, governor central bank bahrain, bcci seminar “impact current global financial crisis bahrain’s economy”, manama, 18 november 2008. * * * lady gentlemen: i would like thank chamber commerce industry kind invitation speak today’s seminar. the topic chosen, “impact current global crisis bahrain’s economy” timely. until month ago, many commentator analyst believe economy gcc would oasis calm on-going financial turmoil. we also tend hear great deal so-called “decoupling” thesis. this idea emerge economy would continue recent strong growth despite economic downturn europe unite states. however, since collapse lehman brother mid-september, become clear part world immune current crisis. what begin september last year crisis u real estate market – so-called “sub-prime” crisis – early year turn begin call “credit crunch.” the loss u european bank suffer result exposure sub-prime asset reduce capital hence ability lend. this sharply reduce availability credit europe us, time corporate household borrower attempt de-leverage – is, reduce amount debt outstanding balance sheets. this situation world economy financial system face middle september. it point global economic slowdown, bad effect would concentrate develop markets. the emerge economy expect continue recent strong growth. the collapse lehman brother mid-september move financial crisis new much unpredictable phase. the immediate effect scramble liquidity main international financial centres, large international banks. there massive rise risk aversion financial markets, reflect variety indicators, include rise risk premium – margin financial intermediary demand hold risky asset – steep fall global stock markets. even gcc crisis begin impact. although gcc country enjoy strong fundamentals, shield crisis. several experience significant stock market corrections. some gcc member need provide support bank sectors, either form recapitalization funds, provide blanket guarantee deposits, combination both. there plenty anecdotal evidence investment project delay scale back. in immediate term cbb’s objective ensure bahrain’s bank system remain sound footing. we receive daily report bank liquidity positions, weekly report exposures. we also encourage bring forward disclosure third quarter results, many published. in long term global financial crisis contain many lesson regulator financial industry. in particular, help underscore need sound risk bi review 162/2008 1 management, effective internal control strong corporate governance financial institutions. all element essential ensure stability individual financial institution financial systems. the role regulator address challenge crucial. we provide guidance create appropriate regulatory framework enable sound stable conduct financial service financial institutions. the 6-volume cbb rulebook core regulatory development enhancement programme. the importance sound corporate governance one issue bring prominence recent global financial turmoil. a alan greenspan acknowledge last month testimony unite state congress, important cause crisis failure internal monitor control financial firms. he assumed, said, shareholder financial firm adequate incentive ensure firm own take excessive risks. a shareholder subsequently find out, risk take go wrong costly them. however, greenspan acknowledged, assumption turn flawed. shareholder act prevent excessive risk-taking. the conclusion clear. if firm lack incentive adequate self-regulation regulator must step in. this aim rulebook requirement corporate governance internal controls. the financial crisis also point need high standard risk management financial firms. improve risk management practice bank important component work already undertake central bank financial crisis, result crisis plan step efforts. in late 2007 direct locally-incorporated bank carry internal risk management assessments. the initial report indicate bahraini bank good internal control system overall. we also require locally-incorporated bank submit risk concentration policy documents. we carry review banks’ policy risk limit summer 2008, process notify bank observe deficiency gap address matter end year. a particular issue risk concentration concern extent bank expose real estate sector. since 2005, require bank report exposure sector order discus real estate concentration individual banks, monitor system’s overall exposure real estate. since late 2007, consult local bank measure limit exposure real estate sector. we issue three consultation paper real estate regard set formal rule due course. we also increase regulatory risk weight real estate 200% act regulatory constraint excessive real estate expansion. regulation limit banks’ risk take never universally popular. some shareholder might see reduce ability make profits, least short-term. but alan greenspan’s admission clearly indicates, pursuit short-term profitability without regard risk involve one’s interest – particularly interest shareholder themselves. i emphasize, however, regulator’s job protect shareholder excessive risk-taking. shareholder provider risk capital expect share loss risk-taking go wrong. instead, aim limit risk take responsibility protect bank’s depositor losses. depositor special category bank’s creditor two main reasons. bank deposit main form save many people, especially le wealthy. bank deposit also money, insolvency bank – especially large one – serious economic side effect sharply reduce supply money credit economy. 2 bi review 162/2008 because importance individual saver wide economy, bank deposit subject special form protection event bank become insolvent. this protection usually refer deposit insurance. in bahrain deposit insurance system years. until protect deposit maximum 75% bd15,000. it also know “ex-post” fund scheme require fund collect bank bank already failed. this take time, one lesson recent financial crisis important depositor compensate promptly bank fails. reflect lesson financial crisis, also recent development international best practice standard deposit insurance, central bank process finalize new regulation reform exist deposit protection arrangements. the purpose reform establish pre-funded scheme. this scheme fund money accumulate advance scheme need make payouts depositors. the fund accumulate regular contribution bank member scheme. the purpose measure i describe ensure bahrain’s financial system remain sound, stable able provide credit domestic economy needs. sometimes measure might lead complaint particular sector group access credit impeded, central bank need take broad view overall stability system. it would one’s interest allow bank bahrain take excessive risks. a sound bank system one firm well-diversified, many different revenue sources, concentrate risk one particular economic sector. this one important lesson draw financial crisis. thank attention. bi review 162/2008 3 denny h kalyalya: expansion zambia’s bank sector remark dr denny h kalyalya, deputy governor-operations bank zambia; official open

ziarul financiar. the one-decade long presence prestigious economic daily newspaper overlap turbulent period history romania. allow dwell upon series event occur shortly release first issue ziarul financiar. in wake crisis russia southeast asia, romania’s need external finance much difficult cover, level foreign currency reserve leave authority little room manoeuvre. back then, today, rat agency extremely cautious assess romania’s country risk, accord headline disseminate obsessively international agency year, romania would face imminent payment default. at moment, situation become even complex due fact international monetary fund resort new approach indebted countries, call p.s.i. (private sector involvement) “burden sharing”. this approach, test four country include romania, prove failure, imf late abandon it. however, romania choose adjust external deficit mean take foreign borrow unacceptable conditions. romania adopt former solution subsequently sign agreement imf. nevertheless, standard&poor’s, promptly downgrade romania’s rat one notch level would indicate external debt payment default – occur case romania – maintain low rat long time, even crisis overcome band country’s reserve resume growth. i reminisce event occur ten year ago i experience particularly strong déjà-vu feel recent months. first come bleak assessment foreign analysts, follow fail speculative attack ron. the next stage game downgrade sovereign rat investment grade, romania eu member state situation. yesterday, i read another comment anticipate neither le romania bulgaria risk default sovereign foreign debt payment even though foreign debt stock private. in order underpin viewpoint, far-fetched reason put forward, case country region conclude agreement imf statement bulgarian romanian currency depreciate u dollar, even though bulgarian currency peg euro fluctuate u dollar rate euro, ron trade euro. to certain extent, approach similar use 1998-1999. there however fundamental difference, despite mention occasionally, namely romania’s foreign exchange reserve currently high whole stock public debt. therefore, implement appropriate domestic policies, romania likely move past period good condition 1999. i strongly believe yet another reason: past decade whole – cover together ziarul financiar – mark significant progress romania. we overlook country witness economic growth nine year ten, annual gdp growth rate exceed 5 percent seven year ten. the three-digit inflation rate early ’90s drop single-digit level recent years. moreover, romania’s join nato european union also place political context underpin sustainable economic growth. this year’s gross domestic product bi review 161/2008 1 amount nearly eur 140 billion, i.e. eur 6,500 per capita. in 1999, romania’s gdp stand merely eur 33 billion, gdp per caput low eur 1,500. this leap, lead significant change include high consumer standards, accompany similar progress understand economic issues, path forward smooth possible. if look long-term development romanian society, decade elapse since launch ziarul financiar significant landmark, compare significant upturn world war i achievement grand union 1918. at turn points, quantitative developments, nonetheless important, need accompany qualitative change relate social philosophy whole, well progress national standard values. from perspective, opinion-makers press general play major role. economic newspaper particular find special position. a matter fact, national bank romania steadily promote economic education do best raise journalists’ level professionalism approach economic issues. let u remember ziarul financiar launch ten year ago marble hall nbr. numerous occasion arise year nbr representative participate event organise ziarul financiar vice versa. there steadfast dialogue benefiting, opinion, ziarul financiar journalist central bank experts. and, true central bank confine ivory tower, hold equally true economic medium avoid slip cheap sensationalism, yield short-term gains. eventually, medium help public take inform decisions, benefit overall economic developments. i well aware shape public opinion neither simple, linear. it hard generation learn price form add plan benefit plan cost grow accustom today’s reality, price formation depend demand supply. hence great difficulty face economic policymakers, analyst medium alike. disseminate – sometimes good faith – statement certain market participant may equally generate confusion. for instance, let u recall representative edible oil producer claim month ago price product would rise, although year’s market supply several time high year earlier. a normal, edible oil price enter downtrend likely persist give change supply-demand ratio. another example businessman say weak demand particular industry would entail high price producers’ attempt safeguard profits. this another statement receive adequate response, message convey market price rise matter what. another instance i would like briefly refer relate assertion several colleague credit institutions, claim nbr perform sort trick october 2008, make liquidity bank system vanish. in words, attempt sanction orchestrate speculative attack domestic currency, central bank actually hit domestic credit institutions. understand channel whereby ron-denominated liquidity move system is, indeed, quite complex hence likely easily generate confusion twist true mean word actions. in fact, one cannot speak liquidity crunch long bank comply 20 percent level reserve requirement october november (according preliminary data). at most, relative decrease might occur temporarily relative primarily corporate tax payment government budget. but even situation nbr provide lend facility, allow immediate access bank capable set require collateral. the fact bank take due care set stock government security timely manner mean management credit institution decide 2 bi review 161/2008 take chance high profit increase market share. however, often case take chance necessarily bring profit alone. the role specialise medium grasp actual dimension phenomenon review equally important. furthermore, specialise newspaper boast strength prestige ziarul financiar obligation judiciously calibrate piece information analysis significance. for instance, medium adopt bleak, sometimes apocalyptic, tone past day amid abundance news alert likely number unemployed upcoming months, i.e. around 30,000 individuals. of course, take individually, anyone make redundant face tough issue. however, economy-wide perspective, rise unemployment 30,000 people account 0.5 percent workforce. couple low level unemployment (3-4 percent) prior outbreak ongoing global recession, economic analyst conclude unemployment hardly press issue romania time being. on hand, equally true short-term outlook domestic economy cannot favourable. to bleak international environment add may also call irrational exuberance market and, many occasions, state authorities. in opinion, mixture hostile external environment seem inadequate domestic response environment stand underlie reason rat agency downgraded, sometimes rather severely, sovereign rating. of course, may voice discontent rat agencies’ evaluation. at times, rat agency facilitate criticism. indeed, i find hard understand earnest rat agency might ass sovereign risk without even refer country’s level public debt international reserves. a professor, i safely assume “subject treated”, hence conclusion unsubstantiated. a concern assessments, i must say however thing least simple. of course, could assert present economy good position country region rat within “investment grade” range. but country least adopt austerity measure domestic level. how thing stand country? after two consecutive year wage increase range 20 percent 25 percent per year – i.e. twice labour productivity gain – wage rise envisage 2009 range 50 percent 60 percent, whereas agreement trade unions, whenever struck, provide hike low 35 percent. such approach reveal dangerous decouple aspiration reality. in current international context give already dangerously high level external deficit, must aim increase domestic consumption labour productivity gains, since finance source something like that. and unless understand state affair ourselves, rat agency go warn us. and act reach wage agreement even compile law back real economic resources, demand – potential moment – become real immediate, might witness bad effect possible. the wage rise bring high live standard – contrary, accomplishment make term economic stability, investment expansion growth potential past year might dissipate easily. a i already state parliament romania, improvement live standard boil matter willingness political decisions, would long poor country anywhere world. it true economic press tackle issue balance manner. the economic press evolve significantly past decade. now dedicate publications, even dedicate tv channels, financial analysts’ market, ultimately indicative mature romanian society. i would even dare say economic journalist analyst generally connect reality decision-makers. bi review 161/2008 3 i must clear one thing: romania alternative adjust domestic demand order visibly cut external deficit. i know painful i well aware difficulty every government encounter put measure practice. i head government critical period 1999-2000 i know exactly difficult adjust domestic consumption, even two percentage point gdp only. this time, difficulty pose adjustment perceive rather big, must accomplish several year significant increase consumption. the trend seem go forever, lead decouple aspiration real possibility fulfil them. therefore, adequate adjust domestic demand sooner rather later, long still enjoy mark economic growth, give point adjustment imply resize amputation. an essential issue romanian society must solve without delay refer adjust first: consumption investment. i realise must ponder matter. the question whether opt buy increase number car set aside resource order build adequate road infrastructure. in years, former choice could lead u total traffic jam, additional consumption leave u could carbon monoxide release exhaust pipes. this example metaphorical. we see everywhere imbalance domestic consumption saving, investment finance resource, already pose serious problems, economy whole citizen – whose true live standard paradoxically amputate precisely result imbalance consumption investment. the current state-of-affairs undoubtedly critical one therefore adjustment domestic demand cannot delayed. it intention dramatise give unjustified warning. but, i point occasion well, either proceed soft land via wise domestic policy face adjustment trigger outside, external capital market, case adjustment neither smooth reasonably sized. i one thing add previous statement topic: international context long leaf much time hesitations. i would like end optimistic note. a matter fact, ziarul financiar adopt often positive note, i wish keep unaltered. with side, i confidence country’s future. and i wish, much do, wisdom prevail front impatience, risk severe slippage fail materialise forthcoming months. with thoughts, i wish best luck editor ziarul financiar well professionalism deal difficult economic issue economic media. 4 bi review

ceremony “certified shari’a adviser auditor”, “certified islamic professional accountant’ programmes. in addition congratulate graduate students, i like thank many distinguish speaker appear conference, well event organisers. particular thank due world bank support event. against background current global financial turmoil, appear good time take stock prospect islamic financial industry. in recent months, global financial crisis deepened, many commentator point relative success islamic financial sector. so far, islamic financial institution escape relatively unscathed severe downturn affect conventional financial institutions. this certainly present industry opportunity continue successful growth recent decades. because interest-based transaction prohibited, islamic finance encourage business trade activity generate fair legitimate profit. the prohibition speculative activity also help ensure close link financial flow productive activities. these intrinsic property islamic finance contribute towards insulate potential risk result excess leverage speculative financial activities. but islamic financial institution largely shelter present crisis, room complacency. it inevitable affect degree, part wide global economic system. the effect global financial crisis real economy potential transmit shock shari’a compliant institution well. this mean must high priority place sound management risk management practice islamic financial institutions. a i point past, sensational growth industry recent years, combine high level liquidity, mean islamic bank need fight

the downturn global economic condition provide business model stern test. project-driven business strategy affect reduction global liquidity slow global economic growth. islamic financial institution need plan prepare challenge operate conditions. the industry need respond challenge develop great diversity business models, diverse stable income sources, rigorous risk management stress test

conventional islamic, access short-term liquidity government bahrain ijara sukuk. at time, however, primary responsibility sound risk management control reside firm themselves. the principle standard develop aaoifi provide islamic financial institution sound basis manage activities. those today, graduate qualification “certified shari’a adviser auditor”, “certified islamic professional

research conference, organize faculty management & finance, university colombo, colombo, 11 december 2008. the view express paper author construe central bank sri lanka. * * * a master debater boast normally employ three ploy subdue difficult customers. “when i find opponent easily surmountable, i use mathematics, philosophy religion subdue him”. he confessed. “mathematical equation frighten him, philosophical expression confuse religious say make feel guilty. after that, easy prey final onslaught”. he elaborate triumphantly. the superior property mathematical equation frighten intellectual opponent without precedent. an example connection present astro-physicist carl sagan broca’s brain (p. 151). accord story, french encyclopaedist diderot, atheist himself, challenge anyone prove existence god visit russian empress catherine’s court. when become embarrassment everyone, euler, master mathematician also temporary visitor court, say accept challenge. euler said, “sir, (a + bn)/n = x, therefore god exists. disprove”. the mathematics-phobic diderot, unable respond, say flee court! these example suggest people sometimes use gimmick confuse opponent win arguments. such win prove disprove proposition. they add knowledge extant body knowledge. they simply help crafty person make temporary escape exist difficult situation. scientific research different employment gimmick gain temporary winnings. it method use human intellect discover new knowledge add wisdom exist body knowledge disprove new discovery. hence, engage scientific research conform set accept principles, guideline code ethic morality. to follow set rule play game call scientific inquiry easy task. yet, one order separate science sometimes know pseudo-science. why scientific research? human knowledge old history human beings. human be attempt understand nature, use human intellect experience, could find answer question puzzle constantly. some question beyond direct observation “who create world?” “what cause rains?”. hence, quite natural hypothesise answer use intellect experience. when so, also inevitable base conclusion personal biases, fear prejudice harbour minds. such conclusion taint bias prejudice view hold person make conclusions. hence, find simply imposition personal view society and, therefore, fail explain reality nature. therefore, discovery make manner enhance human knowledge. in background, necessary build knowledge base mankind free biases, fear prejudices. this could attain pursue scientific inquiry base set principles, guideline ethical moral code discipline bi review 161/2008 1 researchers. it should, however, note conclusion derive scientific inquiry static permanent. the nature scientific inquiry conclusion derive give research study, karl popper point out, capable refute new inquiry. hence, result produce scientific research carry property refutability valid new research study would replace new results. in sense, knowledge base develop scientific inquiry could equate reservoir water would flow fresh water would flow continuously. but core knowledge, like permanently store water reservoir, would remain intact. the mind researcher engage scientific inquiry there certain quality prerequisite researcher engage scientific inquiry possess. the important open mind researcher commence inquiry. the researcher propagandist, person bend superimpose view others. he humble enough reject even view would hold long, inquiry support them. in words, conduct inquiry, objective establish view hold him, objective subject free inquiry. this know rational objective thinking. the buddha, discourse he preach member kalama clan, outline nature rational objective thinking, though purpose guide distinguish good bad. “oh, member kalama clan…” buddha said. “…do rely opinion hear often familiar it. do accept accord tradition find scripture logical conform theory. do accept preach teacher respect priest” (anguththara nikaya). the researcher plan engage scientific inquiry free influence previous knowledge tradition guide mere logical considerations. how could individual understand nature real world? there two approach suggest purpose, namely, classicism romanticism. classicism show world mean underlie form. it proceed reason law govern nature. if motor car engine present classicist, would interest find underlie mechanism determine mechanical law govern work engine. a romantic, hand, would simply interest out surface world. he would look world point immediate appearance. hence, romantic would find motor car engine wire cable strew everywhere disorderly manner dull appearance. a person scientific mind would get embroil classicism romanticism. this romanticism concern emotion – feel like biases, fear prejudice scientist avoid undertake scientific inquiry. what scientific method? robert m pirsig, philosopher-novelist, novel title zen art motorcycle maintenance, raise pertinent question regard scientist scientific inquiry. be sideway motorcycle mechanic scientist? the answer depend motorcycle mechanic would apply problem hand. accord pirsig, motorcycle mechanic lousy job, qualify call scientist. there many mechanic type. when faulty motorcycle bring mechanic, may simply jump conclusion base 2 bi review 161/2008 previous knowledge. instead subject motorcycle thorough scientific inquiry, may conclude fault lie certain part certain mechanism. to reach conclusion, gather relevant information. the chance may correct may correct. if correct, repair perform basis diagnosis make imperfect information prove success. but mechanic case behave like speculator outcome speculation may chance success failure. if turn failure, cost owner motorcycle would enormous. in case, since correct repair performed, motorcycle continue remain faulty. hence, true scientist engage scientific inquiry speculator. instead, person will follow scientific method arrive conclusions. decision could make mechanic attend faulty motorcycle resort either inductivism deductivism. the inductive approach require mechanic look evidence real world come conclusions. for instance, see crow black continue see black crows, may conclude crow black. a motorcycle mechanic may likewise see faulty part conclude fault lie part. the deductive approach, hand, require mechanic theorise mind come conclusion base empirical find would make support theory. in previous black crow example, may theorise crow black look black crow real world. when find one black crow, theory proved. a motorcycle mechanic become scientist, follow scientific method diagnosis fault subsequent repair motorcycle. it involve start open mind. there previously make conclusion prejudgments. the approach simply classical, is, guide underlie principle immediate appearance. there several step scientist follow adopt scientific method. a good motorcycle mechanic would also follow steps. the step involve scientific inquiry follows. first, identify problem state clear terms. in case motorcycle, problem may engine start. second, base problem, one hypothesis several hypothesis require regard cause problem made. the motorcycle engine start fuel tank. or blockage tube distribute fuel engine. or electrical system may failed. or carburettor would blocked. the mechanic would hypothesise possible reason failure engine. third, experiment design test hypothesis made. the mechanic may open fuel tank see whether fuel. if fuel, try start engine fill tank fuel. if fuel tank, would examine second hypothesis, is, whether blockage tube distribute fuel engine. if blockage, clean try start engine. if blockage, would experiment third hypothesis, namely, work electrical system. in manner, would experiment hypothesis make one one make relevant conclusions. fourth, result experiment analyse order ascertain whether hypothesis proved. or else, several hypothesis made, ascertain hypothesis proved. fifth, make final conclusion observe result experiments. a discipline motorcycle mechanic would follow step involve scientific method attend require repair fault motorcycle. in sense, sideway motorcycle mechanic different train scientist, since follow scientific method reach conclusions. bi review 161/2008 3 the use technique technology it fashionable scientist make use scientific technique technology facilitate decision make process, undertake scientific inquiries. extreme care exercise scientist instance. every technique methodology limitation scientist fully aware technique used. inappropriate use technique wrong conclusion make basis result derive amount misuse science researchers. it also pave way crafty individual use result advantage gullible individual get victimised. the use econometrics one technique employ scientist prove disprove hypotheses. this also one source misuse science, either wrong calculation make wrong conclusion arrive at, due failure researcher analyse error term appropriately. wikipedia, cyber-encyclopaedia, full instance misuse econometric method research. it noteworthy refer two study do deirdre n mccloskey stephen t ziliak university iowa status econometric study research article publish repute journal american economic review 1980s. they find fault author analyse error term properly use statistical term “significance” inappropriately. one paper publish journal economic literature march, 1996 title “the standard error regressions” make follow eye-opening comment: “such misuse statistical significance appear depend part vintage effect, measure date ph.d. conferral. the paper author ph.d. confer 1975 1979, inexpensively generate t-tests first reach masses, considerably bad paper others make distinction economic statistical significance. they use word “significance” ambiguous way often early late ph.d. le likely separate statistical significance type significance section scientific policy implications” (p 111). the find mccloskey ziliak also startling. of 182 article american economic review surveyed, 70 percent distinguish statistical significance economic, policy scientific significance. while refer largeness estimators, 72 percent ask “how large large?” at time, 59 percent use word “significance” ambiguous ways. a pronounce failure non-reporting descriptive statistic mean regression variable 69 percent authors. (p 106). the problem econometric study computation make author remain “black box” ordinary readers. it responsibility editor journal verify black box assure quality behalf general public consume outcome research studies. it is, therefore, dishearten learn journal publish paper without due reference consideration methodology adopt conduct research reference. today, course, advance statistical package available, possible editor journal check appropriateness statistical calculation make paper writers. since ordinary reader scientific paper unable gauge wrongful way handle econometrics researchers, study editor paper publish become important. in view gullibility general readers, misuse econometrics learn paper akin “mis-selling” one find market place seller fully apprise buyer risk buy product. this type mis-selling researcher could term “econometric dishonesty” suppose practise. researcher find truth truth the real world vast complex. hence, cannot map scientific research adequately, like neurologist unable map human brain completely. what 4 bi review 161/2008 science discover flint truth vast real world. a such, dearth hypothesis scientist could make dearth theory formulate. that good news prospective scientists. however, one theory valid today could disprove another theory formulate tomorrow. hence, theory subject property: property refutability. in fact, karl popper’s argument theory cannot refuted, become theory. hence, scientific research discover truth truth. this mean scientific research study undertake discipline would produce relative truth absolute truth. with scientific apparatuses, technique compute capacity available today, science still cannot reach absolute truth. a such, task find absolute truth relegate religion mystics. this may discourage news engage scientific research. but, way science throughout history discovery relative truth adequate purpose build human knowledge base put practical use mankind. in modern world, discovery absolute truth may therefore irrelevant. conclusion a researcher propagandist dictator. his task follow accept set principles, guideline ethical moral code discover truth, truth, add extant knowledge base. he start inquiry open mind ready reject even long hold view empirical study support them. but so, researcher display fair degree maturity necessarily cultivate within self-discipline, wisdom, objectivity equanimity. in sense, perfect researcher like buddha guide bias prejudice emotions. hence, important requirement researcher honest himself. bi review 161/2008 5 mario draghi: combat global financial crisis – role international cooperation text hkma distinguish lecture mr mario draghi, governor bank italy chairman financial stability forum, hong kong, 16 december 2008. * * * introduction it honour pleasure give hkma distinguish lecture. i thank joseph yam kind invitation. i also thank joseph colleague hkma host fsf asia-pacific regional meet concluded. the crisis afflict global financial system reach critical stage. on one hand combine response governments, central banks, regulatory authority private sector create base stability, admittedly still fragile, world financial system. on hand, sharp slowdown global growth necessarily translate credit loss impact bank industry. to mitigate recession break vicious circle round response – include fiscal, monetary regulatory policy – prove necessary. shortcoming assessment ahead crisis one strike aspect crisis precisely unfold continue catch policy maker private sector player surprise. it start default marginal segment financial service industry, quickly spread virtually assets. from us-only event, become global, fact force accelerate redress world macro imbalance u 15 years. the current recession result. none step anticipate timely way relevant actors. and i say “in timely way” i mean enough lead-time permit action could affect outcomes. policy reactive, sometimes even effective, never proactive, seem rule. this course approach policy-making try employ come control inflation meet objective macroeconomic policy. one reason asymmetry knowledge interaction within financial service industry global world quite superficial begin crisis. the private sector do better. the immediate outcome private sector’s shortcoming assessment sudden death many business generalize credit contraction. our collective understand process certainly deepen last year yet conscious fully-fledged view financial sector look year come. much effort go far initiative address short-term medium-weaknesses system, may approach time appropriate start think reconstruction. to so, however, first see reality elude market’s perception ahead crisis. first, underlie reason problem u subprime loan lead current broad-based macrofinancial crisis global nature exposure increase risk aversion deleveraging. risk price trade global level. over year precede crisis, overall price risk fell significantly, risky, illiquid position accumulate many different national international markets. when problem emerge specific category u subprime, start process ultimately lead bi review 160/2008 1 repricing risk across asset classes. a tim geithner note deliver lecture two year ago, pattern new one: time financial crisis, investor cut risk-taking, cut everywhere, differ fundamental individual market become irrelevant. second, many saw risk leverage increasing, optimistic view overestimate true degree risk dispersion diversification credit market become conventional wisdom. in particular, even become apparent credit standard deteriorated, neither capital markets, bankers, regulator perceive extent risk exposure generate securitisation stay bank balance sheets. also collectively overestimate ability system absorb, rather amplify, pressure de-risking deleveraging. on another front, crisis underway world seem discover risk inherent business model rely excessively wholesale fund markets, specific institution system. and, give risk misunderstand domestic level, case international level, firms, investor regulator farther market bad risk originated. one way explain collective blindness review market development that, year lead crisis, make regulators’ market’s knowledge suddenly obsolete, increase opacity financial system whole. let give examples. • for first time recent year securitization apply low quality mortgages. monitor capital market low quality make difficult fact probability default factor i) probability drop real estate price u national level, occur since great depression, ii) effect change lend standard probability default markets, iii) cross correlation across default default rest economy. • second, especially 2004, massive amount issuance collateralize obligation player increase market power player credit rat agency dependence source revenue. • third, sec’s relaxation 2004 pre-existing limit leverage investment bank vastly increase complexity risk management. for time neither bank regulator seem fully perceive decision would radically change industry. • finally, rapid growth cd market, ten year go zero 44 trillion dollar notional amounts, create entirely new definition counterparty risk much difficult assess, evaluate collateralize. with benefit hindsight one may tempt say regulator probe deeply, example, risk characteristic triple-a rat super senior cdo tranches, realise risk sharp fall credit quality market value instrument much great triple-a rat bond. and, since responsibility supervisor especially attentive tail risk extreme events, require bank make appropriate capital charge instruments. this might right thing but, previous discussion shown, knowledge lead type behaviour simply there. there many lesson one draw current crisis one especially stand general all-encompassing character. in future much alert systemic implication market development decisions, profound implication many different ways. for one thing, financial innovation simply welcome narrow, specific benefits, case past, carefully scrutinize potential systemic risks. this 2 bi review 160/2008 may well dampen growth financial service industry, enhance survival long term. furthermore, long true threat let financial institution fail effective weapon moral hazard. when implication default systemic, global world case much often past, threat credible say least. and go reliance financial system’s incentive credibly regulate itself, unless find mitigants moral hazard immune systemic implications. finally, regulator take close look ourselves, view eliminate everything contribute segment perception event financial system. response crisis a financial crisis – event financial system fail core tasks, include allocate savings, finance investment, price assets, transfer risk – pose difficult challenge policy term assessment calibration responses. these task difficult domestic level, still complex global level. a critical set challenge relate information gaps. we make progress recent year develop analytical tool metric assess risk ahead crisis. unfortunately, almost definition, crisis involve event process unexpected. and problem emerge, dimension implication impossible gauge quickly. at international level, assessment challenge still. cross-border exposure difficult assess, especially difficult anticipate confidence effects, often primary mean cross-border contagion. also, determine calibrate response classic case decision-making limit information uncertainty. there way know either ex ante ex post whether one make right choice. a hasty response country may increase moral hazard others. but, reach stage forceful response needed, delay country join others dilute impact response delay prompt resolution. in summary vastly imperfect knowledge segment nature would make fast effective crisis response unlikely, since learn crisis unfolded. under circumstances, i think government central bank remarkably flexible open-minded develop implement creative response condition faced. we identify four distinct area authority need act: fund liquidity pressure interbank markets; solvency risk face systemically important institutions; medium- long-term measure strengthen system; slowdown macroeconomy. each feature number critical information gap overcome, present challenge term international coordination. liquidity pressure primary focus policymakers early stage crisis, start august 2007, remain concern ever since. central bank understand early stage need act, act quickly, give sudden rapid rise market’s demand liquid funds, asset ultimately source supply. central bank initially focus markets, give cross-border confidence effect well need foreign currency liquidity many markets, rapidly develop number channel cooperation, include coordinate policy announcement foreign currency swap lines. after collapse lehman september, systemic nature crisis manifest unprecedented force. in financial markets, observe rapid shift liquidity credit risks, prevalent recourse market central bank massive governments’ intervention. response include vary combination deposit guarantees, debt guarantees, capital injections, asset purchases. while bi review 160/2008 3 vary local conditions, need coordination well understood, work make response consistent well underway. what lesson experience recent month deal liquidity solvency problem buffet financial systems? for one thing, learn new global risk environment speed development increase dramatically correspondingly reduce time authority effective response. this increase reliance preventative measure ahead crisis. second, learn international aspect crisis response become many time important before. the transmission shock across border happen diverse channel even year ago. give many international externality involve measure might take national authorities, mechanism coordinate crisis response need place well advance. plan need formulate potential consequence must think through. resolution procedure bankruptcy arrangement also need harmonise good across markets. strengthen system from start current crisis, clear short-term measure address liquidity solvency complement action strengthen system long term. just critical externality short-term response measure call international coordination, long term action need address cross-border effect regulatory policy order assure maintenance level play field. the work strengthen global systemic resilience proceed degree international cooperation speed would unthinkable one year ago. in develop initiatives, broad underlie consensus among authority goal create financial system le leveraged, good capitalised, transparent, feature strong incentive participant system. the fsf prove effective vehicle coordinate action international level. thank broad sectoral membership, encompass finance ministries, central banks, top regulators, international institutions, international standard-setting bodies, expert groupings, able keep one another apprise risk face different sector respective work programs. importantly, membership include key actor responsible implement action recommend. the willingness member exchange information views, alter accelerate work programs, truly remarkable. however, crisis also point need u expand membership geographically, particularly respect large emerge economies. this issue work seriously expect make progress soon. a first set initiative take fsf focus reduce information gaps: term raw data available authority market; term mechanisms, credit ratings, information compile use market; term analytical work official sector ass risk vulnerability system. improve international account disclosure practice help market authority understand risk exposure better. account standard setter take important step address weakness area valuation illiquid security treatment off-balance sheet vehicles. security regulator take number action intend improve role credit rat system, clarify appropriate use investor regulators, address concern conflict interest rat process. 4 bi review 160/2008 close collaboration imf fsf one way global community hope improve ability stay top risk future. a second set initiative focus prudential regulation oversight. i believe strengthen capital liquidity framework see central achievement work enhance systemic resilience. more capital require trade securitisation risks, intense oversight apply liquidity risk management banks. these improvement phase carefully, exacerbate situation still fragile. give importance preserve level play field, work necessarily coordinate internationally. third, fsf initiate different work stream direct reduce procyclicality financial system, i.e. tendency financial system accumulate excessive risk leverage good time shed risk excessively downturn. effort also underway improve incentive create compensation system financial firms. fourth, supervisor agree cooperate closely oversee internationally active banks, vehicle supervisory colleges. finally, go forward, crucial review perimeter regulation, order reduce gap inconsistency regulatory regime address potential systemic issue present sector currently regulated. new challenge macroeconomic policy while structural response clearly essential part cure, help renew confidence markets, also clear many measure take discuss impact medium term. this nature structural response, foremost concentrate regulatory framework. today immediate challenge face avoid situation recessive force deepen combine impairment financial market create vicious spiral. over last months, outlook quickly shift slowdown recession, supply demand shock, inflation deflation risks. this new situation require bold actions, also step level cooperation common understand policy maker national level internationally. let briefly review main challenge confront conduct macroeconomic policy look forward. monetary policy monetary policy response dry global liquidity extremely responsive fully cooperative. on october 8, coordination monetary field reach new heights, simultaneous reduction interest rate eight major central banks. since official interest rate reduce rapid successive wave across globe, respond deterioration economic outlook rapid recede inflation. today margin action rapidly shrink particularly u japan policy rate close zero low bound. rapidly fall inflation expectation and, areas, deflation risks, together impossibility low rate zero, pose challenge test effectiveness monetary policies. we know inability maintain sufficiently low real interest rate aggravate crisis past. at start great depression, example, short term real interest rate actually increase u (up 10 per cent!) 1933, rapid fall inflation. in japan “lost decade” short term real interest rate remain relatively high 1995. such development often point key factor drive economy prolong depression. bi review 160/2008 5 the list monetary policy instrument available central bank reflate economy official rate close zero fairly wide. it includes: • “quantitative easing” policy, i.e. expand money base beyond strictly need keep official rate zero, order reduce liquidity risk provide incentive financial intermediary expand credit (elements policy, amply use japan recently, visible exceptional action many central bank today); • measure reduce long term interest rates, direct purchase long term government security and/or carefully design communication influence market expectation (bank japan feed 2002-03); • purchase wide range private asset security equity (as guest, hkma, experience asian crisis ten year ago). a effective unconventional monetary policy instrument may boost economy price stability stake, aware limit broad implications. first, effect many policy well-known: conduct monetary policy bind surround much uncertainty normally case. it example unclear far long term rates, particular risk premia embed rates, bring liquidity injection situation widespread uncertainty economic prospects. well design communication central bank may crucial respect. second, importantly, always keep mind responsiveness economy depend large extent health financial intermediaries, absence even powerful liquidity injection greatly effective. third, risk introduce distortion financial prices, call particular care design measures. fourth, unconventional measure may direct redistributive impact specific sector economy category society normal monetary policy actions. this imply high degree common understand cooperation fiscal monetary authorities, part clear definition respective responsibility field action. fiscal policy a effectiveness action monetary field become le certain, fiscal stimulus become necessary. when financial market work properly credit constraint widespread, private spend sensitive current disposable income, impact fiscal stimulus therefore greater. to maximize effectiveness, fiscal action affect long term sustainability public finances, order avoid expectation high future taxes; moreover, stimulus direct impact strong fastest. in current circumstances, size quality international coordination crucial. uncoordinated move create spillover relative price exchange rate movement greatly reduce incentive implement fiscal stimulus individual country level. on contrary, coordinate action take globally, individual country’s measure significant joint benefit increase foreign demand. the quantitative effect spillover quite substantial. recent simulation conduct bank italy find coordinate fiscal action european level could increase 6 bi review 160/2008 30 per cent impact measure take italy alone.1 the result report imf late world economic

countries, public finance and/or net external position le sound, margin action obviously limited. this mean nil. but imply medium term growth-enhancing debt-reducing policy become crucial. for example, compensate action may take bolster pension reforms, order lighten burden come age population increase participation rates; implement deep restructure measure public sector enhance efficiency

contraction, need ensure individual action come form coherent approach pressing. in europe, european commission propose plan, currently discussion, concert action fiscal authorities, much line

introductory remark mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, dinner member “internationaler club frankfurter wirtschaftsjournalisten”, frankfurt main, 15 december 2008. * * * lady gentlemen, a warm welcome thank much invitation club evening. i happy see many familiar face audience tonight. communication important issue times. be frankfurt i think profound remark goethe: “niemand würde gesellschaften viel sprechen, wenn er sich bewuβt wäre, wie oft er die anderen missversteht“. nevertheless let bold enough share think communication central banks. communication key element central bank enhance effectiveness, predictability credibility monetary policy decisions. it become even important difficult times, economic outlook darken confidence weakens. it seem central bank improve communication significantly good time – also bad time – year ago communication almost see breach professional code. why change? why central bank decide become transparent? prior 1990s, central bank much work assumption monetary policy effectiveness great central bank systematically surprise markets. the old belief base notion central bank would measure success action extent economic activity could raise maintain potential. if rational individual already expect certain change, adjust behaviour expectation. and mean monetary policy change would effect. in past fifteen years, however, two important development change theory practice central banking. first, assumption successful monetary policy act surprise make sequence isolate step subject thorough theoretical scrutiny close oblivion. it become clear policy-making surprise isolate step bear last effect economy public recognise intention motivate monetary authority. a monetary policy strategy make isolate action intention boost output potential bind lose effectiveness short-term inflationary impact policy soon become embed price wage expectations. output employment react short-run, medium term economy suffer permanently high inflation. the drive toward central bank independence provide additional encouragement transparency. today overwhelm majority central bank across globe independent. the political functional independence central bank important milestone way towards separate authority tax spend power control credit conditions. this separation critical factor behind bi review 160/2008 1 general decline inflation observe past decades.1 but independence make democratic accountability monetary authority important. many central bank go well beyond strict legal requirement pronouncement communication impose statutory accountability duties. the question is: why? the reason rest simple though powerful insight: transparency render monetary policy effective. in world policy-making surprise lose purpose, wide knowledge central bank’s preference objective serve coordination device private beliefs. anchor expectation around objective policy help coordinate reaction economic behaviour macroeconomic shock along appropriate path adjustment central bank want economy follow. many central bank therefore start communicate firm commitment nominal anchor, announcement precise definition price stability. in many cases, central bank go spell general monetary policy strategy, analytical framework use policy maker ass risk achievement central bank’s objectives. a grow body empirical evidence support assumption transparent quantitative objective communication strategy reinforce monetary policy. for instance, recent ecb study show that, follow introduction quantitative definition price stability, inflation persistence considerably diminish euro area, switzerland five inflation-targeting countries.2 while large component switch expectation formation due genuine regime change, exceptional speed adjustment would possible without extensive communication onset new regime. communication difficult time central bank communication – support establish strategy – might well quiet uneventful activity. in difficult times, however, economic outlook darken exceptionally confidence falters, communication become even important explain central bank intend gear policy. we have, one hand, need take communicate swift action implement appropriate monetary policy refinance commercial banks. on hand, need communicate clearly adherence central bank long-term objective policy way intend steer policy course back normal path abnormal circumstance risk subsided. communication difficult time inherently challenge central banks. however, facilitate two fundamental component ecb’s monetary policy strategy. the first quantification price stability objective. this grant significant level predictability. the monetary policy ease enact last two month – scale unprecedented short period time – motivate sharp ease inflation pressure look future. the fact market could predict move fair degree precision – despite exceptional cloud uncertainty surround economic projection present condition – proof main mode 1 see, example, alesina, a. l. summer (1993), 'central bank independence macroeconomic performance: comparative evidence', journal money, credit

mr trichet: i’m sure really eurozone’s first crisis, remember also burst internet bubble, cope oil commodity price shock. moreover, also set difficulty there, include tell 2004 large country unravel stability growth pact. so i would say face series circumstance certainly easy. but remain true, course, u authority world – central banks, executive branch perhaps also parliament – cope truly exceptional situation. in sense i would say tested. in way ecb le test federal reserve, exceptional circumstance call exceptional decision response large number central banks. but extent ten year old, test course particularly important young institution. ft: what difficult moment ecb term crisis management? trichet: i would certainly say first hour outset financial turmoil. the executive board make diagnosis situation short time span, ass kind problem deal with, take decision almost instantaneously. ft: …this july/august 2007, yes…. trichet: this 9 august 2007. we important decision take, way first important decision central bank take order confront exceptional circumstances. i remember i keen thinking, “this grave situation call appropriate responses”. and great number important decision take subsequent months, largely “firsts”, term supply liquidity fix rate even term expand collateral framework which, outset, already comprehensive collateral framework. it big challenge. one challenge take decision rapidly level govern council. and prove that, thank teleconferencing, one hour half two hour could make full judgment take decision. we test capacity teleconference short notice, order sure could confront new situation. we large number teleconference govern council. you see there…[points telephone table] if situation demand one hour half teleconference govern council, indeed teleconference one hour half. the full continent would there. that’s impressive, would mean member govern council ljubljana helsinki lisbon dublin. ft: and say, exceptional crisis, global crisis. how much bad would without euro? trichet: it difficult reconstruct history new assumptions. but memory experience together old day certainly would situation would difficult, top global challenge without precedent, would cope intra-european tensions, bi review 159/2008 1 equivalent intra-erm 1 tensions, would demanding. there doubt standpoint enormous challenge level euro area whole were, fortunately, result intra-euro-area tensions, something important. ft: and would put single market risk? trichet: and would put single market risk, sure. not central bank cope exceptional situations. government call upon take action various forms, fact europe union sovereign state mean lot decision imply taxpayers’ money risk taxpayer take level government parliaments. hence constant need ensure maintain single market level playing-field, re-nationalise segment market. this big challenge level institutional framework europe, do well far. ft: in past, warn first test euro would also perhaps put intolerable strain currency union, academic even suggest would fall apart. this happened, worry member state currency union face great challenges, say, others? trichet: europe’s institutional framework solid, prove solidity. the euro functioned, large, protection intense international challenges. on hand clear economy run properly possible. we market system punish behave improperly. that reason tell member euro area respect stability growth pact. it legal framework quid pro quo fact federal budget federal government. and economically base solid ground. consider spread refinance various government’s treasuries: take account various fiscal policies. consider ricardian effects, level confidence lack confidence observe various constituency economic agents, particularly level households: suggest certain situation behave properly might lose term confidence suppose gain additional spending. we also say regularly various member euro area must aware unit labour cost evolution, relative competitiveness various economy inside euro area, inside single market 27 eu members. this something also important. ft: but course stability growth pact, thank french government, 1997, still constricting. trichet: it suppose function prevent various fiscal policy loosen positive part business cycle order provide appropriate room manoeuvre downbeat episode business cycle. ft: you mean exceptional circumstance clause? trichet: in case suppose close balance much good surplus the… ft: … upswing… trichet: … yes, affluent episode business cycle, least 3% gdp room manoeuvre cope difficulty business cycle reverses. but top mention exceptional circumstances, add stability growth pact. the pact design cope episode business cycle i mentioning, reason say room manoeuvre embed pact exist utilised. ft: do think germany utilise extent should? 2 bi review 159/2008 trichet: every nation ricardian effect assessment situation. i want comment particular country, duty look continent 320 million fellow citizen whole. but i fully accept difference capacity household various culture accept deterioration situation, again, ricardian channel tell u one might lose loss confidence one might gain additional spending. every nation ass situation. we union sovereign states, take account sovereign decision-making process level nation. the process require approval parliaments. in case might decision take expeditiously democratic institution function rapidly. in case accept take long take decision would fully line effective function democracy concerned. but i judge country. ft: but role believe, then, fiscal stimulus play mitigate effect crisis move u towards recovery? trichet: i believe exist room manoeuvre accord stability growth pact rule fully utilised. and great coherence provision stability growth pact one hand, – least speak euro area – attentive economic analysis would recommend other. again mindful spread various treasuries, fact market aware room manoeuvre various countries. we also mindful ricardian effect important. when look level save proportion household revenue various countries, see extent already largely take account expectation tomorrow you’ll face additional taxation additional finance need public funds. ft: in us, really strike european understand crisis exceptional way may put aside rules. these exceptional circumstances. but hand european feel we’ve use much effort political put together agree rule whatever do, mustn’t abandon them. now, come two side equation? trichet: incidentally, exceptional relationship side atlantic large number areas, include supply dollar liquidity. we lot “premiers” term decisions, “premiers” term close cooperation confident cooperation central banks. this something important. but i’m cautious. i take stability growth pact is, provision exceptional circumstances. but would mistake take account fully situation various economies. we exceptional situation, understand exactly limit fiscal room manoeuvre also depend culture. i see culture people anxious medium long run fiscal situation would unsustainable, others reason short term. the “discount rate” implicit various culture same. we also take account. we don’t federal government. we don’t federal budget. if unravel stability growth pact won’t rebuild afterwards. it would unravelled. and would i say american friend tell me, “you put cart horse – don’t federal budget federal government – single currency”? i understand outside setup might seem little surprising, take everything account, credibility euro area, fact quid pro quo birth euro area term institutional framework, setup solid. and don’t forget also something negligible. the role automatic stabiliser also important, i urge member euro area display bi review 159/2008 3 degree worsen fiscal balance represent function automatic stabilisers. if i compare euro area – i think would also true europe whole – us, public spend proportion gdp significantly high us. we social safety net social protection general comprehensive us, hence role automatic stabiliser significantly important. it represent much large part gdp. an order magnitude could decrease gdp, would perhaps twice much influence automatic stabiliser percentage gdp euro area compare us. a large level public spend proportion gdp something necessarily proud of, kind “amortiser” period difficult. ft: in britain you’re look potential 8 per cent budget deficit next year gdp, america word next fiscal boost, name number go higher. and doctrine overwhelm force, powell doctrine, use throw everything problem. now, see risk approach, sympathetic? trichet: if i stick understand difficulty face, i would say certainly pay price absence long period time appropriate balance various economy world over. i’m mention one economy another particular, i think phenomenon industrialise world complex manifest u also significant number industrialise economy include european economies, see permanent tendency domestic imbalance save investment, mirror image large external imbalances. i think aware that. it seem tell presently – message industrialise country understand – normal position, dangerous position domestically externally significantly imbalance. reflect call “overwhelming force”… i don’t know. i memory colleague side atlantic tell limit … all colleague trust limits, case. i would echo i would say always limits. there limit regard structural feature permanent feature function various economies. and think limits, teach limit ricardian effects, financial market themselves. ft: if look medium term, get achieve good balance? how avoid, like, another wave volatility base around unrealistic asset prices, asset bubble? trichet: let u look time burst internet bubble. there degree excessive pessimism, i analyse real situation internet bubble burst. i exclude term macroeconomic policy were… ft: …in word assume thing really bad bubble burst, therefore err maybe monetary side, perhaps…. trichet: i criticise anybody, i know pressure ecb resist time. i appoint end 2003. a early begin 2004 three head state government large country call publicly ecb decrease interest rates. i suppose benefit hindsight would appear extraordinary, take account happen afterwards, documented. central bank permanently asymmetrically call privilege short term detriment medium long term sensitivities, constituency whether private public … we make independent precisely democracy rely u reason also medium long term, avoid exclusively trap short-term considerations. in experience, national international experience euro area: i know practically constituency would call u increase rate time! i experience consequence 1980s second oil shock default sovereign states, mark 1980s. we negative consequence 4 bi review 159/2008 dramatic oil shock commodity price shock cope 2000s, been, top save glut, additional pot force save accumulate level global economy oil commodity producers. that create additional element capital chase investment hunt yields. you low level spread, low level volatility low level risk premia, contribute create asset bubble, asset price inflation. ft: be measure could take policy adopt order avoid another wave volatility? trichet: i would say impossible market economy avoid fluctuations. we accept up downs. what overwhelm duty eliminate, completely possible, in-built element global finance amplify boom busts. such pro-cyclical element everywhere. they behaviour various private entity themselves. we draw appropriate lesson that, include term risk management. we reflect account rules. now see exactly account rule could best reflect reality situation, would avoid augment boom bust case. we reflect basel committee prudential rule bank also insurance companies. a regard market rule general might been, take account, gear towards short-termism pro-cyclical. all avenue see front u meet context financial stability forum, g20, ifmc, g7, g8 g10 group central bank governors. i think much agree appropriate avenues. i use sum say first improve transparency dramatically financial instruments, market institutions. we second combat pro-cyclicality everywhere global financial system, third combat short-termism fourth significantly improve risk management private sector general. moreover, improve surveillance, global level, economy systematically important. it china, u europe, also member g20, systematically important. if everything settle regard financial system, really go without taboo direction presently suggest succeed. this include 67 measure suggest financial stability forum accept international community. but hand, maintain possibility global economy big imbalance would pile years, know recurrent correction equivalent earthquake continent moving, point lead collision. we prevent too. we speak much that, extremely important. ft: have politician lag behind financial markets? certainly, technocrats, central bank understood… the politics lacked, it? trichet: i would say that. the central bank indeed instrumental organise i would call line defense “systemic liquidity risk”. the executive branch take decision organise line defense “systemic solvency risk” threaten national, continental global finance. we ask decision taken. but i certainly underestimate difficulty task government put taxpayers’ money risk stake guarantee recapitalisation necessary. in euro area, uk, us, call courageous decisions. ft: be limit effectiveness monetary policy situation we're in, so, reaction central banker le circumstances? and role play exceptional measure disposal, quantitative ease debate essentially? trichet: first all, make point clearly clear separation monetary policy stance, design deliver price stability medium term bi review 159/2008 5 line definition, intervention money market aim permit smooth function market level short term interest rate decided. and continue look inflation expectation extreme care entire period. and i satisfied, i say, regain control inflation expectation event mid september, permit u decrease rate accompany alleviation inflationary pressure without hesitation. we participate collegial decrease rate organise major central bank world. so important first point. second point, regard present situation, consider decision take exactly necessary. take account alleviation inflationary pressures, mindful spread still observe money market. i say last press conference 4 december, remember, concentrate obtain interest rate effectively practise intend consequences. the transmission channel function usual, functioning. there doubt decision take impact, make complicated, complex present situation, particular fact money market function normally. we can, particular supply liquidity, money market function well possible. but observe challenge global level side atlantic; phenomenon observe try counter. it certainly easy eliminate, otherwise see phenomenon u europe, least progressively attenuate problem. ft: you say last week opportunity next week view operational framework, liquidity regime. you seem contain hint maybe change might planned. can tell u without…? i expect tell u decide, would aim be? would perhaps apply whip bank encourage…? trichet: i say nothing stage. ft: what buy debt, though; buy government debt? would consider move ecb? trichet: again, i say experience demonstrate prepare unexpected exceptional situations, i would say i would eliminate anything ex ante, equally i pre-commit anything ex ante. we'll always look situation basis analysis, take everything account. today, certainly consider appropriate all. you speak quantitative measures. there measure quantity, impressive today – i'm speak side atlantic, side channel – size balance sheet central bank. this explain fact supply liquidity unlimited basis allow collateral way forthcoming. and true central banks. but us, weekly balance sheet comparison one year ago increase around 55 % [from around 1.3 trillion 2 trillion euro]. of course, increase imply increase net liquidity, significant part liquidity provide come back central bank deposit facility. ft: that’s le fed. trichet: yes, true. for ecb part come also fact counterpart dollar supply ourselves, counterpart dollar collateral. the central bank situation play much quantitative role use play, true us. ft: should centralise supervision within eurozone, ecb take responsibility? be ecb will take responsibility politician desire? 6 bi review 159/2008 trichet: a know, always favour close relationship central bank bank surveillance authorities. we say long, long new problems, new difficulties. we govern council position close start ecb, make public. so point, ambiguity all. we also strongly think good coordination big cross-border institution absolutely necessary; even could cope issue stake present circumstances, forget that. it's clear improve present framework improve it. some avenue already suggest ecofin. there already consensus appropriate memoranda understanding. but go direction also seem important. at stage, i say, i full-fledged govern council position. we still reflecting, see position govern council. but i understand european parliament carry several work do within suggestion ecb would play particular role domain coordination surveillance cross-border institution – little bite like us. the federal reserve position concentrate much big cross-border institutions. and i see also suggestion come private sector, come industry, could play important role domain. a president ecb’s govern council, i would say again, i position govern council, i think flat govern council call reflect that, parliament perhaps high-level group set commission number eminent personalities. we see. a little bite philosophy again. we cannot afford put future concept market economy risk did. i know world east west, north south. in matrix, one square four could say favour market economies. the others devise ideas, failed, good failed. however, trust put resilience market economy stake now. i think were, again, quite lucid this. i permanently first page financial time warn it, january 2007, davos, i provide sentiment colleagues, arise governors’ meet basel fact market participant prepare significant correction risk underassessed underestimate global finance. but fragility, global finance global economy itself, something reflect on. you know, key intermediate input produce three factory world. this reliable. we just-in-time system, minimum inventories, case shock might make full body real economy immediately vulnerable. in financial system eliminate number cushion shock-absorbers there. this morning, i tell staff, keen eliminate number air bag [global finance] “car”. so accident, surprise see lot scars. the scar current crisis global financial system significant. all investment bank new york either purchased, go under, change legal framework. that say something. a new concept resilience market economy essence. bi review 159/2008 7 fabrizio saccomanni: manage international financial stability edit text remark mr fabrizio saccomanni, director general bank italy, meet peterson institute international economics, washington dc, 11 december 2008. * * * i delight peterson institute present view international financial instability distinguish audience eminent scholar officials, among i fortunate count many old friends. this first visit institute since i invite join advisory committee i would like express gratitude fred bergsten invitation. i honour participate important body institute i look forward contribute activity promotion policy–oriented research field international economics. instability age globalization international financial instability subject fascinate intrigue since i young economist imf witness considerable anxiety collapse bretton wood system august 15, 1971. the ensue decade instability mostly attributable shock downward float dollar result two oil-shocks 1974 1979. after unsuccessful attempt rebuild bretton woods, negotiation reform international monetary system end 1976 legalization freely float exchange rate seem sufficient fix problem. a tire u treasury secretary, william simon, commented: “all well ends”. at begin 1980s, follow process liberalization, deregulation privatisation set motion margaret thatcher ronald reagan, widely expect full international capital mobility would interact float exchange rate ensure adjustment balance payment disequilibria stable financial environment. instead, new condition pave way emergence global financial system financial innovation ict revolution combine produce extraordinary expansion financial sector market compare real sector industrialize emerge countries. the seed instability thus plant fertile soil. indeed since 1980s financial disturbance occur increase frequency intensity entail major international repercussions. i review long list debt crises, currency misalignments, illiquidity credit markets, asset price bubbles, characterize age globalization, subject i devote considerable attention last years.1 i would rather quote paper write michael bordo, barry eichengreen others 2001 “the crisis problem”: since 1973 crisis frequency double bretton wood classical gold standard period match crisis-ridden 1920s 1930s. history thus confirm something different disturb age.2 1 see saccomanni f.

generous invitation. a many know, charles kind godfather entire generation central bankers. his 1988 book, the evolution central banks, remain classic still require read aspire central bankers. let take opportunity thank charles tonight’s wonderful platform and, importantly, long-standing contribution art, science, craft central banking. recur financial crisis become hallmark modern financial system. it would seem that, every five year so, 100-year event destabilise system. moreover, crisis appear violent previous one. with current crisis showcase, i argue excessively high leverage key factor make bank ultimately financial system much fragile vulnerable observers, regulators, market participant ever imagined. base diagnosis, i argue favour restrict leverage core financial institutions, i.e., banks. needle say, bank tendency oppose regulation. i therefore discus detail regulate banks’ capital necessary promote financial stability. 2. high leverage main cause financial fragility the swiss economy far epicentre current financial crisis. yet, two big swiss bank hit particularly hard recent events. this large extent consequence extraordinarily high leverage. for year now, argue high leverage make particularly vulnerable extreme financial shocks.1 look risk-based capital measures, two large swiss bank among best-capitalised large international bank world. look simple leverage, however, institution among worst-capitalised banks. with benefit hindsight, clearly put even great emphasis risk excessive leverage. excessive leverage mean problem uniquely associate two big swiss banks. there increase international recognition excessive leverage crucial contribute factor current crisis. in april, chairman financial stability forum (fsf), governor mario draghi, summarise view fsf said: “our conviction […] institution accumulate level leverage misperceive excessive.”2 gerald corrigan argue “leverage, many form clearly drive force create market condition would trigger crisis, inevitable de-leveraging downside cycle would severely amplify magnitude crisis.”3 in similar vein, international monetary fund (imf) stress dramatic deleveraging financial institution exacerbate downward spiral 1 see every issue swiss national bank’s financial stability report since 2003. 2 mario draghi, chairman financial stability forum, address g7 minister governors, april 2008. 3 e. gerald corrigan, the credit crisis. the quest stability reform, the william taylor memorial lecture, group thirty, washington dc, 2008, p. 8. bi review 158/2008 1 prevalent current crisis.4 hence, implication, high start level leverage major source severe ongoing adjustment problems. finally, leader g20 declare last month “excessive leverage” root cause “vulnerabilities system”.5moreover, problem excessive leverage limit current crisis. it pivotal feature previous financial crises. john galbraith, instance, carefully document role debt leverage crisis go back 17th century.6 more recently, president’s work group financial market conclude 1999 that, “the principal policy issue arise event surround near collapse long-term capital management constrain excessive leverage.”73. be need good regulation? assume agreement excessive leverage major factor past crises, ought do it? an obvious response limit leverage. but really obvious? after all, people would argue regulation least partly blame past crises. before i go further, i want clarify i stand debate regulation vs. free market – ideological baggage, speak. i believe free market best available mechanism allocate resource ultimately best way promote welfare economic growth. fundamentally, i therefore wary elaborate effort interfere function free, competitive markets. at time, obvious that, certain conditions, free market produce inefficient outcomes. if market failure apparent important enough, justify indeed require interference market mechanism. a joseph stiglitz put it, “whenever “externalities”– action individual impact others pay compensate – market work well.”8in real world banking, potential market failure particularly relevant. an important market failure stem fact bank enjoy benefit safety net. many country explicit deposit insurance schemes, limit depositors’ losses. moreover, almost every country degree implicit government protection large banks. in current crisis, government protection become manifest explicit form recent g7 g20 communiqués. most notably, october g7 finance minister central bank governor declare unambiguously “agree take decisive action use available tool support systemically important financial institution prevent failure.”9 in words, government imply large bank simply “too big fail”. clearly, benefit bank safety nets. but also serious costs. it fact presence insurance lead le careful behaviour, otherwise know moral hazard. if rent fully insure car, likely exercise le care drive it. 4 see october 2008 issue imf‘s global financial stability report, entitle ”financial stress deleveraging“. 5 declaration summit financial market world economy, g20, 15 november 2008. 6 see john galbraith (1990): a short history financial

158/2008 naturally, therefore, rental car much short life span non-rental cars. the reason apply banks. no sane banker intentionally manage bank insolvency. but low incentive avoid insolvency insured. this sub-optimal level caution immediately apparent banks’ balance sheets: bank tend hold low level capital. in cross-sectional comparison, bank much low capital cushion uninsured firms. on average, list non-financial firm capital-to-asset ratio 30 40 percent.10 in stark contrast, onset current crisis, world’s top 50 bank institution held, average, 4 percent capital. none hold 8 percent.11in short, bank preference high leverage. this highlight fundamental dilemma capital regulation: bank don’t like it. banker typically argue high leverage beneficial even necessary. therefore, bank naturally oppose regulation aim restrict leverage. i find neither upset surprising. if regulation effective, must expect impact behaviour restrict action. this solicit complaints. if doesn’t, regulation would, definition, superfluous. 4. from basel i basel ii for reasons, i strongly support bank capital regulation put meaningful limit banks’ leverage. but best way restrict leverage? in ideal world, would, course, also want take account riskiness banks’ assets.12 a know, bank increase risk increase leverage also increase riskiness assets. to compensate difference banks’ assets, would ideally require bank risky asset hold capital. the basel committee bank supervision embrace precisely risk-weighted approach. more risk, capital. if live ideal world, simple principle would work well. by “ideal”, i mean world risk observe everybody assess precisely. what become abundantly clear recent month live ideal world. bank risk incur far transparent. in fact, bank exist asymmetry information.13 a core function bank “produce information”. for instance, bank screen potential borrowers. furthermore, bank monitor ongoing lend relationships. without asymmetry information, bank would necessary, since household could invest save directly mutual funds. therefore, definition cannot bank full transparency.14 fortunately, bank totally opaque either. some risk assess le readily. a u treasury bill clearly le risky unsecured loan obscure software company. therefore, capital requirement least partially base relative riskiness various type assets, even non-ideal world. “basel i”, first basel accord 1988, introduce “risk buckets” purpose. for instance, loan receive risk weight 100%, government bond risk weight 0%. “basel ii” – revision 10 raghuram rajan luigi zingales (1995):

studies. 14 see charles goodhart (1988): the evolution central banks, p. 63. bi review 158/2008 3 first basel accord – currently implemented, try go beyond perceive rather crude risk buckets. under basel ii, risk differentiate detail. for example, loan large, international aaa rat firm typically risky loan local restaurant. while sensible, high risk sensitivity basel ii come price. first, bank supervisor alike incur significant operational cost implement new, highly complex regulation. second, view importantly, basel ii create new risks: risk risk assessments. i tempt call unknowable unknowns. under basel ii, increase dependence risk models. what didn’t pick correct models? what data use calibrate model turn poor quality? what model correct past, future different? what certain tail event simply cannot modelled? these important consideration keep mind interpret risk figure complex models. a turn out, view model output true representation reality prove grave mistake. furthermore, increase reliance banks’ internal model render job supervisor extraordinarily difficult. first, supervisor examine banks’ exposures. second, evaluate highly complex models. third, gauge quality data go computation models. to put diplomatically, constitute formidable task outsider limit resources.155. strengthen basel ii: introduce leverage ratio so leave us? base know understand today, i would suggest risk-weighted capital requirements, broadly propose basel ii, probably remain rigorous way address banks’ tendency incur excessive risk and, ultimately, ensure adequate capital levels. however, must address serious short-comings risk-weighted approach, become powerfully manifest crisis. what basel ii needs, therefore, safeguard provide financial system additional protection negative consequence short-comings. i want stress safeguard kind need addition improvement basel ii currently way result recent fsf report g7 minister governors.16 which bring back obvious simple response excessive leverage: the imposition limit banks’ leverage complement risk-weighted approach reflect current basel framework. the regulation banks’ leverage usually refer “leverage ratio”. specifically, idea set low limit capital-to-assets ratio banks. let stress instrument mean replace basel ii. there reason eliminate benefit risk-weighted capital requirements. the leverage ratio apply complement risk-weighted approach reflect current basel framework. that mean would two independent measure capital adequacy. and bank would meet minimum requirement measures. to extent, capital regulatory framework old news. historically, capital requirement country take form simple leverage ratios. risk-weighted requirement introduce follow first basel accord 1988. the “old-fashioned” leverage ratio replace “modern” risk-sensitive requirements. some 15 for discussion potential short-comings basel ii, see robert bichsel jürg blum (2005): “capital regulation banks: where do we stand where be we going?”, swiss national bank quarterly bulletin. 16 “report financial stability forum enhance market institutional resilience”, financial stability forum, 7 april 2008. 4 bi review 158/2008 countries, however, maintain leverage ratio essential element bank regulation. notable example u canada. despite somewhat old news, i convince introduction leverage ratio fully compatible ongoing effort strengthen banks’ capital. we must forget basel ii aim secure minimum level capital. it’s every bank every national supervisor exceed minimum. a g20 put it, “regulation first foremost responsibility national regulators”.176. the pro con leverage ratio let highlight important benefit leverage ratio. equally, i would like address commonly express concern leverage ratio. have leverage ratio complement risk-weighted capital requirement many advantages. some i already allude to. most significantly, leverage ratio operate fully independently complex model assumption calibration procedures. a such, serf complementary instrument risk-weighted requirement assess banks’ capital adequacy. this considerable value. during recent crisis bank supervisors, take several instrument account, include volume limit restriction asset growth, clearly perform better.18 more generally, research show risk-weighted capital ratio leverage ratio contain complementary information banks’ condition.19 hence, look risk-weighted capital ratio leverage ratios, supervisor bank expect make good judgment systematic way. moreover, much difficult bank arbitrage around two capital ratio around one. can say anything role leverage ratio recent credit crisis? while rigorous analysis would reach beyond scope comment today, seem clear leverage ratio help protect u bank system even great calamity. this necessarily leverage ratio encourage prudent behaviour, leverage ratio ensure minimal buff absorb negative consequence imprudent behaviour. i leave imagination would happen u bank enter current crisis leverage ratio 2 percent instead well 5 percent. it interest note mark carney, governor bank canada, convince canadian banks, also subject leverage ratio, “healthier international peers” “their leverage markedly lower”.20given positive effect leverage ratio, argument it? in view, three potential short-comings. they treatment off-balance-sheet exposures, pro-cyclicality, banks’ profitability. let briefly address turn. • off-balance-sheet exposures: to obtain leverage ratio, capital divide total assets. obviously, simple calculation fail take account off-balance-sheet items. the introduction leverage ratio could therefore encourage bank build large off-balance-sheet exposures. there two response potential problem. first, precisely important leverage ratio 17 g20, “declaration summit financial market world economy”, 15 november 2008. 18 see “observations risk management practice during recent market turbulence”, senior supervisor group, march 2008. 19 see, e.g., arturo estrella, sangkyun park, stavros peristiani (2000): “capital ratio predictor bank failure”, federal reserve bank new york economic policy review. 20 mark carney, “building continuous markets”, remark canada – unite kingdom chamber commerce, london, 19 november 2008. bi review 158/2008 5 use supplement basel ii. to extent move off-balance-sheet activity raise banks’ risk, basel ii result high capital charge – thereby reduce banks’ incentive possibility arbitrage around leverage ratio. more importantly, basel committee process improve treatment off-balance-sheet item basel ii. second, conclude despite ongoing reform basel ii, off-balance-sheet exposure continue undermine adequate capital provisioning, leverage ratio easily enhance include exposures. in canada, instance, off-balance-sheet item add banks’ total asset calculate leverage ratio. alternatively, could go consider define “managed leverage ratio” propose professor joseph mason louisiana state university, “which take securitisations put back balance sheet”.21 • pro-cyclicality: there valid concern leverage ratio may amplify financial cycle. first, imposition leverage ratio middle current crisis would put additional de-leveraging pressure banks. second, long run would make availability credit volatile. bank would force cut lend downturn order comply leverage ratio requirements. unfortunately, so-called pro-cyclicality inherent form capital regulation. the problem stem fact cases, specific capital minimum respect throughout cycle. in switzerland, recent reform large banks’ capital requirements, federal bank commission embark upon pragmatic approach address dilemma. in normal times, bank require hold capital significantly excess regulatory minima. conversely, cycle turns, allow dip capital cushion. naturally, swiss authority acutely aware impose tight capital requirement right would pro-cyclical. under new regime, capital requirement meet 2013. if necessary, implementation window extend further. • finally, let address question banks’ profitability: this tricky question, require two-part answer. first, capital requirement effectively reduce value bank’s explicit implicit government safety net. if think safety net put option owner bank, capital requirement effectively reduce price put option. in words, bank bear large share potential loss themselves. this, course, bad news banks. distortion due safety net main rationale capital regulation. capital requirement aim correct distortion strengthen motivation bank avoid excessive risks. while come cost banks, increase overall efficiency economic welfare. second, capital requirement reduce tax shield debt. debt advantage equity capital sense payment debt holder deduct profits. in contrast, payment shareholders, i.e., dividends, make profit hence subject corporate taxes. force bank hold capital reduce tax shield thereby diminish banks’ market value. what order magnitude talk here? let offer rough back-of-the-envelope calculation use publicly available data switzerland. assume bank increase leverage ratio 1% 5%. if bank subject 21 ”capital ratio help mask loom crisis”, the wall street journal europe, 11 november 2008. 6 bi review 158/2008 effective tax rate 20%, increase capital reduce bank’s total market value le 1%. however, cost notwithstanding, bank shareholder may also benefit hold capital. for instance, bank conservatively capitalise outset current crisis benefit relative strength. in area wealth management, instance, strong bank successful attract client weak banks. moreover, look poor performance thinly capitalise banks’ stock last decade so, low leverage ratio seem attractive. our empirical analysis suggest risk-adjusted stock return bank increase leverage. a cross-sectional comparison risk-adjusted return industry also sobering. the performance relatively low-capitalised bank sector devastate last decade. 7. conclusion to conclude, leverage major contribute factor current financial crisis. excessive leverage amplify shock financial system. moreover, inevitable de-leveraging impose stress system. to enhance longer-term resilience financial system, effective regulation curtail banks’ leverage required. in attempt put low bind banks’ leverage, i strongly support enhance current risk-weighted capital requirement simple leverage ratio. a leverage ratio effectively serf safety valve weakness shortcoming risk-weighted requirements. it ensure minimum capital buff protect bank unexpected loss underestimation risk. a learn current crisis, failure risk model may quickly turn bank seem comfortably capitalise poorly capitalise banks. let emphasise i don’t advocate replace current basel ii regime leverage ratio. this would unwise, would forgo advantage risk-weighted requirements. in particular, would lose valuable indicator banks’ level risk. and, quite frankly, real alternative sight, least readily. in discussion central bank regulatory colleague i detect increase interest willingness examine consider proposal leverage ratio complement risk-weighted capital regime basel ii. governor nout wellink, chairman basel committee bank supervision, recently say committee currently consider measure strengthen basel ii supplement “with simple, transparent gross measure risk”.22 last month, german council economic expert advise german government parliament introduce leverage ratio robust supplement basel ii.23 other country may also find worthwhile consider introduce leverage ratio, even formal international agreement fail materialise. in would enhance financial stability bank systems, would also contribute stable international financial system. finally, encourage note number bank make voluntary commitment exceed certain predefined leverage limits. add leverage ratio basel ii reinforce banks’ capital strengthen capital regulation. however, must remain realistic. introduce leverage ratio doesn’t solve everything. a leverage ratio address excessive leverage bank system. it 22 nout wellink, “the importance bank supervision financial stability”, speech give 17 november 2008. 23 german council economic experts, “mastering financial crisis – strengthen force growth”, 12 november 2008. bi review 158/2008 7 address credit concentration, excessive maturity mismatch undue reliance asset market liquidity. financial crises, let alone financial cycle never eliminated. our aim must ensure negative consequences, bank real economy, remain manageable. put place shock-absorbing leverage ratio complement risk-weighted framework basel ii help u get one step close goal. 8 bi review 158/2008 jean-pierre roth: recent economic financial development switzerland introductory remark mr jean-pierre roth,

situation change considerably since last assessment 18 september 2008. already back then, emphasise substantial risk attach development global economy, financial market energy prices. we also stress forecast economic activity inflation switzerland involve considerable uncertainties. we announce intention monitor development closely, order react swiftly need arise. a know, eventuality indeed materialise. this lead u relax monetary policy decisively uncertainty fade deterioration economic situation become concrete. we first low libor target range 8 october, 25 basis points; 6 november, 50 points; third time 20 november, 100 points. with new cut announce today, libor target range lie 0% 1%, reflect firmly expansionary monetary policy. today’s press conference give opportunity explain detail rationale behind actions. since assessment 18 september, situation change three key areas. first, international economic outlook deteriorate markedly, impact heavily forecast swiss economy. second, financial market crisis intensify since mid-september. finally, price raw material oil plummet this, combine worsen economic outlook, lead mark improvement inflation outlook. i deal three point turn. global economic outlook in september, main focus possibility sharply contract growth advance economies. now, know economic activity decline simultaneously u europe, slow appreciably emerge economies. whether one call recession depend definition used, merely question semantics. in us, gdp likely decline substantially current quarter, follow slight contraction third quarter. industrial production, hitherto remarkably stable, fell sharply 4% july october. moreover, unemployment, also stable time, rise rapidly, reach 6.7% november – level see since 1994. the sudden worsen situation due fall household spending. household saw financial situation deteriorate sharply due loss value real estate financial assets, also suffer – recently – progressive erosion purchase power continuous rise fuel prices. although fuel price since receded, effect price correction real estate sector – root cause financial crisis – well fall stock market price continue felt. in europe third quarter, gdp record second successive fall. despite recent depreciation euro, export hit slowdown global demand. this especially true germany, highly export-dependent. by prompt revision plan expand production capacity, first export industry upstream production chain, fall export lead downturn demand equipment bi review 157/2008 1 investment. moreover, countries, instance spain ireland, construction activity affect significant correction property prices. the picture mix asia. japan emerge economy region probably able escape brief recession, whole economic activity continue advance, albeit le strongly previously expected. in addition, emerge economy latin america eastern europe, heavily dependent capital inflows, could experience mark slowdown growth. thus, merely risk scenario september assessment become reality. the advance economy le move recession simultaneously. the crisis financial sector finally spread rest economy. with decline global demand, price food, raw material oil fall sharply. this positive flipside coin, since development boost real income consumption countries. swiss economic outlook the swiss economy course affect worsen international environment. at september assessment, still project mark slowdown activity, growth remain positive 2009. we forecast gdp growth negative, first two quarter next year, also average 2009 whole. with probable exception consumption, demand component decline. export equipment goods, demand know cyclical, affected. in countries, difficulty sale distribution, one hand, restriction lend conditions, hand, prompt downward revision investment plans. the u europe case point, loss momentum also observe emerge markets. these development weigh heavily export equipment intermediate goods. the substantial decline demand vehicle make u european manufacturer also impact swiss-based suppliers. the metals, machinery electronics industry first experience sharp correction new orders. the worsen outlook sale lead adjustment investment plan switzerland well. domestic demand equipment good could even turn severely affect component final demand. development slightly different construction sector important component, residential investment. house construction decline past years, although cut interest rate could halt trend. all factor bring sharp deterioration business confidence, put damp job creation country. unemployment start rise again. consumption continue grow, considerably slow pace. the household sentiment indicator sharply begin fourth quarter, reflect expectation great job insecurity. in contrast, unexpected fall inflation contribute increase real income, support consumption. for 2009 whole, snb forecast decline real gdp. this decline likely lie 0.5% 1%. change monetary financial condition a i mention open remarks, target range three-month libor already cut 175 basis point three step since september assessment. these successive cut render necessary number factor contribute tighten monetary conditions, whereas deteriorate general economic environment 2 bi review 157/2008 call relaxation. i need mention, regard, brief rapid ascent swiss franc october, surge credit risk premia bond markets. these movement since partly reversed, tension remain. these remark serve illustrate general observation: unfavourable economic development combine financial crisis impair transmission monetary policy, hence compromise effectiveness. the expansionary effect interest rate cut diluted. when confront risk, monetary authority take rapid decisive action order exert desire influence final demand. this do past months. in order monitor lend condition since outbreak financial crisis, snb conduct regular survey 20 major swiss banks. by provide u information banks’ intention expectations, survey complement analysis lend volumes. in vast majority institution surveyed, lend restriction announce third quarter. only 15% bank report lend practice become slightly restrictive. data october lend volume switzerland confirm picture. mortgage lend grow steadily, recently rate 3.4%. growth lend remain strong, albeit advance slightly slow pace. large company increasingly draw line credit, owe difficulty source finance capital markets. all all, is, present, reason speak credit crunch. however, favourable situation could soon worsen, observe countries. i conclude second section brief remark movement monetary aggregates. have decline recently, monetary aggregate rise slightly. follow interest rate cuts, expect growth monetary aggregate gather pace come months. give current heavy demand liquidity, high money growth not, itself, indicate increase inflation risks. only money growth become excessive long period would pose threat price stability medium term. inflation outlook in addition rapid worsen global economy financial crisis, third factor behind policy successive rate cut since october radical change inflation outlook. inflation risk largely dissipate since last quarterly assessment 18 september, leave considerable room manoeuvre monetary policy, firmly exploited. a know, last december inflation breach 2% ceiling snb consider condition price stability long met. the rapid rise inflation – indeed, begin 2007, still zero inflation – due combine effect virtually unbroken rise oil price healthy state economy. in july year, inflation reach 3.1%, level see 15 years. this matter concern, risk level would alter households’ inflation expectations, potentially lead sharp rise nominal wage year-end result certain stickiness inflation. however, two element behind recent rise inflation since reversed. first, oil price collapsed, fall usd 50 mark mid-november peak usd 145 early july. the plummet oil price explain drop global demand result economic slowdown described, unwind speculative positions. second, swiss economy soon operate potential, see renew rise unemployment. this situation moderate effect price wage-setting behaviour. bi review 157/2008 3 thus, forecast – graph presentation show moment – inflation decline almost continuously throughout 2009. despite interest rate cut make since october cut announce today, inflation remain low 2010 2011. a now, current forecast horizon, upside downside inflation risk become symmetrical. monetary policy decision we explain rationale behind recent monetary policy: first, global economic situation worsened, hit swiss economy quarter, particular next year. by contrast, inflation outlook improve appreciably. this increase snb’s room manoeuvre. finally, risk financial crisis cause deterioration finance condition economy whole. these consideration prompt today’s decision cut three-month libor target range another 50 basis points. give expect deterioration swiss economy imponderable link long variable monetary policy transmission lags, rate cut appear appropriate. with action reducing, extent possible, risk even pronounce economic downturn. inflation forecast chart how inflation forecast revised? the dash red curve chart represent new forecast. it cover period fourth quarter 2008 third quarter 2011, map future development inflation assumption three-month libor remain unchanged 0.5% forecast period. for purpose comparison, dash-dotted green curve show inflation forecast september monetary assessment, base three-month libor 2.75%. the new forecast show rapid fall inflation next quarters. it drop back 2% mark fourth quarter year. in light economic developments, continue decline end third quarter 2009, rise slightly next two quarter result base effect cause oil price movements. inflation subsequently fall even further, lie around 0.5% 2010, increase somewhat course 2011. this slight uptick inflation end 2011 explain fact libor 0.5% represent equilibrium level

bank serbia, 4th annual forum – “financial service south east europe”, belgrade, 4 december 2008. * * * lady gentlemen, it four week end year may safely say 2008 date eventful past 2 3 year take together! namely, sooner inflationary pressure subside back fall food fuel price face another, even great challenge. global financial market go unprecedented turmoil, already affect serbia likely produce effect 2009. at time like these, however, vital importance fully aware real state things, adopt pragmatic rather populist approach. a well aware serbia political buffers, make use relatively good time bank sector prepare difficult time facing. or warren buffet famously said: “it tide go know swim naked!” the unfortunate circumstance late give u chance prove well prepare challenges, i.e. swim “naked” tide liquidity. and usual receive commendation strength country’s bank system which, though face high deposit withdrawals, successfully withstand challenge, great maybe face bank system region. the success bank sector, however, obvious: a) serbian taxpayer spend single dinar rescue banks; b) nbs’ measure destabilize bank sector – reserve requirement domestic save remain 40%; c) bank ownership structure prove adequate time crisis. for serbia, key question remain – step take view global economic turmoil: 1. we finally understand current macroeconomic policy cannot continued: completely unrealistic expect time a) cheap foreign fund b) plentiful foreign investment suddenly return help u finance current account deficit 15 – 20%. now time reckoning, sooner accept fact, good concerned: enterprises, banks, households, state, etc. 2. we must admit current challenge fast spill serbia, first psychological effect and, late, economic effect well; 3. we must take emergency measures, macro micro level, alleviate effect financial turbulences. the budget republic serbia play key role respect. and i long talk plan intention general, build concrete mechanism target figure ensure sufficient liquidity level also adequate volume lend enterprises. until two month ago, i often label great pessimist us turbulence international market pretext oppose increase pensions, is, way, base real earnings. in meantime, however, pessimism surpass many, include early argue increase pension would actually u good. the reason simple – turmoil international market good pretext u-turn economic policies! so, weird twist events, i suddenly turn optimist again! bi review 157/2008 1 the grind cautious optimism follows: - on 19 december year, imf executive board approve arrangement serbia, buttress macroeconomic stability country; - the draft memorandum government republic serbia, national bank serbia deposit insurance agency relate stability liquidity financial sector expect complete week. the memorandum contain concrete mechanisms, also exact figures. - full support international financial institution serbia continue 2009: • european investment bank: loan smes; • european bank reconstruction development: capital increase banks, loan smes large enterprises; • german reconstruction bank (kfw): finance energy efficiency project smes commercial banks; • loan government republic italy. all above, course, add-on domestic bank loan foreign loans. - measure take far nb work detriment stability bank sector, good still, reserve requirement lowered, mean ready get grip additional challenge ahead! however, thing keep awake night: - first, medium – unprofessional, sensational incomplete report crisis play significant role withdrawal household deposits. thus, percentage terms, money withdraw bank serbia country three time low capital adequacy ratio saw government rescue package worth dozen billion euros! it medium compete dissemination bad economic news, try convince public everything “is two decade ago” even though everybody know not! - second area concern action take outside serbia: measure take government within eu, brussels itself, half-measures. they target enough take quite kick in. hence, difficult u serbia take measure would complement take abroad! although everyone seem fall make promises, substantive detail scarce money even scarcer: save england! let illustrate asking: will interbank market serbia revive liven briefly bank frankfurt, vienna athens continue mistrust one another? somehow, i doubt it. - the third reason concern financial system neighbour countries: a stable bank system serbia sufficient anything go wrong region, bind produce consequence serbia well. to foreign institutional investor look emerge market opportunity one thing, although we, course, know not. - and finally, much long last much go? i truly hope pessimist prove wrong sum invest central bank government major world country manage prevent worst-case scenario. let u clear – magic bullets, absolutely good bad solutions. we should, however, keep mind objective national bank 2 bi review 157/2008 serbia – primary price stability secondary, financial stability. for reason, national bank serbia’s monetary policy committee will, next monday latest, consider enactment follow measures: - to increase share foreign currency require reserve keep dinar 20 40 percent view provide bank extra foreign currency liquidity withdraw excess dinar circulation; - to encourage bank keep release excess foreign currency liquidity domestic bank sector, rather use repay foreign debt reduce foreign deposits; - to resume organize fix session early today since current level margin trade volume satisfactory; - to low net open position bank 20 10 percent, order reduce exposure exchange rate risk. in parallel, draft decision adopt mid-december relax 2009 requirement nb regulation (e.g. 30%, 50% 150% limits). everybody say serbia perform best back corner. well, position quite seem realize now. understand position necessary, sufficient. in difficult time process transition, one step rest one’s oars. everybody will help us, one job us. thank attention. bi review 157/2008 3 thomas jordan: swiss national bank monetary policy light financial market disruption introductory remark mr thomas jordan, member govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 11 december 2008. * * * situation financial market look financial markets, currently find historically unprecedented situation. the financial crisis escalate dramatically since september. in course past three months, take hold almost every market segment around globe. at time last news conference june, already experience three wave money market turbulence; now, fourth wave eclipse others (cf. chart 1).1the situation money market calm somewhat since november. this due part measure take central bank governments, particular generous amount liquidity inject system, recapitalisation banks, provision state guarantee bank liability transfer risk positions. after unsecured money market freeze autumn, central bank increasingly find act lender first resort, words, become primary supplier liquidity financial system. to end, new monetary policy instrument facility introduced, liquidity supply expand significantly. despite calm money markets, situation stock credit market continue worsen result rapid deterioration economic conditions. i would like illustrate unique nature current situation comparison dow jones industrial average five stock market crisis (cf. chart 2).2 price decline time round significantly steep 2000 1973 comparable 1987, stock market recover quickly. measure extent dow jones losses, current crisis compare 1929. although financial loss suffer time probably already far exceed 1929. the reason considerably high market capitalisation stock markets, measure gross domestic product (gdp). what more, loss suffer today merely limit stock markets, also affect practically every type asset, significantly nowadays back then. price plummet across board, corporate bond structure products, raw material emerge market currency real estate investments. while u property price drop 2% 1929 4% 1930, currently fall rate 17%.3 never many asset wipe worldwide space month year. 1 chart 1 show “fever curve” money market, i.e. difference three-month libor three-month (t)ois rate (tom-next/overnight index swap). this difference reflect credit liquidity risk premium unsecured money market trades. it barometer health money market and, broad sense, also financial market general. 2 the five crisis comparison stock market crash 1929, oil crisis 1973, black monday 1987, burst it bubble 2000, current crisis. in case, look price performance around index’s high record level prior crisis, necessarily coincide onset turmoil. the high level reach 3 september 1929 (black tuesday 29 october 1929), 11 january 1973 (oil crisis), 25 august 1987 (black monday 19 october 1987), 14 january 2000 (it bubble), 9 october 2007. 3 for annual data case-shiller composite 20 index, cf. robert j. shiller, irrational exuberance (2006, 2nd edition). bi review 157/2008 1 these financial loss alone continue major impact real economy time come, owe fact full effect generally felt immediately. despite historic disruption financial markets, 1930s. the main difference back decisive way monetary fiscal policy react far-reaching government intervention aim bolster financial system. a result, financial market able continue functioning, albeit much less extent. yet extraordinary circumstance pose huge challenge market participants, least central banks. both swiss national bank’s (snb) monetary policy strategy instrument thoroughly put test. over past months, several observer remark snb’s monetary policy occasionally slip control. we share view. while cannot rule face new challenges, strategy instrument far prove flexible well suit crisis. implementation monetary policy the snb implement monetary policy define target range three-month libor; interest rate unsecured transaction. we cannot influence three-month libor directly, rather indirectly secure money market trades, repo transaction swaps. before onset crisis, little difference interest rate secure unsecured transactions. rise risk premia since widen gap two rates, however. the high volatile risk premia make steer three-month libor increasingly challenging. tension result demand swiss franc abroad recently make steer libor even difficult. in past years, large number swiss franc loan grant europe refinance swiss bank system. then, last october, many swiss bank suddenly long prepare continue refinance extent, put considerable strain international swiss franc money market. to solve problem, decide offer central bank foreign exchange swap facility. since 20 october, snb provide european central bank (ecb) swiss franc exchange euro swap facility. the ecb allocate swiss franc counterparties euro area swap transactions. a similar agreement operation national bank poland since 17 november. in october, turbulence money market cause three-month libor overshoot upper limit snb’s target range day (cf. chart 3). we not, however, consider strategy failure. the overshoot precede interest rate reduction come surprise markets. the three-month libor cannot expect return immediately middle new target range. even period calm, libor react instantly snb interest rate reduction associate low repo rates. consider historic dimension money market crisis, three-month libor manage return remarkably quickly target range – one day two interest rate reduction 6 20 november libor already move new range cases. the turmoil money market prompt snb conduct money market operation extent never witnessed. there day five auction held. the volume operation vary considerably. on record days, carry operation worth chf 100 billion. the reason sizeable operation find interest rate management – first inject large amount liquidity market late absorb again. until week ago, liquidity actually remain system considerably high crisis. it snb adopt policy low money market rate sight deposit balance increase markedly. the low interest rate level mean opportunity cost bank hold 2 bi review 157/2008 liquidity lower, thus prompt hold money sight deposits. the extent money market operation also major impact size snb’s balance sheet. before crisis, approximately chf 20 billion balance sheet go towards monetary policy; today, look around chf 80 billion. in recent weeks, snb pursue policy bring repo rate close zero. this mean, however, monetary policy cease transmit expansionary impulses. in addition short-term repo rate, use whole range method pursue expansionary monetary policy. we can, instance, extend maturity money market transaction intervene market money market. update monetary policy instrument the snb’s monetary policy instrument fare quite well since onset crisis. however, review highlight two area need adjustment. first, liquidity-absorbing instrument find necessary, second, condition liquidity-shortage finance facility long deem appropriate. the liquidity-shortage finance facility serf bridge unexpected, short-term liquidity bottlenecks. it access bank correspond limit limit fully cover security times. let’s start liquidity-absorbing instrument: the crisis make clear central bank must able offer large quantity liquidity short notice via number channel different maturities. repo transaction foreign exchange swap meet requirement well. however, snb lack separate liquidity-absorbing instrument handle large volumes. we therefore introduce debt certificate – snb bill – range instrument october. snb bill allow u flexible steer liquidity. consequently, position offer long-term transactions, help calm money market facilitate steer three-month libor. the financial market crisis also show u liquidity-shortage finance facility contribute calm situation money market actually use needed. however, even crisis, rarely call upon. the reason direct cost draw relatively high, indirect cost ensue stigma associate use facility. the snb thus decide low direct indirect cost use facility. to start with, reduce special-rate interest premium 200 basis point 50 basis points. this become effective 1 january 2009. the snb also make change report methods. in order protect borrower’s reputation, claim liquidity-shortage finance facility will, future, long report separately. these two measure encourage bank utilise facility’s limit frequently therefore increase liquidity provisioning. we also find that, period turbulence, data report weekly publication important monetary policy data misinterpreted, destabilise effect. to remedy this, decide discontinue real-time announcement individual transaction facilities. the data relevant assessment situation money market sight deposit interest rates. we therefore continue publish weekly basis. from on, data individual balance sheet item monetary policy operation publish snb’s monthly statistical bulletin. thus, snb essentially continue report monetary policy operation transparent manner, difference certain data publish le frequently. our guideline monetary policy instrument revise accordingly. these enter effect 1 january 2009. bi review 157/2008 3 transaction ubs on 16 october, snb announce conclude agreement ubs long-term finance orderly liquidation trouble asset amount usd 60 billion. to facilitate transaction, special purpose vehicle set end november call snb stabfund limit partnership collective investments, domicile berne. the company structure two-party limit partnership. it comprise general partner,

northern trust act custodian securities. we also commission specialise agency carry independent valuation portfolio. an initial tranche asset due transfer stabfund end year. a regard finance stabfund, snb contribute 90% fund form loan; ubs, 10% form equity capital. the snb currently secure initial finance operation via swap agreement federal reserve, also foreign exchange market. it also initiate

stabfund’s existence become apparent end 2008 end march 2009, asset transfer complete another comprehensive valuation carry out. it important note stabfund primarily pursue buy-and-hold-to-maturity strategy portfolio present. short-term price movement bear strategy’s success. a recovery affect market long term far decisive factor here. furthermore, snb put place two safety net cushion loss loan stabfund. first, 10% equity capital ubs, second, payment 100 million ubs share event stabfund need liquidate loss. the volatile price movement severe illiquidity market go show important unburden ubs

stimulant evolution market mechanisms, i expect aftermath present turmoil see innovation incremental refinement quality assurance credit market counterparty credit risk management. i would like highlight two theme i believe influence process. first, quality assurance effective, product trade financial market become simple transparent. product complexity lack transparency root many problem emerged, especially market securitizations structure credit products. i elaborate theme remark i make federal reserve conference last week future mortgage market.4 there i argue recovery market mortgage-backed security (mbss) require great transparency le complexity, importantly, comprehensive standardize loan-level data allow independent credit analysis. for example, structure cash flow mortgage payment pool various tranche mb much le complex create recent years, securitization contract need make homogeneous allow great comparability risk profile across deal perhaps promote robust liquidity. i believe new infrastructure mb build upon foundation might reasonably expect low cost information production process marketplace. the reduction cost facilitate broad independent credit analyses, great due diligence potential purchasers, and, hence, great ability provide double check credit rat agencies' evaluation riskiness securities. in words, market participant would likely acquire expertise evaluate security issue homogeneous le complex. a second key factor effective quality assurance relate institutional contractual framework ensure future performance financial transactions, namely counterparty credit risk management. counterparty credit risk management focus effectiveness different market situation implication financial stability. there broad class market practice provide useful protection individual firm experience trouble practice may provide useful protection – could potentially harmful – trouble marketwide. a representative example use rat trigger counterparty credit risk management. some debt contract otc derivative contract link collateral requirement counterparty's credit rating. if counterparty downgrade past threshold, may become subject immediate margin call. counterparty credit risk appear remain contain long rat trigger breach long counterparty could reach insolvency – is, trigger set relatively high rating. in cases, type 4 randall s. kroszner, 2008, "improving infrastructure non-agency mortgage-backed securities", speech deliver federal reserve system conference house mortgage markets, washington, dc, december 4. bi review 156/2008 3 clause quite valuable mitigate counterparty credit risk give counterparty strong incentive try maintain financial health and, hence, rating. this type protection counterparty risk effective change risk specific counterparty correlate increase risk counterparties markets. in case, post additional collateral long firm reach insolvency provide valuable protection. such provision may provide protection, however, rat change come late, firm brink insolvency, requirement post margin push insolvency. more importantly, provision may also fail provide protection trouble counterparty correlate trouble institution markets, is, due marketwide distress. in time widespread distress, many counterparties may sell asset simultaneously post margin. this occurrence potentially lead situation market asset sell quickly fundamental values. when many counterparties force liquidate similar assets, price asset push down. if asset use collateral positions, decline value lead additional margin calls. this set circumstances, turn, force liquidation price declines. a widespread use rat trigger accelerate downward slide, loss asset value trigger additional downgrade requirement post collateral liquidate positions. recent event demonstrate potentially destabilize dynamic work. rat trigger certainly one example market practice exacerbate impact systemic event make financial market le stable. credit enhancement guarantee also create fragility seem offer protection. a highly-rated guarantor, example, could offer effective protection default small number instruments. in event market-wide increase credit risk, however, increase probability guarantor would require pay many position simultaneously. a market come realize credit enhancement may effective, pressure may come upon institution would leave exposed. thus, widespread reliance credit enhancement could induce form "wrong way risk" seller protection become likely default precisely circumstance protection valued. what might seem like "herd" behavior market may least part response fragile interconnection affect stability markets. such apparent herd behavior, reflect collective loss confidence, may generate market infrastructure induce co-movements across market institution time stress. in circumstances, contractual provision might seem surface prudent counterparty risk management could increase financial market stress. improve banks' risk management participation financial market marketwide credit event stresses, market infrastructure could exacerbate them, receive sufficient attention risk management effort period lead current turmoil. for example, risk manager fully contemplate possibility many participant would need unwind position time, action might present substantial loss several key counterparties, collateral post protection position would fall value time. there sufficient understand correlation decline collateral value likelihood collateral would need call upon. similar issue arise third-party guarantee hedge strategy le effectiveness anticipated. even risk manager understand issues, individually likely face difficulty demand collateral guarantee good time risk manager want first. 4 bi review 156/2008 a key factor assure market quality, i note above, assess behavior counterparties stressful times. not bank need ass counterparty creditworthiness behavior individual basis, also need ass counterparties collective basis. they need understand action protect position put pressure key counterparties, especially market participant likely take similar action protect themselves. so beyond ensure individual position sound well protected, bank need ass whether systematic component market could adversely affect multiple counterparties time, thereby affect risk exposures. a seen, counterparty need technically insolvent shun market participants. the anticipation downgrades, triggers, forth could quickly cause firm lose fund fail. in short, bank regulator need understand type market condition exist likely reliance collateral, guarantees, contract clauses. it important ass likelihood bank's safeguard action could worsen market condition actually increase losses. might bank realize collateral substantially reduce prices? would multiple counterparties suffer distress time? would guarantor perform time distress? in words, would collateral, guarantee, insurance, hedge, forth work precisely time institution would need most, is, market stress event? these important question regulator supervisor ask basel committee financial stability forum, i represent federal reserve system bodies. naturally, type question underscore importance stress test scenario analysis focus market-wide events. such stress test would include potential key counterparties fail suffer difficulty time, market liquidity erode remain low time, market participant view bank impair counterparty. and stress tests, properly designed, provide information typical statistical model may leave trouble capturing, abnormally large jump market moves, evaporation liquidity, prolong period market distress, structural change markets. stress test useful aim include potential secondary "knock-on" effects, also often difficult model standard techniques. in ways, stress test serve complementary tool risk measures. even ex ante estimate probability joint distress among counterparties appear small, still useful know severity outcome, since may clearly reveal unacceptable loss. importantly, bank also conduct stress test across several markets, since counterparties key player across many financial market inability repay could cascade across markets. of course, base consideration factor note result stress tests, bank may reassess participation certain market exercise great caution account potential "tail" risk good protect time market-wide stress. one first thing may increase internal assessment capital need activities, give add risk stress test reveal. they may wish restructure contract alter terms. institution also might ask high initial margin, give subsequent call may provide much risk mitigation distress. they may wish ask collateral, ensure collateral le link counterparty's condition broad market distress. or might look way enhance assessment counterparties, and, perhaps importantly, potential counterparties encounter difficulty marketwide stresses. additionally, may wish conduct trade hedge organize exchange clearinghouses, benefit safeguard i note early remarks. bi review 156/2008 5 some banks, act collective basis, may decide take action improve quality assurance performance market future time stress. trade association bank industry may consider additional safeguard reduce impact systematic risk among counterparties; example, bank may collectively act remove uncertainty associate back-office inefficiency relate risk credit default swap market. another example, i note remark last week, attempt enhance mortgage market great standardization data simpler, homogeneous provision securitizations, le reliance third-party monitoring.5 a general step, bank hold high liquidity capital buffers, since enhancement i note still guarantee future market distress could cause correlate cascade loss among market participants. finally, bank need exercise strong discipline good time return, forget current market difficulty return profligate ways. indeed, time bank establish good risk management policy address issue i discussed, strong risk discipline codified. conclude think of course, bank industry, also u public sector key lesson learn. bank supervisor alike need undertake additional work facilitate build robust method quality assurance financial market help restore maintain confidence. ensure bank exercise good risk management, course, important job bank supervisors, include oversee ability properly capture risk market operate, well ability conduct appropriate stress test explore potential consequence different type market distress. do require supervisor develop strong understand value, limits, potential harm associate banks' attempt protect exposures. at federal reserve, already begin enhance supervisory work area communicate expectation banks. at international level, work colleague country within international bodies, basel committee bank supervision – meet late week – financial stability forum, investigate whether practice could adopt around world mitigate challenge i outline above. this work major focus next month course 2009. 5 randall s. kroszner, 2008, "improving
