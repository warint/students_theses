deputy governor delegate representative alliance financial inclusion (afi), asian development bank, world bank, international finance corporation, un capital development fund pacific financial inclusion programme lady gentlemen. ni sa bula good morning all. introductory remark it give great pleasure morning. let say honour reserve bank fiji host alliance financial inclusion 12th pacific island work group meet i take opportunity welcome one you. for visitor abroad, i hope pleasant flight fiji enjoy stay u come days. at outset i wish commend one continue dedication, hard work passion towards drive financial inclusion respective countries. this evident presence morning. it always proud moment pacific region single use focal point come discussion pertain financial inclusion. a regional group make lot inroad since start 2009 must continue bond order stay ahead. a group, way work together characterise pacific way. i urge continue collaborative effort benefit peer learn experience. financial inclusion – catalyst financial economic stability there grow body evidence support maxim build inclusive financial sectors. financial inclusion support development, contribute efficient financial system enable member community, especially marginalise poor, improve livelihood thus empower effectively contribute economy. all support un millennium development goal halving, 2015, portion world population live extreme poverty. it clear also see change landscape central bank recent years. whilst many central bank traditionally focus core policy objective price stability sufficient foreign reserves, take additional lead role advocate financial inclusion initiative respective countries; build towards inclusive financial system recognise make available different type financial service product affordable, accessible appropriate citizens. 2 bi central bankers’ speech a group learn other’s experiences, also tailor program initiative suit unique country situations. the environment operate constantly evolve need embrace innovation technology facilitate provision inclusive financial system. what’s next piwg? fellow colleagues, let u take moment reflect vision mission work group. our vision “financial service widely access pacific islanders”. to get mission statement urge u “to create condition lead financial empowerment pacific islander short medium term”. a region establish achieve number outcome must take pride achievement date. in last five years, u take bold step establish specific department unit within central bank drive financial inclusion relate matters. we set policy guideline enable stakeholder country contribute part financial inclusion cause. some u set national financial inclusion taskforce guide spearhead development work initiative area. with mind please note, last year’s afi global policy forum malaysia, bank papua new guinea central bank samoa formally pledge commitment maya declaration. they thus join reserve bank vanuatu, central bank solomon island reserve bank fiji, make commitment earlier. i hopeful friend banco central de timor-leste national reserve bank tonga also make commitment due course. colleagues, last year witness introduction innovative product service country mobile financial service micro insurance, well open lot bank accounts. a group undertake comprehensive data project piwg core plus indicators. we work provide enable regulatory framework support innovation areas. the introduction financial literacy education programme school child adult alike also forefront work. however, whilst may want give pat back, let u get complacent. rather, let u inspire push boundary produce tangible result country across region. financial inclusion think outside box, require beyond norm. what require innovative thinking. i therefore invite u put collective think cap regard. allow suggest issue possible deliberation next two days. financial inclusion usage the financial inclusion monitor framework, accord international standards, look access, usage quality indicators. financial access point build blocks. what important get people understand use financial product services. for example, even though remit fund mobile phone perhaps cheap channels, still see alternative expensive medium used. we ask question, so? a work group, need see translation active usage positive developments. it promise note begin gain grind financial access point visible countries, must simultaneously accompany active usage. this provide economy scale provider and, therefore, sustainability particular product service. bi central bankers’ speech 3 diagnostic exercise – survey during next two days, i think would timely deliberate low uptake certain financial product services, instance mobile financial services. i know answer question determine ask people ground, intend customers. to end need work towards national demand survey respective countries. piwg may also explore idea progress poverty index (ppi). the index measures, ass track poverty level time tool statistically sound, yet simple implementation. remittance msmes remittance another important area us. what do improve remittance flows, play pivotal role advance financial inclusion countries? similarly encouragement micro, small medium enterprise another crucial area financial inclusion sphere. what need develop grow sector economy? development fiji lady gentlemen, please allow give quick update development fiji last meet september, 2013. i understand session country update late today, i keep brief. in last two quarters, able accomplish number initiatives. the national financial literacy strategy fiji endorse government implementation; host inaugural national microfinance award pacific microfinance week,

achieve without collaborative effort stakeholder fiji sincerely grateful them. while success, way mean work finished. in fact, first step long journey commit undertake. this great platform chart next phase development financial inclusion fiji. i would therefore like announce bank, together national financial inclusion taskforce, take stock financial inclusion initiative undertake country date use information come nine month develop new financial inclusion strategy fiji run 2015 2020. conclude remark in closing, i thank make denarau week. i urge keep focus goal set achieve. this meet provide great platform take stock, share experiences, discus issue concern region challenge encountered, identify opportunity pursue take goal another level. in day also welcome delegate different part world afi strategy peer learn work group meeting. let small pacific country good financial inclusion example firm collaboration achievement. last year 4 bi central bankers’ speech reserve bank fiji award inaugural maya declaration award, i could see immense pride among pacific member country present achievement bring u close together region. thank continuous support hope see piwg stay ahead game. i certain end two day fruitful discussion, reiterate commitment make region overcome barrier build bridge deliver quality financial service citizens. lastly, i encourage take advantage fijian hospitality. please enjoy array goods, service attraction offer and, enjoy experience us. thank kind attention vinaka vakalevu bi central bankers’ speech 1 ignazio visco: the exit sovereign debt crisis: national policies, european reform monetary policy lectio magistralis mr ignazio visco, governor bank italy, almo collegio borromeo, pavia, 25 march 2014. * * * the road european integration long arduous one; linear: often advance step tiny step, time vigorous leaps. the introduction euro one leap; definite advance certainly complete journey. the euro currency without state; lack suffer from. the divergences, sometimes diffidence, still mark relation member state weaken economic monetary union eye international community citizens. this incompleteness, together weakness member countries, fuel sovereign debt crisis euro area. if weakness engender doubt sustainability national public debts, incompleteness raise fear integrity union, allow risk redenomination area’s financial asset liability national currency gather strength, reintroduce exchange rate risk within monetary union, thus weaken position country difficulty. without political union, european economic governance found upon budget rule ban rescue member countries; rely pressure single market economic convergence. however, many case budget rule respect macroeconomic condition remain divergent, also structurally. the convergence interest rate towards low level “virtuous” country allow country put necessary adjustments. for year financial market consider possibility increase sovereign risks. before crisis, spread yield euro-area government security fall virtually nil. the tension euro area come head environment already fragile result global financial crisis consequent recession 2008–09. initially involve greece view state public finances, ireland owe real-estate bubble consequent bank crisis, portugal result macroeconomic imbalances. in summer 2011 announcement involvement private-sector investor restructure greek public debt clearly reveal implication ban financial rescue member state impose maastricht treaty lack protocol handle sovereign crises. the tension become systemic; country suffer spain, owe bank system’s excessive exposure property market, italy, vulnerable high public debt loss competitiveness growth capability connection country’s pronounce slowness adjust major political, commercial, demographic technological change last twenty years. the yield spread euro-area’s sovereign security increase rapidly. for countries, include italy, rise far level justify economic fundamentals. the spread ten-year btps german bunds, still le 200 basis point first half 2011, reach 550 basis point end year. after narrow early month 2012, return 500 basis point july. we estimate − explain technical analysis public intervention − le half amount due weakness economy; rest reflect fear single currency break up. 2 bi central bankers’ speech national policy european reform to achieve give number objectives, economic policy must least equal number independent instrument disposal. and fact european strategy response crisis identify two instrument pursue two objectives: national policy remove fragility present individual economy strengthen union dispel fear integrity single currency. in case, however, since fear euro reversibility member countries’ debt sustainability fuel other, instrument independent. the reform european governance thus necessarily hinge tighten budget rule introduction new procedure control macroeconomic imbalances. the considerable time need implement strategy conflicted, however, persistent market uncertainty lack instrument, common budget, would make possible combat recession follow financial crisis, offset adverse short-term effect necessary national budgetary adjustment expansionary unitary policies. the succession conventional unconventional monetary policy measure help make market condition easy and, far possible, counter fall demand. at time, worst-hit country aggravation social economic consequence crisis make hard implement necessary structural reforms, which, help restore economy’s growth potential, carry undeniable short-term costs. the immediate visibility result budgetary policy obscured. in italy, despite reduction budget deficit 5.5 3 per cent gdp, 2009 2013 ratio public debt gdp rise 16 percentage point 132.6 per cent, reflect brusque slowdown economy. one contributory factor, count nearly 4 percentage points, italy’s direct indirect support financial adjustment euro-area countries. the fragmentation financial market produce inception vicious circle situation sovereign borrower correspond bank system interfere transmission monetary policy, make condition finance economy severely dishomogeneous among euro-area country hold back expansionary impulse economy need them. the gap cost new loan firm italy germany widen progressively virtually nil summer 2011 one percentage point end year. with three-year refinance operation decide december 2011 govern council ecb counter consequence fragmentation prevent much bad contraction credit actually occurred. in emergency condition good deal uncertainty, national european policy nonetheless move right direction overall. the state public finance country expose crisis improved, albeit high social cost countries. reform support competiveness enact implemented. above all, work begin rebuild trust among member states. at outset crisis europe instrument financial assistance sovereign issuers: first measure favour greece, less extent ireland, take form bilateral loans. with european financial stability facility (efsf), temporary arrangement set may 2010, european stability mechanism (esm), permanent institution capital endowment inaugurate october 2012, europe secure lend capacity almost €700 billion. between 2010 2013 €320 billion loan disburse country difficulty. include amount pay towards capital stock esm, italy’s contribution effort excess €55 billion. the need address asymmetry single monetary policy multiplicity national fiscal structural police recognized. the plan publish european commission november 2012 report president european bi central bankers’ speech 3 council june year (updated follow december), plot stage gradual strengthen economic monetary union. the first, bank union, currently implemented. other, difficult stage lie ahead: independent financial capacity euro area whole, common budget and, future, political union. in advance resolutely along road, one important challenge remains: namely, mark attenuation diffidence find today government national communities. to end, europe cannot confine identify weakness some, objective though may be, require adjustments, albeit necessary, reference short-term results. we must look responsibly longer-term prospects, also take account sustainability sacrifice distribution benefits. preparation single supervisory mechanism (ssm), compose ecb national authorities, proceed apace. this constitute complex feat institutional engineering, least demand precede introduction single currency. build accumulate technical expertise national authorities, ssm must represent supranational vision base best practice supervisory methods, analytical model bank risk assessment. the transition single supervisor enable easy comparison intermediary system various countries, help combat tendency segmentation financial market along national lines. the comprehensive assessment euro area’s lead banks, currently carry preparation launch ssm, go direction. the recent agreement european council, commission parliament single resolution mechanism (srm), due approve latter plenary session april, mark step towards bank union, harmonization responsibility crisis resolution, follow supervision. with respect agreement previously reach european council, simplify decision-making process shorten time take mechanism become fully operational. the srm operate single bank resolution fund finance contribution participate bank manage board comprise permanent members, representative national resolution authorities, ecb european commission, latter observer status. the board, basis ecb’s assessment concern existence trouble banks, determine whether bankruptcy avoid whether public interest justify activation resolution instruments. if so, draw crisis resolution plan subject approval commission and, tacit consent procedure, council. disbursement €5 billion decide executive session board, comprise permanent member resolution authority country intermediary operates; decision adopt plenary session, national resolution authority participate. the fund reach full endowment €55 billion eight years. the banks’ contribution pay national compartments, progressively mutualized start share 40 per cent first year 20 per cent second. the fund may also borrow market basis decision make plenary session. all operational aspect must rapidly finalize permit accurate assessment financial capacity prevent uncertainty amplify national component risk premiums, thereby perpetuate financial market fragmentation vicious circle condition sovereign borrower banks. outright monetary transaction a i observed, national policy european reform introduce change take long time implement; distortion remain financial market meantime jeopardize whole process. during crisis, ecb’s govern council 4 bi central bankers’ speech make decisive use instrument disposal, cut official interest rate repeatedly introduce new refinance operation long maturity full allotment. in august 2012 announce outright monetary transaction (omt), new way intervene secondary market government securities. the omts enable ecb counter effect incorrect assessment sovereign borrower’s risk – particular component link fear monetary union break – purchase security secondary market limit time quantity, forgo status privilege creditor. a result interdependence fear euro reversibility fear sustainability individual countries’ public debt, omts conditional precise public finance commitment structural reform within framework esm financial assistance programmes. the announcement bring success; even without actual intervention markets, instrumental drastic reduction part sovereign risk premium connect fear euro’s survival: spread fall value close consistent fundamentals, market le fragmented. the yield spread ten-year italian german government bond fall back 200 basis points. bank italy estimate show improvement mainly due drastic reduction risk euro area break up. there sign renew interest italian markets, include government bond markets, reflect decline bank italy’s debtor position target2, fell €190 billion end february, almost €100 billion le peak register august 2012. these result would impossible without start resolve national imbalance reform european governance. the single monetary policy cannot guarantee stability unless economic fundamental institutional architecture area consistent it. the risk still present tension ready flare again. in italy national component yield spread reflect high public debt poor growth prospects; need reduce further: recession 2008, ten-year maturity national component le 50 basis points. the reform european governance result surrender sovereignty, albeit limited, part member states, area fiscal structural policy. unconventional monetary policy measure take response crisis. there legitimate need examine conformity solution adopt national constitutional law. besides provoke heat public debate, omts scrutinize german constitutional court, apply european court justice judgment legitimacy. the german court argue omts pursue monetary policy goal strict sense, since use safeguard euro take responsibility properly lie national governments; omts, held, overstep ecb’s mandate, violate ban monetary finance budget deficits; could also lead redistribution resource among country area, thus achieve effect transfer system envisage european treaties. the aim omts preserve monetary policy transmission euro area, jeopardize distortion financial market cause sovereign debt crisis. the goal neutralize spread government bond specific euro-area member state order reduce financial difficulty interfere illegitimately price formation market, instead reduce component spread link factor independent financial sustainability individual countries. intervention aim sustain purchase risky asset correct misperception risk. the yield spread sovereign bond observe moment great tension due part market scepticism ability individual member state ensure sustainability public finance avoid worsen credit risk. in large part, rather, explain investors’ fear euro reversibility. bi central bankers’ speech 5 lastly, omts allow ecb buy government bond whenever monetary policy transmission mechanism interrupted, interruption reflect member state’s sustainability conditions. omts never suppose use purchase security country unsustainable public finances. a regard argument concern risk resource redistribute result omts, risk would incur forgo would far worse. the way crisis exit crisis euro area cannot achieve isolate action individual economic policy authorities. in particular, monetary policy alone cannot guarantee financial stability euro area problem underlie sovereign debt crisis resolve national european level. the fragility public finance country result protract fiscal imprudence culpable underestimation consequence broad persistent loss competitiveness. budgetary policy must ensure debt sustainability full access market. the rule agree european level means, end. the real budget constraint country give need guarantee sustainability public debt maintain full access financial market. a i point one occasion, treasury’s annual resort market order €400 billion. in context still fraught tension, take little undermine investor confidence. this happen summer 2011 spring 2012, share italian government bond foreign hand plummeted. the agreement conclude last two year put early budget commitment practice. the rule public debt, apply italy first time 2016, call average annual reduction one twentieth excess 60 per cent gdp. in order comply, necessary low nominal size debt. in “normal” condition close 3 per cent nominal economic growth, need structural budget balance. contrary commentator say, correction €40–50 billion year required, necessary maintain restrictive budget policy permanently. although debt rule allow room flexibility, must continue aim real growth economy, hence recovery investment – supply factor fundamental demand component. a price developments, inflation still level consistent ecb’s definition price stability, i.e. annual price rise close 2 per cent medium term. actually, consumer price inflation euro area italy fall consistently expect recent month keep 1 per cent since october last year. accord recent estimate ecb, euro-area inflation average 1.0 per cent year, 1.3 per cent 2015 1.5 per cent 2016. our forecast paint similar picture consumer price italy. we situation generalize price reduction, deflation. but even long period excessively small price change undesirable consequences: hind correction macroeconomic imbalance adjustment relative prices; prompt consumer postpone purchases, especially durable goods; affect cost capital thus deter capital formation; make debt service onerous. if situation last long, cause inflation expectation become dangerously detach monetary policy. the risk long-term inflation expectation long anchor price stability must resolutely countered. this risk limit time being, sign underestimated. the downward trend inflation expectation sharpen recent months, spread even distant time horizons: yield inflation swap 6 bi central bankers’ speech indicate expect annual inflation rate 1.2 per cent three year ahead 1.6 per cent five year ahead. professional forecaster survey ecb estimate nearly 20 per cent probability two years’ time inflation 0.9 per cent lower. the formation expectation non-linear process; major change occur suddenly, almost without warning, make difficult regain control. against background, ecb’s govern council reaffirm intention maintain accommodative monetary policy stance long necessary firmly reiterate policy rate remain present low level extend period. in line mandate, council use tool need maintain price stability. to accompany reform effort individual countries, ecb’s monetary policy commitment area responsibility must match commitment institutional actors. the debate euro area’s “fiscal capacity” launch report president european council commission’s plan abruptly break commission present plan major economic reform financial support structural reform march last year. the delay implement structural reform many country responsible build-up macroeconomic imbalance fuel current crisis. the commission’s proposals, expressly open discussion order discover scope improvement, go right direction identify mechanism support convergence need strengthen economic monetary union. italy must succeed take full advantage opportunity offer union. in past, example, able benefit fully european structural funds. introduce structural reform help u regain competitiveness essential step towards country’s recovery. the measure need take long since identified. the process european coordination could help flesh details, ultimate responsibility reform still lie us. it important continue resolutely along path full union. the adoption single mechanism bank supervision resolution crucial step. the benefit strengthen european integration far outweigh allege advantage weaken it. choice must make responsibly. we cannot fear risk action disregard inertia. bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: the know unknown central clear speech mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, meet global economy financial system, host university chicago booth school business initiative global markets, coral gables, 29 march 2014. * * * accompany slide find european central bank’s website i would like thank andreas schönenberger contributions. i remain solely responsible opinion contain herein. lady gentlemen, today, i want share think central clearing. [slide 1] at pittsburgh summit 2009, g20 leader commit standardise otc derivative contract clear central counterparties (ccps). the mandatory use central clear regulatory tool mitigate systemic risk fairly new feature financial market regulation. central clear definitely capacity promote financial stability, provide appropriately use potential side effect well understand effectively mitigated. in context, still number question need look at. let call “known unknowns” central clearing. [slide 2] i want touch upon follow issues: • systemic effect mandatory clear • recovery versus resolution central counterparties • optimal design loss allocation tool • evolution global clear structure systemic effect mandatory clear [slide 3] let start systemic effect mandatory central clearing. clear house do job well crisis, contrary financial institutions, successfully face challenge rapidly grow volume transactions. we want make sure hold true new world mandatory clearing. [slide 4] the systemic effect central clear numerous and, although overall balance undoubtedly positive, ambiguous address carefully. on one hand, mandatory clear reduce systemic risk significantly • lead collateralisation trade might remain uncollateralised otherwise, • enhance risk management mean sophisticate margining methods, • allow mutualisation risk, promote resilience financial system, especially event catastrophic scenarios, 2 bi central bankers’ speech • offer multilateral net le collateral need manage risks, • facilitate risk management help overcome information asymmetry participant non-centrally clear market face. on hand, consequence central clear may increase systemic risk: • result grow risk concentration ccps limit number large global dealers, act general clear member gateway financial institution ccps, • consequence mutualisation, risk may spread among participant market widely distribution loss difficult predict, • order avoid mandatory clearing, might see migration risk outside regulate universe artificial creation bespeak (and hence risky) product suitable central clearing. moreover, systemic effect clear depend whether risk redistribute able deal it, difficult determine. finally, overall systemic effect depend incentive risk-taking central clear accompany risk redistribution. [slide 5] to promote central clear avoid regulatory arbitrage, number reform adopt including: (i) mandatory clearing, (ii) margin requirement non-centrally clear trades, (iii) high capital requirement non-centrally clear trades. this highlight crucial complementarity regulation bank regulation financial market infrastructure (fmis), overall objective regulation reduce overall risk, shift around financial system. cooperation committee payment settlement system international organisation security commission (cpss-iosco) one hand, basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) hand, key respect. a macroeconomic impact assessment lead bi focus effect reform find net benefit 0.12% gdp per year. these estimate long-run consequence reform expect apply reform fully implement produce full economic effects. however, central clear also involve risk redistribution potentially creation new risks. the overall impact therefore le certain: significant benefit need balance potential new risk uncertain risk redistribution effects. ultimately, seem success central clear tool promote financial stability critically depend two factors: (i) ability ccps handle risk concentrate thus design corporate governance, risk management recovery framework (ii) ability official sector address effectively unintended side effect “new” risk may result push towards central clearing. recovery versus resolution ccps [slide 6] a second issue i like highlight today concern relationship recovery resolution ccps. a central clear involve risk concentration may see “super systemically relevant” institutions, crucial institution recover severe shock resolve necessary. now several question typically raise context: bi central bankers’ speech 3 • at point time ccp need resolve cannot recover? • give ccps provide critical service require cover loss liquidity shortfall may arise, resolution ccp realistic concept all? be ever need appropriate? • what make ccps different financial institutions? do difference require different rule recovery resolution? [slide 7] the cpss-iosco principle financial market infrastructure (pfmis) require ccps plan allocate loss liquidity shortfall regular “waterfall” – is, sequence prefunded financial resource – cover. alternatively, respective ccp might resolved. the cpss-iosco financial stability board (fsb) provide guidance recovery resolution ccps mid-2014.1 the question is: resolution perform recovery failed? or could circumstance resolution ccp preferable recovery, even recovery still feasible? let first explore feature make financial market infrastructure different financial institutions: • service continuation (“critical services”) important case fmis. they utility heart financial system. their smooth operation essential type financial service. • in cases, few, any, substitute alternative providers. • unlike banks, fmis ex ante loss allocation rule draw purpose recovery. • not fmis expose credit risk (but still systemically important). • the size composition balance sheet (e.g. rarely subordinate debt instruments) different, make bail-in recovery resolution tool difficult. • to extent use ccp mandatory, absolutely essential relevant clear service preserve regardless circumstances. in conclusion, recovery ccps order maintain service continuation much important ccps financial institutions. that’s pfmis require ccps able allocate loss already cover regular risk management. [slide 8] so recovery ccps vital, scope resolution all? i think is, number reasons: first all, attempt recover may simply fail: ex-ante recovery plan may prove inadequate ex post. recovery plan fortunately yet tested, remain see work practice. most importantly, however, recovery end itself, mean preserve financial stability. entry resolution possible recovery plan fail return fmi viability implementation would otherwise compromise financial stability, 1 see financial stability board. “consultation document: application key attribute effective resolution regime non-bank financial institutions”, 12 august 2013, cpss-iosco. “consultative report: recovery financial market infrastructures”, 12 august 2013. see also p. tucker. “central counterparties evolve capital markets: safety, recovery resolution”. banque de france financial stability review, no. 17, april 2013. 4 bi central bankers’ speech example application particular loss allocation tool turn overexpose certain (groups of) participants. moreover, resolution may also become necessary participant want use ccp long prefer wind down. in conclusion, resolution authority responsibility (and good position ccps) systemically need crisis situation, may mean extreme case application resolution procedure preferable activation recovery plan. of course, much depend authority right thing time crisis. this turn assume authority enough information point time “connect dots” complex network ccps global dealers. hence critical importance enforce new report requirement trade repository (trs), this, able aggregate data collect trs across products, institutions, jurisdictions, conduct analytical work base data.2 optimal design loss allocation tool [slide 9] let turn third know unknown, subject much debate: optimal design composition ccp’s recovery tools? [slide 10] in field recovery, enter new territory, authority wisely take cautious approach give guidance fmis design recovery plans. ideally, recovery tool comprehensive, effective controllable; create appropriate incentive risk management minimise negative impacts. however, challenge individual tool equally meet criterion trade-offs, example: • uncapped cash call comprehensive, may create disincentive central clearing. • variation margin haircutting comprehensive effective (as reduce pay-outs rather require additional pay-ins), loss allocation hence systemic effect uncertain. • initial margin haircutting may help achieve comprehensiveness, increase potential contagion risk. the optimal choice recovery tool still evolve remain controversial issue. the regulatory approach cpss-iosco therefore non-prescriptive aim provide guidance help fmis choose appropriate (mix of) recovery tools. this approach, however, might need adapt time. evolution global clear structure [slide 11] let turn fourth know unknown, optimal design global clear structure. 2 see financial stability board. “consultation paper: feasibility study approach aggregate otc derivative data”, 4 february 2014. bi central bankers’ speech 5 [slide 12] such design depend numerous factor questions: • how many ccps need global level? • how many market ccp serve? • what implication competitive clear several ccps serve trade venue? • should ccps link how? should link limit cash-market ccps also apply derivative commodity ccps? • what degree tiering optimal participant get access ccps needed? this question gain importance establishment clear obligation. [slide 13] what see today globalisation process trigger trend towards global clear increasingly large global ccps. moreover, appear many bank prefer indirect access clear service comply clear obligation. client clear seem thus dominate large global intermediaries. this concentration create high degree dependency small group firms. the trend towards globalisation clear benefit risks. on one hand, great scope net allow collateral savings, low cost direct access use ccps, increase transparency regulator ccps. on hand, potential systemic risk ccps may become big fail. also, market power may push clear fee restrict entry. this could create disincentive central clear could undermine efficiency gain reap first place erode price power global dealers. there could also cross-border regulatory friction case multiple (and inconsistent) national regulations, last least cross-border liquidity provision several currency become complex. this lead last maybe challenge “unknown”. give ccps’ role financial market utility reinforce mandatory clear requirements, increase systemic relevance, would world safe place, ccps establish non-for-profit institutions? my tentative answer no. i outline importance good risk management ccps, ability adapt change market environment term counterparties, products, technologies. i convince good do market environment. but certainly require strong supervision, effective cooperative oversight arrangements, set right incentive structure ccps don’t lose sight public interest, start interest indirect members. let conclude. central clear make global financial system safer. however, also potential redistribute risk. it overall systemic effect thus depend incentive risk-taking central clear accompany risk redistribution. hence need official sector provide right incentive framework ex-ante, produce data help understand distribution risk, tightly supervise ccps spirit cooperation across jurisdictions. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 charles l evans: think accommodative monetary policy, inflation financial instability speech mr charles l evans, president federal reserve bank chicago, credit suisse asian investment conference, hong kong, 28 march 2014. * * * introduction thank you, mr. naqvi. it truly pleasure today credit suisse asian investment conference, i thank organizer include impressive program. today, i would like make three point concern u.s. economy accommodative monetary policy. first, u.s. economy continue improve, accommodative monetary policy remain strong support recovery quite time. second, although highly accommodative monetary policy lead increase inflation risk today, inflation unite state low. and true throughout much world. third, low interest rate could lead financial exuberance principle, monetary policy best tool mitigate risk. instead, macroprudential policy appropriate tool address risk financial instability. before turn detail three points, i need note that, always, standard feed disclaimer applies: i give personal perspective, necessarily share colleague federal open market committee (fomc) federal reserve system. recent monetary policy action a know, response unusual economic circumstance generate financial crisis great recession, fomc low traditional policy tool – target federal fund rate – near-zero level december 2008 keep since. with feed fund rate constrain low bound, economic condition require additional policy accommodation, committee also deploy nontraditional policy tool stimulate activity. we embark upon large-scale purchase long-term treasury security agency mortgage-backed securities. we also use new communication tool provide forward guidance long short-term interest rate essentially remain low bind zero. while large-scale asset purchase forward guidance unconventional tools, effect interest rate real economic activity quite conventional. both tool aim stimulate economic activity low long-term interest rates. through arbitrage portfolio rebalancing, low rate one market transmit interest rate face investors, nonfinancial firm consumers. low rate also transmit across asset maturity spectrum. there significant evidence fomc’s policy helpful reduce finance cost rate pay firm consumer and, generally, support aggregate demand face substantial economic headwind past six years. it note economic activity pick momentum second half 2013. overall, real gross domestic product (gdp) grow bite 3-1/2 percent rate second half, average pace growth 2 percent previous three years. moreover, we’ve see solid consumer spending, provide impetus overall growth year. in labor market, job growth solid unemployment rate 6.7 percent. that well 8.1 percent rate 2 bi central bankers’ speech prevail institute late round large-scale asset purchase september 2012. however, aren’t wood yet. the harsh weather past winter – i mean north american polar vortex – make recent data difficult interpret. that said, soft side. balance sheet scar financial crisis still weigh economy. fiscal policy restraint economic growth. and economic activity abroad robust. the good news headwind appear dissipating. but risk remain. and still large resource gaps. for example, unemployment rate still well 5-1/4 percent rate i think long run. at time, inflation 1 percent – well fomc’s longer-run target 2 percent. accordingly, monetary policy highly accommodative, need remain time. give developments, fomc begin adjust mix tool december. the committee, however, maintain overall highly accommodative stance policy. the committee modestly reduce pace monthly asset purchase $85 billion $55 billion three separate $10 billion steps. in addition, unemployment rate approach 6-1/2 percent threshold establish december 2012, committee decide time update forward guidance future path short-term interest rates. our policy statement emphasize decide long short-term rate remain current level, committee use wide range information ass realize expect progress toward dual mandate goal maximum employment price stability. the statement also indicate give committee’s current assessment factors, likely appropriate keep feed fund rate current level considerable period asset purchase program ends. furthermore, even economy lift employment inflation near mandate-consistent levels, economic condition likely warrant keep short-term rate typical long-run level time. the various asset purchase feed undertake since 2008 expand balance sheet fourfold, $4 trillion dollars. moreover, accord fomc’s projection late market expectations, time policy rate increases, near zero seven years. these startle fact certainly get attention! a prudent policymakers, would remiss fail carefully ass potential risk might arise unusual extraordinary policies. a fomc’s communication indicate, committee fully review potential cost policy reassess regularly. i think benefit policy choice continue far outweigh potential risks. however, must repeatedly think long hard two risk mention often – namely, expand balance sheet prolong period low rate raise 1) risk high inflation; 2) risk financial instability. what go wrong? do appropriate infrastructure tool adequately ass manage risks? to address questions, must evaluate risk within context goal monetary policy current state economy financial markets. inflation risk let start risk high inflation. a far back mid-2009, feed critic warn near-zero policy rate trillion dollar asset purchase risk generate high inflation. on several occasions, underscore risk, i present gift zimbabwe 100 trillion dollar note. a someone subject 20 u.s. dollar limit gifts, i assure within guideline accept one notes. the monetary policy mandate federal reserve clear: we must foster monetary financial condition support maximum employment price stability. since january bi central bankers’ speech 3 2012, feed set explicit goal inflation 2 percent, measure price index total personal consumption expenditures, pce. so, respect 2 percent target zimbabwean risks? despite many early prediction unacceptably high inflation, total pce inflation hover around 1 percent since early 2013. other inflation measures, notably, well-known consumer price index (cpi), also well relate benchmarks.1 forecaster often look core inflation, exclude volatile food energy prices, good predictor overall price head total inflation. our progress toward inflation target noticeably fast metric either. core pce inflation 1.1 percent past year rate since last spring. most private sector forecast survey measure inflation expectation remain well anchor ring alarm high inflation. expectation embed asset price tell similar story. sophisticate model extract inflation expectation yield curve show investors’ inflation expectation three-year horizon 2 percent 2 percent several years. all told, risk high inflation seem low. in fact, i concern inflation pick quickly enough. a i noted, stick 1 percent inflation since early 2013, little indication pickup recent data. low inflation economically costly high inflation. when set inflation target 2 percent, need hit target without much delay. simply put, need average 2 percent inflation medium term. accordingly, current 1 percent inflation situation call extend policy accommodation. if feed embark prematurely restrictive monetary policy conditions, adverse action would work reduce inflation unacceptably low levels. that’s go wrong direction.2 financial stability monetary policy it easy natural feed policymaker talk inflation. price stability one explicit goal monetary policy mandate u.s. congress. financial stability risk complicated. how financial stability dovetail fed’s dual mandate? there clearly interdependent relationship them. a strong economy low inflation provide key stabilize force beneficial credit intermediation robust financial market functioning. at time, stable well-functioning financial market essential achieve maximum employment price stability. the global experience since 2008 reinforce critical interplay monetary financial conditions. however, beyond basic principles, appropriate monetary policy stance achieve financial stability dual mandate maximum employment price stability? with inflation run well 2 percent longer-run target unemployment rate still well normal long-term level, appropriate monetary policy dictate low real interest rate prevail economy along sustainable path potential level inflation close target. nonetheless, common hear 1 because difference product coverage statistical methodologies, total cpi inflation tend average 1/4 1/2 percentage point high total pce inflation. hence, fomc’s 2 percent target total pce inflation would translate 2.3 percent 2.5 percent target total cpi inflation. 2 i recently discuss cost too-low inflation implication 2 percent inflation target january 15 speech; see evans (2014). 4 bi central bankers’ speech argument highly accommodative monetary policy might sow seed financial instability. the fear excessive persistently low interest rate would lead excessive risk-taking investors. for instance, firms, life insurance company pension funds, pressure meet stream fix liability incur interest rate higher.3 (and perhaps liability offer somewhat generous term begin with.) to meet commitment like current low interest rate environment, firm incentive reach yield invest excessively risky assets. furthermore, cost borrow historically low levels, investor might simply decide good time cheaply amplify risk return portfolio take leverage. one could reach conclusion historically low stable interest rate pose threat financial stability. this create seem paradox policymakers. on one hand, exist large shortfall aggregate demand call highly accommodative monetary policy historically low interest rates. on hand, policy potential raise likelihood financial instability future. so, question i’m often ask regard matter follows: do regulator feed adequate safeguard place mitigate potential financial risk? if not, fomc step away think best monetary policy respect dual mandate? should discard nonconventional tool raise feed fund rate order reduce possibility undesirable financial imbalance future? i don’t believe monetary policy adjustment right approach. i think inference persistently low interest rate pose danger financial stability base narrow view economy. this narrow view unlikely survive broad analysis take account interaction financial market real economic activity. if restrictive monetary policy pursue generate high interest rates, would likely result high unemployment sharp decline asset prices, choke moderate recovery. such adverse economic outcome unlikely set favorable foundation financial stability. moreover, short-term interest rate tool blunt significant effect pocket financial system prone inappropriate risk-taking. at time, blunt tool could significantly damage markets, well growth prospect economy whole. therefore, step away otherwise appropriate monetary policy address potential financial instability risk would degrade progress toward maximum employment price stability. this approach would particularly poor choice tool available, low social costs, address risk financial instability. let clear. i say financial stability concern relevant economy policymakers take decisive action development threaten financial stability. rather, i say macroprudential tool available policymakers better-suited safeguard address financial risk directly. these macroprudential action dial give appropriate set monetary policy tools; so, undesirable macroeconomic outcome le likely resort premature monetary tightening. indeed, decision instead rely more-restrictive interest rate policy achieve financial stability expense poor macroeconomic outcome must pas cost–benefit test. and test would clearly illustrate adverse economic outcome more-restrictive interest rate 3 i note increase interest rate since last spring increase discount factor thus low present value pension fund fix nominal liabilities. for instance, see fitch rat (2013). bi central bankers’ speech 5 policy would good acceptable society outcome achieve use enhance supervisory tool alone address financial stability risks. i yet see argue convincingly. macroprudential tool let’s discus macroprudential tools. one simple important tool enhance monitoring. even recent financial crisis, central banker well aware key role play stable financial market economic activity. since crisis, however, analysis financial stability issue greatly expand give prominent role fomc’s deliberations. we comb ream data look evidence incipient risk financial stability. the federal reserve also revamp approach bank supervision substantially expand focus macrofinancial risks. traditional bank supervisory tool use intensively, new tool developed. bank capital stress test one well-known addition supervisory toolkit. another augmentation traditional microprudential supervisory work analyze individual institution effort take wide-angle view bank industry. supervisor look identify common trend across institution emerge concentration risk might pose systemic threat financial system. this broad view also allow supervisor good identify sound practice among firm incorporate supervisory review feedback provide them. the federal reserve also greatly expand surveillance effort financial market outside traditional bank sector, insurance industry financial market utilities. these effort confine financial institution per se, reach range activity might pose potential threat financial stability. for instance, staff member chicago feed actively engage assess role high-frequency computerize trade security derivative market associate risk might arise it. these example regulatory tool available monitor promote financial stability. and host instrument toolkit, resolution plans, liquidity requirement single counterparty credit limits. all example improvement supervisory practice aim reduce likelihood systemic disruption contain impact disruption occur. conclusion to reiterate, i currently expect low inflation still-high unemployment mean short-term policy rate remain near zero well 2015. in environment, question ability supervisory regulatory tool adequately address potential financial instability risks. they argue broad tighten interest rate policy might effective catch incipient risk might fall cracks. it certainly true high interest rate would permeate entire financial system. but another way say raise interest rate blunt tool. high interest rate would reduce risk-taking excessive; also would result pullback economic activity sector risk-taking might already overly restrained. that’s blunt tool works. if believe financial stability achieve high interest rate – interest rate would immediate damage meet dual mandate goal time unemployment still unacceptably high – ought least ask financial system become big complex. 6 bi central bankers’ speech think problematic cost-benefit calculus become way achieve financial stability raise interest rate level force demand supply real economy put them. the possible benefit restrictive rate move would reduce risk might form nook cranny highly complex financial system. but cost would 1) high unemployment; 2) risk choke economic recovery; 3) even low inflation objective; and, somewhat paradoxically, 4) introduction new financial risk reduce asset value credit quality. give cost-benefit trade-offs, i would question whether financial system become complex – perhaps complex enough generate negative social value. rather degrade macroeconomic performance suboptimal monetary policies, i would consider whether contemplate big change financial system – lot rules, substantially high capital requirement institution maybe even few financial products. however, i favorable view social value financial system efficacy supervision regulation. since financial crisis, federal reserve expand macroprudential toolkit enhance microprudential tools. we also reorient approach supervision take full advantage federal reserve system’s wide-ranging expertise macroeconomic financial development risks. i believe regulatory effort effectively minimize risk another crisis increase resiliency financial system. we achieve objective without resort wholesale change financial system without degrade monetary policy goals. maintain effectiveness financial system generate more-robust economic growth continue crucial objective public policy. thank time, i would happy take questions. reference evans, charles, 2014, “recurring theme new year,” speech, corridor economic forecast luncheon, coralville, ia, january 15.

symposium “building financial system twenty-first century: an agenda europe unite states”, armonk, new york, 27 march 2014. * * * the financial crisis exposed, painful dramatic fashion, shortcoming exist regulatory supervisory regimes. in unite state european union (eu), crisis also reveal particular vulnerability create foreign bank operations. this even i would like focus vulnerability best address them. let note outset commonplace observation quite integrate international financial system, many large, globally active firm operate within system national government regulation or, case eu, hybrid regional national regulation. i add equally commonplace observation realistic prospect global bank regulator and, consequently, responsibility authority financial stability continue rest national regional authorities.1 the question, then, responsibility oversight large firm effectively share among regulators. this, course, important issue underlie perennial challenge home-host supervisory relations. another introductory observation – least world nation substantially different economic circumstances, different currencies, bank capital market quite different level depth development – good reason vary least form regulation across countries. presumptively, least, nation able adjust regulatory system base local circumstance relative level risk aversion pertain potential financial instability. although financial system economy unite state eu similar one another many jurisdictions, hardly identical. even two, example, may legitimate difference within broad convergence around minimum regulatory supervisory standard develop basel committee, international organization security commissions, financial stability board, forums. these open observation important respond curious charge “balkanization” level unite state and, less extent, jurisdictions, result action take propose response problem present foreign bank crisis. i say “curious” several reasons. one charge reflect misunderstand allocation responsibility home host supervisor evolve basel committee past several decades. another charge seem implicitly, oddly, premise notion 2007 well-functioning, integrate global financial system effective consolidate supervision global banks. a third charge overlook fact much unite state match eu quite sensibly years. in rest remark i elaborate points, though spirit debater’s arguments, effort answer question i pose moment ago: how, 1 i would add, passing, observation i sure would desirable single global bank regulator even remotely within realm political possibility. 2 bi central bankers’ speech is, successfully reduce risk financial stability pose large, internationally active banks? a i hope become apparent, theme i wish emphasize need redouble effort genuine supervisory cooperation manage effectively vulnerability challenge pose perennial home-host issue. international principle home- host-country responsibility while circumstance risk may changed, issue appropriate role home host country new one. indeed, key motivation creation basel committee 1975 follow failure herstatt franklin national banks. many basel committee’s early activity focus challenge create gap supervision internationally active banks, evidence fact basel “concordats” supervision precede basel “accords” “frameworks” capital subjects. this task has, necessity, ongoing, experience reveal gap supervisory coverage scale scope internationally active bank grew. the principle consolidate supervision emerge early 1980s ensure specific bank authority – generally home-country regulator – complete view asset liability bank.2 this principle reinforce elaborate follow bank credit commerce international episode early 1990s.3 it important note basel committee declaration importance home-country consolidate oversight also include statement obligation prerogative host state significant foreign bank operation located. this feature basel committee’s approach make sense reflection host authority’s responsibility stability financial system practical point host authority familiar characteristic risk market. in accordance history, current version “core principle effective bank supervision” set one “essential criteria” home-host relationship “[t]he host supervisor’s national law regulation require cross-border operation foreign bank subject prudential, inspection regulatory report requirement similar domestic banks.”4 it clear, then, consolidate supervision intend displace host-country supervision. instead, basel committee regularly noted, two intend complementary, assure effective oversight large, internationally active banks. similarly, state purpose basel committee require consolidate capital requirement remove host country responsibility discretion apply regulatory capital requirements, “preserve integrity capital bank subsidiary eliminate double gearing.”5 likewise, contrary suggestion sometimes made, capital accord framework develop basel committee always explicitly minimum requirements. they floors, ceilings. finally, worth note that, establish post-crisis framework domestic systemically important bank (d-sibs), basel committee make clear host country may appropriate circumstance designate domestic operation foreign bank 2 basel committee bank supervision (1983), “principles supervision banks’ foreign establishment (pdf)” (basel: bank international settlements, may). 3 basel committee bank supervision (1992), “minimum standard supervision international bank group their cross-border establishment (pdf)” (basel: bank international settlements, july). 4 basel committee bank supervision (2012), “core principle effective bank supervision (pdf)” (basel: bank international settlements, september), p. 38. 5 basel committee bank supervision (2006), “international convergence capital measure capital standard (pdf)” (basel: bank international settlements, june), p. 7. bi central bankers’ speech 3 systemically important country, even parent foreign bank already designate global systemically important bank (g-sib).6 the idea inform newly create concept d-sib entity whose stress failure could destabilize domestic financial system might thereby indirectly destabilize international financial system. thus, d-sib category carry along high loss-absorbency requirement generally applicable domestic banks, although perhaps high requirement g-sibs. of course, regulation foreign bank organization (fbos) entail d-sib designation require high generally applicable loss absorbency. but i cite feature d-sib framework permit designation domestic operation foreign g-sibs reflect rather clearly principle specific characteristic domestic market may call regulation foreign bank host country, consolidate level. in short, work basel committee year direct restrain host-country authority supervise regulate foreign bank operation country. on contrary, committee repeatedly assert complementary responsibility home host country oversee large, internationally active bank groups, interest national international financial stability. and committee frequently return set issue respond development pose threat safety soundness international financial system. the shift foreign bank activity unfortunately, neither basel committee national regulator respond timely fashion magnitude expansion scale scope world’s large bank organization roughly 15 year financial crisis. a illustrate figure 1, end 1974, basel committee created, asset world’s 10 large bank organization together equal 8 percent global gdp. the three large american – bankamerica, citicorp, chase manhattan. but combine asset equal le 3–1/2 percent world gdp and, illustrate figure 2, 10 percent gdp home country, unite states. by 1988 combine asset world’s 10 large bank organization proportion world gdp nearly double 15 percent, ratio hold constant succeed decade, begin emerge market financial crisis 1997. then explosive growth began. in next decade – is, onset financial crisis 2007 – combine asset world’s 10 large bank share global gdp nearly tripled, 43 percent. the large bank world time, royal bank scotland (rbs), asset equivalent 6.8 percent global gdp, nearly twice comparable figure three large bank combine 1974. add asset deutsche bank bnp paribas – second third large bank 2007 – rbs, three combine asset equal 17 percent global gdp. and three asset nearly equal to, one instance substantially than, gdp home country. even eighth-ranked bank, ubs, asset well four time gdp home country, switzerland. not size large bank change dramatically, so, too, scope, reflect overall integration capital market traditional lend activity accelerate decade half precede crisis. this trend particularly apparent unite state unite kingdom, home world’s two large financial centers. in unite states, proportion foreign bank asset total u.s. bank asset remain constant approximately one-fifth since late 1990s. but 6 basel committee bank supervision (2012), “a framework deal domestic systemically important bank (pdf)” (basel: bank international settlements, october). 4 bi central bankers’ speech concentration character asset change noticeably. today many foreign u.s.-owned bank least $50 billion u.s. assets, threshold establish dodd-frank wall street reform consumer protection act bank stringent prudential measure must established.7 perhaps even important shift composition foreign bank asset 15 year crisis, proportion asset hold u.s. broker-dealer 10 large fbos rise approximately 15 percent roughly 50 percent.8 today, 4 top 10 broker-dealer unite states, 12 top 20, own foreign banks. meanwhile, even traditional branch model large foreign commercial bank unite state changed. reliance le stable, short-term wholesale fund increase significantly. many foreign bank shift “lending branch” model “funding branch” model, u.s. branch foreign bank borrow large amount u.s. dollar upstream parents. these “funding branches” go hold 40 percent foreign bank branch asset mid-1990s hold 75 percent foreign bank branch asset 2009. foreign bank group move position receive fund parent net basis 1999 provide significant fund non-u.s. affiliate mid-2000s – $600 billion net basis 2008.9 a good bite short-term fund use finance long-term, u.s. dollar-denominated project trade finance around world. there also evidence significant portion dollar raise european bank pre-crisis period ultimately return unite state form investment u.s. securities. indeed, amount u.s. dollar-denominated asset-backed security security hold european increase significantly 2003 2007, much finance short-term, dollar-denominated liability european banks.10 just regulatory system not, year precede crisis, address vulnerability reliance short-term wholesale fund create integration capital market traditional lending, respond transformation foreign bank operations. accordingly, home country systemically important bank play catch-up capital, liquidity, requirements, host country large foreign bank operation play catch-up deal different character many internationally active bank 20 30 year ago. the regulatory response in sense, major strengthen past year capital liquidity requirement internationally active bank – include capital surcharge bank global systemic importance – date important international regulatory response reveal vulnerability associate large foreign bank operations. build capital improve liquidity position bank consolidate basis surely key step toward assure stability

appropriate regulation fully incorporate new basel standards, also ensure bank substantively, formally, compliant various transition target date reached. it also case do address risk pose large global bank organizations, include additional measure deal run risk associate short-term wholesale fund ensure even large firm successfully resolve without either create major systemic problem require

state deal vulnerability associate large foreign bank operations, thus fulfil responsibility host-country supervisors. i discus unite kingdom separately eu outside euro zone because, host jurisdiction, similar unite state eu member state or, indeed, country world. the eu not, since crisis, specifically adjust structure regulation foreign bank member state role host supervisors. for decade crisis, eu member state prudently require commercial banking, also investment bank subsidiary foreign (non-eu-based) bank organizations, subject basel capital requirement way eu-based firms. with adoption crd iv,11 directive implement new eu capital requirements, basel iii apply eu firms, include eu bank investment bank subsidiary non-eu bank organizations. branch non-eu bank generally subject local requirements. before crisis subsequent development basel iii, leverage ratio requirement eu capital directives. insofar new leverage ratio part basel iii package agree upon internationally, one would anticipate apply commercial bank investment bank firm eu, include local subsidiary non-eu firms. likewise, one would anticipate basel iii liquidity requirement implement eu accordance internationally agree timeline and, again, apply eu subsidiary fbos. a great challenge eu deal bank headquarter one eu country business eu country “single passport,” basically allow full access rest eu, supervision provide home country. during crisis, notable instance bank stress failure involve institutions, consequent negative effect depositors, counterparties, economy part eu. much ongoing post-crisis reform agenda europe seem direct ensure safety soundness eu-based institutions. the important change may assumption european central bank supervisory responsibility large euro area banks. and, saw last week, work continue long process create credible resolution mechanism banks. a member state eu, unite kingdom course implement eu policy i described. but country apply additional set requirement local operation foreign banks, particularly respect liquidity. the prudential regulation authority bank england apply local liquidity requirement 11 the european crd iv package, implement global basel iii capital standard eu law, enter force july 17, 2013. see http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/regcapital/legislation_in_ force_en.htm 6 bi central bankers’ speech commercial investment bank subsidiary non-u.k. banks, require hold local buff determine internal stress test 14- 90-day components. the assumption stress test premise quite strict. for example, u.k. subsidiary generally must assume zero inflow non-u.k. affiliate – even claim non-u.k. affiliate short term mature within stress test period – 100 percent outflow non-u.k. affiliates. the requirement generate test subject supervisory review add-on firm result significant increase buff requirement. branch foreign commercial bank may circumstance subject local liquidity requirement well. the u.k. initiative apply local liquidity requirement wholly understandable light difficulty encounter stress foreign institutions, include lehman bankruptcy, crisis. because london one world’s two large financial center hosts, unite kingdom country unite state host numerous, large broker-dealer own foreign bank also broad array commercial bank subsidiary branch own foreign banks. in fact, six institution headquarter outside unite state unite kingdom top three tier g-sibs hold roughly 40 percent worldwide asset two jurisdictions.12 thus u.k. initiative liquidity internal debate matter structural supervision, vickers proposals, stress test instructive federal reserve board. even eventually adopt somewhat different approaches, respect motivation scrupulousness u.k. bank authority address systemic vulnerability pose fbos fulfil responsibility rest world assure stability one world’s two important financial centers. unlike eu, unite state – prior financial crisis – require broker-dealer investment bank meet basel capital standards. the legacy glass-steagall act, separate investment bank commercial banking, mean commercial bank subject prudential regulation federal bank agencies. in europe, dominance universal banking, variant thereon, lead naturally application capital prudential standard form bank activity. even gramm-leach-bliley act remove remain barrier affiliation investment bank commercial bank unite states, basel capital requirement apply consolidate level activity investment bank broker-dealer affiliate commercial bank. thus, five large “free-standing” u.s. investment bank generally subject full application basel capital standards. during crisis, ill-advised nature regulatory state affair become apparent. the decline value many mortgage-backed security consequent market uncertainty true value entire class security raise question solvency major broker-dealers. because dealer highly leverage dependent short-term financing, uncertainty also lead serious liquidity strains, first bear stearns lehman brother eventually dealer – domestic foreign owned. bear stearns merrill lynch acquire exist bank hold company come close

www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_131111.pdf. bi central bankers’ speech 7 subsidiary foreign banks. at time, shift strategy many foreign bank toward use u.s. branch raise dollar short-term market lend around world create another set vulnerability result substantial and, relative total assets, disproportionate use federal reserve’s discount window foreign bank branches. the experience crisis make clear, first, perimeter prudential regulation around u.s. financial institution need expanded. a note moment ago, occur de facto crisis. the dodd-frank act give legal foundation change, first mandate goldman sachs morgan stanley remain subject consolidate prudential regulation even divest insure depository institution and, second, give financial stability oversight council authority designate financial firm systemically important, step would place federal reserve regulation supervision. dodd-frank require federal reserve apply progressively stringent prudential regulation bank hold company $50 billion assets. congress also require federal reserve apply special prudential standard large fbos. a i already implied, much do simply catch eu u.k. practice. under recently finalize section 165 enhance prudential standard regulation, fbo u.s. non-branch asset $50 billion must hold u.s. subsidiary intermediate hold company (ihc), must meet risk-based leverage capital standard generally applicable bank hold company u.s. law.13 such fbo must also certify meet consolidate capital adequacy standard establish home-country supervisor consistent basel capital framework. fbos combine u.s. asset $50 billion must also meet liquidity risk-management standard conduct internal liquidity stress tests. the ihc must maintain liquidity buff unite state 30-day liquidity stress test. the u.s. branch agency fbo must maintain liquidity buff unite state equal liquidity need 14 days, determine 30-day liquidity stress test.14 the ihcs fbos must also conform certain risk-management supervisory requirement ihc level. structurally, u.s. capital requirement fbos similar apply foreign bank eu. that is, generally applicable basel capital requirement apply u.s. operation fbos local bank subsidiaries, investment banks, broker-dealers. in fact, new u.s. rule somewhat favorable foreign institutions, apply non-branch u.s. asset fbo exceed $50 billion. that dollar amount, incidentally, dodd-frank threshold stringent prudential measures, though note statutory threshold apply total asset u.s. bank organization – foreign, well domestic – exceed level. a eu, capital requirement apply u.s. branch foreign banks, even though crisis experience provide credible argument so. the leverage ratio requirement receive particular attention. one complaint foreign operation u.s. bank subject leverage ratio local operations. it true many foreign country – include eu member state – currently leverage ratio standard banks. a note earlier, however, one may reasonably expect country implement basel iii leverage ratio timely 13 actually, fbos need meet advance approach risk-based capital requirement unite states, unless specifically opt treatment. see www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/ 20140218a.htm. 14 an fbo total consolidate asset $50 billion combine u.s. asset le $50 billion must report result internal liquidity stress test (either consolidate basis combine u.s. operations) board annual basis. 8 bi central bankers’ speech fashion. also, i would note pass u.s. leverage ratio requirement foreign firm phase slowly originally proposed, align closely effective date basel iii leverage ratio requirement. a second complaint something unfair unite state require fbo meet international leverage ratio u.s. operations, operation may heavily weight toward broker-dealer activities, generally high leverage, whereas leverage ratio u.s. firm base global operations. again, one suspect foreign operation u.s. firm could subject similar ratio requirement abroad country implement basel iii commitments. however, quite apart may happen future, two u.s.-based firm – goldman sachs morgan stanley – whose global business mix resemble u.s. subsidiary fbos predominantly engage broker-dealer activity unite states. in fact, enhance supplementary leverage ratio board propose summer, u.s. g-sibs would subject high basel iii leverage ratio requirement (5 percent) would apply fbo ihcs (3 percent). the applicable liquidity requirements, somewhat differently defined, roughly comparable already applicable fbos unite kingdom. the similar position two nation host country foreign bank operation heavily involve trade significantly reliant potentially runnable short-term wholesale fund explain rough parallelism. the notable departure new u.s. fbo standard exist eu u.k. practice lie ihc requirement foreign bank large domestic operations. give structure u.s. financial regulation legacy glass-steagall, well effort small number large foreign bank evade intent congress capital standard apply u.s. operations, need create structural requirement. it unclear much difference make capital requirement fbos unite state opposed, say, u.s. operation eu. that would depend existence size financial affiliate own u.s. firm subject basel standard directly. in case, seem sound prudential practice – consistent various basel committee principle i early refer – large domestic operation foreign bank meet capital standard basis exposure host jurisdiction and, indeed, manage risk country across affiliates. “balkanization” home-host responsibility to return issue balkanization, three thing apparent. first, new capital regulation applicable fbos, unite state follower pattern set eu initiator new kind requirements. of course, foreign bank would prefer old system hold relatively little capital extensive u.s. operations. but neither safe financial system particularly fair competitor – u.s. foreign – hold significant amount capital here. indeed, firm genuinely well capitalized, include hold g-sib surcharge global consolidate level, require moderate adjustment effort transition period establish fbo rule. second, considerable scope foreign bank integrate u.s. operation global activity within rule federal reserve adopt last month. for example, foreign firm $10 billion non-branch asset additional report requirements, u.s. non-branch asset rise $50 billion quantitative basel capital requirement become applicable u.s. subsidiaries. moreover, capital requirement apply branch long parent subject home-country consolidate capital rule consistent basel standards. the u.s. operation fbo branch subsidiary subject “due from” restrictions. bi central bankers’ speech 9 they remain free lend money worldwide affiliates; must simply stable fund base. finally, i note many fbos, like many u.s.-based banks, make considerable progress reduce dependence short-term wholesale fund build capital. to extent, new requirement intend preserve progress. third, capital liquidity requirement apply wholly consistent responsibility host-country supervisor assure financial stability markets. collectively, foreign bank large presence unite state conduct activity scope, scale, could lead problem u.s. financial system come stress. realistically, exposure vulnerability large host-country market much difficult home-country supervisor assess. indeed, u.s. regulator count expertise proximity u.k. regulator oversee london operation large u.s. financial institution enhance effective consolidate supervision regulation responsible. on issue home-host-country coordination regulate large, globally active bank organizations, i would make three additional points. first, fbo capital requirements, like eu foreign commercial investment banks, base capital rule agree basel committee.15 thus, overall compatibility national international rule respect applicable definitions, standards, require ratios. second, home country must implement enforce faithfully consolidate level capital rules. more broadly, home-country supervisory expectation strong consolidate capital levels, liquidity positions, risk-management practice likely facilitate compliance domestic requirement large fbos sort applicable unite state eu. it also important home country assure credibility resolution mechanism large bank organizations. this task entail implementation financial stability board’s principle effective resolution regimes, include establish resolution authority adequate legal power manage process orderly fashion without injection public capital.16 it also include require institution total loss absorption capacity sufficient recapitalize firm even substantial equity buff lose extreme tail event. home host country work together toward international standard ensure appropriate amount capacity would available host authority face potential insolvency large fbos jurisdiction consequence market failure parent banks. in regard, i think capital requirement fbos sort require eu unite state likely reduce considerable strain traditionally accompany financial distress global bank firms. in cases, include internationally within eu recent years, stress result demand host authority ex post ring fence capital, liquidity, both, often absence ex ante requirements. the existence fbo capital liquidity standards, particularly supplement total loss absorbency measure i referred, mitigate need demands, course come bad possible time firm try meet them. third, – i mean home major host bank regulator – need find good way foster genuine regulatory supervisory cooperation. particularly 15 a technical matter, relevant fbos subject traditional 4 percent u.s. leverage ratio, likely requirement le bind 3 percent international leverage ratio inclusion denominator latter off-balance-sheet activity exposures. 16 financial stability board (2011), “key attribute effective resolution regime financial institutions” (basel: financial stability board, november 4). 10 bi central bankers’ speech senior level agency actually supervise globally active banks, interaction counterpart country become almost exclusively focus develop international standard review compliance exist ones. these discussion usually conduct numerous colleague responsible bank regulation jurisdictions. a important effort been, continue be, follow crisis, risk opportunity senior official various national agency direct supervisory responsibility bank organization meet discus share challenges, give short shrift collective interest bank regulator effective supervision globally active firms. proposal include prudential requirement or, precisely, include limitation prudential requirement trade agreement would lead u farther away aforementioned goal emphasize share financial stability interests, favor approach prudential matter inform principally consideration commercial advantage. conclusion the job regulate supervise large, globally active bank organization tough one. issue moral hazard, negative externalities, asymmetric information are, pervasive, least significant recurring. the job make hard fact firm cross border way regulator not. but cannot ignore fact pretend global oversight. international standard prudential regulation global regulations, consolidate supervision comprehensive supervision. the jurisdiction represent basel committee right regulate financial market – include large fbos participate market – responsibility home jurisdictions, rest world, so. the important contribution unite state make global financial stability ensure stability financial system. there must assurance beyond mere word parent bank home-country supervisor large fbo remain strong support period stress. after all, saw crisis, parent bank home-country authority may offer word total good faith calm times, may unable carry financially turbulent periods. none mean need odds one another. on contrary, circumstance call tangible safeguard host countries, also genuine cooperation among supervisory authorities. indeed, i hope continue case international agenda resolution, total loss absorbency, relate matters, aspire converge around kind protection expect consolidate local levels. bi central bankers’ speech 11 bi central bankers’ speech 1 fritz zurbrügg: the swiss national bank’s

money markets. monetary policy condition our investment policy differ number way large investors, whether private sector investor sovereign wealth funds. this due snb’s special role. a independent central bank, snb conduct switzerland’s monetary policy. our investment policy always subordinate monetary policy understand context policy, currently shape minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 euro. we introduce minimum exchange rate september 2011, since enforce consistently. you recall how, time, debt crisis euro area threaten deteriorate. the upward pressure swiss franc immense. for snb, important ensure price stability avert serious damage swiss economy. see current perspective, certainly achieved. two half year introduction, minimum exchange rate remain key element snb’s monetary policy, last week, monetary policy assessment, decide maintained. although recovery global economy continue fourth quarter 2013, substantial risk remain. in addition, conditional inflation forecast switzerland adjust downwards comparison december. internationally decline inflation rate slightly strong swiss franc delay rise inflation positive territory. the snb expect inflation 0% current year 0.4% 2015. in 2016, inflation increase 1.0%. furthermore, value swiss franc still high. with three-month libor close zero, minimum exchange rate continue right tool avoid undesirable tighten monetary condition event renew upward pressure swiss franc. through minimum exchange rate, therefore, position fulfil price stability mandate. however, consistent enforcement minimum exchange rate contribute substantial increase currency reserves. slide 1 show that, since 2009, currency reserve increase factor six, foreign 2 bi central bankers’ speech exchange reserve almost ten time higher. our foreign exchange reserves, is, currency reserve exclude gold, currently amount almost chf 450 billion, 70% switzerland’s annual economic output. the expansion foreign exchange reserve mean balance sheet expose volatility financial market use be. even slight price change strong influence investment performance. this make investment policy even challenging. however, thank establish process high level expertise, position meet demands. history investment policy snb at snb, move towards sustainable investment policy aim optimise risk return begin early 1970s. at time, management foreign exchange reserve focus exclusively high possible level security liquidity. imagine situation whereby, 1978, residual term three month legal requirement. a result, foreign exchange reserve consist primarily short-term u dollar investments, particularly u treasury bills. this lead considerable concentration risk. at time, potential return extremely low. despite narrow statutory provision market-related limitations, snb try make use exist room manoeuvre regard returns. however, partial revision nba 1997 strategic importance attach generation returns. this become possible abolition maximum residual term one year foreign exchange reserves, apply then. a important step towards sustainable investment policy entry force fully revise nba 2004. although, time, change investment policy attract much public attention, important snb’s investment activities. within monetary mandate, investment policy define one snb’s core task first time. moreover, statutory restriction regard investment instrument removed. and foundation lay modern investment policy whose aim optimise risk/return relationship assets. however, possible extent allow monetary policy, always priority investment policy considerations. in addition expand snb’s freedom action, investment risk control process fundamentally adapt adjust new requirement 1997 onwards. a result, snb frequently find role central bank pioneer, regard choice investment instruments, also area investment processes. it pride i report how, recent years, receive enquiry central bank investment processes. the snb also play pioneer role regard transparency. the composition investment is, large extent, accessible public. indeed, snb one central bank publish investment allocation net result foreign currency position quarterly basis. investment policy commit security, liquidity return nowadays, therefore, invest currency reserves, base decision criterion security, liquidity return. the currency reserve country serve primarily mean prevent overcome crises. in order fulfil function, must, essence, liquid. in past, snb define liquidity specify term bonds. the short residual term, liquid investment appear be. consequently, well 1990s, snb’s foreign exchange reserve consist almost exclusively government paper short terms. bi central bankers’ speech 3 with time, concept liquidity changed. for long time now, define liquidity accord potential rapid sale minimum possible impact market, rather function term bonds. in case, minimum impact market mean that, essentially, wish avoid significant price movements. in order guarantee this, hold substantial portion currency reserve liquid government bonds, important global currencies. together deposit central banks, investment presently account three-quarters foreign exchange reserves. you see current breakdown foreign exchange reserve left-hand side slide 3. for criterion security, focus limit market credit risk. in case, decisive role play diversification across different currency instruments. we engage currency diversification hold foreign exchange reserve currency large advance economies; high percentage account euro (48%) u dollar (27%), see chart right-hand side slide 3. look individual currencies, diversification occur via different investment instruments. a i already mentioned, since full revision nba 2004, additional bond category corporate bond bond foreign authorities, well equities, available. the diversification effect equity versus government bond see slide 4. for chart divide distribution daily return u s&p 500 stock market index since 1999 ten equally large group deciles. then order decile accord size returns. the decile bad return left-hand side best return right. subsequently, assign associate u government bond return deciles. a see, good diversification effect equity government bonds. this result hard understand intuitively. during cyclical upswing, interest rate increasing, price government bond come pressure, equity price benefit improvement economy good profit outlook companies. last year, negative correlation clear diversification effect equity government bond particularly strong. however, interrelationship apply return local currency, us, critical – ultimately – return swiss francs. here situation look somewhat different. this equity price often correlate negatively external value swiss franc. you see relationship slide 5. the chart base approach previous slide. it easy see period poor stock market performance correspond appreciation swiss franc, vice versa. when equity lose value, generally occur environment increase uncertainty economy financial markets. in situations, demand swiss franc particularly strong due character safe haven. the value equity position subject double loss, first price loss second appreciation swiss franc foreign currency equity denominated. so diversification effect equity investment diminished, extent, currency effect. we cannot safeguard hedge appreciation swiss franc would tantamount sell foreign exchange reserve swiss francs, investment decision could thus monetary policy effect. this example show monetary policy consideration limit investment policy’s room manoeuvre. a certain diversification effect also exist equity gold. in time uncertainty high, gold price often increases, equity price come pressure. the opposite occur uncertainty decrease significantly. this particularly evident last year, gold price undergo significant correction climb many years. of course cannot rely kind diversification effect always holding. however, does, welcome. 4 bi central bankers’ speech return important preservation real value that bring third criterion investment activity – return. i would like stress snb concern maximise return sake. rather, return inextricably link criterion security. our goal ensure purchase power currency reserve least maintain time. that, turn, presuppose long-term return earn investment equal great average rate inflation. bear mind aim preserve real value swiss francs, local investment currencies. this mean certain amount positive return local currency needed, balance currency loss incur period swiss franc appreciating. to improve long-term relationship risk return, government bond portfolio supplement additional investment category i already mentioned. generally, potential return equity great government bond issue major advance economies. they therefore make contribution preserve real value currency reserves. to precise, equity increase probability preserve real value currency reserves. this applies, particular, view current low (or negative) real return government bond core markets. so surprise equity investment become important central bank recent years.1 how high equity share be? i talk detail investment equity. so far i explain snb invest equity. in next moments, i would like explore two questions: first, high equity share portfolio be, rough terms? second, investment carry stock market? slide 6 show that, 2005 2010, equity share around 10%. furthermore, see that, since 2011, gradually increase share amount 16% foreign exchange reserves. when determine equity share, challenge optimise risk/return relationship portfolio. a say go among investors: want eat well, buy shares, want sleep well, buy bonds. the idea behind old stock market say that, compare government bonds, equity high potential return generally risky. nevertheless, need begin take account diversification effect equity investments. the interrelationship see look stylise efficient frontier path show slide 7. we start portfolio consist solely government bond (point a chart), start add equity portfolio. in initial stage risk return structure portfolio improves. the expect return increase expect risk decreases. however, give equity share exceeded, point b, trade-off risk return begins. at stage, increase potential return ‘bought’ cost increase risk. in extreme case, reach situation portfolio consist solely equity (point c). the equity share aim obtain weigh additional risk high potential return. after potential return risk weigh way snb, final result look like? fundamentally, efficient frontier present le attractive risk/return combination case many investors. that mean efficient frontier tend look like right-hand curve slide 7. in addition, point 1 accord survey publish early 2013, eight 60 central bank worldwide hold equity part currency reserve time. a six central bank state intend diversify equity future (cf. pringle, robert nick carver, eds. 2013, rb reserve management trend 2013, london, central bank publications). bi central bankers’ speech 5 increase equity share mean rise total risk (point b’) reach early left-hand curve. i already talk reason this. first, naturally hold currency reserve foreign currency swiss francs. second, swiss franc character safe time increase uncertainty economy financial markets. thus i show frequent negative correlation equity price external value swiss franc. third, i also draw attention fact carry currency risk swiss franc, since monetary policy reason cannot hedge it. these factor constitute significant limitation diversification effect equity investments. ultimately, mean snb’s equity share fundamentally low case many investors. the point wish position efficient frontier b’ c’ depend weigh additional risk high return. at present, weighing-up produce equity share 16% i mention before. the snb passive investor how snb carry equity investments? in brief, snb passive investor stock market. in words, snb basically select individual equities. instead, use rule-based procedure invest broad equity universe. at present, snb hold 6,000 security ten currencies. the equity universe equity investment base cover 90% global market capitalisation. we mainly invest mid large cap companies. this make sense, particularly view special liquidity requirement i already mentioned. in addition, also place fund small cap companies. in term market capitalisation hold account small portion equity portfolio, number make three-quarters security hold. this, too, show breadth equity universe. when select equities, use benchmark. this combination various commonly use indices, assemble us. a soon determine benchmark, equity investment become largely automatic process. why snb make target investment individual company sector above-average return expected? in words, engage stock picking? warren buffett quote said, wide diversification require investor understand doing. i assure investment specialist excellent understand doing. however, choose recourse broad equity universe follow four reasons. first, achieve great diversification effect within equity segment invest widely possible, across region sectors. second, objective enforce strategic or, indeed, political interest mean investment individual companies. this could limit monetary policy room manoeuvre would also make position vulnerable. due size foreign exchange reserves, snb could quickly acquire large share companies, might misconstrue strategic participation event active management equity hold correspond overweightings areas. our strategy ensure hold individual company remain low. third, passive strategy minimise market influence, since policy cause u give preference individual security sectors. fourth, investment horizon long-term, is, span several business cycles. the academic literature show that, take account costs, almost impossible beat broad stock index long term systematically.2 2 cf. carhart, mark m. 1997. on persistence mutual fund performance. the journal finance 52 (1): 57–82; also fama, eugene f. kenneth r. french. 2010. luck versus skill cross-section mutual fund returns. the journal finance 65 (5): 1915–1947. 6 bi central bankers’ speech however, two area limit investment universe selective manner. first, exclude mid large cap bank portfolio order avoid conflict interest. second, include company gross violation ethical principles. i explain two point detail. conflict interest regard investment mid large cap bank come because, accord mandate, snb also require contribute stability financial system. under certain circumstances, mean snb information edge market respect financial situation individual banks. in order avoid suspicion snb might make use information edge position investor, completely exclude investment equity banks. moreover, so, prevent market participant attribute signal effect transactions. on question conflict interest, i would also like stress that, matter principle, snb equity swiss company investment purposes. should equity individual company exclude investment universe basis ethical criteria? we discuss question considerable time last year make fundamental decision. we invest company blatantly infringe certain ethical principles. this decision already implement fourth quarter 2013. to specific, hold equity company produce internationally ban weapons, seriously violate fundamental human right systematically cause severe environmental damage. we believe best interest monetary policy snb achieve sound investment return wide possible diversification. consequently, u matter exclude entire sector industries. on contrary. we simply wish exclude company clear evidence serious violation principle mentioned. therefore number company involve limited. how implement this? we convince would practicable snb examine conduct dubious company itself. in view, snb’s task competence include filtering-out companies. for implementation, therefore use analysis establish institution relevant experience. these help u constantly review company fulfil predefined exclusion criteria. you understand provide detail information exclusion procedure equity involved. a i mention beginning, snb always endeavour maintain high degree transparency and, respect, go central banks, especially come investment policy. nevertheless, also establish principle reveal detail various external provider whose service employ operations. the apply detail index use, or, indeed, individual securities. such information could trigger undesirable movement market, would go principle ensure minimum possible impact market. in addition, information could also limit investment policy room manoeuvre thereby negative impact investment results. final consideration the nba 2004 give snb new option investment policy. we use consistent comprehensive development investment policy. in particular, significantly improve risk/return profile foreign exchange reserve number diversification measures. a i shown, equity investment play important role process. however, although snb large global investor, main task monetary policy service swiss economy. consequently, monetary policy affect size investment criterion principle apply manage them. my comment bi central bankers’ speech 7 show option available investment policy limit several area primacy monetary policy. this include fact cannot hedge currency risk respect swiss franc. these limitation sometimes reflect annual results. even though continually extend investment policy, thereby improve return options, occasionally year past negative results. this may repeat future. give current level foreign exchange reserves, small loss percentage term mean high figure swiss francs. that important stress, again, snb’s main task, monetary policy. the success snb cannot measure term annual result whether fulfil mandate, ensure price stability take account development economy. in order fulfil task, minimum exchange rate remain necessary foreseeable future. and return start point presentation. i repeat i say before, minimum exchange rate prevent undesired tighten monetary conditions, upward pressure swiss franc increase again. should become necessary, therefore enforce minimum exchange rate buy foreign currency unlimited quantities. 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 12 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 charles i plosser: systematic policy forward guidance remark mr charles i plosser, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank philadelphia, money marketeers new york university, inc., down town association, new york, 25 march 2014. * * * the view express necessarily federal reserve system fomc. highlight • president plosser highlight relationship systematic monetary policy forward guidance. his goal help underscore systematic approach monetary policy improve effectiveness monetary policy normal time unusual extreme circumstances, policy constrain zero low bind nominal interest rates. • president plosser’s preference deal forward guidance fomc articulate reaction function best can. this entail describe systematic approach policymaking, policy decision base available information consistent predictable way. • president plosser belief recent fomc statement take step direction move qualitative form forward guidance state committee assess progress – realize expect – toward policy objectives. introduction i want thank william kanto money marketeers invite speak evening. your series guest speaker year quite illustrious, include many federal reserve governor presidents, mention distinguish economist wide array others. so, i share think monetary policy tonight, i begin usual disclaimer view necessarily reflect federal reserve system colleague federal open market committee (fomc). of course, disclaimer two-way street, necessarily associate view colleague views. i believe diversity view among fomc participant assure variety among guest speakers. it one great strength decentralize central bank. open dialogue diversity view lead good policy decision primary mean new idea gradually incorporate monetary policy framework. thus, i believe diversity think sign thoughtful progress. a i note 2009 i last speak you, famous american journalist walter lippmann said, “where men think alike, one think much.” tonight i would like focus particular aspect current monetary policy source much discussion debate – forward guidance – is, practice provide information way monetary policy likely evolve future. forward guidance take great significance since fomc low target federal fund rate essentially zero five year ago. face zero low bind constraint primary policy instrument, fomc attempt implement monetary policy, part, influence expectation future policy. the logic approach derive important role expectation play shape economic outcomes. if monetary policy affect expectation specific ways, influence current economic conditions. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the approach i want take discussion highlight relationship forward guidance systematic monetary policy. by systematic, i mean set policy rule-like largely predictable manner response change economic conditions. forward guidance systematic monetary policy closely related. understand relationship provide insight effective monetary policy normal time unusual extreme circumstances, policy constrain zero low bind nominal interest rates. so, i begin brief review benefit systematic policy. i highlight i think academic economist conclude conduct monetary policy rule-like manner preferable regime discretionary. systematic policy for someone age, doesn’t seem long ago take grant central bank suppose mysterious secretive – le say monetary policy better. indeed, wasn’t 1994 fomc begin publicly announce policy change make fomc meeting. up then, market leave infer policy action fed’s behavior market.1 but time definitely changed. transparency replace secrecy, open communication replace mystery. while long thrill day yesteryear central banker say little communicate even less, i don’t think turn back clock – we. economic science come long way past 30 years, one important development recognition important role expectation play understand economic outcomes. this particularly evident financial markets, investment decision valuation security depend assessment future economic outcomes. but also true individual buy home business make capital investments. when business household good understand monetary policy likely evolve, make inform spend financial decisions. if policymakers reduce uncertainty course monetary policy, economy likely perform efficiently. thus, monetary policy systematic predictable reduce expectational error contribute stable efficiently function economy. this recognition important role play expectation lead many academic policymakers stress importance credibility commitment well-articulated monetary policy objectives. it also lead extensive research monetary policy rule enhance predictability policy. in fact, virtually mainstream macroeconomic model build upon presumption monetary policy conduct rule-like manner well understand agent economy. in nobel prize-winning work, finn kydland ed prescott demonstrate credible commitment policymakers behave systematic, rule-like manner time lead good outcome discretion.2 in monetary policy, le discretionary behavior commitment systematic approach show lead economic stability – low le volatile inflation le volatile output. yet, science monetary policy progress point specify optimal rule set monetary policy turn decision computer. judgment 1 see federal reserve bank philadelphia, “timeline transparency.” 2 finn e. kydland edward c. prescott, “rules rather discretion: the inconsistency optimal plans,” journal political economy, 85 (january 1977), pp 473–91. bi central bankers’ speech 3 still required. moreover, optimal rules, is, maximize economic welfare, highly dependent particular model derived. for example, optimal rule one model produce bad outcome another model. in addition, optimal rule often quite complex, thus make difficult implement communicate public. in words, may transparent. however, limitation implement optimal policy rule prevent u adopt systematic approach conduct policy. there great deal progress identify simple, robust rule appear perform well variety model environments. such robust rule form basis develop systematic, rule-like policymaking. this rule-like approach mean one know future future policy decision be. you often hear policymakers speak policy data dependent, indeed, is. but data fee systematic decision-making process policy similar similar environments. one way think systematic part policy reaction function parameter largely stable time. one important desirable characteristic reaction function easily articulate public. this greatly improve transparency predictability monetary policy, reduce surprises. everyone inform course monetary policy understand policymakers likely react change economic circumstances. the well-known simple rule propose john taylor 1993.3 the taylor rule call set nominal feed fund rate base three factors. the first represent economy’s long-run real interest rate, perhaps steady-state real interest rate, plus fed’s target rate inflation. this sometimes refer normal, neutral, nominal rate interest. the second factor function deviation inflation central bank’s target goal. if inflation target, taylor rule say fund rate higher, target, fund rate lower. the third element taylor rule call adjustment fund rate departure real gdp measure “potential” gdp. simply put, gdp “potential,” fund rate reduced, above, increase. i point recent threshold provide reaction function. they simply suggest range economic condition would act. they convey nothing action state economy. in view, one major drawback approach reason change needed. over past 20 years, taylor rule garner great deal attention study. many variation propose property investigated. almost simple rule find robust range model similar construction express variant taylor’s original specification. of course, feed never adopt formal reaction function simple rule set monetary policy. but fomc look implication various rule interest rate make policy decisions. the fact fomc adopt formal reaction function might reflect desire discretion part policymakers. but also reflect difficulty reach consensus. the committee compose 19 member vary view economy functions, shock affect economy, policy set meet fomc’s monetary policy goals. despite formally adopt particular rule, 3 john b. taylor, “discretion versus policy rule practice,” carnegie-rochester series public policy, north-holland, 39, 1993, pp. 195–214. 4 bi central bankers’ speech feed appear behave systematic way various time past. indeed, taylor’s 1993 article note rule approximate federal reserve policy set 1987–1992 period, save deviation stock market crash 1987. i believe despite challenges, would large benefit fomc reach consensus reaction function could serve useful guide understand behavior. those benefit would form increase transparency alignment public’s expectation policymakers’ intentions. a i’ve discuss before, limitation use simple rules, central bank constrain one simple rule circumstances. rule basically intend work well average, central bank look many variable determine policy. there time policy must deviate reaction function policy rule. however, simple rule provide valuable benchmark assess appropriate stance policy. they also provide guidance likely path policy thus intend reduce volatility. however, outcome cannot happen unless central bank will publicly communicate reaction function rule. another benefit articulate rule enhance accountability. there inevitably time economic development fall outside scope model warrant unusual monetary policy action. event 9/11, asian financial crisis, collapse lehman brothers, 1987 stock market crash may require departure simple rule. have articulate rule guide policymaking normal times, policymaker expect explain departure rule unusual circumstances. with rule baseline, departure quantify inform u excessively tight easy policy might relative normal. if event temporary, policymakers explain policy likely return normal. thus, i see several benefit fomc reach consensus reaction function policy rule, include align expectation policy enhance transparency accountability policymaking process. forward guidance one way think policy reaction function form forward guidance. indeed, perhaps best useful form forward guidance. in normal times, forward guidance provide public information expect path policy. a i’ve discussed, forward guidance form transparency reduce volatility reduce policy uncertainty relative discretionary decision-making. however, policy rate near zero, forward guidance play role increase degree accommodation. when policy rate constrain zero low bound, future policy rate become potentially important current policy rate influence current economic condition impact expectations. in models, face zero low bound, desirable indicate future policy rate keep low long might otherwise case.4 thus, policymakers may want deliberately commit deviate would otherwise choose normal conditions, follow taylor-like rule normal reaction function. in models, commitment would tend raise inflation expectation low long-run nominal rates, thereby induce household business spend today. this use forward guidance ask policymakers articulate reaction function. in sense, require commitment policymakers; require commit future path time consistent policymakers forward 4 gauti b. eggertsson michael woodford, “the zero bind interest rate optimal monetary policy,” brook paper economic activity, no. 1, 2003, pp. 139–211. bi central bankers’ speech 5 looking. instead, policymakers need commit policy path history dependent. a i noted, think commitment deviate prior reaction function, particularly reaction function make provision operate zero low bound. if commitment make credible, yield good economic outcomes. but manage public’s belief future policy path challenge policymakers must convince public behave past. and i would argue circumstance fomc faces.5 manage expectation even challenge policymakers clear reaction function use normal times. how policymakers credibly commit deviate something never commit first place? how policymakers convey implement policy accommodative normal clear would constitute normal degree accommodation? manage public’s expectation may difficult also counterproductive. without public’s understand policymaking normal times, try pursue commitment looser-than-normal policy may send wrong signal. for example, public hear policy rate low longer, may interpret message policymakers say expect economy weak longer. if interpretation, forward guidance weaken rather strengthen current spending. where go here? my preference deal forward guidance fomc articulate reaction function best can. this entail describe systematic approach policymaking policy decision base available information consistent predictable way. i believe recent fomc statement take step direction move qualitative form forward guidance state assess progress – realize expect – toward policy objectives. the idea policy change approach objective flavor reaction function. but, course, work do. because know true model economy, i would suggest committee begin consider set robust policy rule design good result variety model across various stage business cycle. such robust rule recognize data measure imprecisely subject revision. these robust rule typically indicate policy respond change gap inflation inflation goal, change deviation output measure potential output, change unemployment steady-state natural rate unemployment. most robust rule suggest reaction change inflation gap one-for-one exceed reaction change output unemployment gap. the rule also suggest policy somewhat inertial. by recognize fundamental difficulty measure potential output natural rate unemployment, i think good case make consider rule rely growth output change unemployment rate employment growth. i want stress rule suggest policy respond change output unemployment gap policy seek fine-tune real economy 5 this would case reaction function rule explicitly describe policy would conduct zero low bound. in case, new forward guidance would required, reaction function would already notify public expect. 6 bi central bankers’ speech allow economy efficiently use resource give economic disturbance experiences. by consider robust rules, fomc might able move toward consensus qualitative description reaction function important first step. for example, would specify precise mathematical rule would provide assessment key variable communicate policy decision term change key variables. if policy changed, would explain change term variable response function changed. if choose consistent set variable systematically use describe policy choices, public form accurate judgment likely course policy – thereby reduce uncertainty promote stability. the fomc keep federal fund rate effectively zero since december 2008. for much time, interest rate rule suggest zero low bind nominal interest rate constrain policy; words, nominal rate negative possible. however, many robust rule suggest give progress economy make past year, policy either long constrain soon constrain zero bound. that is, indicate policy rate zero. rule-based policymaking would require fomc indicate plan adjust policy normal stance. the committee could decide simply follow prescription offer reaction function. or instead, committee might decide normalization delay gradual adjustment rate relative prescription reaction function. but even fomc prepare choose particular rule, could articulate clearly qualitative reaction function would serve baseline future change policy exit zero low bound. it belief would understandable form forward guidance, le subject misinterpretation policy transition unusual time normal times. bi central bankers’ speech 1 grant spencer: coordination monetary policy macro-prudential policy speech mr grant spencer, deputy governor head financial stability reserve bank new zealand, credit suisse asian investment conference, hong kong, 27 march 2014. * * * accompany table figure find end speech. 1. introduction the reserve bank expect tighten monetary policy substantially next two year response emerge inflation risks. at time, speed limit high loan-to-value ratio (lvr) lend place since 1 october 2013, order reduce systemic risk associate highly leverage household rise house prices. the natural question arises: lvr speed limit interact monetary policy? and extent coordinated? these question relate current business cycle also raise broad question – general principle apply manage macro-prudential policy monetary policy go forward? these important question simple answers. they explore economic policy literature reserve bank currently undertake research help clarify issue new zealand context. today i would like discus bank’s current think interaction monetary macro-prudential policies, point area analysis. the bank see important communicate think policy coordination, maintain transparency build many year monetary policy. to summarise bank’s current position, believe essential retain clear primary objective monetary macro-prudential policy. these primary objective price stability financial system stability respectively. however, appropriate role policy coordination certain circumstance certain policy tools. the key respect, ensure primary aim two policy arm undermine heavily divert attention policy secondary objectives. conceptually, case coordinate use monetary policy macro- prudential policy instrument provide affect outcome relevant achievement policy objectives. in general condition likely met, widely vary degrees. most time monetary policy macro-prudential policy able operate largely independently, complementary effect relatively easy manage (table 1). relative independence possible one policy ‘neutral’, therefore impart little influence other’s objective. the great degree complementarity occur real financial cycle sync – either rise fall together depict sw ne corner table 1. in situations, coordination relatively simple, require policy set allow complementary effect other. conversely, two policy great potential conflict real financial cycle sync, depict nw se corner table. these situation coordination difficult also important. this primary objective two policy need carefully balanced. (table 1) to explore policy coordination option closely, i first examine macro-prudential price stability, turn table ask monetary policy financial stability. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 2. what macro-prudential policy price stability? the basic motivation use macro-prudential instrument assist monetary policy help support price stability objective central bank. the monetary authority case welcome assistance range policies, supportive fiscal policy structural reform increase competitive pressure enhance productivity. assistance particularly welcome macro-prudential policy target ‘hot spot’ overheat house market. (figure 1) macro-prudential instrument reduce systemic risk two ways: 1) dampen credit asset price cycles; 2) increase resilience balance sheet downward phase cycle. when think policy coordination, mainly interest tool work first channel, lvr restrictions. our work date suggest lvr restriction material impact supply credit (rbnz (2013)) hence inflation objective. other macro-prudential tools, counter cyclical capital buff (ccb), operate second (resilience increasing) channel, le relevant coordination monetary policy1. assistance macro-prudential tool likely appropriate monetary policy face constraint difficult trade-off dampen inflation pressures. for small open economy like new zealand, constraint often emerge result spill-over effect global financial market and, particular, exchange rate pressures. a good example experience monetary policy last house boom 2003–2007. during time, monetary policy lose degree traction relatively high policy rate market return attract strong capital inflows, result high exchange rate downward pressure long-term interest rates. borrower respond lock long term finance relatively low rates, thereby reduce impact official cash rate (ocr) increases. this mean large increase ocr require control inflation, put additional upward pressure new zealand dollar exchange rate. there loud call time use alternative policy instrument assist monetary policy. possible candidate include macro-prudential policy tax measures, capital gain tax mortgage interest levy (treasury rbnz (2006)). with hindsight, use another policy instrument would helpful period, assist slow domestic demand inflation pressure, le work do ocr exchange rate. lvr restriction may able assist, give rapid rate credit house price growth time present risk financial stability well price stability. macro-prudential tool may also useful complement monetary policy economic downturn 2008. if bank enter recession stable source fund large capital buffers, tighten credit condition ensue gfc may ameliorated, potentially reduce need ease monetary policy significantly. in way, use macro-prudential adjustment downturn situation low risk run zero low bind interest rates. but also significant cost macro-prudential policy instrument use aggressively support monetary policy. all macro-prudential instrument create incentive financial disintermediation– credit flow avoid regulation move outside regulatory perimeter. over-use macro-prudential tool attempt 1 these macro-prudential tool work force bank temporarily increase capital fund buff period rise asset price leverage. because cost capital and/or core fund likely compress periods, cycle-dampening effect instrument likely limited. however, tool significant effect improve scope bank continue lend downward phase cycle. bi central bankers’ speech 3 manage credit cycle would likely see disintermediation increase, thus reduce effectiveness policy tools. moreover, push financial intermediation towards secondary ‘shadow banking’ channels, excessive use macro-prudential policy could weaken financial system efficiency ultimately reduce soundness financial system. we see example behaviour new zealand’s history many countries. with consideration mind, may scope macro-prudential policy assist monetary policy, limit extent, cycle, provide primary objective promote financial stability keep firmly mind. 3. what monetary policy financial stability? we regard financial stability necessary – sufficient– condition macro-economic stability. the gfc-induced recession evidence enough potential financial instability generate macroeconomic instability. further, monetary policy influence asset price credit cycle impact bank lend rates. thus, potential case monetary policy assist promote financial stability or, minimum, undermine it.2 (figure 2) the emerge literature identify number channel monetary policy influence risk-taking behaviour build-up systemic risk (borio zhu (2010)). in particular, extend period low interest rate contribute financial stability risk increase risk-taking, lead ‘search yield’ compression credit spreads. in similar way, extend period low interest rate also lead excessive ease bank lend standards. look issue another angle, tighten monetary policy rein inflation pressure often bring end credit boom (drehmann juselius (2012)). in words, sharp movement interest rates, well sustain low level interest rates, lead financial system stress. however, key lesson literature experience transmission monetary policy financial stability far le clear transmission inflation. in particular, effect monetary policy financial stability depend critically state financial sector time. for example, impact ocr tighten cycle may different depend start level household corporate debt debt service capacity. when monetary policy adjustment likely helpful financial stability perspective? this likely situation asset credit market buoyant prudential policy alone insufficient constrain build-up financial system stress. for example, themselves, macro-prudential policy lvr restriction may limit effect asset price inflation credit cycle. macro-prudential policy must remain consistent micro prudential principle therefore generally scalable way interest rate are. further, impact macro-prudential policy erode disintermediation outside regulatory perimeter, something become likely interest rate set stimulatory levels. thus, situation inflation near target, asset market rise sharply, assistance monetary policy important mean meet financial stability objectives. 2 many country currently actively consider manage potential effect extend period loose monetary policy financial stability. for example, bank england recently include financial stability knock-out forward guidance monetary policy (kohn (2013). 4 bi central bankers’ speech a note federal reserve governor, jeremy stein (2012), monetary policy“gets cracks” financial system. it affect cost credit borrowers, include may avoid macro-prudential regulation result disintermediation. other policy initiative seek alleviate supply-demand imbalance asset market also helpful. in case house market example, might involve regulatory reform around zone plan restrictions, change taxation reduce incentive speculative investment. should monetary policy respond request prudential authority tight policy? the key test whether consistent primary monetary policy objective price stability. if monetary policy divert far long primary objective price stability risk transparency credibility monetary policy damaged, thus reduce long-run effectiveness monetary policy achieve prime objective. this potential problem emphasise example svensson (2011). policymakers academic around world debate appropriateness tighten monetary policy financial stability grind credit asset booms. broadly speaking, two oppose view ‘lean versus clean’ debate: • the “clean” view dominant prior gfc. this view propose monetary policy respond asset credit booms, except extent influence inflation pressures. it assume monetary policy ‘clean up’ impact real economy financial cycle crashes, tighten monetary policy require lean credit asset price boom would create unacceptable cost wide economy. this view implicitly assume micro- macro-prudential instrument effectively limit extent financial system damage downturn. • the ‘lean’ view become prominent since gfc two reasons. first, policy maker surprise large asset bubble could emerge condition sustain price stability, prudent fiscal policies, small output gaps. second, output employment loss social economic cost associate aftermath gfc prove much great deep-set policy maker expected. the‘lean’ view propose monetary policy actively lean credit boom financial stability purposes. it assume that: (i) monetary policy lean credit boom consistent long-run price stability; (ii) increase interest rate effective limit credit boom limit cost wide economy. this view implicitly assume circumstance prudential policy – micro macro – insufficient contain financial system risk own. (table 2) research continue area. although ‘lean’ view become dominant, particular reflect research bi (borio lowe (2003)), consensus monetary policy always respond emerge financial stresses. rather, emerge consensus financial stability valid secondary objective monetary policy may respond financial stability concern action also consistent primary price stability objective (smets (2013)). 4. the new zealand framework: conditional policy coordination new zealand’s policy framework might describe one conditional policy coordination. that say, two policy retain distinct primary objectives, free lend hand policy objective, provide primary objective compromised. in new zealand, coordination facilitate decision macro-prudential monetary policy undertake reserve bank’s govern committee, clearly distinct mandate two policies. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the reserve bank new zealand long mandate use (micro-) prudential policy promote sound efficient financial system. we mandate protect soundness individual institutions. the macro-prudential policy framework establish 2013 also focus promote sound efficient financial system use set instrument may vary financial cycle. a memorandum understand macro-prudential policy sign minister finance 2013 set objectives, instrument responsibility macro-prudential policy (rogers (2013)). the new macro-prudential framework draw lesson monetary policy framework. it incorporate commitment achieve objective best suit financial stability – combine decision-making arm’s-length political pressures. however, key difference macro-prudential policy decision involve great degree consultation government public. the new zealand policy framework recognise interaction monetary macro-prudential policy logic conditional policy coordination. in pursue primary objective price stability, policy target agreement (pta) state monetary policy must regard financial stability. and pursue primary financial stability objective, macro-prudential policy require mou consider implication monetary policy. 5. lvr speed limit interaction monetary policy new zealand experience live issue interface macro-prudential monetary policies. during 2003–2007, new zealand experience one high house price appreciation among oecd economies. a period sustain low interest rate since 2009, combine ease lend condition house supply shortage contribute resurge house market house price end 2013 almost 15 percent 2007 peak. the bank respond introduction lvr ‘speed limit’, commence 1 october 2013 (rbnz (2013)). the purpose lvr restriction reduce build-up financial system risk by: 1) dampen rapid growth house prices; 2) strengthen households’ banks’ balance sheets. the policy ban high lvr lending, allow bank write 10 percent mortgage commitment lvrs 80 percent, lead significant reduction high-lvr lending. (figure 3) initially, estimate lvr restriction would dampen annual growth house price 1–4 percentage points; house sale 3–8 percent, credit growth 1–3 percentage point first year policy place. the evidence date suggest dampen effect lvr restriction house price broadly line expectations. house sale fall 13 percent since september, early sign begin translate weak house price credit growth.3 (table 3) while lvrs financial stability purpose, important consideration monetary policy assessment. the dampen effect lvrs house price inflation credit expect reduce wealth credit effect consumption might otherwise increase due rapid expansion house prices. this, turn, estimate reduce cpi inflation pressure amount similar 25–50 basis point increase ocr. 3 reserve bank simulation counter-factual – would happen house price inflation absence lvr speed limit – suggest house price inflation would 2.5 percent high current level. we continue monitor effect lvr restriction publish new estimate impact reserve bank’s may financial stability report. 6 bi central bankers’ speech early month, response broaden inflation pressures, reserve bank begin ocr tighten cycle three year change policy rate. give lvr restriction begin moderate house cycle october 2013, monetary policy tighten cycle might need accentuate absence. while main benefit lvrs redress impact easy lend conditions, may also help take pressure new zealand dollar exchange rate. what policy “conditionally coordinated”? while purely hypothetical, policy decision make strictly independent basis, may see macro-prudential policy‘wait’ come monetary policy tighten cycle slow house market. an absence macro-prudential measure may turn prompt monetary policy tighten start somewhat earlier. to clear, monetary policy tighten cycle underway motivate need ensure cpi inflation remain vicinity 2 percent medium term. the boost financial system resilience provide lvr restrictions, well decision increase risk weight high-lvr house lending4, mean monetary policy need consider tighten financial stability purposes. however, motivate financial stability objective, monetary policy tighten expect help dampen house price inflation. in regard, interest rate move back normal levels, expect great scope ease remove lvr restrictions. the reserve bank state outset lvr restriction intend permanent. they remove house market pressure moderate confident resurgence house price inflation (wheeler (2013)). but exit coordinate expect ocr tighten cycle? the factor consider include: – the degree moderation achieve rate house price inflation credit expansion; – factor might affect potential resurgence house price inflation follow removal lvrs, dampen effect increase house supply mortgage rates, stimulatory effect high net immigration flows; – any distortion inefficiency become apparent result policy. a decision ease remove lvr restriction ultimately take account financial stability price stability implication so. we alert risk removal lvr restriction could produce resurgence house price inflation, would potentially undermine financial price stability. 6. conclusion while monetary policy macro-prudential policy need retain separate primary objective price stability financial stability, significant spill-over effect two policy make clear case co-ordination. however, coordination must conditional policy arm continue focus primary objective. change joint objective policy would: 1) complicate policy decisions; 2) undermine transparency; 3) potentially damage credibility monetary policy macro- prudential policy. 4 increase risk weight high-lvr mortgage apply large internal rat base (irb) bank september 2013. bi central bankers’ speech 7 the policy framework new zealand consistent conditional coordination approach. in monetary policy target agreement financial stability secondary objective. this mean monetary authority need think hard ocr decision might adverse effect financial stability. similarly, macro-prudential mou require macro-prudential initiative regard potential impact monetary policy. there remain many aspect policy co-ordinations need deepen understanding. these include: • the quantitative effect macro-prudential policy macro-economic outcome implication monetary policy. • the scale time spill-over effect ocr four macro-prudential tools. • how best coordinate ocr

conference, hong kong, 26 march 2014. * * * i thank alexandra rush assistance compile remarks. when i last speak conference two year ago, unite state avoid fear “double-dip” recession. europe news, acute concern feedback loop weak economies, bank asset quality sovereign finances. china’s growth moderated, many fear would decline sharply. since then, world economy continue expansion. growth global gdp bite trend 2013, reasonable prospect pick year. none downside scenario exercise mind past couple year have, yet, come pass. that doesn’t mean won’t, world economy climb “wall worry” year now. overall, 2014 economic global growth think likely major forecaster bite high 2013, average pace. more growth come advance countries, proportionately quite much emerge ones. that probably welcome re-balancing respects, weakness advance country recent years. the unite state continue recovery lead private demand second half last year economy expand annualised rate 3 per cent. with current agreement u federal budget, one headwind last year abate somewhat. of course effect recent severe weather still little yet u policymakers get clear read pace expansion. but obvious reason expect expansion de-railed. the euro area resume growth, albeit somewhat hesitant fashion noticeable difference performance country. some quite pronounce adjustment cost structure occur so-called “peripheral” countries, need single currency area arrangement. in japan, initial result policy measure past 18 month quite positive, though course propose “third arrow” reform yet fully delivered. the much anticipate “tapering” u federal reserve’s monthly asset purchase commence december. the initial expectation taper middle 2013 cause market ruction event itself. that said, often occur feed change course, investor take opportunity period re-assess position appetite risk. so far, investor flee risk indiscriminately. they draw distinction alternative class investment differ outlook across countries. long-term sovereign yield core advance country remain low and, compress risk spreads, borrow cost many private-sector borrower also remain low. a emerge economy lately come pressure, bond yield spike exchange rate depreciating. in instances, country-specific issue identify source legitimate concern investors. it notable number country pressure small middle last year, make credibility-enhancing policy adjustment intervene period. so far, good, tapering. in opinion, welcome it. 2 bi central bankers’ speech there tendency, though, talk “normalisation” monetary policy major advance country though happen them. it isn’t: really happen unite states. even early stage unite state actually path neither euro area japan even contemplate yet. in jurisdictions, far i tell, discussion whether ease may order. in fact bank japan (boj) step current program quantitative qualitative easing, would soon add cash global financial system, absolute terms, federal reserve. intriguingly, boj’s action attract rather le attention fed’s. i position opine whether ease might occur, point simply monetary policy trajectory major currency area could diverge, increasingly so, next couple years. one interest question fully possibility reflect major exchange rates. turn asian region, china’s economy grow close to, fact little fast than, government’s target last year. strong equal contribution growth make household consumption investment. consumer price inflation continue stable. recent indicator show possible sign slow growth early part 2014: growth industrial production slowed; retail sale passenger vehicle sale moderated; fix asset investment growth little low january february, though quite stable year-ended terms. give growth target meet last year, give chinese new

people may incline fret still relatively small movement monthly pmis, like, china. sometimes fret even small bump u economic data. the great concern risk involve build-up credit so-called “shadow banking” past five years. to considerable extent growth financial activity surely reflect natural tendency avoid effect price quantity constraint impose core bank sector, environment strong demand

turn chinese financial system economy. it clear chinese authority across issue, likelihood ability resource manage situation. some reform already implemented, help manage risk future, step take moderate flow total social finance seem, far, success. in meantime, broad set recent reform represent incremental step towards great financial market liberalisation: removal restriction lend rate

trade zone associate ease capital account restrictions. these welcome move china’s long-run interests. around asian region generally, stage, sense economic growth continue trend pace. all country watch closely development china impact capital flow risk-pricing feed taper major central bank implement choose policies. turn australian economy, i continue find fascinate divergence view foreign observers, especially asia, many say “australia well” tone commentary home, typically lot pessimistic. my read actual data suggest economy bite good much domestic commentary past couple year would believe, quite well many foreign investor seem thought. australia certainly weather financial crisis well, real gdp 13 per cent large begin 2009, compare well many advance countries. it case, though, growth positive, run pace bite trend pace 18 month now. the rate unemployment increase something like percentage point period. most people familiar fact strong condition natural resource sector. the big positive term trade shock least century drive mine investment boom truly epic proportions, add major impetus demand economy. but term trade peak two half year ago; capital spend resource sector also peak expect decline significantly next couple years. in rest economy, household spend past five year behave conservatively, rather normally, long period mid 2000s expansive mood. both consumption residential construction soft while. i speak length trend explain expected. nonetheless, many business expose sectors, include retailers, builder banks, find go harder. in addition, mine boom associate high exchange rate, trade expose sector also face challenge conditions. look ahead, resource sector’s capital spend continue fall, desirable see source growth strengthen. one export volume resources, already grow strongly, additional capacity put place recent year become utilised. for example, iron ore shipment rise 85 per cent level five year ago, around 1.5 million tonne per day. export rise come year two, additional resource project complete and, margin, area face slightly le headwind exchange rate. it unlikely, though, pick-up resource exports, important be, enough keep overall growth right track. it helpful area domestic demand subdue start grow faster. for occur, household would need make progress desire sustain high saving, consolidate debt needed. business outside mine would need make progress contain costs, raise efficiency. they would also need bite confidence future before, pre-condition make plan lift investment add workforces. there promise sign regard. recent data show strong household consumption summer. the late survey liaison confirm this, suggest retailer optimistic year ago. that said, expect 4 bi central bankers’ speech consumption spend grow line income perhaps little faster, pace see year prior financial crisis. we certainly see abundant sign confidence house market. dwell price see broad-based rise 10 per cent past year 5 per cent previous peak 2010. initially associate much way fast house credit growth. that pick little, though remain far rate see 1990s 2000s. the pick-up noticeable investors, need take care amount

aggregate level, since estimate australia’s addition dwell stock run rate population growth recent years. measure business confidence improve past six months. business seem, far, take cautious approach investment, however: wait stronger, persistent signal improve condition commit significant increase capital expenditure. that’s actually pretty normal cyclical upswing. in hire decision early promise sign improvement, though soon see much way concrete evidence strong gain employment yet. so encourage early evidence so-called “handover” mining-led demand growth broad private demand growth beginning. put together, think economic growth continue, may strengthen little late year pick 2015. it important stress outlook is, obviously, balance large negative force decline mine investment and, work way, likely pick area demand help low interest rates, improve confidence on, well high resource shipments. the low exchange rate since last april improve economic condition overseas also help. because try ass balance different forces, however, inevitably substantial range uncertainty surround central outlook. that simply unavoidable. the fact one say certainty smooth “handover” occur. nor anyone pretend able fine-tune it. on inflation, view little high think three month ago. this take account recent data, high expected, allow result convey least genuine information. nonetheless, think unlikely signify persistent serious inflation pressures. unemployment rising, probably rise bite yet; growth labour cost slow noticeably response. indeed, growth wage price index around low 15-year history measure. measure unit labour cost growth correspondingly quite low. so, absent continually rise profit margin part businesses, don’t see condition persistently high consumer price inflation, even though tradable good price expect rise due low exchange rate. measure inflation expectation remain well-anchored around long-run averages. our view remain outlook inflation, little high before, still consistent medium-term target. trend asset price area watch. in particular, need alert possibility past year strong rise dwell price lead people assume norm. be assumption lead increase speculative activity, accompany renew increase household leverage associate risk house market economy generally, would unwelcome. this theme discuss detail late financial stability review, release early bi central bankers’ speech 5 today. we watch closely, remind people house price go well up. in fact two episode price fell year past decade. the australian prudential regulation authority also emphasise lender boards, time now, need maintain high lend standards. there is, course, full panoply “risks” identified. a always, exchange rate source significant uncertainty. much australia’s outlook also depend development overseas. further progress towards full treatment bank problem return sustainable fiscal budget europe important. with great certainty unite state fiscal policy path monetary policy, risk may upside. on hand, event – like geo-political shock – lead wide retreat risk taking, could significant dampen impact global economy. china’s outlook important australia as, matter, countries. china large second large trade partner significant economies. not way china manage current financial issues, implementation structural reforms, maintain robust economic growth long run, impact us. our monetary policy set unchanged since last august, standard accommodative level. this play part support sustainable growth demand, consistent inflation target. we signal economy evolve line present set forecasts, period stability interest rate could expected. have say that, let return global perspective, make point sustainable growth long run rely monetary policy. strong long-run growth won’t achieve country simply manipulate interest rate (or, matter, exchange rates). monetary policy’s main contribution long run provide stable monetary standard. that necessary condition strong growth sufficient one. nor fiscal expansion serve temporary boost growth. indeed limit fiscal activism surely clear many country now. other condition need right growth. these include ensure environment competition, innovation investment, include human capital, sound. in areas, various government policy must come fore. that spirit country g20 recently commit come measure could raise level world gdp 2 per cent would otherwise been, horizon five years. this isn’t achieve program cheap money debt-financed spending. many need measure likely politically demand government introduce. but sign challenge help galvanise effort sort reform need made, worthwhile initiative. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 graeme wheeler: meet demand statistic fast move world remark mr graeme wheeler, governor reserve bank new zealand, official statistic user forum, wellington, 26 march 2014. * * * introduction it’s pleasure today talk reserve bank’s experience user official statistics. like many central banks, we’re major user producer statistics. we’re big user economic statistic i’ll start talk need area. i’ll go discus role collecting, use disseminate statistic financial system change we’re facing. and i’ll offer central banker’s view challenge statistician face meet grow demand user statistics. at reserve bank, rely heavily broad range economic data. statistic new zealand produce many statistic use also rely data domestic offshore sources. once every quarter, undertake in-depth forecast arrive best projection economy inflation head future. this turn help guide policy decisions. we use range economic models, rely heavily data, apply lot judgment. our assessment economy comprehensive. when look external economy, consider economy major trade partners, term trade, exchange rate current account. when look domestic economy consider household business spending, savings, credit trend confidence. when ass inflation pressures, consider economy’s growth potential alongside actual growth rate take account labour market, import price factor influence prices. let give idea reliant economic statistics. our system processing, store manage time series data know financial sector information system (fsis). we develop six year ago provide u robust database nearly data produce use. today, fsis hold around 36,000 time series. around 20,000 macro-economic time series relate new zealand global economy. statistic new zealand would produce lion’s share 20,000 series. you’ll relieve hear i’m go talk 20,000 statistic let make comment matter u large scale user. timeliness reliability obviously important we’re try ass economy real time. so good quality guidance statistic compile statistician call “metadata”. when encounter puzzle data, essential able open honest conversation statistic new zealand might cause them. revision need handle carefully. most data revise time time, revision large enough re-write history, original data would potential mislead policymakers. the early learn upcoming revision drive better. another thing matter u user official statistic harmonisation. the economic data statistic new zealand produce ideally consistent financial data reserve bank produces. there real value work common business register put together institutional statistics. that real benefit users. 2 bi central bankers’ speech what would top four ‘wants’ statistic new zealand? we’d like sector balance sheet would tell u owe across economy rest world. we’d like quarterly income-based measure gdp, would provide useful alternative perspective output exist production expenditure-based measures. we’d like gdp rebased least every 10 year capture structural change economy. and would love monthly cpi enable timely analysis forecast inflation. we recognise many statistical need resource limited. but lose sight value. new zealand’s annual gdp $220 billion good quality timely decision result slight improvement economic performance could easily worth million dollar per annum. we greatly value voice statistic new zealand’s data development process opportunity engage point process view take account. by accounts, relationship statistic new zealand good shape party need work hard keep improve it. the reserve bank’s financial statistic turn financial statistics, bank major user data financial system, produce in-house, draw power reserve bank act (1989) collect data financial institutions. these data account 16,000 time series fsis database include institutional data collect prudential purposes, data financial markets, data note coins, publish financial system statistics. our survey respondent include bank financial institution “micro-data” use role prudential regulator supervisor. commercial confidentiality mean data isn’t generally published, use compile broad financial system statistics. we’ve well-established practice construct publish statistics. an example would standard statistical return bank system, provide comprehensive information bank system’s balance sheet. some statistic act input production statistic new zealand’s statistics, include national accounts. table 1 some key reserve bank

financial crisis our financial data collection grow substantially recent year three reasons. first, intensity prudential oversight increase since global financial crisis 2008/09. we’ve seek strengthen prudential regime bank example. a elsewhere, gfc show risk around bank liquidity fund period financial turmoil potentially much great anyone expected. in 2010, introduce new standard bank require new minimum liquid asset requirement minimum core fund ratio. introduce new standard mean need new liquidity fund data monitor compliance new standard individual bank financial system level. another example strong prudential standard introduction temporary speed limit banks’ high-loan-to-value (lvr) lend reflect concern grow risk house sector. this, turn, require u collect additional data banks’ house lend break lvr. a second driver expand need statistic expansion regulatory responsibility recent years. since 2008, reserve bank give responsibility prudential regulation non-bank deposit take sector (nbdt). new standard capital, liquidity relate party exposure inevitably require data collect industry may prompt upgrade sector’s statistic future. in 2010, become prudential regulator supervisor insurance sector, time relatively loosely regulate new zealand. this mean currently little way formal statistic insurance sector. consequently we’re currently plan data collection industry design meet prudential broad statistical needs. this major job around 100 newly license insurers, wide range potential risk cover. the third driver behind expansion financial collection grow demand general public, international agencies, medium financial analyst year follow financial crisis. there’s grow appetite granularity detail financial statistic coverage new areas. for example, there’s demand detail financial product service offer banks, expand data financial prices, ability drill financial sub-sectors rather great extent before. and there’s much great interest understand capital market – area date hasn’t well capture statistic new zealand. meet demand statistic fast move world what statistic produce pose important challenge u main producer new zealand’s financial statistics. we need respond increase demand data data transparency also need manage cost, size complexity statistical function keep respondent burden acceptable level. decision proceed new collection must base clear business case. in many respect decision begin new financial data collection hallmark investment decision purchase long-lived asset. we engage extensively user try identify clearly benefit new data financial analysis policymaking future. some benefit associate new statistic accrue several year track good time series developed. choice make (or) collect collect implication quality financial analysis (or policymaking) year future. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in assess cost new collection also focus cost respondent might incur undertake significant internal system change enhancement order provide information. we obligation ensure cost incur “worth it”. keep structural change always challenge. the absence financial statistic particular part financial sector sometimes mask structural change completely, financial analyst way see them. more often, may aware shift pattern lack statistic properly capture them. this occur new type financial institution develop exist financial activity migrate one type institution another isn’t well represent statistics. structural change difficult detect involve new financial products, unregulated institution provision financial service offshore. structural change also arise due shift trade pattern new zealand rest world. since 1970s, bank publish weight average measure new zealand dollar relative currency major trade partners. we report variety real nominal measure trade weight exchange rate (twis) website. our flagship twi develop 15 year ago follow introduction euro base five currency (the u dollar, australian dollar, yen, euro british pound). since then, trade pattern change dramatically. in particular, china large single destination new zealand’s merchandise export exchange rate become flexible. some year ago develop broad 14 currency trade weight index, include chinese currency publish daily website alongside five currency index. however, currently undertake full review exchange rate measure publish, hope complete end year. even good statistical practices, extensive liaison users, many statistical collection ultimately become obsolete need overhauling. our standard statistical return bank system serve u well past 15 year we’re re-developing it. that reflect change bank sector period good understand monitor sector. for example, exist return provide little data banks’ income expense performance metrics. our hope new collection methodology serve u well next 15 years. during rapid change associate gfc, become clear traditional time lag availability financial sector data become long fully inform analysis. increasingly draw data banks’ internal management system could provide close real time. we’ve use experience try shorten time lag availability financial data. we’ve do area bank credit, liquidity, solvency debt issuance. timeliness essential good policy make time also need weigh alongside parameter data quality, respondent burden cost process data quickly. financial system complex, user – especially uninformed users– often difficulty interpret data. our challenge provide external user statistic metadata guidance around use statistic without overload much information. a seek re-develop many statistic next year develop new ones, need give equal attention support provide user new statistics. let conclude briefly say there magic good policy making. good decision depend good quality

worrell: what fair trade? text the fair trade commission’s 10th annual lecture dr delisle worrell, governor central bank barbados, bridgetown, 14 march 2014. * * * tonight i explore way economists, accountants, lawyer business people try arrive fair price things, price somehow “correct price”. to illustrate difficult is, i begin three controversial examples, two familiar you. my first example take book short story brilliant jamaican satirist anthony winkler. the story i quote length entitle “the man know price fish”. here story opens: baba black man past. he nothing ahead him; nothing behind him. he drop oblivion one day, grow montego bay island jamaica, grow manhood tremendous low jaw burgeon windpipe, jawbone large top jaw mastiff, jaw jut face disjointed, un-proportioned, stiff, mysteriously heavy, cap low level green teeth. he black man past future, forehead round indent like goat’s two thick hirsute arm drop waist walked. his eyes, people would squint look into, sink deep inside black face, shelter two fat lid drop thick cream, squiggled deep mystery blackness skin, black themselves, except shine sunlight, hide camouflage face. and, top this, past. he future; wife; children; nothing, except small black hull canoe, wire fishpots mangrove-stained line use catch fish with. every night row canoe set fishpots throw lines, every morning row giddy beach canoeful dead fish sell dead fish woman poor himself, would higgle furiously, insult fish, call jinal, mean intent rob them, paw corps fish, hold cynical comparison successful fishermen, accuse white mother, call rastafarian, walk away clutch contemptuously dead fish wrap newspaper, pay baba’s price. for impossible higgle down, past could either insult deprecated. it matter call mother, mother. he wife could say cuckold him; child get poor mark school; grandfather bubble senility street corners; cousin cat-o’nined stealing; aunt paint face tourist men nights; attachment make vulnerable abuse; one call shame over. and one ever higgle price fish. if say green-skinned, beak-teeth parrot-fish shill each, impossible shake him. the woman could call fish gangrened, could say slimy skin, could say fish, could say anything, would matter. she could higgle black face green parrot-fish, would matter. for baba decide fish worth shilling, god could alter price. the fish always sell shilling. 2 bi central bankers’ speech my second example familiar you: emera purchase barbados light power (bl&p) share couple year ago. you recall many people argue price offer low, base company’s earn criteria, share worth much more. those make argument wrong. there one correct price know economics, price trade take place, provide coercion seller buyer, misinformation quantity quality good service exchanged. the price offer emera share bl&p fair price, simply many u happy sell price. my third case study become cause celebre new international game bash banks. i refer london inter-bank borrow rate (libor) scandal. i sure believe know happened: bank borrow one interest rate, report different rate bankers’ association compile averages, prosecute new york attorney general. i tell story bear resemblance facts. much understand event base correspondence matter professor avinash persaud. in fact, problem libor emerge 2007 major bank london market stop borrow short term. it puzzle greatly no-one think ask problem arise libor recently 2007. the answer bank borrow temporarily short cash. every day bank report bankers’ association rate borrowed, association compute average, whole world use reference rate. you immediately see problem: nobody borrowing, nothing report, rate international finance anchor disappears. that case since 2007, commercial bank begin withdraw short term market funds. round 2005 british bank source much 1/3 fund borrow financial market short term, rather customers’ deposits. confidence value short term instrument use financial market begin evaporate 2005, large-scale failure sub-prime mortgage us. by 2007 short-term international fund dry up, include source fund london interbank market. libor cease exist, important reference rate international financial transaction disappeared. the market solution problem; market economics price transaction. since 2007 transaction substance major bank london market, therefore short term london interbank interest rate. it strange economist banker world fail acknowledge fact. notice i say libor cease exist. the crucial word “offer”; bank continue make token offer buy sell liquid funds, offer deliberately set unrealistic levels, reason obvious, think it. i like old cars, i version original mini, build british leyland company. i intention sell it, offer buy, i might quote outlandish price, rather say outright no. in similar fashion, bank london market motive quote unrealistic rates, since wish borrow interbank market. a difficulty arise calculation base offer rates, rather actual realise rates. i presume that, 2007 market dry up, rate publish british bankers’ association fact average rate borrow actually realise day. it may call offer rate, actually realise rate, call london inter-bank realise rate (librr). this rate disappear 2007. offer rate remained, many banks, none realistic, nobody want lend borrow. the librr, rate mattered, rate transaction actually take place, long exists. bi central bankers’ speech 3 these three example – price fish, emera transaction, disappearance london interbank realise rate – illustrate conundrum economist face search objective way determine fair trade. can trade fair seller adopt take leave attitude? can say trade unfair buyer seller happy price, even though others party trade say unfair, whether opportunity participate? what fair price, circumstance transaction actually take place? let say little economics try address questions. one approach adopt economics imagine everything world trade open auction, final auction price fair price. that model underlie famous demand supply cross everyone do elementary economics course encountered. the seller hope top dollar, buyer look bargain, auctioneer achieve price within acceptable range parties. except doesn’t. a know, often happen auction item fail reach reserve price, complete answer question fair value. the auction also objective. the result depend attends, held, skill auctioneer, many factors. similar item may fetch widely different price different auctions. an alternative economic approach determine fair value establish cost item traded, fair profit trader. this approach limit applicability practice, cost bring item market information seldom available party time trade, notion “normal” profit completely arbitrary. a hear public utility price ftc predecessor conduct past four decade would demonstrated, many discretionary factor go price decision single unambiguous cost produce anything. the problem especially intractable we’re talk services, airline transportation, hotel accommodation, legal services, bank educational services, cite random examples. economics make many attempt make either two basic approach – cost plus equilibrium demand supply – good match everyday transaction real world. this occasion go detail, fair summarise say convince model emerge would adequately provide fair value circumstance example began, many instance might cited. the important element determine value practice actually obtain elsewhere market, good service markets. whatever may sell buying, benchmark determine fair price price comparable product services. if buy sell 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house, feel satisfy settlement price value roughly similar home sell neighbourhood recent times. if open hairdressing business, price service basis others profession charging. the price bank beer, carib heineken identical, comparable. the rule price observe daily commerce cannot explain establish economic theory, even though theory may employ rationalize fact. that become clear whenever abrupt change price trade take place, circumstance nothing fundamental altered. the market property financial asset provide strike examples. with extraordinary change demand supply, little increase cost, market price time time spiral upwards, come crash eventually. that case house boom u europe mid-2000s. the rapid upward spiral price around 2003 cannot explain reference change demand supply housing; 4 bi central bankers’ speech price develop momentum own. naturally, price spiral come effect demand supply; property developer vie construct new homes, turn spur frenetic activity build supplies, furnishings, transport relate services. at time, price house soar beyond reach ordinary folk, many over-reached themselves, many push home buyers’ market. with supply go demand falling, twain could never meet, famous intersection point endure symbol market economics become unattainable. in circumstances, market never find fair price. another circumstance inadequacy economists’ pretension determine fair value may seen, market entirely new product services. if i mistaken, amazon.com, internet retailer, make loss first decade existence. yet share price keep rise throughout. for time amazon fund deficit additional capital. a turn out, amazon’s business model successful investor wait company’s long incubation period benefit appreciation value holdings, majority similar venture go belly up, result collapse dotcom bubble. a third illustration difference economic theory price fact determined, come world automobiles. the world’s lead manufacturers, toyota, general motors, volkswagen , sell model virtually identical market around world. but land price corrolla certain specification always vary country country, even else identical: factory made, ship costs, etc. there evidently single global market corrollas clear fair value corolla. nor determinate fair value currency country corrollas sell exchange other. the evidence around u failure understand drive prices, inability determine transaction fairly valued. the increase demand gold wealthy asians, others seek safe investments, admittedly large, nowhere near enough explain enormous spiral gold prices. violence political instability clearly element drive upward spiral oil prices, actual supply new source technology produce expect correction. the relative value dollar, yen euro owe much traders’ guess market next, little fundamental weakness strength policy economic performance country concerned. airline price complicate mystery u all, involve many factor project year future, objective measure operate cost, take replacement cost fully account, beyond practical reach. together colleague dr. winston moore, late friend colleague prof roland craigwell, i recently edit e-book record frequently much price actually change caribbean. the book, may freely download website publisher, caribbean centre money finance, analysis price change barbados, curacao, st lucia trinidad tobago, use data consumer price survey conduct every month compilation consumer price index. we find barbados 50 80 percent consumer price change every month, little 3 percent items, much 29 percent others. moreover, price move tandem price substitute similar items, price jump around, rise rapidly one month barely increase even fall follow month, phenomenon economist refer “low inflation persistence”. these feature might expect either two approach economist use determine value. the demand consumer item hardly fluctuate month month, supply, which, short term, take inventory already priced. bi central bankers’ speech 5 economist understandably reluctant accept fact fundamental contribution determine fair value limit practical application. most economist still believe supply price demand inform customer conflate produce fair price, spite evidence contrary. this place discus many study purport find support conventional view dissonance everyday experience, audience intricacies. whatever may merit, clear need way arrive fair value trade may apply everyday transactions. accountants, lawyer others attempt fill vacuum leave economists. however, definition come back use market mechanism. their guideline tantamount say trade accept agent side market may say fair trade. that tautology. we want know market price fair value: price i pay house day bottom fell market? i think not. but neither upset price auctioneer dispose former property lender repossessed. somewhere fair value lies, market cannot tell u is. be way determine fair trade? the answer question nuanced. in case today’s offer price much different price i pay last time i buy similar item, market work perfectly well. everyone accept price fair accord expectations, expectation form basis previous experience. the market work, know product everyone familiar, modest price variation. the market cannot provide fair estimate value product unknown, price vary sharply time. for new unfamiliar product reference price use point departure. typically price appear due course, small number dominant firm arrive understand among range value product offered. the problematic case occur abrupt change value market make trade, circumstance fair value needed, trade. the value may need account report purposes, example asset book market value, may need reference price transactions, case libor. unless official intervention point, unless market leader emerge sufficient power impose will, settle price may emerge. in latter case, price impose market dominance, trade value may consider fair. so, possible determine fair trade, product price fluctuate great deal? it possible arrive fair price, official intervention. leave devices, market continue flounder, agent buy sell side object price oblige trade unfair. these circumstance warrant aggressive credible official intervention, sufficient establish benchmark values, determine basis fully explained, consistent market understand fundamental drive particular market, well sensitive production cost market demand product. official intervention get bad rap recent policy discussion, often policy fully understood, line market sentiment, base economic assumption unrealistic. however, official intervention line economic fundamentals, fully explained, take full account intentions, motif resource market participants, may way attain fair value trade, circumstance establish norm prices, large departure norm. 6 bi central bankers’ speech i conclude apply approach example i cite essay. in case libor, view bank england need set benchmark rate, basis full analysis documentation underlie market liquidity situation use justify rate, invite bank use reference rate international transactions, choose so. no unofficial financial institution london wealth data analytical resource take inform view real cost liquidity, comparable bank england may deploy. the bankers’ association would free circulate offer rates, encourage so, rate may logically average guidance market interbank realise rate, rate money actually borrow lent. in contrast, i believe barbados authority correct stay determination settlement price bl&p shares. in case, market achieve price accept fair price majority shareholders, transaction execute clear transparent manner. not everyone agree pricing, nature market everyone agrees. the management asset price bubbles, include surge property prices, also justify aggressive intervention official institutions. the nature intervention determine individual circumstance, must large enough must pursue determination persistence, steam go inflationary surge. sound data, convince analysis effective communication key success. finally, man know price fish? for me, true example market function well market can, real world. a know, many thing nothing economics influence whether think transaction fair: whether counterparty someone trust, whether party transaction comparable bargain power, whether circumstance trade facilitate bargaining, whether party meet face face, many factors. small trader informal market often work satisfaction all, price item trade leave party undertake transaction. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ardian fullani: promote public debate around new economic growth model speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, meet agro-business bank sector representatives, lushnja, 13 march 2014. * * * dear guests, it great pleasure today discus one important sector albanian economy – agriculture. moreover, fact meet take place one area extraordinary potential development sector – i refer lushnja, entire fier district – significant. i think i surprise anyone, particularly engage daily entrepreneurship, i state recent years’ global economic crisis easily recognisable impact albanian economy well. the pace economic growth slow markedly, particularly past two years. accord late forecasts, albanian economy expect pick slightly next year due improve monetary financial conditions, fact trade neighbour are, similar albania, show first sign recovery several years. however, expect growth remain weak yet compare pre-crisis period. under circumstances, bank albania promote public debate around new economic growth model, even global financial crisis take hold. the central bank’s stance clear transparent public. we constantly state main source economic growth two decade transition reduce markedly, albanian economy need re-oriented towards new sector near future. the bank albania see agriculture – and, broad sense, entire agro-business – one main sector stand front re-orientation. my presence today, bank albania’s presence, serve confirmation commitment discuss new growth model primary role agriculture play it. * * * the albanian economy difficult year 2013. domestic demand, consequently economic growth, hit one low level history. the inflation rate hit low bind bank albania’s target tolerance band, budget deficit public debt increase considerably. the economic performance also accompany uncertainty surround external economy – albania’s trade partner particular –, also domestic economy consider 2013 election year. all contribute deceleration cautious behaviour economic agents. some domestic product indicator saw significant changes. worth mention construction sector, one top contributor economic growth 2000–08, shrink considerably past years. fortunately, albanian bank system remain solid well-capitalised. despite increase non-performing loan portfolio, bank sufficient capital address phenomenon. i would like elaborate latter point. the performance lend become focus attention policy-makers economic agents. the slow economic growth follow sharp deceleration lending. the reason quite understandable: one hand, business reduce demand loan due uncertainty relate sale products; 2 bi central bankers’ speech hand, bank pursue conservative approach lending, uncertain success different business plans. global theory practice suggest investment credit cycle progress line performance aggregate demand. in words, see stable recovery lend economic growth recover steady pace. however, already stated, believe room within albanian reality good performance lending. channel save profitable investment support business lend reason existence bank system. we constantly emphasize message, take concrete steps, low bank system’s finance cost provide incentive lend adequate regulatory environment. the bank albania expect situation improve next months, follow macro prudential measure take facilitate lending, banks’ clean balance sheet credit restructuring. i intend make random overview situation, show albanian economic reality moment present future challenges. it easily understandable weak economic growth call innovative solution new sectors. there room bank lend profitable project continue collect deposit maintain sound level financial ratios. it responsibility policy-makers help entrepreneurship, order get clear view right investment future. we state report new source growth originate competitive sector domestic and, even further, external market, trade balance keep show improvement 2013. export growth important long run offset moment weakness domestic demand, diversify source income. although economy benefit increase export mineral products, latter often export without sort process domestic market and, consequently, make little contribution improve productivity competitiveness albanian economy. bank albania’s research analysis show trade goods’ sector show increase productivity compare non-traded one. during 2000s, albanian economy focus non-traded sector like construction, hotel tourism, low share growth productivity. improve successfully face competition international market lie core albania’s new economic growth model. bank albania’s analysis suggest structural change contribute recover economy fast pace year ahead restore previous growth rates. the agriculture sector meet criterion lie core new model good economic sector. on hand, must recognise despite albania’s vast natural resources, manage fully utilise potential resource agriculture sector face competition international markets. the bank albania see great potential agriculture, which, number reasons, could materialise past year become beneficial future. unlike sectors, whose future benefit may limited, agriculture may represent important source second period dynamic economic growth. the albanian economy re-oriented towards sector whose capacity compete international market best signal development potential. the albanian economy net importer food product hint low level competitiveness represent one major future challenges. lushnja one main region albanian agriculture recovery economy start – hold meet today mere coincidence. bi central bankers’ speech 3 bank albania’s analysis pay increase attention development relate perspective sector. a speak, 47% albanian population around 49% labour force life rural area engage agriculture-related activities. accord late data 2012, around 24% land area use cultivate different agriculture cultures. however, despite vast resource concentrate agriculture important role play main source income considerable part population, 20% gross add value come sector. the low share economy proportion considerable number population involve agriculture indicate low productivity sector. the late data show export “food, beverage tobacco” account 6.2% total exports. livestock agricultural product share 0.78% 2.3% total exports, respectively, whereas agro-industry share 3%. fier district represent considerable part production factor agriculture. the late data show fier share 18% total agricultural land, thus classify district high share country. in 2012, 56 thousand farm register fier, high number country-level. this number account 16% total farm country, provide high share income sale agricultural products, 20% albania’s total income. relate livestock, fier, mainly lushnja district, considerable share livestock products. a district, fier produce 20% total livestock production (milk), whereas lushnja produce 9%. the set witness private effort entrepreneurship develop sector. in order process go ahead accelerate pace, policy-makers identify advantage problem sector encounters, order address quickly. in 2012, oxford university publish book focus economic growth south-eastern european region. this book elaborate number structural problem challenge face albanian economy, effort develop further. agriculture significant share analysis. some problem acknowledge frequently mentioned, important infrastructure-related issue include road, watering, draining, storage process systems. problem land ownership transformation function activity continue remain major obstacle country’s normal development, raise ongoing concern relate price use important factor production, on, normal function product market land-related factors. agriculture affect structural problem need long-term solution. average-size farm continue relatively small, thus restrict development growth average productivity, differently know “the economy scale”. there many reason behind this. we mention inheritance communist system separation land collapse. a state above, lack normal land market also due ownership problems, naturally play important role establish large farm and, consequently, competitive ones. these problem also affect agricultural sector-bank relationship lend activity home. the recent data show lend agricultural sector account 1.25% total lend businesses, average. it considerably low figure, raise concern, consider sector contribute one/fifth gross domestic product. i believe two reason drive bank system reluctant finance different project sector. first, risk classification categorisation credit agricultural sector commitment different activities. the lack formalisation, even matter regular maintenance information statistic 4 bi central bankers’ speech ownership, financial statistics, damage farmers’ credibility early step lending. i find room prudential intervention public institutions, condemn farmers, good prepare assist formalise business. in light this, bank albania past year initiate campaign improve financial education albanian people. the recent result questionnaire indicate albanian urban population show increase complete knowledge relate various financial problem encounter. but result rural area reveal education level remain considerably lower. second, albanian agricultural sector suffer lack information evaluation. a i note above, one reason bank hesitate increase lend lack complete information farm products. further, quality certification standard albanian product remain low. one main reason restrict high export and, consequently, high production, lack certification accordance high standard albanian agricultural products. this type certification prove elementary food security require european markets, also establish start point competition market. the presence standard reliable level would lead improvement market mechanisms, help bank lend proportion quality products. in framework concern face agricultural sector, bank albania increase interest microcredit institutions. in many develop countries, institution lead increase lending, particularly agricultural sector rural population general, thus try work formalisation evaluation problem i state above. i find successful experience microcredit institution country could import albania. consequently, policy-makers get close institution help grow, microcredit institution one great potential become important lender private agricultural enterprises, good intervention financial public institutions. let conclude say agricultural sector important source albania’s development. but solution problem face sector call great attention, all, modern way think concrete cooperation relate stakeholders. i, therefore, hope today’s meet contribute draw attention towards important sector push forward require structural reforms, would also encourage cooperation agriculture bank financial sector. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jeremy c stein: crowdfunding community development finance welcome remark mr jeremy c stein, member board governor federal reserve system, crowdfunding community development finance conference, washington dc, 24 march 2014. * * * good morning. let start welcome everyone federal reserve. today’s topic crowdfunding community development finance important topical one, i want thank help u think challenge opportunity present new technology relate raise fund local communities. this gather particularly timely two reasons. first, many communities, traditional resource community development shrinking, field actively seek identify new source funding. second, security exchange commission recently release propose rule jumpstart our business startup – job – act, likely influence environment crowdfunding general community development finance specifically. to extent people know crowdfunding all, may associate tech startup independent movie production, since press coverage often focus example areas. these story typically describe use, often success, crowdfunding, aspire inventor artist able tap internet raise money help make vision reality. the question today whether power crowd harness support community development, field widely benefit crowdfunding thus far. indeed, i say “power crowd,” worth note individual investment amount may small, total amount fund raise source large. although lack reliable data current size crowdfunding, source indicate it’s multibillion-dollar industry, 1 million separate offer year, field grow rapidly.1 while crowdfunding may well know community development context, are, fact, exist model crowdfunding community development learn from. i understand several exist model discuss panel late morning. one local example fundrise, investment platform commercial real estate give individual opportunity invest directly neighborhood businesses. fundrise start h street corridor d.c., complete 18 real estate deal total $10 million. for example, platform attract 361 people invest total $350,000 toward redevelopment 906 h street, n.e. currently vacant building, property, locate quickly revitalize h street corridor, fund necessary renovate property transform restaurant retail space. a second example calvert foundation’s community investment note. this interest one calvert foundation essentially something akin crowdfunding community development internet platform become available. a may know, calvert foundation certify community development financial institution (cdfi) establish 1988 501(c)3 calvert investment find strong interest among client invest directly underserved communities. since 1995, 13,000 people invest notes, provide financial return economically empower communities.2 accord calvert foundation, 1 massolution, “2013cf: the crowdfunding industry report”. 2 calvert foundation. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 13,000 individual investment collectively help create 430,000 job low-income individuals, build rehabilitate 17,000 affordable homes, finance close 26,000 nonprofit facility social enterprises.3 both fundrise calvert foundation example hint potential scale crowdfunding community development. many may wondering, “why feed interest topic?” first, fundamental level, it’s important u keep finger pulse financial innovation change dynamic financial service industry – even part industry direct regulatory role. we know financial innovation offer opportunity pitfalls; carefully even-handedly study new product service early stage lifecycle, hope good understand potential benefits, well risk adverse impact household communities. also, convene like today’s event share promise practices, federal reserve system longstanding history support local regional community economic development effort contribute economic growth employment. to extent crowdfunding potential bring new capital low- moderate-income communities, want involve help learn process along. a i mention earlier, many people associate crowdfunding tech startup art initiatives. however, may way new form fundraise adapt community development investing. give wide open issue are, today’s event work meet discussion groups. we appreciate willingness share time us, look forward benefit insights. thank you. 3 calvert foundation (pdf). bi central bankers’ speech 1 kikuo iwata: quantitative qualitative monetary ease japan’s recent economic financial development speech mr kikuo iwata, deputy governor bank japan, international centre study east asian development (icsead), kitakyushu, 24 march 2014. * * * accompany chart find end speech. introduction i express thank large audience gather kitakyushu regions, also give opportunity speak front you. about year ago, i appoint deputy governor bank japan, march 20, 2013. in 40 year time, i teach college study economist within academia, latter half year i consistently emphasize big challenge japan’s economy overcome deflation early possible time, role monetary policy end critical. on april 4, 2013, shortly current governor deputy governors, include myself, assume duties, bank japan decide introduce unprecedented scale accommodative monetary policy call quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe), far, pursue policy scheduled. today, i explain aim qqe light recent development japan’s economy. to understand qqe, necessary gain understand price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) bank aim – or, words, bank’s inflation target policy – think behind policy. let start point (chart 1). i. price stability target a. why deflation problematic? i mention early overcome deflation early possible time big challenge japan’s economy. while deflation “a persistent decline prices”, often seem use refer “a situation economy vicious cycle price decline recession” – is, mean “deflationary recession”. in term sentiment toward spend everyday life, might often think decline price favorable thing. a price various good service decline, get price. what problem (chart 2)? decline aggregate demand due defer spend at outset, need acknowledge difference price general individual good services. a former, indicator cpi domestic corporate good price index. price stability bank aim define cpi. the cpi show change total amount expenditure require purchase equivalent good service purchase household give time, call “reference period”. the cpi calculate give value 100 reference period compare price observation period reference period. inflation define situation 2 bi central bankers’ speech cpi persistently rises; contrary, deflation define situation cpi keep falling. a price rise fall individual item vegetable television set constitute either inflation deflation. keep mind, let explain consequence persistent decline general price – rather price decline individual good service – look like. to sure, decline price effect raise real income. however, persistent decline price mean wait, good service get price. in words, mean value cash deposit increase hold them. thus, firm household hoard money much possible defer action associate spending, consumption investment. put jargon economics, aggregate demand decline. that problem. if aggregate demand decline sale good service decrease, firm reduce production level consistent decline sales. a corporate profit decline employee income fall accordingly, people’s consumption house investment – well firms’ business fix investment – stagnate. namely, aggregate demand decline, induce decline price levels. thus, economy trap vicious cycle price decline recession (chart 3). increase effective debt burden in addition, decline price mean value money good service increase, borrow money, value money repay future increase. thus, represent increase effective debt burden. it might easy understand consider case mortgage. a amount repay fix wage real estate price decline due deflation, feel debt service burden gradually increase. the effective burden debt already become heavy and, even future borrowings, somewhat nominal interest rate suggest. therefore, firm household become cautious borrow money. in addition, household firm already borrow try repay debt soon possible, even restrain consumption investment. thus, house investment firms’ business fix investment stagnate aggregate demand become compressed, thereby result vicious cycle recession price decline (chart 3). b. why stable moderate inflation desirable? by contrast, environment stable moderate inflation, example, case cpi rise 2 percent year-on-year, mechanism reversal i explain deflation work (chart 4). increase aggregate demand due rejuvenate spend namely, envisage price rise, many might wish purchase thing buy much possible price rise. a front-loaded increase demand ahead consumption tax hike next month often refer days, similar mentality work consistent manner. of course, like perishables, number good cannot purchase advance, service cannot bring forward. here, i talk trend whole. bi central bankers’ speech 3 unlike consumption tax hike, one-off event alter price certain point time, price level gradually rise. therefore, incentive bring spend forward work powerfully case front-loaded increase demand ahead tax hike, rather slowly constantly. a spend term consumption investment stimulate due future price outlook, aggregate demand economy whole increase. sale good service rise firm expand production level consistent increase sales. a corporate profit improve employee income increases, consumption house investment, well firms’ activity – include business fix investment – become rejuvenated. in words, aggregate demand increase price rise accordingly. a virtuous cycle buoyant economy inflation generate (chart 4). cost rapid inflation a matter course, i mind stable moderate inflation, unexpected rapid inflation so-called hyperinflation. a well aware of, hyperinflation last thing want. if rise wage pension cannot keep rapid inflation, real income decline real value cash deposit save also decline rapidly. through reduce effective debt service burden past debt, unexpected income transfer, speak, creditor debtor occur, creditor lose debtor gain. by contrast, case wish newly borrow money, lender require high interest rate preparation future high inflation, make fund-raise difficult. if rapid inflation go on, need frequently revise price good services. a become ever difficult envisage future manufacture cost sell prices, firm able even prepare production plans. the economy tumble turmoil. therefore, bank aim stable moderate inflation continues, mean generate hyperinflation (chart 4). c. advantage inflation target policy in order achieve stable moderate inflation, kind policy desirable? one answer policy framework call inflation targeting. the bank pursue monetary ease price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi. that understand typical example inflation target policy (chart 5). enhance policy credibility predictability inflation target policy number advantages. to begin with, policy contain specific numerical target future inflation rate, judge objectively whether target met. through enhance transparency, central bank’s obligation accountable regard policy judgment status achieve target become crucial. that create situation credibility monetary policy likely enhanced. a become easy forecast price levels, various economic entity conduct economic activity basis forecasts. the predictability future price reinforce credibility monetary policy become enhance (chart 5). 4 bi central bankers’ speech prevent hyperinflation about bank’s policy, demonstrate concern time come bank stop monetary easing, might difficult due pressure financial market government, eventually lead induce hyperinflation. the adoption inflation target also effective concern. the reason inflation target policy device hold specific numerical target future inflation rate make commitment achieve situation generate neither inflation target rate deflation. though inflation target policy often discuss japan measure overcome deflation, originally adopt country like new zealand 1980s suffer high inflation. i would like understand that, case economy overheat inflation rate rise well 2 percent price stability target, bank already make commitment take appropriate measure line framework inflation target policy. i stress that, line mission stipulate bank japan act, bank conduct monetary policy base judgment responsibility facilitate communication government (chart 5). ii. aim qqe current situation japan’s economy so far, i explain price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi; namely, so-called inflation target policy think behind that. now, i talk content effect qqe, introduce policy achieve 2 percent price stability target, also take account current state japan’s economy. a. what qqe? the qqe consist two pillar (chart 6). the first pillar commitment bank achieve price stability target 2 percent soon possible. the bank make clear commitment “will achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time, time horizon two years”. the second pillar engage action embody commitment specify first pillar. a exemplify phrase “quantitative qualitative monetary easing”, action increase “quantity” bank’s balance sheet change “quality” asset purchases. an increase quantity require massively increase amount money bank directly supply financial system – call “the monetary base” – annual pace 60–70 trillion yen. measure increase monetary base mainly purchase japanese government bond (jgbs), bank purchase jgbs outstanding amount increase annual pace 50 trillion yen. a change quality require purchase asset high risk profile. among jgbs, bank start purchase long remain maturities. in addition, increase amount purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) order reduce risk premium assets. bi central bankers’ speech 5 when decide introduce qqe last april, use expression “a new phase monetary ease term quantity quality”. the bank pursue monetary ease exactly manner, unprecedented scale. b. work expect real interest rate while qqe consist two pillars, far transmission channel concerned, important factor term effect economy low expect real interest rates. the follow explanation become somewhat complicated, please bear (chart 7). expect real interest rate obtain subtract expect rate inflation nominal interest rate actually observe financial market counter. while nominal rate – is, objective interest rate – visible, expect real interest rate people forecast subjectively, base respective price projections, thus various rate exist person-by-person basis. view borrowers’ side, real interest rate equivalent borrowers’ subjective expectation regard real cost borrowing, take account price changes, borrow money certain nominal interest rate. consequently, low expect real interest rate economic entity, subdue entity expect real cost borrow be. the qqe effect reduce nominal interest rate effect lift economic entity’s inflation expectations, exert downward pressure expect real interest rates, derive subtract expect rate inflation nominal rate (chart 8). c. spillover effect real economy if many economic entity low expect real interest rates, stimulate demand real economy number ways. for example, real interest rate decline, investment cash, deposits, fixed-income security (excluding inflation-indexed bonds) become le attractive; thus, people shift portfolio financial asset equity tangible asset land housing, foreign currency-denominated asset high returns. the rise equity price appreciation foreign currency stimulate private consumption wealth effect (charts 9 10). in addition decline expect real interest rates, factor – include increase consumption improvement export condition due depreciation yen – encourage firm aggressive business fix investment (charts 11 12). accord business outlook survey, conduct jointly cabinet office ministry finance, index business condition large enterprise decline minus 9.8 april–june quarter expect rise plus 8.3 july–september quarter. that small medium-sized enterprise follow le pattern large enterprise (chart 13). while may partly due statistical peculiarities, suggest firm anticipate subsequent decline spend consumption tax hike april 2014 result front-loaded increase spend relatively short-lived. if shortage aggregate demand economy whole eliminate increase demand private consumption investment, price level naturally rise. in fact, recent development cpi show japan’s economy follow path toward overcome deflation expect (chart 14). 6 bi central bankers’ speech production increase demand expands, thus employment condition also improve. that suddenly result rise wage bonuses, tend first lead increase number employees, mainly non-regular employees. nevertheless, due expansion corporate profit tightness labor market, income employee receive gradually increase (chart 15). if employee income whole increase manner, elevate consumption households, include benefit wealth effect rise stock price appreciation foreign currencies. an increase corporate profit increase

concern future whole, thereby exert positive effect economy. in manner, overcome deflation start qqe, virtuous cycle economy expect continue (chart 16). d. outlook fiscal 2015 a outlook, japan’s economy expect continue moderate recovery trend, support improvement employment income situation, expect affect front-loaded increase subsequent decline demand prior consumption tax hike. a prices, year-on-year rate increase cpi, exclude direct effect consumption tax hike, likely around 1¼ percent time. after that, expect gradually return rise trend likely reach around 2 percent price stability target toward end fiscal 2014 fiscal 2015 (chart 17). conclude remark let conclude remark touch economy kitakyushu (chart 18). kitakyushu’s economy long stagnant lehman shock, gradually improve region’s main force – manufacture sector – partly back correction yen’s appreciation. recently, improvement start spread large medium- small-sized firms, regional economy recover moderately whole. historically, kitakyushu prosper since meiji period, center chikuho coalfield moji port, utilize location advantage, government-managed steelworks start operation yahata 1901. for reference, kitakyushu branch bank japan mark 120th anniversary last year, precursor branch – namely, saibu branch – establish around time, 1893. kitakyushu represent japan’s modernization, despite number difficulties, thrive subsequently improve evolving. a result many year tremendous efforts, kitakyushu establish one prominent industrial area japan – electrical machinery automobile industry, addition steel industry – well base international trade asian countries. other industrial front, kitakyushu city become one world’s environmental cities, recently select “model city green growth” organisation economic co-operation development (oecd), “future city” japanese government. in addition, government decide recommend “local industrial heritage site meiji period”, include yahata steelworks-related facility kitakyushu, unite nation educational, scientific, cultural organization bi central bankers’ speech 7 (unesco) candidate world heritage site fiscal year. this region start grab spotlight industrial tourism. a global competition intensify year ahead, path kitakyushu follow might smooth one. however, region strong industrial base, include manufacture technology human resources, establish many years. this region also well-developed traffic distribution systems, 24-hour airport start point east kyushu highway extend miyazaki city schedule open fiscal 2014. while fully utilize strengths, i strongly believe kitakyushu’s economy grow develop future. thank you. 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11

efficient retail payment – key strengthen competitiveness growth potential eu speech mr yves mersch, member executive board european central bank, ecb/bank italy workshop “interchange fees”, rome, 24 march 2014. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure today contribute discussion retail payment euro area europe broadly. but first all, i would like thank banca d’italia organise workshop jointly ecb, host beautiful setting. i also grateful fabio panetta open event morning. payment system payment schemes, like city, don’t get build day. good thing take time. payment network industry, rely cooperation bank payment service provider – cooperation call resolve stamina. today, i would like talk retail payment ecb’s eurosystem’s role payments, touch current development future challenges. i’d also like say word interchange fees, issue workshop. why retail payment important? payment oil wheel single market. they facilitate “four freedoms”– free movement people, goods, service capital. without efficient electronic payment system, union would able develop grow years. and neither forget contribution make large-value retail payment system europe’s economy height crisis aftermath. they help europe’s economy run smoothly. some may still remember time wage pay cash, inconvenience obtain foreign currency trip abroad, complexity cross-border payments, mention plan disrupt unforeseen exchange rate movements. you may even remember interbank position clear settle physical meet central bank end business day. efficient, robust, standardise integrate retail payment payment system essential make trade easier, increase competition innovation, foster financial integration complete single currency project. they play key part strengthen competitiveness growth potential european union. in 2012 ecb publish study, conduct 13 eu central banks, social private cost different retail payment instruments.1 the study show social cost retail payment instrument substantial amount €45 billion, i.e. 0.96% gdp participate eu countries.2.so, term costs, retail payment certainly matter. an ecb study 2009 show country develop retail payment service bank perform good – term account ratio profit 1 see schmiedel h., kostova g. ruttenberg w., “the social private cost retail payment instrument – a european perspective”, occasional paper series, no 137, ecb, frankfurt main, september 2012. the paper available https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp137.pdf. 2 denmark, estonia, finland, greece, hungary, ireland, italy, latvia, netherlands, portugal, romania, spain sweden. 2 bi central bankers’ speech cost efficiency.3 retail payment transaction technology also improve bank performance, evidence show heterogeneity retail payment instrument associate enhance bank performance. similarly, high usage electronic retail payment instrument seem stimulate bank business. there also evidence show retail payment service generate stable revenue bank decrease risk. so, also term bank performance, retail payment matter. in context, discussion “ring-fencing” retail bank activity relevant. retail bank take deposits, offer credit real economy provide payment service firm households. these three function key public services. to sum up, retail payment important, maybe important people often think. i convince even great efficiency payment system would advance development internal market. let turn role ecb respective national central banks. the central banks’ role one basic task european system central bank promote smooth operation payment systems. the integration harmonisation retail payment system within euro area therefore vital concern us. progress field achieve gradually. it take time sometimes difficult recognise. however, look back euro introduced, see make considerable progress. back 2000 cross-border credit transfer process via correspondent bank arrangements, base bilateral relationship financial institutions. to provide adequate geographical coverage, many bilateral arrangement needed. it system considerably le efficient fully automate interbank fund transfer system use national payment member states. these arrangement might also explain high charge cross-border payment time. the european commission’s report “bank charge europe”,4 publish april 2000, state average total cost cross-border credit transfer €17.10 €100 transfer. moreover, cross-border credit transfer take average nearly 3½ days. since introduction euro, ecb eurosystem central bank work close cooperation commission payment industry establish single euro payment area (sepa). the ecb act catalyst here, provide analytical work produce progress reports, together national central banks, well organise conference event bring market participant together. it also work closely eu legislators, support harmonise legal framework retail payments. it result concrete achievements: • pan-european scheme basic retail payments, i.e. sepa credit transfer direct debit, introduce payment industry january 2008 november 2009 respectively. • cost cross-border payment national payments, 3 see hasan i., schmiedel h. liang s., “return retail bank payments”, work paper series, no 1135, ecb, frankfurt main, december 2009. the paper available http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1135.pdf. 4 see http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_consumer/library/surveys/sur14_en.pdf. bi central bankers’ speech 3 • the execution time credit transfer take one bank day (d+1) trend clearly towards day – even real-time – settlement retail payment transactions. the ecb also strong advocate sepa end date regulation specify 1 february 2014 end date migration sepa credit transfer direct debit. despite commission’s late amendment allow bank process old payment format 1 august year, member state succeed migrate original deadline 1 february 2014. the recent migration figure february 2014 show 93.9% euro area credit transfers, 80.3% euro area direct debit process sepa format. current developments, future challenge a i say earlier, good thing take time. that apply european union creation integrate market retail payments. the successful migration sepa credit transfer direct debit mark end effort retail payments, lay foundation new innovative payments, integration. i wish take opportunity mention area would like see integration harmonisation. first all, cards. card alternative cash point sale. 12 year introduction euro banknote coins, still don’t integrate european market card payments. that eurosystem currently prepare report entitle “card payment europe – renew focus ‘sepa cards’”. it emphasise need harmonise principles, business practice rules, well technical standard relate card payments. we would also like see payment become faster. although d+1 requirement credit transfer – part payment service directive – come effect 2012, increase number merchant want payment confirmation provide good services, person-to-person payment via mobile phone seem great potential. it become clear day market want increasingly fast retail payment execution. such service already available member states, need widely available across europe. even focus euro area rest europe, however also aim integration broad context, bring forward sepa standard global level input others. sepa base iso standard financial service message clear business rules.5 the use global standard rule retail payment worldwide would facilitate interlink payment system increase efficiency involved. think potential remittance migrant workers. security, unsurprisingly, continue critical topic. advance technology mean safety security retail payment remain vital interest market participant authority alike. the secure pay forum publish recommendation improve security internet payment january 2013, recently publish “public note security payment account access services”.6. the creation euro retail payment board (erpb) ecb’s govern council another step take eurosystem foster integrated, innovative competitive market retail payment euro eu. the erpb bring together representative supply demand side identify strategic issue work priorities, 5 see “iso 20022 financial service – universal financial industry message scheme”. 6 see http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/pubnote201403securitypaymentaccountaccessservicesen.pdf. 4 bi central bankers’ speech include business practices, requirement standards, ensure addressed. the commission participate observer. similar “social dialogue” body already set successfully operate several member states. the move establish erpb well receive first meet schedule 16 may. finally, i would like say word virtual currency schemes. bitcoin perhaps notable topical these, certainly long one. many medium commentator wonder impact currency retail payment even central banks. i agree virtual currency scheme interest phenomenon ignore dismissed. the ecb one first public authority see potential risk publish detail analysis 2012.7 despite overall rise value bitcoin since publication report medium attention getting, conclusion still seem valid, namely, currency (at least yet) economically important. in europe, virtual currency pose risk price stability financial stability, pose risk users. however, user risk relate speculative investment consumer protection, necessarily payments. nevertheless, closely follow development keep touch authorities. all all, live time rapid change. it may well hold store novel even unconventional challenge create build block financial integration. interchange fee let conclude touch interchange fees, topic today’s workshop. the fee turn rather controversial issue, europe also worldwide. the eurosystem’s position neutral interchange fees. but clarity need bank payment service provider decide future investments. that clarity provide commission’s proposal interchange fee regulation, much welcome. even cap interchange fees, bank seize opportunity “sepa cards” offers. the growth potential card point sale still substantial europe, especially countries. the favourable outlook card transaction business case itself, even scheme operate low interchange fee. build european union slow laborious ultimately reward process. the migration sepa credit transfer direct debit mark completion another element construction, come. i sure today’s workshop give u new insight help pave way design construction work, value people continent. finally, word thank colleague banca d’italia warm welcome hospitality. and, course, thank attend workshop today. unfortunately, i soon leave frankfurt, let wish “buon appetito” fruitful afternoon session. 7 see http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf. bi central bankers’ speech 1 takahide kiuchi: recent development economic activity, price monetary policy speech mr takahide kiuchi, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, shiga, 19 march 2014. * * * i. economic development a. overseas economy i would like start speech look overseas economies. overseas economy – mainly advance economy – start recover, although performance remain lackluster part expect recover moderately. look projection global economic growth recently release international monetary fund (imf), growth 2014 project around 3.7 percent, mainly due rise growth rate advance economies. look respective major country regions, u.s. economy continue recover moderately. a downtrend observe economic indicator around turn year, likely largely attributable temporary factor winter snowstorms. a outlook, pace economic recovery expect gradually rise, lead domestic demand particular, mainly fiscal drag continue fade accommodative financial condition project maintained. the european economy pick emerge recession 2013. private consumption pick moderately, consumer sentiment continue improve, although employment income situation remain severe. business fix investment bottom out. although attention still need pay point various adjustment pressures, include european debt problem, economy likely continue pick up, mainly due pick-up domestic demand reflect improvement business household sentiment. meanwhile, chinese economy continue see stable somewhat low growth before. a outlook, although structural reform chinese government respond problem excess production capacity may exert downward pressure domestic demand, economy expect maintain stable growth government likely continue pay consideration economic activity well employment situation, environment surround export improve. on hand, emerge economy china commodity-exporting economy continue lack momentum. in economy face structural problems, economic activity notably weak financial market show unstable movement since 2013. in india, economy remain state deceleration, particularly domestic demand. growth momentum asean country remain weak. under circumstances, i pay attention particularly development emerge commodity-exporting economies, prospect european debt problem, pace recovery u.s. economy risk outlook overseas economies. b. current state outlook japan’s economic activity price japan’s economy continue recover moderately. accord second preliminary estimate real gdp growth rate october-december quarter 2013 release march 10, 2014, register 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter basis 0.7 percent annualized quarter-on-quarter basis, economy continue increase pace consider potential four consecutive quarters. look 2 bi central bankers’ speech component, export – register small increase 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter basis – likely level le recently, consider development real export january 2014. business fix investment increase three consecutive quarter quarter-on-quarter basis, pick-up become evident corporate profit improved. while front-loaded increase demand prior consumption tax hike april 2014 recently observed, private consumption remain resilient trend improvement employment income situation. with regard outlook, japan’s economy expect continue moderate recovery trend, albeit fluctuation cause consumption tax hike. export expect increase moderately, mainly background recovery overseas economies. public investment expect trend upward time become le flat high level. business fix investment project follow moderate increase trend. private consumption house investment, albeit fluctuation cause consumption tax hike, expect remain resilient trend, support mainly improvement employment income situation. meanwhile, price rise markedly past year. the year-on-year rate increase consumer price index (cpi, item le fresh food, hereafter) around 1–1/4 percent three consecutive month january 2014 – first time since november 2008 exceed 1.0 percent. on basis exclude food energy, also register high growth 0.7 percent – high level since august 1998 – two consecutive month january 2014. regard outlook, year-on-year rate increase cpi, exclude direct effect consumption tax hike, likely around 1–1/4 percent time. accord bank japan’s interim assessment release january 2014 october 2013 outlook economic activity price (hereafter outlook report), median policy board members’ forecast real gdp growth rate 2.7 percent fiscal 2013, 1.4 percent fiscal 2014, 1.5 percent fiscal 2015. the median forecast year-on-year rate increase cpi, exclude direct effect consumption tax hikes, 0.7 percent fiscal 2013, 1.3 percent fiscal 2014, 1.9 percent fiscal 2015. ii. risk outlook economic activity price although upside downside risk bank’s aforementioned baseline scenario regard economic activity price japan, i personally pay close attention downside risks. the consumption tax hike unlikely affect ongoing moderate recovery trend, although may temporarily cause great fluctuation economic activity. however, i pay particular attention development export consumption downside risk economy. in addition, reveal in, example, minute monetary policy meet (mpms), i personally hold cautious view outlook price compare forecast baseline scenario. let share consideration regard outlook you. a. development export export continue slightly lack momentum. this reflect external demand factor factors, i consider export likely continue lack momentum time. regard external demand factors, must note asian economy japan’s major export destination still lack momentum. for example, look development chinese economy since begin 2014, purchase managers’ index (pmi) manufacture activity february mark low level since middle 2013, and, parallel progress implementation measure cope structural problems, sign sluggishness pace increase fix asset investment. in addition, bi central bankers’ speech 3 uncertainty regard outlook issue shadow banking, depend outcome this, could become additional downside risk chinese economy. there also high uncertainty regard emerge commodity-exporting economy face structural problems. in economies, buildup imbalance progressed, accumulation private-sector debt, due excessive fiscal monetary policy measure follow lehman shock increase capital inflow economy base excessive expectation economic growth. i think economy currently undergo adjustment process. therefore, financial market economy likely become unstable market participant become concern possibility reversal global flow fund might occur process normalization u.s. monetary policy, instability may become additional downside risk emerge economies. in addition, attention need pay development ukraine, although difficult predict possible effect present. on hand, u.s. economy, adjustment house market household debt progressed. however, prolong adjustment may bring increase number unemployed difficulty find new job, also number people problem participate return labor force, lead new structural problem persist economic slack decline growth rate labor productivity. take account possibilities, i pay particular attention pace recovery u.s. economy. next, i would like point two possible factor contribute lack momentum japan’s exports, aforementioned external demand factors. the first structural factor – include shift japanese firms’ production site overseas accompany increase local procurement part japanese manufacturer – may work. accord recent research conduct cabinet office, manufacturer expect continue increase ratio overseas production. this suggest firm conscious low growth rate domestic demand relative external demand, rather change foreign exchange rates. the second factor japanese firm may take cautious stance toward low foreign currency-denominated contract price export goods. this could suggest firm currently strong tendency enjoy temporary increase profit stem rise price export good denominate yen, rather expand overseas market low foreign currency-denominated contract prices. i continue pay attention two factor affect japan’s exports. b. development consumption private consumption remain resilient front-loaded increase demand prior consumption tax hike also observe recently. however, sign consumer sentiment might changing. for example, (1) consumer confidence index deteriorate february 2014 low level two year five month (2) overall diffusion index future economic condition economy watcher survey drop february low level two year ten months, mainly due drop index household activity. in particular, i think necessary carefully monitor whether momentum private consumption eventually weaken current decline trend real wage continues. let elaborate point. at present, number employee increase real wage decrease, thus real compensation employee total moderate increase trend. however, large gap year-on-year growth real compensation employee total real private consumption: october-december quarter 2013, former show moderate increase 0.6 percent, latter increase 2.3 percent. there seem fairly strong expectation among public since 2013 that, inflation rate rose, rate wage increase would eventually reach level. however, must note that, public increasingly 4 bi central bankers’ speech expect rate wage increase remain inflation rate protract period, could make consumer sentiment cautious, thereby negatively affect public’s consumption behavior. in relation point, let turn development wages. schedule wages, base salaries, remain decline trend, support improvement corporate profit supply demand condition labor market, likely stop decline point upcoming spring wage negotiations. however, many firm seem remain cautious significantly increase level monthly salary – so-called base salary – due concern future increase fix costs, will use improve profit reward employee rise lump-sum payments. this stance firm consistent fact remain cautious increase number regular employees. the active job openings-to-applicants ratio, show supply demand condition labor market, exceed 1.00, reach 1.04 january. however, supply demand condition labor market regular employee seem tight, therefore seem difficult expect significant increase base salaries, subject discussion wage negotiations. consider (1) wage increase could regular annual raise rise lump-sum payments, although base salary could rise certain level, (2) proportion non-regular employee – whose wage discuss wage negotiation – total employment increasing, (3) rate wage increase small firm public sector likely relatively low, rate overall wage increase could remain moderate despite temporary positive effect expect termination measure reduce salary government employee secure fund reconstruction work great east japan earthquake. if turn case, rate nominal wage increase consequently fall rate increase cpi exclude effect consumption tax hike, consumer might increasingly expect decrease real wage protracted. development wage therefore require careful monitoring. c. outlook price the bank’s outlook private sector’s expectation price fiscal 2013 converging, still wide gap fiscal 2014 2015. a outlook prices, i take cautious view forecast bank’s baseline scenario, evident fact i formulate proposal change expression regard outlook price october 2013 outlook report, although defeat majority vote mpm. let explain background view. so far, bank’s quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) produce positive effect japan’s economy stimulate domestic demand support positive development economic activity. this contribute degree price rise improvement output gap. i personally take view, however, rise inflation rate date cause mainly change foreign exchange rates, trend pace price rise moderate effect development foreign exchange rate eliminated. in addition, rise medium- long-term inflation expectation remain moderate, explain later, rate wage increase may remain moderate time being. therefore, i take cautious view regard outlook prices. the rate inflation rise markedly within short period since 2013, bank’s price stability target aim create virtuous cycle wage price increase balance manner upturn economic activity, maintain stably. for happen, necessary price rise pace consistent increase growth potential economy. give this, i consider price stability target 2 percent appropriate regard medium- long-term target. i elaborate point late i explain proposal regard conduct monetary policy. bi central bankers’ speech 5 let add that, firms’ response consumption tax hike, likely variation among different industry sale strategies, term aspect degree pas high cost sale price time price revisions. the price trend therefore may remain difficult ass while. bear mind, i would like monitor development price closely. iii. conduct monetary policy the bank introduce qqe mpm hold april 3 4, 2013, view achieve price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi early possible time, time horizon two years. under new framework monetary policy, bank conduct money market operation monetary base increase annual pace 60–70 trillion yen. in order realize this, bank purchase japanese government bond (jgbs) amount outstanding increase annual pace 50 trillion yen. in addition, view low risk premia asset prices, bank purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) amount outstanding increase annual pace 1 trillion yen 30 billion yen, respectively. in aim achieve price stability target 2 percent, bank commit continue qqe long necessary maintain target stable manner. almost one year pass since introduction qqe. so far, exert positive effect japan’s economy positive influence expectation financial market household firms. since introduction policy, however, support concrete measure qqe, i continue propose change expression statement monetary policy regard time frame achieve 2 percent price stability target continue qqe, although proposal repeatedly defeat majority vote mpms. let explain background proposal, well personal view point discussion regard conduct monetary policy. a. issue consider regard price stability target prior introduction qqe, bank introduce price stability target 2 percent mpm hold january 2013. first all, i would like explain think behind price stability target two perspectives. first, bank conduct monetary policy base principle policy shall aim “achieving price stability, thereby contribute sound development national economy.” in line principle, “price stability” define “a state various economic entity include household firm may make decision regard economic activity consumption investment without concern fluctuation general price level.” it could say that, realize price stability, bank responsible create medium long term environment economy achieve sustainable growth growth potential realize maximum extent. in words, i think achieve price stability play role intermediate objective, yardstick, achieve ultimate goal contribute sound development national economy. in view, therefore, important thing conduct monetary policy pay attention solely monthly movement price indices, give due consideration wide range development overall economy achieve price stability, thereby achieve ultimate goal. second, price stability target 2 percent aim maintain 2 percent inflation rate stable manner. this price stability consistent sustainable growth economy must sustainable medium long term. therefore, order achieve price stability target 2 percent, temporary achievement 2 percent observe inflation rate sufficient – necessary rate stabilize level. in order 6 bi central bankers’ speech achieve this, households, firms, financial market need act assumption price increase 2 percent; words, medium- long-term inflation expectation 2 percent. so far, medium- long-term inflation expectation mostly positive territory trend, actual price long decline trend. consequently, price stability achieved, thus economy undesirable situation. this background become necessary introduce qqe. however, i think medium- long-term inflation expectation japan mainly determine supply side factor potential growth rate labor productivity growth rate, rather level bank’s price stability target supply demand balance goods, services, labor markets. at least now, i think 2 percent target well level consistent economy’s growth potential. for example, although observe inflation rate rise markedly, recent various indicator suggest rise medium- long-term inflation expectations, five ten year ahead, remain moderate. therefore, achieve price stability target 2 percent, i think necessary wide range economic entity make use benign economic financial environment bring qqe make continuous effort strengthen economy’s growth potential. if medium- long-term inflation expectation rise result efforts, could become appropriate set target level inflation 2 percent, although i think require considerable time. due reason i explain far, i continue propose mpms restrict time frame achieve 2 percent price stability target two years, aim achieve medium long term. moreover, i think room future review level price stability target currently set 2 percent, consider future change growth potential medium- long-term inflation expectations. b. issue consider regard qqe when introduction qqe decide april 2013, i support concrete measure qqe i consider would open significant opportunity term three aspects. first, measure would provide opportunity demand side create virtuous cycle stimulate economy. second, would offer opportunity supply side encourage government’s growth strategy contribute strengthen growth potential japan’s economy fiscal consolidation, well positive action firm households. and third, measure would afford opportunity return conventional interest rate policy future, zero interest rate produce positive effect improvement economic price conditions. on hand, qqe entail considerable potential risks, view; example, normalization measure easy process, speculation bank engage finance fiscal deficit could increase. one cannot rule possibility that, current policy commitment, financial market increasingly view achieve 2 percent price stability target two year difficult, bank oblige extend strengthen monetary ease drive external factors, even situation judge side effect outweigh positive effect economy. in regard, understand 2 percent price stability target consistent fundamental japan’s economy medium- long-term perspective. i therefore pay particular attention risk that, current large-scale monetary ease policy protract policy strengthen additional measures, associate side effect would instead outweigh positive effects, would undermine economic stability long run. this i propose bank aim achieve price stability target 2 percent medium long term designate qqe intensive measure time frame two years. my proposal aim secure opportunity bank thoroughly examine, certain period time, bi central bankers’ speech 7 whether side effect qqe outweigh positive effect review ease measure flexible manner depend economic financial condition time. c. monetary policy structural reform qqe powerful policy, exert maximum effect combine various effort public private sectors. generally speaking, monetary policy provide indirect support structural reform mainly work demand side economy, cannot substitute reform themselves. for example, i mention earlier, various measure supply side strengthen growth potential economy necessary increase potential growth rate labor productivity growth rate. in relation this, possibility decline potential growth rate rise natural unemployment rate, example, recently become hot topic discussion unite state major advance economies. due attention pay risk excessive monetary ease without accurate recognition structural change could result accumulation economic financial imbalances. there also concern that, excessive expectation monetary policy increase, monetary ease promote beyond appropriate scope monetary policy, may lead lose momentum advance necessary structural reform instead exert negative effect economic growth long-term perspective. in order ensure effect monetary ease fully take hold, government’s effort secure confidence fiscal sustainability also essential. in situation bank continue purchase large amount jgbs, government’s effort achieve fiscal consolidation structural reform weaken speculation permeate financial market – reflect overly heighten expectation stability bond market ensure bank’s jgb purchase – confidence fiscal sustainability could undermine long-term interest rate could rise. this turn could worsen fiscal condition substantially constrain effect monetary easing. a specify joint statement government bank release january 2013, implementation fiscal consolidation measure important prerequisite success qqe essential japan’s economy overcome deflation achieve sustainable growth. d. use wide range policy measure 1. loan support program in addition powerful monetary ease qqe, bank establish fund-provisioning measure call loan support program support initiative make best use accommodative financial condition within effort increase bank lend strengthen growth potential japan’s economy. the program consist two measures: fund-provisioning measure stimulate bank lend (hereafter stimulate bank lend facility) fund-provisioning measure support strengthen foundation economic growth (hereafter growth-supporting fund facility). at mpm hold february 2014, bank decide increase scale two facility extend deadline new application facilities, due expire shortly, one year. specifically, stimulate bank lend facility, maximum amount bank’s fund-provisioning financial institution increase amount equivalent net increase lend amount twice much net increase lending. a growth-supporting fund facility, maximum amount bank’s fund-provisioning main rule increase 3.5 trillion yen 7 trillion yen, maximum amount fund-provisioning financial institution increase current 150 billion yen 1 trillion yen. furthermore, 8 bi central bankers’ speech facilities, financial institution able borrow fund fix rate 0.1 percent per annum extend duration; namely, four year instead one three year present. with revisions, loan support program expect promote effort increase bank lend strengthen growth potential japan’s economy, thereby complement qqe contribute improvement economy. i consider desirable aim achieve economic condition preferable medium- long-term perspective make use various measure parallel manner, i explained, instead rely much qqe, considerable side effects. 2. conduct monetary policy view effect interest rate policy an unconventional policy asset purchase policy implement qqe regard exceptional somewhat temporary measure generate upward momentum economic activity price affect direction momentum zero low bind nominal interest rates. on hand, conventional interest rate policy regard usual, fine-tune measure use time encourage economic activity price reach desirable levels. my understand that, momentum economic activity price become sufficiently strong result positive outcome qqe expect rate return rises, zero interest rate maintained, effect monetary ease cumulatively increase conventional interest rate policy, consequently stimulative effect economic activity take hold. in fact, calculate japan’s policy interest rate taylor rule,1 recent estimate suggest rate shift upward, negative territory 0 percent almost positive territory, reflect improvement output gap increase price since introduction qqe. therefore, view, cumulative effect monetary ease generate maintain zero interest rates, addition ease effect qqe, increase go forward, one option gradually shift focus monetary policy conduct asset purchase policy zero interest rate policy, view role two policy tool well balance positive effect side effects. precisely unconventional policy new policy measure short history, side effect general could still many unknown parts. in particular, future, order achieve smooth normalization monetary policy maintain financial market stability, i consider aim make shift focus monetary policy conduct, together government’s fiscal consolidation, become important requirement. 1 the taylor rule monetary policy rule level benchmark policy interest rate calculate base particular formula using, example, deviation observe inflation rate target inflation rate, output gap. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jeremy c stein: incorporate financial stability consideration monetary policy framework speech mr jeremy c stein, member board governor federal reserve system, international research forum monetary policy, washington dc, 21 march 2014. * * * i would like talk today one might explicitly incorporate financial stability consideration monetary policy framework.1 do involve tackle two question – one relatively easy one much harder. the easy question is, financial stability concerns, principle, influence monetary policy decisions? to specific, case one might tolerate large forecast shortfall path unemployment rate full-employment level one would otherwise, concern accommodative policy might entail heighten risk sort adverse financial market outcome? this question theory, empirical magnitudes, and, view, theoretical answer clear “yes.” i say bite shortly, let stress i break new conceptual grind here; basic argument lay number others, include woodford kocherlakota.2 the second question is, one operationalize theory? what sort data one look to, sort empirical method one use, calibrate much stance monetary policy alter relative case financial stability consideration completely set aside? this question difficult. in interest advance conversation, i venture tentative think one possible approach, somewhat different i see recent work topic. while i hope convince path worth exploring, i cannot say i know yet exactly lead – and, particular, whether ultimately deliver monetary policy prescription differ quantitatively meaningful way offer current models. so i intend anything follow comment current stance policy. before get deep details, let preview bottom line. i go try make case that, else equal, monetary policy le accommodative – i mean will tolerate large forecast shortfall path unemployment rate full-employment level – estimate risk premium bond market abnormally low. these risk premium include term premium treasury securities, well expect return investor bear credit risk on, example, corporate bond asset-backed securities. a illustration, consider period spring 2013 10-year treasury yield neighborhood 1.60 percent estimate term premium around negative 80 basis points.3 apply period, approach would suggest less willingness use large-scale 1 the view express necessarily share member federal reserve board federal open market committee. i grateful david lopez-salido egon zakrajsek number helpful conversation carry empirical work report here. thank also william english jon faust comments. 2 see woodford (2012) kocherlakota (2013, 2014). 3 the 10-year nominal rate hit 1.63 percent may 2, 2013. an estimate term premium base oft-cited methodology kim wright (2005) negative 0.78 percent day. 2 bi central bankers’ speech asset purchase push yield even further, compare scenario term premium low.4 the informal intuition i mind cost associate push risk premium low, increase likelihood may revert back way hind federal reserve’s ability achieve mandate objectives. in follows, i try make intuition precise generalize applicability. do financial stability consideration belong monetary policy framework? however, let start conceptual question whether financial stability consideration belong monetary policy framework. a i say earlier, i think clear in-principle answer “yes.” the generic argument rest three assumptions. first, suppose federal reserve focus traditional dual mandate maximum employment price stability. to keep thing simple, suppose two goal conflict one another – say, aggregate demand weak, depress employment inflation – boil thing one objective: keep unemployment close target. with usual quadratic loss objective function, assumption would say federal reserve care minimize expect value (u – u*)2. a little bite algebra show objective function turn decompose two pieces: (1) “expected shortfall” term, give square deviation expect unemployment target level u*; (2) “risk” term, give variance realize unemployment, u.5 second, argument assume variable summarize financial market vulnerability – i abstract moment call fmv – influence monetary policy. that is, easy monetary policy lead increase vulnerability measure fmv. moreover, fmv elevated, great probability adverse event – kind financial market shock – that, occur, would push unemployment rate, else equal.6 the third final assumption risk associate elevate value fmv cannot fully offset zero cost nonmonetary tools, financial regulation. to clear, assumption imply regulation helpful reduce financial vulnerability – say regulation perfect instrument. these imperfection could stem regulatory arbitrage; political-economy constraints; fact much regulation also impede economic growth, like overly restrictive monetary policy.7 thus one way think construct fmv stand-in level financial vulnerability remain regulation do best do, give exist real-world limitations. 4 again, i stress statement directional, quantitative – i claim magnitude adjustment one would want make large, policy place time miscalibrated absolute sense. rather, point financial stability cost asset purchase likely loom large term premium negative, consideration belong discussion. 5 kocherlakota (2014) emphasize decomposition federal reserve’s loss function. note that, focus mean variance, functional form set aside may another important aspect vulnerabilities: tail risk well capture variance oppose high moments. 6 if i introduce explicit time dimension, might natural assume easy monetary policy today raise probability adverse event medium-run future date, even reduce probability short run. in case, might interest set intertemporal tradeoff considered, particularly economy vulnerable position today. in event, assumption point, mean illustrate logic argument. 7 see, example, stein (2013) elaboration points. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in setting, even inflation concern entirely set aside, monetary policy face tradeoff. consider situation unemployment target. a accommodative policy usual benefit low expect unemployment thus reduce expect shortfall term objective function.if, however, also raise conditional variance unemployment rate via elevated-fmv channel – thereby increase risk term objective function – cost weigh alongside benefit. and importantly, true even financial stability separate objective itself; i frame it, financial stability matter insofar affect degree risk around employment leg federal reserve’s mandate.8 to sure, absent concrete measure fmv, well sense responsiveness fmv monetary policy, discussion pretty theoretical non-operational. so i turn measurement moment. but worth note one useful qualitative observation emerge logic nature quadratic loss function. in make tradeoff i described, marginal benefit use easy policy reduce expect unemployment gap great gap large – is, unemployment far target. in case, even quite high level financial vulnerability may imply much different stance monetary policy would fall traditional analysis. however, unemployment gap shrinks, financial stability risk loom large relative terms, analysis take board may lead adjustment stance policy. okay, measure financial market vulnerability? financial sector leverage at abstract level, framework i sketch correspond closely woodford’s work, although model much fully articulated. when get implementation, woodford suggest natural measure financial market vulnerability variable capture “leverage financial sector.” in words, face unemployment target, would monetary policy le accommodative, else equal, financial-sector leverage high. this recommendation rest three key premises. first, financial-sector leverage high, probability severe crisis multiple large intermediary become insolvent elevate – is, likely replay happen 2008 2009. second, easy monetary policy assert increase incentive financial sector lever up. and, third, focus leverage oppose asset price avoid put central bank position “spot bubbles”: even impossible central bank know asset class overvalued, risk economy associate overvaluation presumably great intermediary highly levered.9 in view, generally sensible arguments, approach sort woodford outline may well turn fruitful. at time, leverage-centric approach also drawbacks, suggest likely value parallel exploration tracks. for one thing, effective degree leverage financial system easy measure comprehensive fashion. one certainly look 8 see tarullo (2014) similar observation. 9 woodford (2012) writes, “it important, i believe, realize real issue identify whether one type asset another currently overvalued. instead, central bank (and potentially ‘macro-prudential' regulators) need able monitor degree position take leverage institution pose risk financial stability… a central bank need able identify asset over-valuations order recognize situation probability simultaneous financial distress several institution non-trivial.” 4 bi central bankers’ speech thing like banks’ capital ratios, important action, financial stability perspective, likely subtle form leverage either outside traditional bank sector prone shape shifting. more point, recall that, purpose inform monetary policy, one want focus source financial vulnerability least effectively deal via regulation. and reliably form leverage measured, good candidate handle regulatory supervisory approach. in words, see sign banks’ capital ratio danger eroding, would certainly want something, hard imagine something involve monetary policy – obvious first line defense case would turn regulatory supervisory tools. in response critique, one might instead seek focus attention monetary policymakers broad measure private-sector leverage outside reach traditional financial regulation. for example, borio drehmann document ratio credit private nonfinancial sector relative gross domestic product (gdp), suitably detrended, substantial predictive power financial crises, perhaps might make sense monetary policy condition kind broad credit-to-gdp ratio.10 however, one go route, another measurement challenge arises: how, all, monetary policy influence evolution ratio? without answer question, hard say much one would want alter stance policy when, say, ratio abnormally high relative trend. and measurement problem likely difficult one, give credit-to-gdp ratio slow-moving variable: unlike asset prices, scope event-study analysis effect change policy item interest.11 risk premium bond market motivate part observations, i would like spend rest talk explore alternative, albeit potentially complementary, approach problem. rather focus primarily measure intermediary leverage input monetary policy framework, suggestion also look estimate risk premium bond market. thus, broad thematic level, i take capital-markets-centric view financial stability, oppose purely intermediary-centric view. this is, course, suggest shock large leverage intermediary important – – play primarily capital markets. rather, premise simply disruption originate capital market consequence right, may le amenable deal via financial regulation. in regard, i echo point make recently feroli others, emphasize fragility relate bond fund flows.12 let start clear terminology: by “risk premium” asset category, i mean ex ante expect return, base objective statistical model, investor anticipate earn asset excess short-term treasury bills. so i use word “risk premium” “expected return” interchangeably follows. and, sake concreteness, i focus two bond market risk premium particular: so-called term premium, expect excess return longer-term treasury bond relative short-term bills, credit risk premium, expect 10 see borio drehmann (2009). but here, too, one might argue macroprudential tool reach beyond bank sector target broad measure household leverage might direct, tool available. an example would limit loan-to-value ratio mortgage loans, irrespective whether reside bank balance sheets. 11 a difficulty lie real-time estimation underlie trend credit-to-gdp ratio and, hence, gap relative trend. see edge meisenzahl (2011). 12 see feroli others (2014). bi central bankers’ speech 5 excess return bond credit risk (for example, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities) relative safe treasury securities. with rhetorical heat get generate whether federal reserve try spot bubbles, worth keep uncontroversial fact mind. it widely accept among researcher finance economically large amount predictable variation risk premium wide range asset classes.13 for example, cochrane piazzesi document excess return longer-term treasury security predict one year ahead simple model deliver r-squared excess 40 percent.14 analogously, greenwood hanson show return junk bond relative treasury security two- three-year horizon also forecast r-squared value ballpark 30 40 percent, case use two intuitively appeal forecast variables: credit spread high-yield share, fraction total bond issuance come high-yield category.15 figure 1 illustrate time-series variation estimate risk premiums. again, sort find largely undisputed. where controversy interpretation patterns, argue reflect wave irrational investor sentiment others take view come rational factors, time variation either risk face investor tolerance bear risks. here one get hard-to-resolve debate bubble spot whether one expect federal reserve smart market participants. however, least purposes, debate beside point. in particular, implication monetary policy i mind seem depend critically difficult question much time variation expect bond market returns; require variation exists, know does. in words, may scope make considerable practical progress remain largely agnostic whole metaphysical are-there-bubbles question.16 okay. so let’s stipulate risk premium bond market move around lot. the next observation throw mix monetary policy one factor important influence movements. an emerge body empirical work find ease monetary policy – even via conventional policy tool normal time – tend reduce term premium long-term treasury security credit spread corporate bonds.17 that is, monetary policy always tend work part effect capital market risk premiums, perhaps risk-taking reaching-for-yield mechanism.18 13 see cochrane (2011) recent survey enormous literature. 14 see cochrane piazzesi (2005). 15 see greenwood hanson (2013). 16 this statement admittedly sweep important subtlety rug. more precisely, i suspect that, one take federal reserve's legal mandate give – and, specifically, take give objective function minimize expect value (u – u*)2 – one remain agnostic source variation risk premium still reach kind conclusion i follows. however, one ask whether mandate normatively optimal fully micro-founded model, intuition source variation may matter quite bit. for example, i would conjecture might normatively appropriate, hold fix consequence aggregate activity unemployment, lean sharp reduction risk premium drive investor sentiment rather one drive rational response change risk environment. 17 see, example, hanson stein (2012); gertler karadi (2013); gilchrist, lopez-salido, zakrajsek (2014). 18 note that, econometric matter, easy establish causal effect monetary policy risk premium broad measure leverage, asset price measure daily even intraday basis. so directly relate innovation stance policy, proxied by, 6 bi central bankers’ speech however, empirical observation shed interest light monetary policy influence real economy, suggest financial stability dark side – is, meaningful increase i call fmv – low risk premium go monetary accommodation. for dark side, would sort asymmetry unwind effect monetary policy risk premiums, whereby eventual reversal either happen abruptly, cause large economic effects, initial compression. let’s take example. suppose initially, credit risk premium high-yield bond 400 basis points, that, unemployment rate well target, federal reserve want add monetary accommodation. suppose low credit risk premium 200 basis point temporarily also increase odds risk premium will, point next couple years, revert sharply, move back direction 400 basis points. what downside here? give desire accommodation, good credit risk premium push low on-average level, even potentially involve volatile down-then-up path? again, answer depend critically whether kind asymmetry, whereby eventual increase spread either abrupt, large effect real economy, initial compression. in table 1 figure 2, i present new evidence bear asymmetry. to so, i build directly recent work gilchrist zakrajsek (hereafter, gz).19 gz show change credit risk premium substantial predictive power measure economic activity like gdp unemployment. more specifically, gz construct variable call excess bond premium (ebp). the ebp point time is, roughly speaking, measure marketwide credit spread minus estimate expect default loss bonds. hence, think proxy excess return bondholder expect earn, net defaults, going-forward basis – much spirit risk premium concept i referring. not surprisingly, ebp exhibit considerable time-series variation, reach peak wake lehman brother bankruptcy. moreover, simple forecast regressions, change ebp associate significant movement gdp unemployment one year later. in words, increase ebp – is, widen non-default-related component credit spread – portend decline economic activity employment year later. the specification gz linear, impose assumption increase ebp effect symmetric decreases. in table 1 figure 2, i look explicitly asymmetries, specification allow upward move ebp different effect economy downward move. the results, come sample span period january 1973 december 2012, striking. upward move ebp – again, correspond widen credit spread – informative future evolution real economy. the coefficient estimate imply increase 50 basis point ebp single quarter, roughly once-every-five-years kind move, associate two percentage point slow gdp growth next four quarter slightly one percentage point increase unemployment rate interval.20 these effect are, standard, economically important. by contrast, decline ebp discernible effect economic activity. example, movement short-term rate wake announcement federal open market committee. a similar identification strategy available link monetary policy change movement in, say, nonfinancial-sector leverage, give latter measure infrequently. 19 see gilchrist zakrajsek (2012). 20 to bite precise, 40-year sample period, seven observation ebp increase 50 basis point single quarter. bi central bankers’ speech 7 put together, reason suggest credit risk premium – measured, say, forecast model like greenwood hanson – may operationally useful measure financial market vulnerability. when risk premium low, great probability subsequent upward spike credit spread ebp. moreover, upward spikes, occur, associate significant adverse economic effects. to clear, necessarily talk once-in-a-generation financial crisis here, major financial institution teeter brink failure. nevertheless, evidence suggest even modest capital market disruption may consequence large enough warrant consideration formulate monetary policy. if so, indicate directional adjustment would le aggressive provide monetary accommodation face above-target unemployment, else equal, risk premium abnormally low. of course, many caveats. foremost among fact ability increase ebp predict future economic activity may reflect causal link former latter. perhaps economic slowdown cause entirely nonfinancial factors, and, investor see one horizon, get skittish, cause ebp rise. if so, would wrong conclude easy monetary policy – even does, fact, cause low risk premium – causal effect probability future slowdown. so point, evidence i review think suggestive. make progress difficult issue causality likely require clear articulation underlie mechanism lead pronounce asymmetry relationship credit spread economic activity. if causal link is, indeed, present, lead increase spread much strong effect economy decreases? i suspect answer something mimic effect leverage loss financial intermediary – attendant effect credit supply. for example, gz document ebp measure closely correlate credit default swap spread broker-dealer firms. the reason could loss inventory risky bond erode capital position firms, might turn compromise ability provide valuable intermediation services. alternatively, similar mechanism may play open-end bond funds, whereby loss cause large outflow asset management, compromise intermediation function aggregate credit supply.21 conclusion to restate main point, i believe measure bond market risk premium – example, estimate expect excess return long-term treasury security relative treasury bill credit-risky bond relative treasury security – may turn useful input monetary policy framework. these variable potential serve simple proxy particular sort financial market vulnerability may easily address supervision regulation. again, however, let emphasize conjectural nature remarks. even broad way think problem turn useful, way go – term model calibration – use make quantitative statements. thus, early stage, i would want claim one likely get policy prescription differ significantly standard models. we work see emerges. finally, general theme lurk background sharp difference perspective subfields economics sometimes bring give question. a i note earlier, one central widely share idea academic finance 21 basset others (2014) document change ebp associate significant change bank lend standards, suggest broad pullback credit intermediation process. 8 bi central bankers’ speech literature importance time variation risk premium (or expect returns) wide range assets. at time, canonical macro model new keynesian genre sort often use inform monetary policy tend exhibit little meaningful risk premium variation.22 even specific i say talk turn base, i believe macro model ultimately useful guide policy build empirically realistic foundation respect behavior

haruhiko kuroda, governor bank japan, international financial symposium, host institute international monetary affairs, tokyo, 19 march 2014. * * * introduction it honor invite panelist international financial symposium host institute international monetary affairs. the theme symposium important issue challenge policy world economic growth. look current situation global economy, finally overcome financial crisis follow lehman shock recently head toward recovery whole. however, pace recovery remain moderate risk euro area advance economy tumble deflation noted. i think risk significant medium- long-term inflation expectation anchor level central bank aim at. inflation expectation key term japan’s experience deflation challenge toward overcome deflation, i go talk now. long fight deflation in retrospect, series event since second half 1990s – banks’ nonperforming loan problems, asian currency crisis, lehman shock, great east japan earthquake – weigh strongly japan’s economy. in addition, variety factor put direct downward pressure prices, low-priced import emerge economy firms’ low-price strategy counter intensify competition stem deregulation. in response, bank japan implement series unconventional monetary policy ahead central bank around globe, zero interest rate policy, quantitative ease policy, forward guidance. with policy serve stimulate economic activity, economy head toward recovery time time. however, policy fail put end trend price decline. rather, people’s inflation expectation decline deflation become protracted, deflationary expectation – sense price would increase – become entrenched. in world deflationary expectation entrenched, hold cash deposit become relatively good investment strategy, firms’ incentive launch new initiative invest business facility research development become reduced. thus, japan’s economy deprive vitality generate vicious cycle low vitality make difficult overcome deflation. due long persistence, deflation become challenge difficult overcome. in order escape situation, become necessary pursue policy quickly drastically change people’s sense price increase. to end, introduce prescription last april quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe). this policy differ bank’s past monetary ease policies, well monetary ease policy implement major central bank overseas, policy effect focus dispel deflationary expectation directly work people’s expectations; words, raise people’s inflation expectations. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the qqe the qqe comprise two elements. first, eliminate deflationary expectation entrench among firm households, bank show determination would definitively overcome deflation strong clear commitment. the bank clearly state would “achieve price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) early possible time, time horizon two years,” thus clearly specify period would achieve target. second, give deflation continue long period, even strong commitment, difficult bank’s strong determination view convince without underpin measure place. the bank therefore decide double monetary base two years, achieve decide massively purchase japanese government bond (jgbs), include long remain maturities. so far, bank pursue decide provision monetary base, year-on-year rate increase monetary base 55 percent february. the monetary base expect reach 56 percent nominal gdp end year. this far exceed current ratio 22 percent federal reserve unite state 22 percent bank england unite kingdom, unprecedented monetary easing. the key qqe’s transmission mechanism low real interest rates. by raise inflation expectation clear commitment underpin large-scale monetary ease one hand contain nominal interest rate massive purchase jgbs other, real interest rate lowered, thereby generate effect powerfully stimulate economic activity. a real economy improve due stimulus, actual inflation rate rise, lead rise inflation expectations: virtuous cycle expect operate. be mechanism actually work? so far, qqe steadily exert intend effects. survey various economic entity break-even inflation rate suggest rise inflation expectation whole. a nominal interest rates, contrast advance economy long-term interest rate rise tandem economic recovery, japan’s long-term interest rate hover stable manner extremely low level around 0.6 percent. under financial conditions, japan’s economy continue recover moderately association virtuous cycle among production, income, spending. on price front, year-on-year rate change cpi exclude fresh food negative qqe introduce since improved, register positive figure around 1¼ percent late data. one year pass since introduction qqe, reach midpoint “about two years” specified. so far, japan’s economy follow path toward achieve 2 percent price stability target expected, become increasingly confident anticipate transmission mechanism qqe actually working. in japan, two round consumption tax hike scheduled. base experience economy go recession consumption tax raise last time, 1997, concern might happen again. however, look economic condition time, economic growth rate plunge immediately tax hike subsequently show sign recovery. the economy seem instead affect substantially series failure japanese major financial institution asian currency crisis take place economy show nascent recovery. by contrast, present, japan’s financial system maintain stability emerge economy become resilient negative shocks. the current condition quite different 1997. take difference account, bank belief that, even assume two consumption tax hikes, virtuous cycle economy interrupt japan’s economy continue grow potential growth rate trend. bi central bankers’ speech 3 challenge ahead achieve 2 percent to conclude, let briefly touch one challenge lie ahead; namely, price wage set achieve 2 percent inflation stable manner. the bank commit continue qqe long necessary maintain 2 percent price stability target stable manner. we aim economy society actual inflation rate around 2 percent average, firm household behave assumption price increase 2 percent. in unite state europe, people’s medium- long-term inflation expectation anchor 2 percent, set price wage base expectation firmly established. we would like achieve japan well. on point, encourage development annual wage revision next fiscal year. we pay close attention wage decision framework base assumption price rise created. conclude remark the qqe, i talk today, hold huge challenge raise inflation expectation monetary policy. so far, policy exert intend effects, japan’s economy step toward achieve 2 percent price stability target expected. of course, halfway there. the bank steadily pursue qqe overcome soon possible deflation continue nearly 15 years. it examine upside downside risk economic activity prices, make adjustment necessary achieve price stability target. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 andreas dombret: regulatory reform – unresolved issue need international cooperation speech dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, harvard law school symposium “building financial system 21st century – an agenda europe unite states”, armonk, new york, 28 march 2014. * * * 1 introduction lady gentleman thank opportunity speak today harvard law school symposium build financial system 21st century – an agenda europe unite states. it great pleasure here. in november 2008, week lehman brother failed, leader g20 meet washington d.c. in meet take far-reaching decision – combat current crisis also prevent future crises. a central passage declaration follows: “we pledge strengthen regulatory regimes, prudential oversight, risk management, ensure financial markets, product participant regulate subject oversight, appropriate circumstances.” today, five year later, make good progress. nevertheless, must aware mark roe harvard university call “regulatory confidence cycle”. he writes: “regulators react explosion create new rules. the economy recovers; regulator conclude job well, regulate resist tightening. […] a recovery continue memory financial crisis grow faint, appetite regulatory change dissipates. why fix something long broken?”. on superficial level appear financial system mended. however, ensure break – objective yet achieved. there still issue need address order create stable financial system. in speech today, i would like highlight three issues: too-big-to-fail problem already discuss morning, shadow bank system, market otc derivatives. let u begin too-big-to-fail problem. 2 tame beast – too-big-to-fail problem leave aside nitty gritty, one thing resolve too-big-to-fail problem: need introduce “market” financial market – is, restore fundamental principle market economy. the important principle principle liability. everywhere common sense people hold responsible actions. everywhere world banking, would appear. during crisis, government around world spend billion dollar taxpayers’ pocket save banks. this indicate too-big-to-fail banks, least, play different set rules. they weave deeply fabric financial system failure might tear everything apart. the consequence this: whenever too-big-to-fail bank run trouble, government might compel bail order prevent full-blown financial crisis. this mean bank implicitly insured. whatever happens, government likely stand ready help. and consequence nature game. first, accord recent study federal reserve bank new york, “too-big-to-fail” bank fund advantage 2 bi central bankers’ speech small banks. second, implicit insurance provide incentive engage risky business promise high returns. if thing turn well, bank wins. if thing go wrong, taxpayer lose. the principle liability obviously violated. the crucial question juncture following: need restore it? well, decisive point bank must able fail without drag entire financial system them. what need effective resolution mechanism banks. this common sense conceptual level. however, come implementation, thing turn little complex. put practicable resolution procedure place difficult endeavour, especially international context. systemically important bank large number entity many countries, procedure supervisory traditions. in absence sound legal basis close cooperation, resolution measure execute one country might always recognise countries. thus well-coordinated approach authority needed. the purpose maintain systemically important activity resolution procedure applied. coordination advance plan resolution measure enable authority consider financial stability international point view, merely national perspective. to end, new international standard recovery resolution systemically important institution develop financial stability board. have new standard big step forward. at european level, central pillar envisage bank union single resolution mechanism. this instrument allow authority restructure resolve bank without put taxpayers’ money stake. in future, whenever bank fails, resolution cost must bear first shareholder creditors. after that, bank-financed resolution fund come play, last resort public fund use taxpayer make pay. 3 bring light shadow – shadow bank system we make good progress global european level address too-big-to-fail problem. however, discussion mainly centre around bank system. yet part financial system might become source systemic risk. one shadow bank system. accord financial stability board, shadow bank system comprise “credit intermediation involve entity activity outside regular bank system”. what i think relevant financial stability perspective entity create bank-like risk without subject bank regulation. the overall effect shadow bank system financial stability ambiguous. theoretically, non-banking financial institution perform bank-like activity associate diversification specialisation benefits. therefore, could assume contribute make financial system efficient resilient. however, development run-up financial crisis reveal something else: activity entity shadow bank system pose threat financial stability. these potential threat mostly result maturity liquidity transformation, build-up leverage credit risk transfer conduct outside perimeter bank regulation. all activity evil per se, ensue systemic risk need contained. all activity must make transparent, particular vis-à-vis supervisory authorities, need adequately regulated. in regard, i welcome global regulatory initiative shadow bank – leadership financial stability board. bi central bankers’ speech 3 and too, international cooperation essential establish effective regulation. a central feature shadow bank system regulatory arbitrage: activity shift bank system shadow bank system order evade regulation. a geographically fragment approach regulation would curb regulatory arbitrage take another level. against backdrop, welcome g20 place shadow bank system high agenda. 4 structure market – otc derivative ccps the third issue i would like raise relate structure market – derivative market, precise. trade derivative certainly potential cause massive losses, disrupt market threaten financial stability. but trade financial stability put risk; also jeopardise back office level transaction clear settled. and might pose problem market participants, part bank system shadow bank system. the g20’s decision require otc derivative clear centrally important cornerstone regulate otc derivative markets. central counterparties, ccps short, able mitigate systemic risk act risk buff global financial markets. this appear particularly strike consider two source potentially huge losses: first, extremely one-sided derivative position and, second, high degree opacity surround interconnectedness global financial players. in regard, ccps help good solve another problem i already mentioned: too-big-to-fail issue. however, ccps become systemically important. this harbour potential side effect need monitored. furthermore, effective recovery resolution regime need place ccps. to shield taxpayers’ money, potential loss distribute among clear participants, often globally active banks. this give rise potential contagion risk domino effects. therefore, careful calibration recovery resolution regime crucial. against backdrop, international coordination essential. the regulation otc derivative market across jurisdiction – spirit, wording, term outcome. this would allow correspond national regulator defer other’s rule cross-border transaction occur. otherwise, regulatory arbitrage, market fragmentation liquidity disruption might consequences. some progress make past year towards resolve cross-border issues. one example ‘path forward’, joint statement agree upon european commission cftc july 2013. this statement necessary foundation cooperation. however, cross-border matter still unresolved urgently need addressed. major difference u eu regulation found, instance, method use compute initial margin coverage ccps. and also find scope report requirement trade repositories. let u take brief look two examples. first, rule use calculate minimum initial margin ccps differ u eu. generally speaking, ccps ask initial margin order hedge market risk derivative position liquidation period case clear member defaults. under exist eu u regulation, risk manager ccps take account different minimum liquidation period confidence interval calculate adequate initial margins. a result, initial margin request ccps may vary considerably, depend location ccp. this might eventually drive business 4 bi central bankers’ speech towards ccps le strict initial margin calculation requirements. to prevent regulatory arbitrage happening, might make sense agree consistent strict international standard detail thus reduce national leeway. second, mandatory report rule differ significantly term time scope. in us, cftc-registered “swap dealers” “major swap participants” require report transaction trade repository real time. in eu, meanwhile, transaction report end next business day contract parties. furthermore, exchange trade derivatives, market price collateral level report eu, us. it remain see whether differ report rule recognise equivalent. and – importantly – also remain see meaningful accurate global aggregation trade repository data bring about. 5 lay groundwork – cooperation harmonisation lady gentlemen, i briefly discuss too-big-to-fail problem, shadow bank system market otc derivatives. each issue highlight need international cooperation. if coordinate approach towards regulation create fragment financial system. a financial system vast opportunity regulatory arbitrage ample source systemic risk. against backdrop, recent regulatory initiative u worry me. they seem contradict need international cooperation. a “balkanisation” regulatory space represent genuine risk, regulatory decision take consideration mind – europe well unite states. and apply regulation also foundation rests. regulate supervise financial institution require information. and satisfy need international cooperation, information internationally comparable. unfortunately, always case. it entirely new insight difference account standard across country hamper international comparability balance sheet data. this turn potentially impede financial regulation. a prominent example treatment derivative affect balance sheet ratio subject regulation. derivative net rule u gaap allow u financial institution net derivative position large extent. in europe, ifrs account rule far restrictive regard. that derivative volume appear much large european bank u counterparts. go one step further, regulatory balance sheet ratio relate total asset differ u european banks. the leverage ratio u banks, instance, generally appear much low european banks. hence, particular case, distortion arise different account rule may make easy bank u comply give regulatory leverage ratio european peers. so far, standard setter agree harmonise information disclose note financial statements. nevertheless, global harmonisation account standard need order create regulatory level play field avoid regulatory arbitrage. in view, certainly something move high agenda global regulation. 6 conclusion lady gentlemen, make good progress adjust financial regulation. nevertheless, reach destination; regulatory reform continue. i discuss outstanding issue speech: too-big-to-fail banks, shadow bi central bankers’ speech 5 banking, otc derivative account standards. i also highlight need international cooperation. at begin speech i cite passage g20’s washington declaration. let close speech quote another passage: “our financial market global scope, therefore, intensify international cooperation among regulator strengthen international standards, necessary, consistent implementation necessary protect adverse cross-border, regional global development affect international financial stability.” that spirit, lady gentlemen. to reach destination – stable financial system – walk together. thank much. bi central bankers’ speech 1 manuel sánchez: evolve global challenge policy option latin america remark manuel sánchez, deputy governor bank mexico, 2014 iif (institute international finance) latin america economic forum, bahia, brazil, 29 march 2014. * * * it certainly pleasure invite stunningly beautiful brazilian coast participate 2014 iif latin america economic forum. i would like thank institute international finance chance share think challenge opportunity face latin america current economic environment. i organize remark follows. first, i comment change global context emerge markets; second, i highlight policy option country may entertain confront likely external financial headwinds; finally, i make comment mexican economy. evolve global challenge two trend particularly noticeable recent world economic developments. the first decrease growth since 2010, especially emerge economies, amid modest post-crisis global improvement. soften commodity price economic deceleration china contribute tendency, affect latin american commodity exporters. in particular, grain metal see moderately fall prices, high levels. the second trend reversal fortune global financial condition emerge economies. whereas wake great recession, country draw substantial capital inflows, especially portfolio funds, saw price financial asset rise, 2013, table turned. in particular, expectation eventual begin taper asset purchase u.s. federal reserve sharpen global risk aversion. since may last year, portfolio capital inflow emerge economies, previously darling destination foreign funds, contract countries, even become outflows. at time, price many financial asset see risky fall abruptly. emerging-market bonds, equity currency affect change market sentiment. also contribute low asset hold value weak relative outlook growth emerge economies. however, country treat equally. investor differentiate among destination accord macroeconomic fundamental prospect economic expansion, among factors. nation large financial imbalances, whether internal external, hit hardest, include country latin american region. more recently, political tension uncertainty ability government resolve external finance inflation problem turn pressure various nation act swiftly. for almost year, negative spillover effect emerge economy resulted. move forward, foreseeable real financial environment emerge economy continue challenging. specifically, world economic upturn remain muted. one reason recovery lead advance countries.1 1 see, example, consensus economics (2014), consensus forecasts, march; consensus economics (2014), latin american consensus forecasts, march. 2 bi central bankers’ speech high growth develop nation good news. but support moderate. mature economy nature grow fast. also, output probably remain secular trend give fact country need continue fiscal consolidation measure wake past expansionary cyclical posture give increase long-term government obligations. another factor call prudent expectation global recovery economic change undertake china, authority make effort adjust developments. rapid credit growth feed real estate price pressure affect bank balance sheets; shadow bank operation may pose stability risks; sign swift expansion certain sector may require restrictive policies. for reasons, commodity likely see low demand china, may dampen commodity price growth. furthermore, condition financial market probably continue bumpy. a major reason uncertainty surround process reverse extraordinary monetary stimulus advance countries, unite states. a reflect good economic prospects, unwind welcome development. but central bank nonetheless sail uncharted waters. unconventional monetary policies, include asset purchase forward guidance, unprecedented; change use instrument compound uncertainty relate eventual decision raise policy interest rates. authority doubt withdraw monetary expansion cautious way possible. however, dissonance communication public perception future action may give rise sharp market fluctuations, occur 2013. in case, even without future turbulence, finance emerge economy likely become tighter, chill enthusiasm somewhat portfolio investor assets. policy implication in context modest recovery le favorable financial conditions, policy maker latin america make best thing economies? a always, valid one-size-fits-all response, desirable measure necessarily depend country’s circumstances. but two separate situation may help u identify policy options. first, case significant market stress, emergency measures, orient toward manage foreign-exchange market capital flows, might considered. in particular, use international reserve attenuate market volatility may helpful, show recent response various severely stress economies, also tighten monetary policy. however, evidence effectiveness foreign-exchange market intervention mixed, impact almost always temporary. in addition, use policy impede adjustment exist large external imbalances. moreover, imposition capital control limit short-term success, usually affect composition flows, may harm prospect future financing.2 in case homegrown economic stresses, limitation emergency measure obvious. for example, nation experience over-leveraging price bubble either capital boom loose fiscal financial policies, may weaken 2 empirical evidence effectiveness policy intervention foreign exchange market capital flow find broto, c. (2013), “the effectiveness forex intervention four latin american countries,” emerge market review 17; forbes, et. al. (2013), “capital control macroprudential measures: what be they good for?” diw berlin, german institute economic research, discussion paper 1343. bi central bankers’ speech 3 banks’ balance sheets. tackle underlie problem soon possible necessary condition regain stability. available tool include fiscal monetary tightening, micro macro prudential policy exchange rate adjustment. in short term, tradeoff may involved. for example, restrictive monetary policy counteract capital outflow may weaken cyclical upturn result disorderly deleveraging, keep monetary policy loose could trigger inflation exacerbate balance-of-payment problems. second, even significant imbalance evident, preventive policy always call prepare potential financial strain. possible fragility watch correct preemptively include rapidly rise external debt foreign currency mismatches, well domestic asset price bubbles. all all, best strategy strengthen macroeconomic foundations, fortify financial system good regulation oversight, promote reform enhance economic efficiency hence potential growth. the mexican economy during recent years, mexico important recipient foreign portfolio fund among emerge economies. the country also fare relatively well current le favorable external financial environment. in particular, since may 2013, mexican peso depreciate le many emerging-market currencies. this noteworthy period mexico resort type foreign exchange intervention, policy become pervasive several countries. the freely float exchange rate regime mexico clearly force.3 since last may, yield curve steepen tandem unite states. shift yield curve mainly reflect high term premiums, stem anticipate unwind expansionary monetary stance unite states. possible effect domestic expect inflation, currency risk future policy interest rate hike seem play important role. also, country risk indicators, mexican government’s credit default swaps, rise le many emerge economies.4 moreover, capital flow continue increase, albeit slow pace, particularly orient toward fixed-income assets. foreign hold peso-denominated government bond reach new highs, although portfolio duration drop slightly. this contrast reduction hold observe emerge market whole. mexico’s ability weather recent market turmoil may reflect several factors, include flexible exchange rate regime long serve buff external shocks, transmit global financial signal domestic economy efficiently. also, clear imbalance build capital boom years. current account fiscal deficit remain moderate relative gdp. furthermore, ratio private-sector credit output, anything, stay low international comparison take account. the growth ratio last year one low among emerge economies, pose challenge make credit available mexico. longstanding prudential regulation adequate business model make bank system solid, healthy level capital, provision asset quality. bank rule design forestall foreign currency mismatch cover deposits, net liabilities, net open position liquidity ratios. 3 pursuant regulation issue bank mexico accordance law, federal treasury pemex must carry foreign currency transaction central bank. proceed pemex transaction largely

course, buttress economy effective monetary policy keep inflation subdued, last decade. a list sound economic fundamental imply economy free risks. stability cannot take granted, authority continue monitor condition sign weakness order prevent potential market disarray. finally, mexican economy undergo period low cyclical growth begin middle 2012. some factor temporary nature, slow mexican export due previous deceleration u.s. economy, low government spend tie begin new federal administration restructure house developer market wake failure three large firm sector. thus, improvement factor lead upturn. in particular, close linkage u.s. economy could make future growth solid derive dependence export commodity prices.5 other last problem center stagnation total factor productivity, contribute largely mexico’s disappoint long-term economic performance. current momentum structural reforms, seek generate great efficiency, highly promising. the agenda ample, cover many sector economy. although full effect reform may take year materialize, direction confidence come positive expectation likely already help attract continue capital inflows, fuel sustain recovery.6 conclude remark the present environment challenge one emerge economies, include latin america, challenges, course, always carry potential opportunities. the expect global economic rebound good news, especially country poise benefit strong tie world’s big consumers. future market condition may rocky, pose risk particular nation finance vulnerabilities. the best ring-fencing strategy correct imbalance

member board directors; senior management staff; distinguish customers; invite guests; lady gentlemen. i greatly honour invite chief guest official open new branch imperial bank acacia mall. let begin congratulate director management imperial bank progress make expand bank’s foot print ugandan bank market. this fifth branch bank open since begin operation uganda three year ago. it provide good access premier bank service bank’s customer vibrant business location city. uganda currently 25 commercial bank operation, compare 15 end 2007. in last six years, 12 new bank enter market uganda, imperial bank one recent. it pertinent ask benefit almost double number commercial bank operate uganda deliver bank customer country. i would like spend minute address question. for many years, colonial period three decade independence, bank market dominate relatively small number banks, mostly foreign publicly owned. competition vigorous access bank service limit majority ugandan population. this begin change 1990s, new privately own bank enter market. since mid 2000s, new entry bank market gather pace, comprise part bank subsidiary african banks, especially bank nigeria

bankers’ speech 1 koji ishida: economic activity price japan monetary policy speech mr koji ishida, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, saitama, 26 february 2014. * * * i. monetary policy a. introduction price stability target joint statement government bank japan first, i would like describe status bank japan’s monetary policy conduct january 2013. at monetary policy meet (mpm) hold january 21 22, 2013, bank decide introduce price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi). at time, release joint statement government, clearly state government bank would strengthen policy coordination work together overcome deflation early achieve sustainable economic growth price stability. in statement, bank announce that, price stability target, would pursue monetary ease aim achieve target early possible time. concurrently, government announce would flexibly manage macroeconomic policy also formulate measure strengthen competitiveness growth potential japan’s economy, promote strongly. the government also announce would steadily promote measure aim establish sustainable fiscal structure view ensure credibility fiscal management. b. quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) now i would like talk bank’s current monetary policy measures. at mpm hold april 3 4, 2013, bank introduce qqe achieve price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi early possible time, time horizon two years. the feature new monetary policy measure follows. first, view pursue quantitative monetary easing, bank change main operate target money market operation uncollateralized overnight call rate monetary base, total amount money bank directly supply economy. on basis, bank increase monetary base – define sum banknote circulation, coin circulation, current account deposit hold financial institution bank – annual pace 60–70 trillion yen. second, bank purchase japanese government bond (jgbs) primary mean increase monetary base, amount outstanding increase annual pace 50 trillion yen. moreover, average remain maturity bank’s jgb purchase extend slightly le three year seven year – equivalent average maturity amount outstanding jgbs issued. third, addition jgbs, view low risk premium asset prices, bank purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) amount outstanding increase annual pace 1 trillion yen 30 billion yen, respectively. and fourth, bank continue qqe, aim achieve price stability target 2 percent, long necessary maintain target stable manner. it examine upside downside risk economic activity prices, make adjustment appropriate. so far, i explain basic framework qqe. almost year pass since qqe introduce april 2013. the amount outstanding monetary base increase 138 trillion yen end 2012 202 trillion yen end 2013, accumulate smoothly toward 270 trillion yen, amount project end-2014. the 2 bi central bankers’ speech amount outstanding jgbs also accumulate smoothly toward 190 trillion yen, amount project end-2014, increase 89 trillion yen end 2012 142 trillion yen end 2013. c. loan support program in addition implement qqe, bank employ loan support program promote financial institutions’ use large scale monetary base – supply bank aggressive monetary ease – effort increase amount bank lend strengthen growth potential japan’s economy. at mpm hold february 17 18, 2014, bank decide double scale loan support program extend application period one year. the loan support program consist two measures: fund-provisioning measure stimulate bank lend (hereafter stimulate bank lend facility) fund-provisioning measure support strengthen foundation economic growth (hereafter growth-supporting fund facility). specifically, former, bank decide enable financial institution borrow fund bank amount twice much net increase lending. a latter, bank decide double maximum amount fund-provisioning main rule 3.5 trillion yen 7 trillion yen. under facilities, financial institution able borrow fund fix rate 0.1 percent per annum four years. thus far, loan support program support financial institutions’ effort increase total amount lend produce positive effect catalyst regard firms’ financial institutions’ effort strengthen foundation japan’s economic growth. the bank expect enhancement make february mpm promote financial institutions’ action well stimulate firms’ households’ demand credit, view encourage banks’ lend strengthen foundation economic growth. d. development financial condition financial market reflect policy measures, financial condition japan accommodative. firms’ fund cost hover low levels, long-term average contract interest rate new loan discount record historic low. issue condition cp corporate bond also favorable. in addition, situation year-on-year rate change bank lend continue increase, loan provide shinkin bank also record year-on-year positive growth since summer 2013. firm continue see financial institutions’ lend attitude improving. firms’ financial position also improve regardless firm size. this evidence diffusion index financial position small firms: proportion firm respond financial position “easy” exceed proportion respond “tight” first time since bubble period early 1990s. turn development financial markets, yield 10-year jgbs – benchmark long-term interest rate – stable low level around 0.6 percent bank proceed jgb purchases. give year-on-year rate increase cpi currently around 1¼ percent, long-term real interest rate presume negative territory. a foreign exchange rates, yen depreciating, albeit fluctuations. stock price trend upward. meanwhile, accord money stock statistics, growth rate investment trust pecuniary trust high levels, indicate money holder household increase risk assets. a i described, accommodative financial condition seem recently effectively stimulate private demand, condition appear form basis bi central bankers’ speech 3 japan’s economy overcome negative effect consumption tax hike virtuous cycle among production, income, spend operate firmly. ii. development economic activity price a. overseas economy next, i talk development economic activity prices. overseas economy – mainly advance economy – start recover, although performance remain lackluster parts. the growth rate global economy 2014, release january international monetary fund (imf), project accelerate 3.7 percent 3.0 percent 2013. naturally, growth rate emerge commodity-exporting economy high advance economies. however, advance economy project show strong growth momentum emerge commodity-exporting economy 2014, compare year earlier. among advance economies, growth rate u.s. economy project accelerate 2014 compare previous year. inevitably growth rate u.s. economy january–march quarter 2014 adversely affect record winter snowstorm since december 2013. however, situation balance-sheet adjustment household sector seem mostly complete fiscal drag faded, production private demand expect remain firm economic recovery expect become widespread spring. with regard employment situation, although current data show weakness reflect effect winter snowstorm, improve trend remained, evidence decline trend unemployment rate. a euro area, 2014 economy project emerge negative growth. concern persist disinflation, business household sentiment continue improve situation financial market stabilized, production pick up, albeit moderately. whereas improvement observe advance economy i described, situation vary among emerge commodity-exporting economies. first, chinese economy continue see stable growth, albeit slow pace before, maintain year-on-year growth rate 7.5–8.0 percent october–december quarter 2013. the purchase managers’ index (pmi) manufacture activity recently show weakness, chinese economy expect basically maintain stable growth around current pace state control. among emerge commodity-exporting economies, economic development ny pick up, particularly exports, effect economic recovery advance economy spread them. in contrast, growth momentum asean country remain weak relatively limit ability profit recovery advance economies. in particular, concern impact unstable political situation country trade japan, example. among emerge commodity-exporting economies, – structural vulnerability current account deficit – saw nervousness market one point federal reserve proceed reduce pace asset purchases, situation recently regain stability. b. japan’s economic activity price 1. current situation a. economic activity now, i discus japan’s economic activity. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the bank’s current assessment japan’s economy continue recover moderately. moreover, front-loaded increase demand prior consumption tax hike recently observed. real gdp october–december quarter 2013, release february 17, 2014, show quarter-on-quarter growth 0.3 percent, represent fourth consecutive quarter positive growth. by component, private demand quarter, include private consumption business fix investment, record high growth rate july–september quarter. a private consumption, consumption good durable good increase partly reflect front-loaded increase demand prior consumption tax hike amid improvement employment income situation evidence increase winter bonus payments. business fix investment, previously lack momentum compare firms’ annual fix investment plan improve trend profits, rise noticeably last october–december quarter. in contrast, export lack momentum date despite recovery trend overseas economies, mainly advance economies, movement foreign exchange market. a import grow substantially, net export continue significantly push gdp growth rate, july–september quarter. although handful economic indicator release period start january 2014, seasonally adjust number new passenger-car registration – consumption-related indicator – increase rather substantially 6.9 percent january month-on-month basis, suggest possibility front-loaded increase demand prior consumption tax hike become pronounced. meanwhile, real export january decline 2.3 percent overall, presumably due drop export china. index industrial production january, reflect development domestic external demand, schedule release february 28. accord survey production forecast manufacture release january, production january expect show relatively strong growth lead production meet domestic demand. b. price regard development prices, year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food) december 2013 climb previous month 1.3 percent. through latter half 2013, rise price energy-related item petroleum product – reflect movement crude oil price foreign exchange rate – contribute rise prices. however, price increase gradually observe item recently, private consumption remain resilient, indicate increase steadily become widespread. in fact, year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le food energy) rise 0.7 percent december 2013, represent strong growth since august 1998. 2. outlook economic activity in term economic activity, domestic demand, particularly private consumption, likely maintain firmness external demand expect increase – albeit moderately – virtuous cycle among production, income, spend likely maintained. a prices, whereas upward contribution price movement energy-related item likely diminish gradually, boost effect improvement aggregate supply demand balance accompany economic recovery expect spread. consequently, year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food), exclude direct effect consumption tax hike, likely around 1¼ percent time. a i mentioned, japan’s economy likely continue moderate recovery trend, affect front-loaded increase subsequent decline demand prior consumption tax hike. for time being, i pay attention follow points. bi central bankers’ speech 5 a. the effect consumption tax hike the first point attention effect consumption tax hike. the front-loaded increase demand prior consumption tax hike already observe considerable extent durable consumer goods, mainly houses, passenger cars, white goods. if scale front-loaded increase demand great expect toward end fiscal 2013, subsequent decline april beyond substantial. it inevitable consumption tax hike adverse effect households’ real income. nevertheless, economy whole underpin government’s economic measures, increase likely export business fix investment – lack momentum date. therefore, even economy temporarily post negative growth april–june quarter 2014, recovery trend unlikely dissipate. meanwhile, i consider necessary carefully ass underlie trend various indicator schedule release period first half fiscal 2014, give likely show large fluctuations, upward downward, due consumption tax hike. b. risk overseas economy development export the second point attention risk overseas economy development exports. overseas economy – mainly advance economy – start recover, high degree uncertainty likely remain outlook emerge commodity-exporting economy structural vulnerability fiscal current account deficits. although market currently calm down, necessary monitor whether risk economy materialize affect global economy. export expect offset temporary fallback demand likely observe april 2014 follow consumption tax hike, expect play traditional role trigger virtuous economic cycle. however, lack momentum moment. a background lack momentum, number issue raise discussion concern cyclical structural problems, pace recovery overseas economy shift manufacture firms’ production site overseas. i also monitor whether exports, significant spillover effect business fix investment, act drive force japan’s economy expect fiscal 2014 onward. c. the employment income situation the third point attention development employment income situation households. with regard recent situation, supply demand condition labor market continue improve steadily, show fact active job openings-to-applicants ratio rise 1.03 december 2013. employee income also pick moderately because, total cash earn per employee generally bottom out, year-on-year rate increase number regular employee expanded. for domestic demand, particularly private consumption, maintain firmness concurrently rise prices, essential virtuous cycle improvement continue employment income situation support consumption. i intend monitor result spring’s wage negotiation extent employee income whole improves, include degree number employee increases. 6 bi central bankers’ speech iii. achieve price stability target a. forecast price fiscal 2015 thus far, i outline bank’s assessment japan’s recent economic activity prices. base assessment, bank compile release policy board members’ forecast economic activity price fiscal 2015. in term median members’ forecast prices, year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) expect register 0.7 percent fiscal 2013. exclude effect consumption tax hikes, project reach 1.3 percent 1.9 percent fiscal 2014 2015, respectively. it likely reach around 2 percent – price stability target – toward latter half projection period, is, fiscal 2015. b. the price stability target price index the bank judge basic indicator use express price stability target must price index comprehensively cover good service consume household general public large accustom to. to end, bank view cpi item important. however, since cpi item affect temporary fluctuation components, bank us cpi (all item le fresh food) identify underlie trend inflation; fresh food exclude index highly volatile component. to grasp underlie trend cpi, bank also examine reference index cpi (all item le food energy), laspeyres chain index (all item le fresh food), 10 percent trim mean. a price indices, cpi (all item le impute rent) use deflator convert nominal figure real one statistic relate household consumption expenditures. this price index adopt consider one suitable measure actual household consumption expenditures, give impute rent owner-occupied home actually paid. in long run, price index show movement overall index, point time could move somewhat differently, reflect temporary factors. for example, year-on-year rate growth december 2013 cpi (all item le fresh food) cpi (all item le food energy) 1.3 percent 0.7 percent, respectively – i mention early – cpi item 1.6 percent, laspeyres chain index (all item le fresh food) 1.2 percent, 10 percent trim mean 0.8 percent, cpi (all item le impute rent) 2.0 percent. the bank judge necessary ass price development comprehensively monitor wide range price index mentioned. it seek achieve price stability target early possible time maintain stable manner. in way, seek fulfill mission “achieving price stability, thereby contribute sound development national economy”, stipulate bank japan act. bi central bankers’ speech 1 william c dudley: u monetary policy emerge market economy remark mr william c dudley, president chief executive officer federal reserve

past. this reflect fundamental improvement strong policy framework many emerge market economy put place past 15 years. third, give role dollar global reserve currency, federal reserve special responsibility manage policy way help promote global financial stability. fourth, i believe need good international mechanism cushion adjustment process capital flow abruptly change direction. like central banks, monetary policy mandate domestic. but, action often global implication fee back u.s. economy, need always keep mind. we also need careful underestimate consequence actions. focus direct channels, effect one would expect ripple back unite state problem one two emes typically look quite small. but, indirect channel feedback aggregate properly – admittedly difficult – effect may considerably larger. my point tend underestimate feedback effects. for us, market volatility past spring summer still remain fresh minds. eme financial market hit hardest, decline equity prices, widen sovereign debt spreads, sharp increase foreign exchange rate volatility. in u.s., saw spike treasury yields, 10-year rate rise roughly 100 basis point early may early july, rise roughly another 30 basis point peak early september. most commentary focus shift expectation respect u.s. monetary policy – and, particular, uncertainty time implication feed taper – catalyst moves. this focus seem generally right, although factor also play role. market participant also evaluate possibility growth china emes might slow even growth u.s. advance economy 2 bi central bankers’ speech pick up. the subsequent market movement investor withdraw fund eme investment abrupt shock emes generally, especially long early period abundant liquidity ample inflows. from one perspective, unconventional nature recent u.s. monetary policy add little fundamentally new challenge face emes. these policy simply represent way easing, drive come zero low bound. central banker manage difference across country cyclical position policy stance many time past. but, another perspective, le experience operate unconventional monetary policy create potential uncertainties. this put premium continue dialogue among central bankers, central banker market, keen listen skill part. in view, fact large scale asset purchase program affect size term risk premia globally important. this set monetary policy affect financial asset price different way compare change short-term interest rates, humble claim understand importance distinction. for period ahead, seem likely market remain focus vulnerability might ignore year ago. the great premium strong fundamentals, policy coherence predictability likely remain. there one right answer manage trade-off come change environment, adjustment sometimes difficult. moreover, undoubtedly experience bump road. the renew volatility saw january proof enough that. yet, i think remain generally optimistic outlook long market participant continue appropriately discriminate across countries, rather treat emes homogenous group. furthermore, many emes generally appear good equip today handle fed’s prospective exit exceptional policy accommodation past tighten cycles. this reflect fundamental reform emes put place past 15 years, well hard lesson learn past period market stress. among positive are: • the absence type fix exchange rate peg regime often undermine violently past period stress; • improve debt service ratio generally moderate external debt levels; • large foreign exchange reserve liquidity cushions; • clear coherent monetary policy frameworks, support generally low moderate inflation rates; • generally improve fiscal discipline; • good capitalize bank systems, support strengthen regulatory supervisory frameworks. of course progress uniform across emes work remain strengthen institutional structure countries. in particular, vulnerability build recently several important emes. still, fundamental improvement i’ve cite leave many emes good position past weather time cycle external environment turn welcome wary. the impact change feed policy beyond border lead call u internalize impacts, even policymaking internationally coordinated. a i’ve already noted, feed policy significant effect internationally, give central place u.s. market global financial system dollar’s status lead global reserve currency. in pursue policy responsibilities, seek conduct policy transparently base clear principles. we mindful global effect bi central bankers’ speech 3 feed policy. promote growth stability u.s., i believe, important contribution make growth stability worldwide. there is, course, argument feed policy accommodative long, create risk financial stability worldwide. here, i think, it’s important consider carefully counterfactual. would country beyond border really good weak u.s. economy? the fundamental issue whether u.s. monetary policy help support dual objective stable price maximum sustainable growth whether consistent healthy global economy. moreover, far clear explicitly coordinate policy would produce good outcome global economy generally, emes specifically. central bank challenge enough tailor policy domestic circumstances. i believe would take much attempt collectively fashion policy reference global conditions. moreover, last system explicit coordination – system fix exchange rate bretton wood – break reason. monetary policy mean suit everybody likely end suit nobody. similar consideration underlie widespread move emerge world away fix exchange rate regimes. policymakers worldwide learn framework capable respond discipline flexible manner change domestic condition work best long run. while explicit coordination look neither feasible desirable, central bank general, feed particular, could good global stewards. one thing recent event demonstrate importance effective feed communication. it clear retrospect attempt last spring provide guidance potential time pace taper confuse market participants. in particular, market seem conflate taper monetary policy tighten raise expect path policy rates. lately, seem do better: market seem understand policy rate likely remain exceptionally low considerable period time even taper completed. a know, we’ve take number step recent year increase transparency improve communications. this include regular press conference follow federal open market committee (fomc) meet feed chair; publish growth inflation forecast fomc participants; concert attempt lay guidepost fomc look ass progress toward mandate. this last element, course, go along move explicit forward guidance, part effort provide stimulus zero low bound. we are, though, still learn effectively communicate, especially give new expand set policy instruments. a second area must good safeguard financial stability. simply put, fail act either early enough decisively enough stem credit excess spawn financial crisis great recession. the unite state alone this, give position global financial system, especially do better. we’ve take important steps, reflect new legislative mandate broad effort rethink regulatory supervisory framework. systemically important bank organization must hold amount capital liquidity good align risk profiles, compensation scheme institution focus reward long-term result official sector make progress solve too-big-to-fail dilemma. all remain much work progress. but, effort help u avoid repeat mistake recent past, take proactive stance toward mitigate potential future vulnerabilities. of course, feed alone here. since recent financial crisis, central bank worldwide engage broad rethink good fulfill mandates. i also think another area need work on, area little do date. we need collectively devise good international mechanism facilitate 4 bi central bankers’ speech adjustment direction capital flow change abruptly. the current regime strike inefficient often ineffective. hold large cushion foreign exchange reserve expensive, draw reserve often unattractive potential adverse signal sends, emes loath turn international monetary fund resource cushion adjustment process. it seem could design good global solution collective insurance – access liquid resource time stress stigmatize could would use facilitate adjustment. this could help reduce market volatility dampen size foreign exchange adjustments. this topic, opinion, deserve great attention central banker around world. let close final thought. the large problem country create others often emanate get policy wrong domestically. recession instability home often quickly exported. equally important, growth stability abroad make job easier. this mean externality work do, effective fulfillment domestic mandate help bring u good place collectively. ensure global growth stability remain joint common endeavor. this terry checki work distinguish career. we fortunate service must carry mantle forward. bi central bankers’ speech 1 már guðmundsson: recent economic financial development iceland speech mr már guðmundsson, governor central bank iceland, 53rd annual general meet central bank iceland, reykjavík, 27 march 2014. * * * mr. president, prime minister, minister finance economic affairs, chairman supervisory board, former governors, directors, ambassadors, lady gentlemen: this annual general meet bank’s sixth one since large part icelandic financial system collapsed, usher deep economic contraction iceland see since measurement begin world war ii. it also last annual general meet current term governor. for reason, stand turn point resurrection iceland’s economy financial system, appropriate look back, ass progress made, identify challenge ahead. iceland’s financial crisis part global crisis peak september 2008, u investment bank lehman brother failed, trigger worldwide run banks’ foreign funding. have coordinate response lead central bank around world, provide collateralised u dollar liquidity international banks, directly foreign currency swaps, many bank would go under. iceland participant cooperative effort limit degree. but commercial bank highly dependent foreign funding, much shorter-term foreign asset invested. on own, icelandic government position provide icelandic bank fx liquidity facility foreign counterpart receive time, would place real peril try provide enough assistance prevent default fx liabilities. in addition, number weakness balance sheet – weakness would probably pose serious problem case, albeit late on. but even though situation develop iceland, important u remember coordinate international response prevent financial crisis side atlantic mushroom tidal wave national international bank failures. and response keep economic recession develop full-blown depression like 1930s. central bank play key role initially, provide massive liquidity facility coordinate monetary ease home front and, least, negotiate fx swap actually entail global extension u federal reserve’s role lender last resort. in addition mitigate imminent contraction, measure attempt interrupt vicious cycle fire sale illiquid assets, fall asset prices, evaporate liquidity, thus reduce risk banks’ equity would plunge regulatory minimum bank around world would start fall like dominoes. such turn event would severe effect real economy. in respect, important refrain draw too-sweeping conclusion bank collapse iceland, international part iceland’s bank system large domestic bank operation actually keep run considerable cost. international cooperation crisis management grow markedly scope, particularly collaboration among g20 country international monetary fund. it encompass common perspective fiscal measure support bank system stimulate demand, provision support specific countries. late on, emphasis shift reform financial regulatory framework. that work still underway. 2 bi central bankers’ speech but spite measures, late 2008 early 2009 recession side atlantic become deep since interwar years, global level extensive synchronise contraction history. all affect icelandic economy, course, add collapse iceland’s banks, plunge asset prices, inevitable adjustment domestic demand follow overheat 2005–2007 – adjustment begin bank fell. the contraction peak q4/2007 trough q1/2010 deep iceland seen, least post-war period. gdp contract nearly 12½%. in context, must remember, though, peak utterly unsustainable, combine wide positive output gap enormous current account deficit. iceland’s economic recovery begin q2/2010. we well way towards recoup lose gdp, forecast indicate year recover full. the difference, though, domestic economy much good balance then. we run current account surplus, inflation target. one might ask much success actually is, give number country already recover lose output. it point iceland’s investment level low, true develop country recently, apart major commodity producer australia, canada, norway. if compare iceland’s recovery experience country suffer twin bank currency crisis, see far anomalous, least view fact that, among comparison countries, recovery often take place much favourable global economic environment face today. in assess recovery, must also bear mind room manoeuvre stimulate demand limited. from 2010 onwards, fiscal policy focus gradually eliminate fiscal deficit, prerequisite reinstate sovereign’s access foreign capital markets. early on, monetary policy committee focus stabilise exchange rate order stop collapse asset price automatic increase private sector debt, either exchange rate-linked index cpi. the scope cut interest rate order stimulate demand therefore limited, although begin develop course 2009. the capital control introduce late 2008 provide room manoeuvre enable central bank allow real interest rate fall fast would otherwise possible. inflation, skyrocket currency collapsed, begin subside gradually, inflation spike cause contractual wage increase excessively high inflation expectation cut room manoeuvre mid-2011 onwards. in order understand economic recovery face headwinds, two point important. the first point centre nature recession. to extent, recession represent inevitable adjustment domestic demand fact long possible fund country’s massive current account deficit abrupt contraction two sector – financial service construction – grow exponentially upswing. when dust settled, domestic economy still rest sturdy foundations, low real exchange rate stimulate iceland’s tradable sectors. the second point iceland small, open economy, domestic demand often le driver gdp growth foreign demand case much large economies. there tendency iceland forget discussion economic policy. honour guests: we turn point respect monetary policy implementation. for last year, inflation inflation expectation well inflation target, economic recovery gain momentum, inflation forecast suggest would remain target sustain period, provide exchange rate remain close level prevail time. it would possible conclude monetary stance loose. actually, several critic maintain monetary stance tight, economic development show sign support bi central bankers’ speech 3 argument, consistent common measure appropriate stance monetary policy. the monetary policy committee consider monetary stance sufficient bring inflation back target near future. in february, gratify see inflation subside target first time since early 2011. a far monetary policy concerned, three factor contribute achievement. the first interest rate hike august 2011 november 2012, response foreseeable inflation spike follow spring 2011 wage settlements. although controversial time, rate hike prove value contain inflation without derail economic recovery. second, monetary policy committee’s warn – would happen year wage increase prove excessive – appear credible, probably would happen without previous rate increases. third, foreign exchange market intervention policy introduce bank mid-may prove effective. the outlook inflation stay close target year króna hold relatively stable. this positive outlook due number factors: favourable inflation development first two month year, sign wage cost increase small recent term previously thought, fact recent wage settlement – provide pay increase consistent inflation target – appear set tone subsequent wage negotiations, fact global inflation look set somewhat low previously forecast. look beyond year, however, inflation could rise slack economy disappear effect increase investment government’s debt relief measure domestic demand come fore. the impact inflation depend inflation inflation expectation develop year, factor could affect demand near term. it monetary policy committee’s task decide respond different short- long-term prospects, aim keep inflation close target. monetary policy instrument currently revised, eye improve liquidity management prepare tighten bank system liquidity concurrent central bank iceland hold company’s domestic asset sale possible measure relate capital account liberalisation, cause short-term market rate move close centre bank’s interest rate corridor. this could increase bank’s net interest income. the monetary policy currently pursue different prevail crisis, owe presence capital control manage float rather virtually free-floating exchange rate regime place crisis struck. the policy describe bank’s december 2010 report “monetary policy iceland after capital controls” therefore implement part. it possible could go even near future create monetary policy framework would supplant joint declaration march 2001, confirm change already place pave way others. if done, important remember limit monetary policy achieve. in long run, monetary policy affect inflation, short run smooth cyclical fluctuations, particularly credible; i.e., inflation expectation remain close target even attempt mitigate recessions. once slack disappears, however, monetary policy cannot deliver output growth beyond growth potential economy, attempt ultimately lead inflation persistently target. by law, central bank iceland two main objectives. the first promote price stability, main task monetary policy. the second promote financial stability. a regard monetary policy implementation, central bank independent stand alone. it also independent regard contribution financial stability; is, analysis decision prudential rule task setting; i.e., concern liquidity 4 bi central bankers’ speech foreign exchange risk. in addition, like central banks, play key role crisis management liquidity facility role lender last resort. but emphatically alone regard, body make important contribution – financial supervisory authority particular, also relevant ministries. the legislature also play large role monetary policy, statutory framework monetary policy seldom changes, amendment financial system legislation much frequent. a result, financial stability collaborative task undertake various administrative bodies. the division task area financial stability vary one country another, wake recent financial crisis, shift attitude towards division. before crisis, tendency believe financial monetary stability well enough serve monetary policy focus solely inflation target, interest rate primary tool, financial supervision regulatory framework aim primarily ensure individual financial institution sound. the market would take care rest. experience show view narrow, many place abandoned. to degree, entail compartmentalisation central banks’ previous tasks. some country – uk, instance – address problem revert central bank wide-ranging role cover monetary financial stability. but viable response. here iceland, financial supervisory authority central bank step collaboration systemic risk analysis exchange information. these effort bear fruit, collaboration two institution good, would imprudent let success rest mainly willingness cooperate, could change change actors. a result, important strengthen statutory framework provide good support efforts. this i welcome introduction legislative bill financial stability council, aim provide strong foundation systemic risk analysis response guarantee access necessary information. time tell whether step necessary. on 9 april, central bank publish annual financial stability report, include detail analysis financial system risk affect it. i therefore brief topic. the big picture this: since iceland’s outward-oriented bank system collapsed, great deal achieve term build financial system domestic focus. the banks’ balance sheet grow stronger, non-performing loan decline, foreign exchange mismatch reduced, equity increased, liquidity strong. corporate household debt level falling. the regulatory framework bank operation also improve base experience gain financial crisis, implementation international rule derive important cross-border collaboration develop crisis, implementation rule base iceland-specific risk. a good example new liquidity rule adopt central bank december, base basel iii principle include special ratio foreign-denominated liquidity. there number task ahead, however, regard implementation rule basel iii capital adequacy rule special prudential rule adopt capital control lifted, address foreign exchange risk volatile capital movement effectively. an effective financial system important ingredient economic progress. it therefore important ensure regulatory framework impede system’s effectiveness unduly. regulatory provision may go need safeguard actual risk. this accurate risk analysis important. for reason, among others, bank emphasise work effectively financial institution draft rules. the capital control removal remain important risk financial stability iceland. the bank present in-depth analysis problem face, update figure relate include upcoming issue financial stability. the big bi central bankers’ speech 5 picture change little recent term, however. iceland face balance payment crisis main reason capital controls. it mean borrower sovereign central bank limit access foreign capital markets. at time, foreseeable current account surplus next several year large enough cover contractual foreign debt repayments, thing equal. furthermore, volatile isk asset hold non-residents currently total perhaps fifth gdp could rise almost half gdp fail banks’ isk asset recover full pay creditors. iceland excess foreign exchange revenue unwind isk positions, however. the solution lie spread repayment foreign loans, solve isk problem relate settlement fail banks’ estate manner exacerbate balance payment problem, open market access resident entities. a number possible scenario could achieve scrutiny time, need discus detail here. but measure generate result aim at, important ensure impact foreign debt service, whether domestic foreign currency, manageable; safeguard iceland’s public debt position, sovereign credit ratings, access capital markets; ultimately, provide domestic entity access foreign credit acceptable terms. some goal may conflict one another, consider course action chosen. in addition, important economic policy incentive public system promote national save attempt make safeguard current account surplus year come, expedite resolution balance payment crisis, enhance confidence iceland, reduce likelihood iceland emerge process face economic imbalances. because irrevocable actions, one chance settle estates, general lift controls, therefore critical successfully. but i say before, change fact cost capital control rise time important progress high-quality gdp growth lift sooner rather later. it also important learn, experience others’, unrestricted capital flow accompany benefit also risks. appropriate prudential rule measure must place address risk step taken. this speech centre primarily two central bank’s main tasks: monetary policy financial stability. but bank’s function actually much broad this. and many function grow scope wake financial crisis – instance, investment management large foreign exchange reserve dramatically increase need legal services. still task add on, capital control surveillance recovery claim revert bank crash. the central bank gain strength institution recent years, grapple old project new challenges. in order deal successfully, necessary expand staff, nowhere near much one might expect much might do countries. we able contain staff level exceptional team highly qualify employees. if central bank succeed role safeguard monetary financial stability, key importance change may lie ahead bank remain professionally strong productive. a competent dedicate staff vital regard. i wish thank bank’s employee excellent work recent years. honour guests: in closing, i would like thank central bank’s many collaborator successful cooperative relationship past year. first among financial supervisory authority ministry bank work closely – particular, ministry finance economic affairs, administer affair central bank behalf government. i would also like thank financial institution bank interact cooperation. and finally, i would also like thank parliament iceland, particularly economic affair trade committee, collaboration. bi central bankers’ speech 1 andreas dombret: what go europe? the view within speech dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, new york stock exchange, new york, 26 march 2014. * * * 1. introduction lady gentleman thank invite speak new york stock exchange. it great honour pleasure today. in 1792, stock broke gather buttonwood tree low end wall street. in meeting, sign agreement which, effect, mark birth new york stock exchange. today, 200 year later, buttonwood tree long gone; fell storm 1865. however, new york stock exchange still go strong become guide light financial economic universe. in role, witness fair share up downs, boom busts, tranquillity turmoil. however, last seven year mostly characterise downs, bust turmoil. since 2007, live succession crises: global financial crisis, worldwide recession, sovereign debt crisis euro area and, recently, turbulence emerge markets. these episode underscore closely interconnect global economy become. what drive growth prosperity good time easily turn way crisis. in globalise world, problem one side globe quickly spread side. to paraphrase winston churchill: “a financial crisis get halfway around world policymakers chance get pant on”. in globalise world, happen unite state relevant europe happen europe relevant unite states. against backdrop, i wish shed light situation euro area offer inside view. 2. there light end tunnel for nearly four year now, state euro area define sovereign debt crisis. however, i good news – light end tunnel. most importantly, euro area whole finally leave recession. by now, see three consecutive quarter positive growth, look ahead, outlook year next year also quite encouraging. projection ecb suggest euro-area gdp grow 1% 2014 1½% 2015. and recovery drive “core euro-area” country germany. some crisis-hit country also finally embark path recovery. and least see light end tunnel. it seem effort implement structural reform gradually bear fruit. competitiveness improve peripheral country past years. almost everywhere, unit labour cost fall substantially. improve competitiveness turn drive export higher. all peripheral country – except cyprus – project see export growth year. these achievement reflect current account increasingly revert positive balances. 2 bi central bankers’ speech and germany part rebalancing equation. since 2007, germany’s current account surplus vis-à-vis euro area shrink continuously 4½% gdp 2% gdp. a business investment germany project pick 2014 2015, rebalancing continue. the progress abstract figure reflect also visible concrete events. for example, ireland spain exit financial support programme without friction. and portugal plan leave adjustment programme first half year. all three country recently return sovereign bond market relatively low yields. it seem international investor increasingly acknowledge countries’ effort achievements. in case ireland portugal, international investor buy 80% newly issue bonds. at time, stock market economy rise time now. these development underscore progress peripheral euro-area country make adjust economies. however, due different start point country naturally advance adjustment process others. especially greece effort necessary manage turnaround. 3. the role monetary policy now, role monetary policy process? monetary policy certainly help prevent crisis escalating. still, one thing clear about: monetary policy cannot solve underlie cause crisis. nevertheless, observer propose even expansionary monetary policy. they worry risk deflation euro area. it certainly true current inflation rate rather low but, view, risk deflation limited. and issue, bundesbank ecb agree. the argument rest three pillars: • first, around two-thirds drop inflation due fall price energy food. these exogenous factor effect likely temporary. • second, low inflation rate euro area partly result necessary adjustment crisis-hit countries. these also one-off effects. • third, sign self-enforcing downward spiral price wages. long-term inflation expectation firmly anchor level line ecb’s definition price stability. private household seem postpone expenditure expectation drop prices. there indication substantial increase save rate. fear fate similar japan therefore misplaced. moreover, notion japan’s “lost decades” need see perspective. the weak growth japan partly natural consequence country’s change demographics, working-age population shrink since mid-1990s. that, incidentally, economic policy challenge await euro area economy year come – notably germany. 4. there still obstacle overcome so, even take account issue deflation, still see light end tunnel. however, reach yet. there may still obstacle could block way – already see, others cannot see. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the latter frank knight, one founder chicago school economics, call “unknown unknowns”. a recent example political crisis ukraine. however, example “unknown unknown”, limit potential prevent u reach end tunnel. ukraine contribute quarter percent global economic output. furthermore, exposure european bank ukraine relatively small. accord data bank international settlement stand us$23 billion. a know obstacle could block way, hand, prolong period low interest rates. but please misunderstand me: current status monetary policy certainly adequate. nevertheless, interest rate stay low long time, may experience unwanted side-effects. one side-effects search yield. investor may eventually increase risk investment make shortfall yield cause low interest rates. and, indeed, seem investor already begin search yield. in corporate debt markets, instance, valuation already somewhat stretched. and global low-interest rate environment, ambitious valuation may well spread market segments. in regard, strong recovery property market euro-area country set u thinking. take german house market, example. between 2009 2012, price large city rise almost 25%. and, 2013, increase another 8.9%. calculation bundesbank already point overvaluation urban areas. nevertheless, look german market whole, situation seem le dramatic. in 2013, price rise average 4.5% – figure give much cause concern. overall, price germany yet move away fundamentals. for me, warn bell would start ring rapid increase house price accompany significant rise lending. and even warn bell would ring rise credit accompany deteriorate lend standards. have say that, i assure point time i surround silence. but bond market house market look at. since nyse, let u take look stock markets. in 2013, one way stock market go up. the eurostoxx 50 increase 18%, ftse 100 14%, dow jones 28%, nikkei skyrocket much 57%. market volatility decreased, too. after year risk aversion, sentiment switch “risk on” mode. do financial market enter new phase “irrational exuberance”? such verdict certainly debatable. but financial market least anticipate significant improvement economic fundamental prospects. and anticipate government around world continue implement necessary reforms. these expectation create vast scope confidence shocks. this, turn, interact unfavourable way another risk arise prolong period low interest rates. a prolong period low interest rate could set wrong incentives. it could encourage bank postpone necessary balance sheet adjustments. and might induce government postpone necessary structural reform consolidation public finances. in view, could big threat recovery process. the improve outlook together low interest rate could lead complacency reform fatigue. we cannot let happen. we cannot let happen still lot put euro area back solid footing. reform national level must continue and, look future, reform european level equally important. 4 bi central bankers’ speech 5. how get end tunnel? at european level, important project bank union. the bank union certainly big step since introduction euro. and logical step take. a single currency require integrate financial market include supervision banks. consequently, one pillar bank union rest upon single supervisory mechanism – european bank supervision large banks. centralise supervisory power way foster comprehensive unbiased view upon banks. it also enable policy action hold hostage national interests. thus, contribute effective supervision good cross-border cooperation coordination. however, bank union rest one pillar alone. a second pillar necessary keep everything balance. this second pillar single resolution mechanism. european bank supervision require european bank resolution – otherwise would imbalance liability control. in wide sense, resolution mechanism essential solve too-big-to-fail-problem. large bank must able fail without endanger stability whole system. otherwise, government would step prevent systemic crisis. this would create asymmetry: if everything go well, bank wins. if everything go downhill, taxpayer lose. this create moral hazard banks, endanger financial stability threaten public finances. the single resolution mechanism solve problem. it allow authority restructure resolve bank without put taxpayers’ money risk. in future, whenever bank fails, resolution cost bear first shareholder creditors. after that, bank-financed resolution fund come play, last resort public fund use taxpayer make pay. and even bank union starts. one big preparatory step undoubtedly comprehensive assessment bank fall european supervision. this comprehensive assessment consist two elements: backward-looking asset quality review forward-looking stress test. the objective asset quality review uncover legacy asset banks’ balance sheet accumulate bank national supervision. the objective stress test ass resilient bank stress scenarios. any capital shortfall reveal comprehensive assessment rectify bank union starts. ideally, would primarily involve private funds. if private fund available bank sustainable business model, respective government could step in. ultimately, question responsible past fail bank supervision – individual member states. the comprehensive assessment allow bank union start clean slate. at time, support necessary deleveraging european banks. balance sheet eventually “cleaned up” doubt regard quality removed. this improve banks’ capacity lend real economy thus support economic growth. against backdrop, crucial comprehensive assessment conduct tough thorough manner. in context, let briefly compare european stress test correspond stress test unite states. one question might be: two stricter? well, compare strictness two stress test simple. in unite states, threshold 5 per cent capital relative bank’s risk weight asset stipulated, europe, 5.5 per cent. doe mean european stress test stricter? in mind, comparison inadequate. bi central bankers’ speech 5 a meaningful comparison include threshold capital, also macro scenario. however, macro scenario european stress test yet finalised; due publish end april. but even know scenarios, comparison would still difficult: the scenario take account one variable, gdp growth, – case u stress test – 28 variables. what’s more, horizon stress test one year, le three years. a large number variable therefore compare three-year horizon. in likelihood, comparison two stress test would therefore ambiguous. sound stress test method essential correctly determine banks’ capital needs, i certain european stress test fulfil requirement. 6. conclusion lady gentlemen, i cover lot grind speech today. nonetheless, central message straightforward. the situation euro area improve light end tunnel. however, time complacency. risk remain, among reform fatigue side-effects low interest rates. thus, must continue effort put euro area back sound footing. two week ago, ecb president mario draghi say 2012 2013 year stabilisation euro area 2014 2015 may year recovery. if continue path reform, expectation prove correct. but i say beginning, world become closely interconnect so, too, risk problems. the prolong period low interest rate much global problem european one. and one thing certain: interest rate rise point. however, manage turnaround prove formidable challenge require careful policy design adequate communication. the recent turbulence emerge market response fed’s taper decision case point. it case point need qualification. in end, domestic problem lack progress reform make emerge market vulnerable. to restore investors’ confidence, address domestic vulnerability strengthen macroeconomic policy reinvigorate structural reform efforts. although turbulence emerge market potential derail global recovery show sensitive market moment. there still considerable scope negative confidence shocks. therefore, ball court policy-makers – euro area, unite state emerge economies. if press ahead necessary reforms, eventually able leave time downs, bust turmoil behind us. thank much. bi central bankers’ speech 1 javier guzmán calafell: level volatility food prices: challenge prospect remark mr javier guzmán calafell, deputy governor bank mexico, panel “level volatility food prices: challenge prospects” “food security context high food price volatility low productivity latin america caribbean: challenge opportunities” international seminar, guadalajara, 27 march 2014. * * * first i would like thank three speakers, accept invitation

after show pronounce decline several decades, international food price start increase begin century, abruptly spike 2007–2008. price product fell end 2008 within context global economic crisis, rise hit level 2011 even high post crisis. although wake spike food price diminished, still remain high levels. in addition, forecast next year suggest complex scenario. for example, oecd fao estimate food

speech 1 mario draghi: a consistent strategy sustain recovery lecture mr mario draghi, president european central bank, science po, paris, 25 march 2014. * * * the euro area crisis almost unprecedented drama severity. like great depression 1930s, likely provide rich material economic historian decade come. it study analysed, cause consequence debate revised. so interest u imagine, dust settled, various account euro area debt crisis locate turn point. some historian may locate individual policy measure take crisis; others may place future yet reached. in view, turn point passed, come summer 2012. what change point crisis management shift towards development execution consistent recovery strategy. it strategy i go outline remark today. i organise remark follows. first, i describe initial development crisis, illustrate policy choice make pressure event commendable themselves, sequence wrong order, make deal consequence debt overhang difficult. this interact feature euro area’s institutional structure postpone recovery. thereafter, i describe right sequence step june 2012, bank union project first agreed, put euro area back trajectory towards recovery. the first step ‘rebooting’ financial system, necessary condition sustain recovery, least help monetary policy manage aggregate demand. but sufficient condition: policy structural reform lift level potential growth equally important part recovery strategy. in describe strategy, i talk past, also present future. the crisis over. to successful, recovery strategy being, must continue be, execute commitment perseverance. look back crisis the early phase crisis follow roughly pattern across advance economies. most long period excessive debt accumulation, private debt level several jurisdiction reach historical highs. in country fuel over-investment unproductive sectors, include real estate, sector associate severe financial crisis history. the mirror image development credit bubble bank sector, bank finance house supply, i.e. loan real estate developers, house demand – is, mortgages. when crisis break out, debt build-up quickly become debt overhang. many advance economy enter prolong period deleveraging firms, household bank attempt reduce debt levels. for firms, mean le investment. for households, le consumption. and banks, le credit. moreover, collapse lehman brother send shockwaves global financial system lead unprecedented rise uncertainty risk aversion. this lead retrenchment investment, trade hire globalise “great recession”. government budget go deep deficit offset massive shock nominal spending. these event share across major economies, also largely consistent historical experience. there several episode economic history 2 bi central bankers’ speech large build-ups follow period debt deleveraging. serious financial crisis tend follow slow economic recoveries. nevertheless, mid-2010, advance economy show sign return growth, albeit slow pace. at point, however, trajectory euro area depart others. while recovery gain grind u particular, euro area enter second recession last second quarter 2013. why divergence happen? for two reason specific euro area. first, sequence policy response first bail-out greece aggravate concern bank sovereign debt sustainability. second, concern interact incomplete institutional framework self-reinforcing way. in address situation mid-2010 – benefit hindsight – one could legitimately expect follow sequence actions. first, agree solid backstop deal sovereign bank sector problems. thereafter, conduct stress test recapitalise bank necessary. then, bank strong position absorb loss sovereign backstop place, construct consistent framework deal sovereign excessive debt. finally, apply framework country deem need it. for example, sequence backstop stress test recapitalisation apply us, lesson lehman brother shock drawn, accelerate clean-up country’s bank system. however, 2010 2011 almost reverse sequence take place euro area. the deauville agreement private sector involvement october 2010 greek debt restructure july 2011 announce effective backstop solvent government still constructed. and initial stress test bank 2011 capital raise exercise october year conduct without clear backstop solvent banks. the effect cause many bank government come uncomfortably close lose market access, lose altogether. a consequence, instead act shock absorber, bank government begin act pro-cyclically. this situation interact negatively two feature euro area’s institutional structure. the first euro area’s incomplete financial integration. while price converge many asset class prior crisis, turn euro area fact create condition deep cross-country financial integration. integration largely base short-term interbank debt, rather equity direct cross-border lend firm households, stress quickly unravelled. indeed, build-up financial imbalance euro area periphery part finance short-term lend bank core. those bank quickly reverse exposure amount “sudden stop”, analogous crisis experience emerge economies. this contribute fragmentation euro area bank sector economy along national lines, phenomenon visible early stage crisis. the second feature euro area's fiscal framework, strictly enforced. that framework explicitly design ensure fiscal responsibility, two result benefits. first, strictly applied, would create fiscal space ex ante government absorb exceptional shocks, one experience worldwide. and second, anchor confidence medium-term soundness public finances, would allow government run counter-cyclical policy retain market access. in situation, need fiscal risk-sharing fiscal backstop. yet, fiscal framework strictly enforced, two benefit reversed: number government either fiscal space absorb shock face early stage crisis (consider belgium italy); unable maintain bi central bankers’ speech 3 trust market (consider portugal ireland). fiscal policy country therefore switch provide counter-cyclical buff convince investor debt sustainability. under circumstances, unavoidable fiscal consolidation front-loaded. but also mean fiscal policy change tailwind headwind, add drag come deleveraging across private sector. in particular, bank sector yet clean strengthened, low growth produce deterioration balance sheet add pro-cyclicality. in manage crisis, european policymakers face unprecedented set circumstances. they make decision real time face political institutional constraints. so aim comment criticise. rather, highlight fact sequence consistency policy decision matter. policymakers deal immediate situation without simultaneously address consequences. it begin change june 2012 return path recovery. the begin consistent strategy what happen time european policymakers acknowledge need complete euro area’s institutional architecture, initial stage set bank union. and so, initiate i believe necessary first step consistent strategy sustain recovery. the bank union first step long sequence, two reasons. first, necessary consolidate single currency. second, provide opportunity “reboot” euro area bank system, turn pre-condition recovery. let u consider two sequence. restore singleness money money, remembered, liability bank system. banknote represent fraction money use daily. the bulk money deposits, liability commercial banks. so truly single money among sovereign countries, fungibility deposit across borders. yet, fungibility come threat crisis. it threaten initially fragmentation financial market euro area, exacerbate emergence redenomination risk financial prices. those unfounded fear redenomination put price stability risk, ecb alleviate creation outright monetary transaction (omt) programme. our action underline irreversibility single currency decisive restore confidence. but underlie driver fragmentation still remained, especially emergence credit risk premia national level mirror perceive credit risk sovereigns, particular greek debt restructuring. this link sovereign bank risk reflected, first foremost, perception ultimate guarantor deposit bank system state. hence, perception sovereign creditworthiness diverged, confidence respective bank systems. in essence, development highlight truly single bank system euro area; juxtapositionof national bank systems, fragment easily. to ensure single currency truly single, therefore, realistic option bring together national system one single system, fungibility deposit re-established. this bank union come in. 4 bi central bankers’ speech bank union mean three things: mean single supervisory framework minimise equally risk euro area bank take excessive risk run failure. it mean single resolution framework, bank still fail, resolve way, limit use taxpayer money, irrespective bank locate fiscal strength government. and mean system deposit protection provide depositor equal confidence deposit safe, regardless jurisdiction. we well advance process unify bank system way. the single supervisory mechanism (ssm) begin operate november. a deal reach last week single resolution mechanism single resolution fund. and harmonise approach level fund deposit guarantee scheme across euro area agreed, first step towards single deposit guarantee scheme. deposit individual small- medium-sized enterprise (smes) also seniority future bank resolutions. together, go long way towards create genuine bank union, although important details, backstop european resolution financing, still need clarified. by reinforce singleness money, bank union provide condition last reintegration single financial market. it therefore pre-requisite recovery. it not, however, generate recovery, put bank position properly support recovery. this bring second step sequence event require achieve goal: role ssm clean bank system. clean bank sector prior crisis, euro area bank enter rapid period balance sheet expansion. from start expansion 2005 peak 2012, bank asset increase 60 percentage point gdp. this associate development unsustainable bank business models. bank rely much debt finance lending, debt depend much wholesale market fund little deposits. this model able develop perception implicit state guarantee bank debt – perception reinforce link sovereign bank risk i describe above. the deterioration sovereign credit, one hand, clarification rule regard bail-in bank debt, other, help bring end fund model neither desirable sustainable. the euro area bank system therefore undergo process restructure deleveraging. a necessary correction, process policymakers seek prevent. however, process need properly managed. deleveraging essentially take two forms: “good” form “bad” form. the “good” type bank quickly carve non-performing non-core asset raise equity, allow restart lend new, creditworthy clients. the “bad” type sell good asset hold non-performing asset hope value recovers. this tend create so-called “zombie banks” lead prolong period low credit growth. and even damage if, due fear counterparty credit liquidity hoarding, liquidity dry bank sell asset distress prices. such interaction market risk fund risk cause systemic crisis, outright credit crunch consequence. historical precedent suggest – thing equal – quick, “good” deleveraging tend bring early recovery. in euro area largely avoid bad form deleveraging, thank ecb intervention provide liquidity bank key moment crisis, notably move unlimited liquidity provision 2008 two longer-term refinance operation (ltros) late 2011 early 2012. in environment bank make progress deleveraging bi central bankers’ speech 5 restructuring. however, late last year still uncertainty true extent quality deleveraging. this show persistent investor doubt bank asset valuations, low credit growth real economy. it context creation ssm become critical. the ssm provide catalyst clean-up bank system take place quickly comprehensively would otherwise case. why this? introduce joint supervisory framework require u conduct thorough health check bank balance sheets, use harmonise methods, legacy issue recognised, bank enter new supervisory regime sound level capital liquidity. we currently conduct comprehensive assessment cooperation national supervisors. to illustrate scale, total amount risk-weighted asset (rwa) review amount €3.7 trillion, 60% total rwa 128 participate banks. the nature assessment, include asset quality review, conducive achieve “good” type deleveraging. it shed light composition valuation bank assets, ought turn trigger fresh equity raise appropriate, carving-out asset necessary, either sell market via “bad banks”. raise equity strengthen balance sheet long-term interest bank shareholders, even imply initial dilution claims. in fact, cleaning-up bank balance sheet need wait end assessment. the best outcome one bank forward-looking take corrective action end process. and indeed, see many case bank revise asset valuations, raise equity dispose assets. bank balance sheet decline around 20 percentage point gdp 2013 alone, partly anticipation assessment. increase robustness mirror banks’ share prices, increase around 40% 2013 relative average market growth 20%. over time, i expect process, together new regulatory framework complete basel committee, result euro area bank system streamline balance sheet structure high level capital. we wary situation bank asset many multiple gdp, saw country like ireland cyprus crisis. bail-in ability likely also mean senior unsecured bank debt play less role future relative deposits. in words, bank system come close traditional role take deposit make loans. however, permanent shrink bank system raise question finance intermediate euro area. if intermediation save investment take place le banks, must take place elsewhere, capital markets. capital market already increasingly complement bank euro area: bank credit corporates fallen, approximately match issuance corporate bonds. however, substitution perfect, particular small firms, costly investor obtain adequate information. this mean that, absent policy action, smes risk lose access finance. if continue consistent set step support recovery, clean bank system therefore accompany policy facilitate development capital markets, especially small firms. it reason frequently highlight importance create condition support capital market deepening, include remove regulatory obstacle least risky model securitisation. move towards sustain recovery this “rebooting” financial system, together construction bank union, first step consistent strategy, healthy bank system necessity sustain recovery. yet still enable factor. what achieves, essentially, 6 bi central bankers’ speech create environment “normal” macroeconomic management resume. it generate recovery. the bank sector support process two channels. first, facilitate ability monetary policy maintain price stability help economic growth return potential. second, ensure adequate supply finance investment, efficient allocation credit productive non-productive firms, thus also support potential growth. let explain two point detail. maintain price stability close output gap the task stabilise output around potential maintain price stability fall within responsibility central bank. this especially true current crisis as, due unavoidable consolidation public finance i describe earlier, contribution fiscal policy economic stabilisation could significant normal circumstances. a large burden therefore place monetary policy achieve price stability manage aggregate demand. to illustrate this, cut interest rate low level since creation euro, also introduce forward guidance, whereby commit keep policy interest rate low currently even low extend period time. this support economy today steer expectation future. in particular, forward guidance imply short-term real rates, negative today, become even negative foreseeable future. this policy rate remain low low nominal terms, inflation project gradually pick up. in turn, expectation low short-term real rate reflect level medium-term real rates, relevant investment decision entrepreneurs. in way, guidance level rate tomorrow, day tomorrow, support investment today. however, stimulatory effect hind impairment transmission monetary policy part euro area crisis, particular regard bank lend channel. the responsiveness bank lend rate cut main interest rate uneven across jurisdictions, lend rate country fall le tandem, others react barely all. the main explanation fragmentation bank system bank deleveraging i describe above. with fund long flow freely within euro area, bank pay high rate attract deposits, push fund costs. high fund cost mean high lend rates. bank process rebuild capital also require great compensation loan carry high risk weights, non-financial corporations. and need rebuild profit margin cope high-risk environment. this imply low ecb interest rate could fully pass borrowers. yet also imply effect omt announcement fee through, policy reverse fragmentation accelerate, bank deleveraging restructure proceeds, monetary policy become increasingly effective. in fact, already see evidence process. deposit rate euro area converge towards policy rate. and bank advance balance sheet adjustment good able reflect policy impulse lend volume rates. if bank lend rate euro area periphery ultimately converge core, would effectively represent significant additional monetary easing. a such, i expect monetary policy regain influence economic cycle, accommodative stance support gradual close output gap come years. this reflect current ecb staff projections, foresee inflation rise 1.0% 2014, 1.3% 2015 1.5% 2016. if downside risk scenario appear, bi central bankers’ speech 7 stand ready take additional monetary policy measure ensure mandate fulfilled. in words, need maintain price stability. our accommodative monetary policy ancillary advantage current situation: facilitate ongoing process deleveraging. it reduce numerator debt ratios, i.e. nominal interest rate, raise denominator – is, nominal growth rate. and facilitate reduction financial fragmentation, tend increase nominal rate decrease growth rates. raise potential return output potential one part recovery story; equally important level trend potential itself. in initial stage crisis, euro area, like advance economies, receive substantial downward shock potential growth. while measure potential growth complicated, projection major economic institution put euro area’s rate potential growth low crisis. low potential growth create several problems. it imply stagnant real incomes, thus limit welfare gain complicate management debt overhang firm households. it accompany high level structural unemployment, socially costly create drag aggregate demand. and reduce amount stimulus monetary policy provide economy without generate inflation. for reasons, engineer boost potential output key policy challenge face euro area today – essential part consistent recovery strategy. however, raise potential growth task monetary policy. monetary policy act output gap, structural policy act potential output. and give euro area’s weak demographics, principally achieve policy raise productivity, turn come raise investment. investment crucial today’s demand tomorrow’s supply. yet, investment euro area fall 18% crisis, 35% stress countries. this process repair bank sector help lift potential growth well. evidence euro area firm show financial constraint strongly affect firms’ investment decision crisis. this come supply side – bank lend firm – demand side, i.e. firm want borrow balance sheet leveraged. with good capitalise banks, see steady resolution issues. finance resume firm profitable investment opportunities, benefit particular young firm create net job reactive change investment opportunities. at time, acknowledge loss raise capital pre-requisite bank restructure loan distress borrowers, thus facilitate gradual workout private sector debt. in turn, allow bank sector support schumpeterian process creative destruction key productivity growth – is, allocate reallocate resource towards firm sector generate innovation. recent micro-level research eurosystem’s compnet network reveal distribution least productive firm euro area country large, imply reallocation could provide significant boost productivity. complete picture yet end story. the reboot financial system necessary sufficient achieve high investment. investment also low demand low slack economy. this partially unwind economy recovers, cannot exclude investment return former level certain sector permanently downsize result crisis. 8 bi central bankers’ speech this raise question whether policy enough compensate structural change – particular, whether create framework condition new business model emerge require high level productive investment. for example, regulation country conducive investment? 45% fix investment europe estimate concentrate sector government significant regulatory influence, imply regulation could play important role boost investment demand. even firm level, regulation influence whether productive firm allow grow. one well-known distortion regard change status requirement firm country 50 employee more. be tax code conducive investment? what matter investment demand after-tax return firm receive, mean tax incentive improve risk-return profile investment projects, even low growth environment. in country, several official report suggest high corporate labour tax rate hind investment. the focus current government issue therefore fully justified. be education system conducive investment? europe’s comparative advantage, like advance economies, increasingly locate high-end value chain. yet investment flow workforce skill match. around half country euro area rank oecd average student performance mathematics, read science, imply standard could still rise. indeed, educational attainment long factor income, also employment prospects: end 2012 18% worker low education level unemployed, compare 6% highly educate workers. all underscore that, think restore competitiveness euro area, think term low wage relative productivity. this may necessary short-run measure jurisdictions, zero-sum game: country benefit expense others. the ultimate source competitiveness euro area productivity gain build investment, positive-sum game. it raise welfare euro area aggregate. what i say new. the need continuous rise productivity performance long recognise europe; context launch 2000 lisbon agenda, aim make europe “the competitive dynamic knowledge-based economy world” 2010. a know, target reached. but objective was, remains, fundamentally right one. what different today, compare decade ago, weak productivity long hide increase private leverage rise public sector debt. there lever pull raise real growth address structural barrier economies. fiscal policy support growth ensure consolidation good composition – le focus raise taxes, prioritise expenditure – make sense unwind consolidation hard work done. this i reiterate big policy challenge euro area raise potential growth. conclusion let conclude. the point i try emphasise today simple: navigate debt crisis euro area experienced, sequence consistency policy choice everything. we need consistent across space, need consistent across time. there indeed two inescapable lesson account event i present today. bi central bankers’ speech 9 first, full recovery achieve – – complete full sequence step i highlighted. with step sequence, ask “have do enough?”. it clear do enough: debt reduced, potential output raise unemployment come – along preserve integrity money, mean price stability. this means, ultimately, look hard whether economy fit purpose specialised, globalise knowledge economy. this something national governments, business social partner together. what do france important respect, strong euro area need strong french economy. the second lesson recovery stem joint action. we see effect fragmentation financial market across national lines. we experience consequence confidence diverge across countries. we suffer result loss growth rise unemployment. no one experience either crisis, economic volatility 1970s early 1980s, credibly conclude return mere juxtaposition national policy improve situation countries. rather, make policy consistent across border achieve positive results, heed lesson continue so. in areas, bank union, mean formulate policy centrally. in areas, fiscal policy structural reform, mean accept effective scrutiny peers. in cases, loss sovereignty. in fact, i regard recovery sovereignty, mean provide again, sustainably, stability opportunity citizen demand policymakers. winston churchill say “to achieve great things, two thing needed: plan, quite enough time”. i hope i make clear today plan. and since certainly time spare, i trust that, remain resolute, great thing euro area citizen become possible. bi central bankers’ speech 1 philip lowe: some implication internationalisation renminbi open remark mr philip lowe, deputy governor reserve bank australia, centre international finance regulation conference internationalisation renminbi, sydney, 26 march 2014. * * * i would like thank michelle wright assistance preparation remarks. i would like thank centre international finance regulation (cifr) opportunity open today’s conference internationalisation renminbi. this topic extremely important one reserve bank strong supporter cifr’s work area. in view, internationalisation renminbi (rmb) – change accompany – could ultimately prove transformative global capital market early open china’s border global trade system. even turn half correct, need good understand process internationalisation rmb, include pitfall opportunities. this conference another important step journey understanding. internationalisation rmb capital flow at outset, i think useful precise mean talk “internationalisation”. in view, country’s currency view internationalise two key condition need met. the first country’s currency use transaction resident non-residents. the progress china make area significant, particularly trade side. over past years, share china’s international trade denominate rmb rise significantly trend expect continue. on investment side, expansion scheme permit approve foreign resident invest rmb china. indeed, recent time number central bank (including reserve bank) invest foreign currency reserve rmb. the market offshore rmb-denominated bond also grow strongly, chinese resident account majority issuance. further, plan announce allow chinese resident invest rmb approve offshore destinations. the second condition currency use transaction non-residents. in particular, truly internationalise currency one where: i. non-residents will raise fund currency despite ultimately need another currency; ii. non-residents will hold unhedged exposure currency. china make progress area, but, date, progress remain relatively limited. there have, example, report non-residents issue rmb-denominated bond offshore market swap proceed home currencies. but general, still fair way go here, include development market would support use rmb way. ultimately, progress internationalise rmb inextricably link china’s transition towards capital account liberalisation flexible exchange rate. experience elsewhere around world, include australia, suggest extensive 2 bi central bankers’ speech exchange control highly manage exchange rate unlikely consistent internationalise currency. the chinese authority understand signal intention liberalise capital account move flexible exchange rate. we saw late step transition last week daily trade range rmb u dollar widen ±1 per cent ±2 per cent. while journey clearly gradual one, i suspect year ahead, liberalisation chinese capital account could turn one really significant event global capital markets. to date, much capital outflow china intermediate – indirectly – people’s bank china intervention foreign exchange market accumulation $us3½ trillion foreign reserves. at point, control capital outflow lifted, model likely change. a does, non-official sector become increasingly responsible manage foreign asset chinese residents. a cifr’s report notes, transition likely associate increase outflow private capital.1 this likely lead change type foreign asset chinese entity hold could significant implication asset market country receive inflows. the increase private capital outflow also likely lead increase demand hedge product chinese entities, least entity want hedge currency risk new offshore investments. this grow demand expect support development foreign exchange market china. the ability hedge foreign exchange risk – alongside ability denominate foreign liability local currency – important ingredient help ensure benefit associate open capital account flexible exchange rate outweigh potential financial (in)stability costs. indeed, development deep liquid hedge market one reason australia’s experience capital account liberalisation exchange rate flexibility work well. when first move fixed, managed, float exchange rate regime 1970s 1980s, market particularly well developed, since mature significantly. in large part, occur organically response increase demand hedge product arise exchange rate become variable. this may well case china too. this positive feedback loop liberalisation market development also important lesson experience: liberalisation occur hard market develop, market develop hard liberalise. but gradual process liberalisation promote market development stability make easy liberalise further. one element positive feedback loop great use rmb trade invoice chinese firm allow firm reduce currency mismatch balance sheet thus alleviate potential vulnerability could otherwise arise flexible exchange rate regime. another that, capital account liberalisation proceeds, entry non-residents china’s domestic financial market increase depth markets. and non-residents become will take rmb exposures, pool potential counterparties chinese entity seek hedge foreign currency liability also increase. 1 centre international finance regulation (2014), “internationalisation renminbi: pathways, implication opportunities”, research report, march. available <http://www.cifr.edu.au/site/research/targeted_research_rmb_internationalisation.aspx>. bi central bankers’ speech 3 nobody know precisely whole process rmb internalisation play out. this partly historical precedent economy china’s size relative stage development integrate global financial system complex interconnect see today. there are, professor eichengreen highlight paper, array challenges, risk uncertainty inherent china’s transition open, market-based economy. in way task china difficult country make journey, include australia. first, much international scrutiny rest world strong interest outcome. and second, china’s financial sector already large relative gdp mean setback reform process could significant effect broad chinese economy. that said, australia’s experience guide, journey turn positive one. for us, financial reform integration capital market global system deliver basis sound macroeconomic policy, diversify portfolio australian investor development tool hedge risks. but journey without trouble much learn along way. at beginning, risk management skill australian bank inadequate cope world much free access foreign capital credit long rationed. regulator also ill-equipped provide effective supervision. the combination institutional weakness intense competition among bank manifest prominently bubble, eventual bust, commercial property price late 1980s. today, china go adjustment pains. but forget internationalisation rmb hold promise benefit internationalisation australian dollar deliver u australia. the effect felt china itself, throughout world. amongst things, open china’s capital account process rmb internationalisation may well elevate rmb international reserve currency status. while still look way off, would represent profound change nature international monetary financial system. some potential impact explore u prasanna gai’s paper conference. some implication australia i would like briefly touch implication rmb internationalisation u australia. it perhaps state obvious say strong interest china’s financial reform journey successful one. financial reform play significant role promote economic financial stability major trade partner. furthermore, time, change structure chinese capital flow could significant implication capital asset markets. and, increase demand hedge product financial instrument could open new opportunity financial institutions. in immediate future, australia’s already strong trade link china grow financial linkage two country mean mutually beneficial opportunity rmb internationalisation.2 some explore cifr’s research report, discuss geoff weir late today. for example, australia’s fund management industry benefit increase investment opportunity within china inward capital flow china increase. it also benefit share expertise 2 i previously discuss aspect deepen financial relationship lowe p (2013), “the journey financial reform”, address australian chamber commerce shanghai, shanghai, 24 april. 4 bi central bankers’ speech chinese fund manager and/or provide direct fund management service chinese investor private outward capital flow china increase. similarly, use rmb trade settlement commodity market may also mutually advantageous. in context, result survey cifr conduct australian chinese firms’ attitude towards use rmb trade invoice currency particularly relevant. the cifr survey extend version early rba survey australian firm conducted, help local banks, lead-up inaugural australia-hong kong renminbi trade investment dialogue hold sydney april last year.3 the recent survey – kathy walsh present late today – highlight fact many chinese firm still aware rmb use trade settlement currency. more positively, impediment rmb trade settlement evident rba’s initial survey 2013 – particular, relate administrative burden payment delay – appear recently lessen somewhat. with second australia-hong kong renminbi trade investment dialogue come may, survey result highlight importance effort educate firm australia china rmb trade settlement process rmb bank hedge product already available. in regard, i welcome australian financial sector’s effort support development rmb market sydney, particular, ensure current future rmb product need australian corporates met, client ready access information. another encourage sign recent announcement two chinese bank operate sydney regard rmb clear services. conclusion the internationalisation rmb – china’s associate move towards liberalise capital account flexible exchange rate regime – potential create seismic shift international monetary financial landscape. and china clearly interest get process right, rest world – include australia – also strong interest outcome. history teach u financial deregulation inherently risky process, substantial payoff do well.

(1900–1930), cooperative movement originate due initiative colonial government early 20th century. the idea establish cooperative type work successfully germany moot late 19th century. these cooperative see mean liberate poor farmer clutch usurious money-lenders. the government pass cooperative society act 1904 follow comprehensive cooperative society act late 1912. in 1915, maclagan

cooperative credit structure (stccs) 10. since inception, cooperative make available institutional credit affordable cost particularly agricultural sector. the short-term rural cooperative credit structure (stccs) provide mainly short term medium-term production credit besides financial services. at present, nearly 92,432 primary agricultural credit society (pacs), 371 district central cooperative bank (dccb) 13,233 branch 32 state cooperative bank (scb) 992 branches. on average, one pac every 8 villages. these society total membership 120 million rural people make one large rural

security investment commission) annual forum 2014, sydney, 25 march 2014. * * * i would like thank ivailo arsov, mitch kosev david wakeling valuable assistance preparation talk. when i invite speak conference, asic organiser suggest topic “opportunities challenge market-based financing”. i please able accept invitation topic important one. it currently also highly relevant topic give australian government’s recently commission inquiry australian financial system. i would like start quote final report previous inquiry financial system – wallis inquiry hand find 17 year ago. in particular, report observed:1 the evolution financial system characterise continue struggle financial intermediary financial markets. while inquiry wary make precise predictions, quite strong sense report financial market would inevitably win struggle; time, market – include bond market – would become increasingly important connect saver borrowers. it think likely improvement technology access information would allow good differentiate price risk. and this, combine increase household save superannuation fund shift investment preferences, would give market edge traditional financial intermediaries, namely banks. while see step general direction, include finance mortgage residential mortgage-backed security (rmbs), thing exactly turn way. improvement information technology greatly improve access information. however, challenge turn much access information, use information well. it also turn households’ investment preference change much extent change, mainly reflect increase appetite equities. a result, market-based finance develop time, grab upper hand think likely time wallis inquiry deliver final report. one area attract considerable attention non-financial corporate bond market. some commentator lament fact australian market develop rapidly, business borrower still connect saver balance sheet financial institutions. some commentator also lament fact superannuation fund – see natural buyer corporate bond – seem limit appetite bonds. 1 see financial system inquiry (1997), financial system inquiry final report (s wallis, chairperson), australian government publish service, canberra, p 159. 2 bi central bankers’ speech give background, i think would useful briefly discus recent development australian non-financial corporate bond market well role superannuation fund come play intermediate borrower savers. i would like discus role market-based corporate finance play provide form insurance stress bank system possibility lack competition bank system. the australian corporate bond market by international standards, australian corporate sector make relatively little use bond market, especially domestic bond market. since mid 2000s, available internationally comparable data suggest average annual bond issuance australian corporation equivalent 1 per cent gdp, around two-thirds total issuance take place offshore, rather domestic market (graph 1). in country normally like compare financial markets, corporate sector make great use bond funding. graph 1 the relatively high reliance australian issuer offshore market evident data composition corporate bond outstanding (graph 2). currently, bond issue offshore account around 80 per cent outstanding value bond issue australian-based corporations. a decade ago, figure considerably low around 50 per cent. the offshore market favour company want raise foreign currency fund natural hedge foreign currency revenue. it also prove easy issue large amount long tenor offshore market domestic market. bi central bankers’ speech 3 graph 2 another perspective recent trend gain look data number credit rat individual bond issue domestically offshore (graph 3). graph 3 4 bi central bankers’ speech a number observation stand out: 1. the number australian company issue bond quite small. on average, recent times, around 30 bond issue domestic market per year, issue offshore market. in term size, offshore issue tend substantially large also tend long maturities. 2. during global financial crisis, issuance bond domestic market ceased, handful company go market 2008 2009. during period, issuance offshore market although number bond issue substantially low year before, after, crisis.2 this partly reflect high spread demand investor time. 3. there significant issuance aaa security domestic market prior financial crisis, although security credit wrap bond insurers. during crisis insurer wind follow large rat downgrades, segment market subsequently disappeared. 4. the publically available information indicate single corporate bond credit rat bbb- issue domestic market. in contrast, since 2000, around 30 bond rat bbb- issue offshore market australian corporations. 5. recently, pick-up number (and value) bbb-rated issuer domestic market. last year, total 16 bbb-rated bond issued, high number record. in another positive sign, average maturity bond noticeably long previous years. put together, australian corporate bond market relatively small size le well develop corporate bond market number countries. total outstandings domestic market amount around $50 billion compare total corporate debt outstanding much large $920 billion. notwithstanding this, regular activity occur market across much, although all, credit spectrum. and recent times, issuance appear pick little, particularly lower-rated companies. the role superannuation i would like turn issue superannuation fund role provision market base finance. this obviously important issue give rise share national save manage fund (graph 4). in late 1980s/early 1990s, little le 20 per cent flow new national save direct superannuation. today, figure almost double that. 2 the value issuance offshore market increase notably 2009, primarily due small number large bond issue major diversify mine companies. bi central bankers’ speech 5 graph 4 accord late figures, superannuation fund currently hold around $7 billion domestically issue corporate bond (graph 5). this represent around 15 per cent total outstandings domestic market, australian mutual fund non-resident investor together hold 60 per cent bond issue. all up, domestically issue corporate bond account le 1 per cent total superannuation assets.3 graph 5 3 superannuation fund also hold bond offshore market issue australian companies, although comprehensive data available. 6 bi central bankers’ speech one reason sometimes give superannuation funds’ relatively limit hold corporate bond fund strong preference equity – currently, around 50 per cent australian superannuation funds’ asset invest equities, whereas many country comparable figure le 40 per cent. this apparent preference equity is, however, partial explanation best. australian superannuation fund hold large portfolio fixed-income securities. however, within portfolio, many fixed-income security issue corporate sector. in contrast modest growth hold corporate bonds, superannuation fund purchase large volume bond issue overseas authorise deposit-taking institution (adis) base australia (graph 6). indeed, superannuation funds’ hold bank bond rise around $8 billion decade ago, around $40 billion today. this suggest issue much lack appetite bonds, rather relative risk-return liquidity characteristic corporate bond offer. graph 6 interestingly, superannuation fund also purchase significant volume bank liability bonds, include bank equity, bank short-term debt and, notably, bank deposit (graph 7). indeed, bank deposit amongst fast grow asset class superannuation sector recent times. a result developments, super fund currently hold $440 billion liability issue banks, represent 15 per cent bank sector’s total liabilities. so thing turn out, superannuation funds, rather finance corporate sector directly, help finance banks, turn finance corporate sector. in effect, see lengthen chain financial intermediation – saver superannuation fund bank borrowers. this quite financial disintermediation expect decade half ago. bi central bankers’ speech 7 graph 7 superannuation fund have, nevertheless, important source market-based fund another channel – namely purchase corporate equity (graph 8). over past decade, superannuation fund increase net investment australian equity equivalent around 2 per cent gdp per year, current dollar equal annual net new investment around $30 billion. this suggest natural reluctance superannuation sector corporate exposure, rather equity represent attractive option debt. graph 8 in context, one issue worthy analysis liquidity. give balance superannuation fund essentially “at call” move short notice, fund need ensure remain quite liquid times. this inevitably reduce 8 bi central bankers’ speech attractiveness relatively illiquid asset like corporate bonds. from one perspective seem slightly curious long-term retirement save move short notice. over time, may benefit explore arrangement conducive investment illiquid assets. doe matter? with fact background, i would like pose question whether really matters: matter whether corporate bond market matter size market is? after all, australian economy financial system perform well past two decade appear systematic difficulty corporate sector access finance. in answer question useful think implication corporate bond market overall stability economy efficiency financial intermediation. in term stability, one argument vibrant corporate bond market effectively act “spare tyre” – bank system get difficulty, bond market take place provide credit business thus allow economy continue operate relatively normally. the available international evidence broadly consistent argument, although transition bank finance bond finance time stress seamless one give event cause problem bank also cause market freeze time. nevertheless, severe downturns, market seem recover quickly banks, highly leveraged, find difficult time consume get back normal operations.4 interestingly, evidence also suggest mild downturns, bank tend stable provider credit markets. this partly reflect tendency bank long-term client keep support client can, whereas market abruptly shut time. the recent experience unite state europe provide illustration constructive role corporate bond market play time severe stress bank system. bank area capital constrained, face high cost raise fund diminish appetite lending. a result, time bank credit outstanding unchanged declining, outstanding value corporate bond issue rising, particularly unite state (graph 9). in term efficiency financial system, bond market play role competitive edge: ensure bank charge high price financial intermediation. we saw clear example 1990s australia. on occasion, mortgage lender make high return new mortgage loans, spread mortgage rate cash rate reach around 4¾ percentage points. the rmbs market emerge partly response time extra competition lead mortgage spread fall considerably. more broadly, corporate bond market improve overall efficiency financial system offer broad range maturity loan structure bank able, willing, do. 4 see example gambacorta l, y jing k tsatsaronis (2014), “financial structure growth” bi quarterly review, march, pp 21–35. available <https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1403e.htm>. bi central bankers’ speech 9 graph 9 so, effect, bond market see provide form insurance – insure time bank system stress process financial intermediation continue and, times, insure lack competition bank sector lead excessively high price financial intermediation. importantly, play role corporate bond market need able come life need – need spare tyre need provide competition. in perfect world, market would deep liquid times, i don’t think require market play important insurance role. instead need general infrastructure would allow market respond necessary. here, i think australia relatively well placed. the legal apparatus exist issue corporate bonds. the trade arrangement well established. we reasonable number financial institution able assist company issue bonds. we business experience market. and superannuation fund will purchase bond right price. this financial infrastructure mean confidence capacity corporate bond market fulfil important insurance role. from perspective, fact recent time corporate bond market australia relatively subdue compare market europe north america can, least partly, explain different outcome bank sectors. in australia, bank sound shape will lend. in contrast, many north atlantic bank severe difficulty little appetite new loans. indeed, lend rate charge euro-area bank often exceed cost bond market finance even fairly lowly rat company (graph 10). in environment, surprise bond issuance increased. 10 bi central bankers’ speech graph 10 in contrast, australia, rise cost bank fund recent year mean business able raise fund bond market cheaply obtain bank loan, number business find position relatively small. by large, australian bank system able meet finance need corporate sector. look forward, need ensure infrastructure support bond market remain place strengthen time. this strengthen gradual process step direction recent times. these step include: effort simplify prospectus requirement retail vanilla bond ease personal liability company directors; improve market transparency rba’s publication new measure corporate bond yields; lengthen government bond curve; list certain fixed-income security australian security exchange. these welcome developments. conclusion in conclusion, let try briefly summarise. bank-based finance remain dominant form finance australian companies. superannuation fund prepare finance bank effectively outsource credit assessment function much corporate sector. partly result, development deep liquid corporate bond market still work progress. but equally important observation infrastructure could support strong active bond market time stress inadequate competition. in way, infrastructure provide form insurance. we need make sure nurture infrastructure continue confident corporate bond market needed. give perspective, i think probably good think market institution complements, rather engage type struggle supremacy. thank much listening. bi central bankers’ speech 1 timothy lane: financial benchmark – question trust remark mr timothy lane, deputy governor bank canada, osgoode hall law school schulich school business, toronto, ontario, 24 march 2014. * * * thank opportunity speak today subject centre much attention recently. this city, like others, depend trade commerce thrive. at root successful trade commercial relationship trust party transaction deliver agreed. many institution develop throughout history support trust. among basic standardize unit measurement. more broadly, trust found rule law element good governance. trust also fundamental importance world finance. that trust shake recently series headline relate financial benchmark london interbank offer rate, libor. today, i discus use financial benchmarks, use them, headline re-establish trust vital well-functioning financial system. what financial benchmarks? financial benchmark use variety contract specify what, much money, deliver particular dates. one example floating-rate debt, borrower pay lender amount interest base benchmark vary one period another accord select measure interest rates. benchmark also particularly important derivative interest rate swaps, critical tool risk management. when benchmark function should, straightforward technical element world finance. they intend provide unbiased, arm’s-length measure underlie market prices. what go wrong? but financial benchmark recently make headline – wrong reasons. these benchmark include libor foreign exchange rate benchmark (commonly know “fx fixes”). a allege misconduct relate benchmark investigated, firm pay multi-billion-dollar fines, high-flying trader lose jobs. these headline damage trust. they raise doubt whether key financial benchmark fact provide unbiased, arm’s-length measure actual market conditions. at extreme, could even see raise question integrity wide financial system. let’s look problem arisen. libor first, let’s take libor. libor emerge eurodollar market develop london late 1960s 1970s. in particular, develop response rise syndicate eurodollar loan market demand tool manage risk exposures, include arise 2 bi central bankers’ speech make loans. these tools, know today interest rate derivatives, need common benchmark could commoditized easily, libor common rate. libor first officially publish new year’s day 1986. a interest rate benchmark, libor use measure prevail interest rate range major currency maturity overnight one year. and, although originate loan markets, come dominant benchmark wide range cash derivative markets. libor – equivalent currencies, collectively know “ibors” (interbank offer rates) – use determine float rate pay us$500 trillion dollar interest rate derivative contracts, well many trillion floating-rate loan securities. libor calculate base submission panel banks: bank responsible estimate cost could borrow unsecured interbank market banks, various maturity various currencies. libor calculate average estimates, drop high low figures. banks’ individual quote also make public – deter anyone submit wild number influence average. the important thing remember libor every submission base directly actual transactions. for example, global financial crisis 2008, interbank market essentially dry up, especially long maturities, bank still contribute benchmark. now let turn problem emerge regard libor. the first signalling. in circumstance height recent crisis, interbank credit condition become increasingly difficult, bank could become reluctant report high estimate peer fear would interpret signal creditworthiness deteriorating. the second problem manipulation, stuff headlines. the focus libor survey response individual firm biased, view profit trade positions. of course, extent kind misrepresentation occurred, criminal behaviour authority treat such. foreign exchange fix now let move foreign exchange benchmarks. foreign exchange benchmark typically calculate actual spot trade short predetermine time period (or “window”) day. it allege foreign exchange trader large financial institution exchange information clients’ order view position advantageously market. the suspicion collusion – suggest email chat-room discussion come light – take seriously. the existence collusion cannot inferred, though, volume trade fix window. bank may want execute many trade fix window, instance, customer want transact fix price, bank therefore look offset position around fix manage market risk. issue relate fix designed, use bank customers, examine global authorities. what done? to address problem associate benchmarks, two option present themselves: reform replacement. we reform exist benchmark strengthen governance enforce procedure provide adequate check conflict interest collusion. or, replace robust alternative benchmarks. in bi central bankers’ speech 3 fact, likely neither solution sufficient itself. we need both. reform benchmark the first step reform benchmark clarify governance. who direct responsibility set benchmark assure integrity? what kind governance exist within financial institution determine benchmarks? and oversee process make sure safeguard appropriate? last summer group financial market regulator around world, international organization security commission (iosco), release principle financial benchmark – set best practice aim answer questions. these principle outline framework governance administration financial benchmarks, include roles, responsibility internal control require benchmark’s administrator. attention pay additional control necessary survey-based benchmarks, particular cause concern. replace benchmark the second option, replace exist benchmark new ones, challenge two reasons. first, may difficult find superior alternative benchmark, robust also capture relevant economic exposures. second, even suitable alternative identified, make transition may straightforward matter. the iosco principle outline desirable feature robust financial benchmarks. notably, call benchmark anchor observable transaction active underlie markets. one could consider go further: rely actual market price benchmarks. indeed, case – instance, short-term repo market – underlie market sufficiently liquid reliably support benchmark simply average rate participant transact. in cases, market price could least use cross-check survey-based measure, even cannot use directly calculate benchmark. in cases, may hard find suitable market price track desire aspect market conditions. if replacement benchmark fully reflect economic exposure hedged, hedger able manage risk effectively. moreover, absence appropriate governance, control regulation, market price also subject manipulation. benchmark derive solely transaction also face challenge determine benchmark rate transaction relevant market particular day, indeed whole series day – example period stress. even superior alternative benchmark could find markets, several issue would need address make switch. exist benchmark already write enormous number contracts, could still years, decades, run. these contract would close and/or rewritten, raise issue coordination legal risk. take concern account, last year financial stability board (fsb) establish steer group regulator central bank help coordinate upcoming review exist benchmark iosco’s standard examine feasibility develop alternative benchmarks, least markets. the main focus major global interest rate benchmarks: libor, euro interbank offer rate (euribor) tokyo interbank offer rate (tibor). this steer group work market participant around world evaluate possible 4 bi central bankers’ speech alternative benchmark identify look way mitigate issue might arise transition. when work complete, find help inform view possible alternative financial benchmark currencies, include canadian dollar. similar international work recently launch examine foreign exchange benchmarks. cdor – a canadian case move close home, main benchmark canadian-dollar interest rate canadian dealer offer rate (commonly know cdor). it use determine interest payment can$130 billion floating-rate note payment us$9.3 trillion canadian-dollar interest rate swaps1 well can$750 billion exchange-traded derivatives. give cdor’s importance, make sure robust essential whole canadian financial system. so cdor come from? cdor rate bank will offer credit company bankers’ acceptance (bas). cdor determine daily survey seven market participant hold 10:15 every morning. in simple process, high low rate drop final five rate averaged. while number bank panel may look small, represent key player ba market, originate close 99 per cent approximately can$67 billion outstanding ba canada. thus, although cdor similarity libor, different animals. cdor bank lend rate, rather bank borrow rate. another difference average secondary market transaction data, derive underlie market remain sizeable. this contrast unsecured interbank markets, basis libor, generally shrink substantially since crisis. also, since bank commit lend company ba line base cdor, borrower choose maturity borrow, le likely rate would subject problem i discuss earlier. these feature cdor provide reassurance – indeed, problem similar financial benchmark reported. nonetheless, give vital role cdor play financial system, canadian authority judge essential examine cdor closely light new iosco principle experience interest rate benchmark elsewhere. strengthen governance cdor in 2012–13, initial step toward strengthen governance cdor, investment industry regulatory organization canada (iiroc) review exist practices. the focus review panel members’ supervisory practices: specifically, cdor submission calculated, participates, supervises, regulatory jurisdiction. it intend investigation potential wrongdoing manipulation cdor. the iiroc review note inconsistency procedure among different institutions, failure case document procedures. iiroc also identify need strengthen independent compliance oversight rate set complement business supervision procedure conflict-of-interest protocol within institutions. action underway, official community industry, address issue highlight review. give cdor base banks’ issuance bas, 1 bank international settlements, triennial central bank survey, “statistical release, otc derivative statistic end-june 2013,” november 2013. bi central bankers’ speech 5 cdor submission come entirely bank rather dealers, relevant authority agree banks’ cdor submission process appropriately regulate banks’ regulator, office superintendent financial institution (osfi). accordingly, january, osfi announce that, consistent mandate expertise, supervise effectiveness governance risk control surround banks’ cdor submission processes.2 subsequently, recent budget, federal government announce intention include regulation-making authority bank act cover bank submission financial benchmarks. furthermore, bank cdor panel should, fairly soon, release submitters’ code conduct develop consultation iiroc bank canada. in addition provide formal definition cdor requirement submitter, code specify minimum standard submission methodology, internal oversight record retention. work continue strengthen aspect governance cdor meet principle establish iosco. for instance, discuss industry need establish formal administrative arrangement cdor, industry begin work take forward. other canadian benchmark while cdor probably important financial market benchmark canada, also important ensure significant benchmark well design appropriate governance, line iosco standards. one obvious example canadian overnight repo rate average (corra). although le widely use cdor, corra important canadian financial system, since reference rate overnight index swaps, sizable derivative market. corra calculate base actual transaction overnight market.3 although own bank canada, calculate publish rate basis data submit brokers. work begin look change may need corra give new iosco standards. i expect that, progresses, work need involvement range stakeholders. turn foreign exchange rates, bank canada post indicative exchange rate base market transaction market quotes, information purposes, benchmark. nevertheless, rate seem use benchmark financial transactions. while evidence market manipulation affect bank canada’s rates, review rate consider change may appropriate. we examine post rate currently use market participant see possible change could affect market functioning. conclusion we’ve cover technical ground, basic thrust simple. we need good governance maintain trust myriad financial contract economy built. 2 see office superintendent financial institutions, “oversight cdor benchmark-setting submissions,” 13 january 2014. 3 specifically, weight average general collateral repo trade take place daily three interdealer-brokers. 6 bi central bankers’ speech i’ve talk key financial benchmark jurisdiction fall short requirement do rebuild trust, internationally canada. the introduction implementation iosco benchmark principle help ensure great integrity governance

(cibil) incorporate august 2000. cibil launch credit bureau operation april 2004 commercial bureau operation may 2006. follow enactment credit information 2 bi central bankers’ speech company (regulation) act (cicra) 2005, three credit information company (cics) also set up. 4. at level regulator, credit registry play pivotal role provide insight drive effective policy changes. they also provide important input bank supervisor monitor systemic risks. a use regulatory level may analyze appropriate capital provision strategy bank and, particular, ass whether current capital provision regulation match actual risks. for cics/credit registry effective, integrity completeness data one essential pre-requisites. however, i allude little bite earlier, even 10 year existence, credit information companies/bureaus able penetrate market meaningful way. there whole host issue impede growth acceptance cics india quality data submit lenders, multiplicity cics, use alternate data consumer protection major ones. with view overcome issue challenges, rbi set committee (chairman: shri aditya puri, md, hdfc bank limited) examine issue also recommend data format furnish credit information cics credit institutions. the committee also mandate suggest best practice guidance credit institution respect usage credit information part credit appraisal process. the final report committee awaited. information action: essential pre-requisites 5. let turn theme conference “information action.” what need put ‘information action’? in context conference, essentially mean available credit information extensively use draw inference make lend decisions. some might know i student statistics; hence, i would use analogy discipline explain condition information use decision making. in statistics, sample data use draw inference population parameters, estimate satisfy four basic characteristics. these “unbiasedness”, “consistency”, “efficiency” “sufficiency”. similarly, credit information use facilitate effective lend decisions, information also satisfy four important characteristics. let explain one one. (a) unbiasedness: when i say information unbiased, basically mean information gather bias favour consumer, lender borrower. the cic say inaccurate rat arrive due wrong data provide bank. the onus cics ensure data gather error-free able give unbiased information customers. (b) consistency: the credit worthiness borrower consistent accurate. if one cic rate borrower good one rate bad, mean credit information system consistent. likewise, rat borrower vary one loan product other. (c) efficiency: an efficient information system ensure cics able provide reliable, accurate unbiased information least possible cost. (d) sufficiency: the credit information system consider sufficient contain require credit payment relate information borrower cic give additional material information credit history particular borrower. bi central bankers’ speech 3 completeness information 6. while i agree stage may close meet four essential constituent robust information system, i would like emphasize unless strive meet them, would able transform information action. a important consideration meaningful transformation credit information action completeness data. around 90% population never borrow formal financial system hence credit history. under circumstances, quite likely deny credit lend institutions. how completeness data achieve cases? i return aspect little while. quality data 7. a central strand completeness information quality data. the efficiency effectiveness credit bureau largely dependent quality data collect database. rbi issue guideline submission timely, accurate error free data bureau. however, observation data furnish bank cics many instance continue incomplete / inaccurate. a know, quality product good bad inputs. the data contain junk values, incorrect information incomplete identifier field feed lender cics would lead half-baked output eventually contribute create information asymmetry borrower lenders. while, i understand quality data hold microfinance institution borrower comparatively better, quality consistency data bank system reliable hence, pose significant challenge effectiveness credit information system. the cics india try address issue take recourse prove best practice support technology ensure credit information render accurate, complete updated. they also start undertake quality check receive upload members’ data return record reject validation process back member along reason thereof, correction re-submission. 8. it hearten note result effort take cics clean data positive reflect improve ‘hit rate’ cics. i understand even develop economy like us, credit bureau existence century well evolve identification verification systems, bureau hit rate around 85%. so, hit rate around 75% case indian cics face significant roadblock like lack unique identifier geographic cultural diversity consider good, definitely scope improvement. alternate data source 9. let come another strand completeness. a i mention little back, sizeable number individuals/small business owner may prior credit history. so, completeness data ensure cases? certain world bank study indicate inclusion report non-financial payment data (alternative data) prof extremely beneficial make lend decisions, specifically segment access credit. the financially exclude consumer positive payment record non-financial obligations, access affordable credit. cics request rbi permit collaborate sector like telecom, utility trade credit inclusion data credit bureau database. they state inclusion data source bureau database benefit financial sector also useful telecom, utility trade credit sector. the committee comprehensive financial service small business low income household (dr. nachiket mor, chairman, december 2013) suggest inter alia, need develop robust legal regulatory framework around customer data generate various transaction (credit payments, digital off-line), objective customer ownership 4 bi central bankers’ speech transaction data use, among others, signal credit-worthiness. in regard, committee recommend rbi constitute work group comprise trai, cerc, credit information company develop framework share data telecom companies, electrical utilities, credit bureaus. the suggestions/recommendations committee presently examine rbi. single v/s multiple cics 10. there view existence multiple credit bureau economy ensure competition create cost advantage users. however, consumer well financial institution complete understand benefit bureaus, could lead disaster. due function multiple bureaus, fragment view borrower obtain holistic financial picture may hard achieve. it suggest several quarter environment infrastructure exist all, initial impetus may come government/regulator. in model, initially could single cic; late on, model multiple player could evolve avoid monopolistic environment. in addition, besides set bureaus, government/regulator may also need work towards education awareness both, financial institution also consumers. 11. in india, set cibil herald begin credit information system decade ago, credit information company (regulation) act, 2005 (cicra) provide increase total number cics may grant certificate registration carry business. thus, realisation competition bring good technology efficiency system, three company issue ‘in-principle’ approval set cics april 2009. 12. with least 3 year multi-cic environment behind us, problem data fragmentation come fore. cics collect credit information bank financial institutions, non bank financial companies, house finance companies, micro finance institutions, credit card companies, etc. today. in term section 15 cicra, every credit institution become member least one cic. since four cics functional, consequent issue data exist silos. a now, enquiry make one cic certain borrower prospective borrower, information provide cic member would available cic. the information credit institution borrower may avail credit facility member particular cic, may include credit information report provide it. this another challenge regard completeness data. data commercial account 13. the database cics primarily use retail segment, especially approve credit cards, personal loans, home loan auto loans. anectodotal evidence show major chunk account private bank foreign bank public sector bank recently start use significant way. in commercial segment, use bureau extent. smes big growth driver economy, account majority job exports. inadequate credit flow one factor constrain growth sme sector. one reason banks’ reluctance lend group unavailability reliable information bank ass creditworthiness sme units. there significant role cics build information base smes assist bank credit decision making. this facilitate free flow credit smes would provide impetus overall economic growth. the cics would progressively need enlarge information database bring sector fold. 14. a i mention earlier, committee head shri aditya puri also look issue low usage credit information member institutions. we understand bi central bankers’ speech 5 bank complain high cost obtain report one consideration low usage credit information. on contrary, cics view price would come increase usage. in context, committee felt workshop create awareness credit information report (cirs) use credit appraisal lender would meaningful could hold regularly, association industry-level body like iba mfin. unique identifier 15. a study august 2005 “the evolution credit bureau asia-pacific” recognise challenge relate data quality consumer identification issue cics india (at point cibil existence) need overcome. sadly, challenge continue plague system. a bank india inadequate electronic data capture system inadequate network facilities, problem encounter data-collection may magnify multi-fold. notwithstanding massive number unique identity generate uidai, country whole single official national identification registry uniquely identify individual. on part bank supervisors, despite continuous persuasion, indian bank able assign unique identification number customers. cics try work around problem sometimes use ration card number, voter id, pan aadhaar number combination these. however, result much scope improvement since mix-up credit information result customer grievance. customer grievance redressal mechanism 16. the credit report knowledge guide recognise “a challenge data accuracy validation lack uniform identification schemes. issue national unique identity number usually within prerogative government. adopt identification system initial phase establish credit report system would ideal, always realistic.” in scenario, credit institution cics must customer friendly policy place. credit institution ensure record submit cics update regularly. customer grievance redressal give top priority especially respect complaint relate updation/alteration credit information. cics, end, structure systemic process redress grievances. they abide period stipulate cicra respect updation, alteration credit information, resolution dispute etc. sum 17. i quite agree significant hurdle achieve completeness information term meet four fundamental criterion unbiasedness, consistency, efficiency sufficiency i mention beginning. some deficiency completeness data/information overcome use good analytical tool cics. in regard, cibil could leverage upon association global leader like transunion provide much good solution member institutions. a robust customer redressal system would also go long way improve quality information, make lender aware importance provide accurate data. the cics need sensitive grievance customer provide redressal timely manner. this would improve quality data also lend credence utility credit information system country. 18. notwithstanding data quality completeness issues, lend institution start use information decision make process unless institution use data/information cics decision make process price loan products, completeness information cannot expect improve. 6 bi central bankers’ speech share information individual’s privacy right / share personal information 19. have dwell upon essential pre-requisites transformation information action let highlight issue protect individuals’ privacy right insofar cics business concerned. a per fslrc report, personal information mean information relate person permit inference person’s identity. this include demographic information person’s name contact information; biometric information; transactional information hold deal financial product services. the draft code provide follow protection personal information: • a prohibition collection personal information beyond require provide relevant financial service. • a requirement maintain confidentiality personal information, unless consumer consent disclosure otherwise permit law. • an obligation maintain accurate, up-to-date complete personal information, allow consumer reasonable access personal information. • power give regulator specify additional requirements, exempt financial service provider application protection establish mechanism ensure consumer access personal information 20. the activity credit bureau regulate almost everywhere prevent violation privacy civil liberties. privacy law effect wide range issue affect individual, viz., limit access credit information specify user (i.e. credit institution entity allow use information), set time limit long information maintain cics, right access, check correct one’s credit information. 21. in india, various provision cicra cover regulation credit information business also include responsibility bureaus, right obligation credit institution safeguard privacy right individual. we understand credit information individual cics reflection behave relation lender/s. if he/she good borrower, record repayments; else record default build up. this akin reputational collateral use cics provide picture individual prospective lender. in cases, exist lender may like review portfolio evaluate function individual borrower post disbursal credit also determine payment-performances take turn worse. it may emphasise credit information report build store credit information say whether borrower prospective borrower good credit risk bad credit risk. it provide lender data allow take decision themselves, depend risk-reward trade-off internal policies. this give comfort take inform decision base credit information available within system. 22. it uncommon question “why information pass around system?” raised, even today context. the provision cicra seek strike balance dual objective put place efficient system share credit information large interest financial system one hand, maintain privacy information, other. a part customer education awareness efforts, cics able effectively communicate benefit low interest rate consumer may derive perceive ‘good borrowers’. bi central bankers’ speech 7 recent regulatory / supervisory measure let turn attention recent regulatory/supervisory measure initiate area. (i) central repository information large credits(crilc) 23. a know, dr. raghuram rajan assume charge governor, rbi announce rbi propose collect credit data examine large common exposure across bank enable creation central repository large credits, may share banks. this expect enable bank aware build leverage common exposures. the crilc expect act repository large credit contain system-wide exposure individual entity exposure (both fund non-fund based) rs. 50 million. thus, basic purpose crilc collect, store disseminate large credit data banks. the underlie objective creation crilc tackle menace rise npa indian bank system. i would like urge bank cics also put place system collect credit data exposure even rs.50 million, could reliable information borrower financial system. (ii) investment credit information company 24. rbi issue revise directive november 29, 2013, allow high fdi limit entity establish track record run credit information bureau well regulate environment. this regulatory measure aim bring much need foreign equity support also keep intact competition sector. a result measure, foreign partner cics take step increase equity stake cics thereby continue bring foreign technology support long gestation capital intensive industry. conclusion 25. before i conclude, let revisit reason credit information bureau include cibil, receive level success would expected, even decade existence. in essence, two user credit information, lend institution well consumer still wary output generate cics. while one hand, lender see compel reason subscribe cic report want appropriate information analytics, consumer hand still sceptical authenticity cirs. there numerous complaint cics hand incorrect report consumer run pillar post get corrected. the grievance redressal system area, fact, need thorough overhaul. thus, go forward, challenge cics indeed, cibil, virtual monopoly business address twin concern i mentioned. the purpose cics system would best serve credit need deserve people meet timely manner reasonable cost. 26. i sure conference would throw ‘actionable’ idea would go long way spread awareness credit information system country also improve it. i congratulate cibil reach significant milestone journey thank invite part conference. i wish fruitful deliberation ahead. thank you! references: the evolution credit bureau asia-pacific-

international finance corporation (2012) bi central bankers’ speech 1 takehiro sato: quantitative qualitative monetary ease – importance fiscal consolidation speech mr takehiro sato, member policy board bank japan, japan society, new york, 19 march 2014. * * * accompany chart find end speech. introduction thank you, mr. harris, kind introduction. distinguish guest member japan society. it great honor real pleasure speak today. a member policy board bank japan, i vote quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) last april. it strong desire ensure succeeds. at time, process overcome deflation, japanese government’s effort fiscal consolidation play vital role. it reason i talk fiscal consolidation today. today, i first explain current development japan’s economy. i focus mean price stability target stress importance flexibility monetary policy. i also talk effect price stability target financial markets. next, i explain importance fiscal consolidation range perspectives, include potential change balance payment save investment balance japan. in speech, i often refer optimistic scenario pessimistic scenario. the latter intend highlight importance government’s effort ensure fiscal discipline. it mean intend get bogged pessimism. i close speech note qqe fiscal consolidation. i. development japan’s economy it almost year since bank introduce qqe last april (chart 1). economic activity price broadly line baseline scenario present outlook report interim assessment (chart 2). in short, japan’s economy steadily pursue path achieve price stability target 2 percent. look ahead, effect consumption tax hike 5 8 percent april closely monitored. in judgment, japan’s economy entirely different 1997, consumption tax lift 3 5 percent. japan’s economy become much resilient tax hikes. on price front, bank’s policy board make follow judgment. exclude direct effect consumption tax hike, year-on-year rate increase core cpi, exclude volatile food, likely around 1¼ percent time. thereafter, expect reach price stability target 2 percent latter half fiscal 2014 fiscal 2015, economy continue grow pace potential growth rate. base outlook, policy board judge appropriate steadily pursue qqe current guideline asset purchases. ii. price stability target qqe a. price stability target flexible framework next, i explain mean price stability target, introduce january 2013 (chart 3). 2 bi central bankers’ speech under qqe, bank aim achieve target early possible time, time horizon two years. the policy framework price stability target flexible, like adopt major central bank overseas. specifically, monetary policy require long variable time lag effect permeate economy, thereafter prices. to achieve sustainable growth path context price stability, monetary policy need flexible. in words, examine current condition outlook economic activity prices. we also analyze various risk factor include accumulation financial imbalances. we take account development decide monetary policy. that i mean flexible. flexibility monetary policy widely share countries. particularly aftermath global financial crisis, major overseas economy become increasingly attentive flexibility monetary policymaking. from viewpoint, price stability target mean rigid superficial framework call inflation rate reach 2 percent surgical precision. it flexible practical framework accommodate need arise economic developments. put differently, price stability target aim achieve situation price rise. rather, aim achieve environment improvement overall economy result high wage high prices. in view, environment, degree latitude price stability target – upside downside – naturally required. furthermore, necessary make analysis broad perspective assess extent bank come close achieve target. that include examine recent development wage well core cpi, indicator policy board present assessments. b. qqe long-term interest rate i talk effect price stability target financial markets. under qqe, bank put strong downward pressure nominal long-term interest rate massive purchase jgbs. it also try raise people’s inflation expectation via accumulation monetary base. the combination two low real long-term interest rates. that unprecedented challenge. there different view extent massive supply monetary base real impact people’s inflation expectations. nevertheless, lift inflation expectation one remain policy option circumstances. after nearly 15 year deflation, medium- long-term inflation expectation around 1 percent stay low, compare advance economies. moreover, japan face zero boundary nominal interest rates. here, let recap qqe work nominal long-term interest rate transmission mechanism. nominal long-term interest rate combine two elements: one average future short-term rates; premium (chart 4). base understanding, bank specify forward guidance order produce effects. first continue qqe, aim achieve price stability target, long necessary maintain target stable manner. that effect exert downward pressure average future short-term rates. in addition, premium prevent widen massive purchase jgbs relatively long maturities. the qqe thus rely mechanism combination forward guidance asset purchase maintain nominal long-term interest rate low levels. that different happen central banks, federal reserve bank england, also depend similar unconventional monetary policy. under unconventional policy, nominal interest rate likely rise effect policy start occur, precede improvement economy prices. refer element i explained, future short-term rate likely rise market judge exit current ease policy hand. admittedly, need follow narrow path achieve objective qqe, challenge must meet. bi central bankers’ speech 3 a i explain shortly, limit extent central bank control nominal long-term interest rates. therefore, government’s effort fiscal consolidation vital. they become even vital deflation come end eventual exit deflation occurs. iii. importance fiscal consolidation a. overcome deflation change environment surround fiscal policy let explain fiscal consolidation important order overcome deflation. from optimistic viewpoint, medium- long-term growth expectation rise result overcome deflation, fiscal structure remain solid despite pick-up nominal long-term rates. that tax revenue increase nominal growth rate rises. the elasticity tax revenue generally high initial phase economic expansion, corporate tax likely contribute high revenue. on expenditure side, pace increase government’s interest payment cost remain subdue time. that due government’s debt management policy average maturity extended, government take advantage current easy monetary conditions. for reference, average maturity jgbs issue fiscal 2014 eight year five months. in light weak credit demand deflation, government build fiscal structure resilient possible rate rises. couple effect qqe, government’s borrow cost stay stably around 1 percent. by extend maturity jgbs, government effect able buy time liability side (chart 5). such optimistic view may entail risk. the age population continue put pressure additional fiscal expenditure, increase social security benefits. the age constrain labor supply supply side, change demand structure economy whole. unless economy respond change demand structure, reduce potential grow. if growth expectation rise materially due aging, fiscal structure remain vulnerable. take account demographic changes, good conservative. in judgment, fiscal issue remain even manage overcome deflation. b. recent development balance payment now, i talk japan’s balance payments. the current account surplus register 3.3 trillion yen last year. in year comparison made, low figure record 1985 (chart 6). behind that, trade surplus electronic appliance almost disappear fuel import increase materially suspension nuclear power plants. on quarterly basis, current account balance register deficit first time october–december quarter last year, expect remain deficit january–march quarter. have say that, deficit quarterly current account balance fundamentally reflect solid import thank resilient domestic demand due front-loaded increase demand prior consumption tax hike april. therefore, i expect current account deficit persist consumption tax hike. the deficit see recently take place somewhat unique circumstances. by contrast, accord “balance payment development stage theory”,1 current account balance change surplus deficit long run result demographic change. it look though recent increase fuel import accelerate 1 crowther’s “balance payment development stage theory” explain long-term pattern change country’s balance payment structure economy advance debtor creditor country, eventually one liquidate overseas assets. 4 bi central bankers’ speech change current account balance. the state economy – trade surplus deficit, current account surplus deficit – ultimately result people’s rational decision-making. it irrelevant social welfare perspective. that lead conclude appropriate say surplus good thing deficit bad. nonetheless, current account deficit continues, mean domestic save investment balance shift surplus deficit, possibility advantage japan achieve finance deficit ample domestic save might change long run. c. overcome deflation, save investment balance let elaborate nexus save investment balance overcome deflation. i start save investment balance deflation. in japan, excess save decrease household sector, whereas increase corporate sector (chart 7). put trend together, excess save private sector whole remain intact. behind that, company make priority downsize balance sheet repay debt light harmful deflationary expectations. put differently, deflation lead excess save private sector, enable government finance debt subdue borrow costs. thus, “deflationary equilibrium” prevailed. the equilibrium subject change qqe succeed japan’s economy overcome deflation. admittedly, easy predict save investment balance private sector look like deflation. in general, however, propensity import rise stimulate investment spending. that lead outflow income overseas. under circumstances, domestic excess save private sector likely shrink, reversal excess save excess investment. look corporate household sector separately, excess save corporate sector likely show clear decline. that because, overcome deflation, become rational company change strategy increase external debt finance investment. a household sector, economic theory say household save rate go age population. i note may case take account transfer government corporate sector (chart 8). in view, mindful possible decline domestic excess save qqe succeed japan move deflationary equilibrium. in light decline excess savings, fiscal deficit change, current account balance register deficit. we might long able finance government debt domestic savings. then, overseas investor ask high premium, possibly drive government’s borrow cost even higher. to avoid trap situation, mitigate shock associate situation, vital government continue sound fiscal management. that important term prevent problem associate shrink excess save surfacing. put differently, government need show firm commitment fiscal consolidation. moreover, government need implement path toward consolidation order avoid leave impression market serious issue. the scenario i lay contain number assumptions. in practice, end deflation generate high tax revenue nominal growth rate rises. that obviously good fiscal consolidation. thus, i repeat best avoid get trap pessimism. d. domar’s theorem fiscal sustainability generally mean future outstanding amount government’s debt relative gdp reach unmanageable level. in theory, summarize bi central bankers’ speech 5 current outstanding amount government’s debt relative gdp equivalent discount value current future primary balances. however, cannot derive threshold value outstanding amount government’s debt relative gdp say fiscal situation long sustainable beyond value. after all, whether fiscal situation sustainable depend much future primary balance look like wide range economic entity expect balance change. here, let come back equation determine fiscal sustainability. if economy grow rate interest rates, government able issue bond forever despite condition specify equation. that call domar’s theorem. this theorem often refer back-of-the-envelope calculation ass fiscal sustainability. in practice, interest rate likely stay growth rates, become common today ass fiscal sustainability condition domar’s theorem hold. in view, assess fiscal sustainability, interest rate compare growth rate term long-term bond yield rather average cost government’s borrowing. the cost could high low growth rate economy. indeed, government’s borrow cost consistently decline since begin 1990s, long-term bond yield begin trend downward. most recently, cost around 1 percent, well nominal growth rate (chart 1). under circumstances, government benefit “interest rate bonus”. look situation pessimistic viewpoint, may face “an interest rate onus”, government’s borrow cost remain high nominal growth rates. the japanese government already start take measure extend average maturity debts. we still time interest rate onus take place, meantime government make effort fiscal consolidation. e. overcome deflation bank’s response the next topic concern policy response bank might take see overcome deflation start effect long-term interest rates. after success qqe, people’s medium- long-term inflation expectation anchor around 2 percent, bank might possibly start move toward exit. market participant notice sign change economic activity monetary policy. under circumstances, nominal long-term rate might start adjust, well actual change policy. from purely macroeconomic perspective, change nominal rate consider result change people’s inflation expectations. such change may detrimental long real rate remain le same. more optimistically, high tax revenue overcome deflation expected, improve fiscal situation. from pessimistic viewpoint, abrupt change nominal rate might make fiscal situation severe possibly effect financial system. somewhat ironically, success overcome deflation might produce unfavorable spillover effects, give significant size government’s debts. in extreme case grave negative impact financial stability, central bank might choose either financial stability price stability, matter strongly commit price stability. once central bank long pursue price stability fear fiscal sustainability, might fall situation, know “unpleasant monetarist arithmetic”.2 2 see sargent wallace (1981) detail regard “unpleasant monetarist arithmetic”. 6 bi central bankers’ speech in view, must avoid pessimistic scenario unfolding. to end, bank stress-testing robustness japan’s financial system, take account possible change interest rate environment. furthermore, urge financial institution reinforce risk management take measure enhance profitability. in term relationship government, bank pursue monetary policy achieve 2 percent price stability target. that include process eventually exit current ease policy. we simply cannot accept situation monetary policy decision affect consideration fiscal policy. there question it. once financial environment changes, possible people pay attention relationship government central bank. expectation central bank’s operation support bond price might rise. however, free capital mobility, central bank’s involvement solve problem. to concrete, even though central bank increase operation government bond market order suppress government’s borrow costs, premium might possibly rise accord mechanism i lay today, judge market participant central bank’s operation weaken fiscal discipline. furthermore, market think rapid increase central bank’s balance sheet might cause inflation beyond level judge appropriate, anticipate future short-term interest rate might rise. in short, market judgment matter rather central bank’s intention. down road, social security spend expect rise due aging. that spend japan significantly high relative economy moment. however, vital government make seamless tireless effort make sure fiscal discipline remain firmly intact doubt market concern government’s intention toward fiscal discipline (chart 9). f. plausibility financial repression despite government’s determination achieve fiscal consolidation, appear still view state central bank conduct monetary policy consideration fiscal situation. those obsess view claim central bank continue massive bond purchase operation order avoid problem fiscal concern. they insist central bank involve operation long-term rate start pick around time exit. often refer “financial repression”, intention contain possible pick-up nominal rate central bank’s massive bond purchase order maintain fiscal sustainability. that remind “fiscal theory price level (ftpl)”.3 the ftpl state fiscal stimulus effective price stability. however, implicitly base assumption central bank financial repression. in words, suppose bond price maintain despite increase government debt result fiscal expansion. otherwise, private sector, hold government bonds, reduce spend due adverse wealth effect hence offset increase demand stem additional fiscal measures. under circumstances, output gap improve price rise. that said, whether central bank control bond price depend intention market judgment. it reason i emphasize importance fiscal consolidation. 3 see sims (1999), christiano fitzgerald (2000a, b), leeper (1991), cochrane (2000), woodford (1996, 2001) detail regard fiscal theory price level. bi central bankers’ speech 7 conclude remark a. government’s commitment fiscal consolidation now, let sum up. in speech today, i repeatedly emphasize importance fiscal consolidation. indeed, japanese government already say halve deficit primary balance relative gdp fiscal 2015 level register fiscal 2010. furthermore, commit turn primary balance deficit surplus fiscal 2020. those move constitute important part government’s commitment fiscal consolidation widely accept international community. accordingly, government decide raise consumption tax 5 8 percent april; moreover, tax rate schedule raise 10 percent october 2015. down road, may hear discussion concern whether consumption tax 10 percent enough make fiscal structure sustainable. whatever discussion might be, important acknowledge government take crucial first step toward fiscal consolidation, give mount social security spending. there question that, financial market understand government’s intention that. b. qqe base fiscal consolidation recent long-term rate stable light sign overcome deflation. that due effect bank’s jgb purchases. it also hinge fact market participant businesspeople full confidence government’s strong commitment fiscal consolidation. that enable bank conduct massive jgb purchase without trap fiscal dominance. the bank offer full support government’s commitment. the commitment fiscal consolidation government imperative qqe – design overcome deflation – perceive mean “financial repression”. at time, problem arise government create fiscal cliff, epitomize enforcement fiscal structure reform act mid-1990s. in practice, balance approach may require medium- long-term commitment fiscal consolidation short-term flexibility policy. even so, government ensure lose sight importance fiscal consolidation reinforce medium- long-term commitment front. thank you. 8 bi central bankers’

economic landscape, include challenge opportunities, thrift bank industry currently face backdrop asean integration. the chamber strategic way, clearly, understand one’s start point initial condition important define one’s final destination. the economy large let begin therefore economy large. it tempt simply cite array indicator show macro-economy strong. in 2013, saw convergence high growth stable price country post real gross domestic product growth rate 7.2 percent amid inflation three percent. this top real gdp growth 6.8 percent 3.2 percent inflation rate 2012. we need appreciate

support fee bank industry whose strength well documented. standard & poor’s late bank outlook (february 2014) note “philippine bank likely continue benefit country’s buoyant economic prospect 2014”. and moody’s bank report (2014 outlook date december 2013), philippine jurisdiction whose bank system rate positive outlook. thrift bank industry may small compare universal commercial bank peers. but mean leave behind. peso deposit mobilize grow 22 percent 1 typhoon pablo strong tropical cyclone ever hit mindanao. the zamboanga crisis 30-day stand-off. the earthquake bohol deadly earthquake philippine experience 23 year typhoon yolanda devastate typhoon record. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 2013, loan expand 13 percent, total resource rise 16 percent, profitability increase 18 percent. the challenge lie ahead all enough reason optimistic future bank industry. but financial market swiftly change course… everyone aware save take long time put together could investment lose value

future market consumer need potent. this say current consumer market already attractive. world bank data show, example, cellular subscription per 100 individual already nearly 107 philippines, high 94 subscription average bclmv country (brunei, cambodia, lao, myanmar vietnam), 66 subscription china, japan korea. our internet penetration rate far off, 36 internet user per 100 individual versus 40 average china, japan korea 45 user singapore, thailand, malaysia indonesia collectively. but develop young population tech-savvy, one surely expect number keep rising. i really mention big ticket item since area focus. but put record, see outstanding auto loans, credit card receivables residential 2 all data section take world bank’s world development indicator 2013 edition. bi central bankers’

consumer finance market, prospect seem tailor-fit you. in fact, within framework, philippine stand even specific demographic profile i describe earlier. doe mean corporate future secured? unfortunately, potential asean demographic advantage not, own, create balance sheets. there still strategic decision make tactical plan execute identify positive reflect reality balance sheets. what clear juncture market competition change traditional niches. internally, large bank extend network area small bank traditionally operate bank increasingly tap consumer finance space. externally, asean

importance micro, small & medium enterprises, msmes economy; • thirdly, i wish highlight recent initiative incentive government rbf msme sector; • finally, share think indigenous we, i’taukeis increase participation business. 1. the current state fiji economy lady gentleman, recovery fijian economy start 2010 gain much firm footing, despite continue sluggishness key trade partner economy period. the fijian economy estimate expand 3.6 percent last year follow 2.7 percent 1.7 percent expansion 2011 2012, respectively. we four year consecutive growth normally see history. last year, sector economy, exception mine fish sectors, contribute positively towards growth. this improve confidence attribute number factor increase spend government infrastructure development social welfare accommodative monetary policy reserve bank consequent easy access credit historical low interest rates. furthermore, concert effort government towards inclusive parliamentary democracy 2014 also major contributor regain confidence amongst investor consumer alike. the improve confidence well reflect major macroeconomic indicators. consumer spend buoyant throughout 2013 underpin good labour market 2 bi central bankers’ speech conditions, increase income tax threshold wage government workers, high inward remittance increase lend financial institutions. partial indicator value add tax (vat)

data november 2013 reveal total domestic export decline 2.7 percent. a allude earlier, import continue surge due pick-up demand across economy. a result trade deficit widen last year, though support extent favourable inflow tourism remittances. remittance perform exceptionally well last year reach new record $339 million. nonetheless, overall external position remain stable foreign reserve record

additionally, surge consumption investment spend expect continue even boost increase disposable income. confidence economy expect remain strong support sentiment express retailer business rbf’s business expectation retail sale survey suggest positive outlook consumption investment activity 2014. macroeconomic fundamental poise remain strong conducive growth business 2014. a grow economy therefore augur well micro, small, medium enterprises. 2. importance micro, small & medium enterprise (msmes) economy we recognise micro, small medium enterprise (msmes) play vital role economic development. they important engine economic growth le develop economy also advance nations. i sure know msmes important. i therefore re-iterate factor briefly: • it raise economic growth: in develop country asia, smes make bulk economies, high 60 percent gdp. in fiji, bi central bankers’ speech 3 approximately 4,200 register msmes, mainly agriculture, fishing, manufacture retail tourism sectors. it estimate msmes sector account almost 12 percent gdp 2013 value around $800 million. however, total outstanding borrow sector commercial bank $316 million end 2013 8 percent total loan portfolio. this show sector still largely untapped lot potential develop strong msme sector lead job creation, empower individuals, increase export investment turn economic activity. • it raise exports/investment: small business always stay small; grow. many large company like tappoos, motibhais, hotbread kitchen many others msmes. i confident small business grow help raise export investment fiji. they also help import-substitution thereby reduce import bill narrow trade deficit. • it create employment: small business answer unemployment problem. our formal sector cannot absorb school leaver – develop countries. the employment growth require future come small business sector. rough estimate suggest close 60 percent fiji’s labour force involve various form business fall head msmes. • it combat poverty: msmes also way combat poverty help u achieve millennium development goals. msmes allow people help rise poverty, supply mean provide basic need education, food, shelter clothing. smes give people dignity work living. 3. let move recent government rbf policy initiative support msmes over years, government rbf put place various incentive supportive policy create conducive

micro-entrepreneurs fiji. 4. i move personal observation us, i’taukeis succeed business • when i invite mr joe taoi deliver presentation, initial reaction i authority subject matter i experience private business. however, background accountant almost four decade experience central banker teach lesson i feel important share forum. my first advice aspire i’taukei businessmen woman revenue not equal profit. a lot businesses, include i’taukei business fail simple misconception. • secondly, invest business, first must learn save. a i’taukeis save rate much low compare others. if save, able start business use save equity borrow banks. build save prudent management finance critical u succeed businesses. • one challenge aspect financial business management i notice i’taukei business lack budget lack financial discipline. financial business literacy is, review, key success. • one reason many small business fail sell good credit. sell good credit mean cash flow small business affect result inability restock repay loans. in cases, credit become bad debt small business operate narrow margin low volumes, disastrous. when walk store own non-i’taukei, see notice prominently display say “no credit”. we therefore must follow rule “no kerekere” succeed business. • i often hear people say i’taukeis u succeed business. i totally disagree live testimony business successful. it therefore important tell we can succeed business otherwise battle lose contest begins. • a i highlight earlier, government introduce sme credit guarantee scheme. in view, facility well suit i’taukei take advantage interest rate loan exceed 10% p.a. government guarantee pay 50 percent whichever less, sme loan go bad. bi central bankers’ speech 5 our assessment i’taukei business people access facility 483 loan advance date. it is, therefore, important u take advantage facility well iseff attract maximum interest rate 5% p.a. • while i view i’taukei business must assisted, must also careful give much handout potential create “handout mentality responsibility accountability give free”. we must change hand-out mentality. • talk change behaviour easy importantly, go change them? we cannot business people. however, create right environment child future generation successful business. you may aware financial literacy integrate school curriculum teach primary secondary school fiji since 2013. a pilot program 28 school commence 2012. start early primary school level ensure citizen tomorrow financially literate important instill child form responsibility financial discipline early age. • finally, lady gentlemen, successful business people council room. you important role model mentor upcoming i’taukei business entrepreneurs. if look non i’taukeis note trick trade pass one generation another. i therefore urge i’taukei business leader please continue mentor people think start business start one. there good role model help succeed. i wish every success. may business venture continue bless you, family beloved country, fiji. vinaka vakalevu. bi central bankers’ speech 1 haruhiko kuroda: how overcome deflation speech mr haruhiko kuroda, governor bank japan, conference, hold london school economics political science, london, 21 march 2014. * * * introduction it indeed honor give opportunity today speak conference host london school economics political science. just one year pass since i become governor bank japan march 20, 2013. in short, past one year one mark challenge overcome deflation. the word deflation might remind price decline associate rapid contraction economy great depression 1930s. some might even look back much early episode downtrend price 20 year unite kingdom experience second half 19th century. what deflation actually like? why deflation problem? a i would expect nobody actually experience past deflations, might able conceive answer questions, could difficult true sense reality situations. therefore, speech today, i talk japan’s experience 15 year deflation try overcome that. let first ask question. what average annual rate decline consumer price japan past 15 years? the answer minus 0.3 percent. unlike rapid substantial price decline great depression 1930s, feature japan’s deflation extremely moderate price decline continue long period. the unemployment rate 5.5 percent bad scene jobless people predominate town, case great depression. this say weren’t problem simply decline price moderate. if regard price decline great depression fierce acute symptom, japan’s deflation come show symptom akin chronic lifestyle disease. once expectation price fall become built-in among public, real interest rates, obtain subtract expect rate inflation nominal interest rates, increase. of course, central bank cope situation low nominal interest rates, japan policy rate already low 0.5 percent 1995 little room reduce nominal interest rates. an increase real interest rate restrain business fix investment household spending, thus economic activity japan remain stagnant. in addition, deflation, hold cash deposit become good choice make investment, incentive launch new business take risk become weakened. in situation, japan’s economy lose vitality growth rate declined. it say moderate price decline gradually undermine japan’s economy. therefore, restore vitality japan’s economy let economy grow sustainable manner achieve 2 percent price stability target overcome protract deflation. a i describe later, overcome deflation, bank japan introduce last april quantitative qualitative monetary easing, dub qqe – unprecedented bold monetary ease – pursue policy. today, enhance understand bank’s initiative overcome deflation, i address three questions. first, japan’s economy unable overcome deflation? second, try get deflation? and lastly, far come process overcome deflation? 2 bi central bankers’ speech i. why japan’s economy unable overcome deflation? a i mention earlier, deflation continue japan since late 1990s, economy recession whole period. instead, recovery phase six years, begin 2002 early 2008, mark long post-war economic recovery. since 1999, overcome deflation, bank adopt ahead central bank various unconventional policy measures, zero interest rate policy, quantitative ease policy, commitment duration policies, purchase risk assets. if name commitment duration zero interest rate policy introduce 1999 eye-catching “forward guidance”, bank might receive honor inventor policy tool. however, despite tailwind real economy considerable effort bank, japan’s economy could overcome deflation. what lacking? to state answer first, lack central bank’s strong clear commitment achieve price stability target action work inflation expectation commitment. to begin with, look cause japan’s price declines, various factor effect point time. to name several, adjustment excess capacity employment bubble period, low-priced import emerge economy firms’ low-price strategies, financial institutions’ nonperforming loan problem financial system uneasiness, excessive appreciation yen. a actual price decline due factors, deflationary expectation price rise instead decline generate among people. subsequently, even factor induce price decline diminished, deflationary expectation become entrenched, people would make decision take action assumption price would rise. through process, deflationary expectation create self-fulfilling manner economy price easily rise. explain use jargon economics, japan’s economy situation phillips curve, express negative relationship inflation unemployment, shift downward due decline people’s inflation expectations. even economy trap situation, raise price temporarily rejuvenate economic activity stimulative policies. however, phillips curve remain shift downward, economy eventually return deflationary state economic activity decline business cycle. this japan’s economy could overcome deflation all, despite experience economic expansion several time deflation continuing. have analyze protract deflation occurs, let’s turn second question: require get protract deflation achieve 2 percent price stability target sustainable manner? a problem lie fact people deflationary sentiment price fall, dispel sentiment. we convince people situation price increase around 2 percent every year nothing special, change economy one people make decision behave base assumption. in words, necessary raise people’s expect rate inflation 2 percent re-anchor level. the bank repeatedly implement various leading-edge policies. while series policy stimulate economic activity, fell short show strong clear commitment achieve price stability target means. a result, insufficient work inflation expectation fail raise them. therefore, even face temporary rise prices, rise sustain economy could get deflation long period. ii. how overcome deflation let next talk bank try raise people’s inflation expectation overcome deflation. it clear result past policy deflationary sentiment embed protract deflation cannot easily dispelled. there examples. look back, one immediately think u.s. new deal policy bi central bankers’ speech 3 1930s episode people’s inflation expectation substantially rise short period time policy measures. at period japan, similar series macroeconomic policy measure call “takahashi economic policy”, name finance minister take initiative, implemented. in policies, exit gold standard enable foreign exchange rate adjust line actual economic conditions, macroeconomic policy combine aggressive fiscal monetary policy implemented. by contrast, powerful monetary tighten chairman volcker u.s. federal reserve (fed) end 1970s begin 1980s note episode inflation expectation substantially lowered. all event associate policy authorities’ strong drastically change economic situation, bold policy conversion underpin will. therefore, convert people’s deflationary expectation raise expect rate inflation, necessary demonstrate bank’s strong resolution commitment toward overcome deflation implement decisive policy sufficient achieve goal. we also make conversion expectation happen zero low bind nominal interest rates. take point account, monetary policy meet april 4 last year, bank introduce unprecedented large-scale monetary ease policy qqe. it policy, upon strongly commit achieve 2 percent price stability target time horizon two year mind, increase monetary base unprecedented amount 60–70 trillion yen underpin commitment. a result, monetary base double two years. in addition, aim achieve 2 percent price stability target, bank commit continue qqe long necessary maintain target stable manner. the bank clearly commit achieve 2 percent price stability target, time horizon two year mind, also continue unprecedented large-scale monetary ease qqe long necessary maintain target stable manner. we consider combination would raise people’s inflation expectation forward-looking manner. we also assume that, result, actual price start increase, would affect inflation expectation backward-looking manner well. and increase number people believe bank’s commitment, forward-looking influence would also strengthened. let specific transmission mechanism qqe. three transmission channel assumed: contain interest rate risk premium massive asset purchases, portfolio rebalancing, raise inflation expectations. what i would like focus particular channel start rise inflation expectations. a rise inflation expectation shift phillips curve upward, level economic activity, actual inflation rate higher. in addition, rise expect rate inflation, nominal interest rate rise le that, low real interest rate stimulate economic activity. that is, bank contain nominal interest rate massive asset purchase raise expect rate inflation, low real interest rates. in case central bank unite state europe, inflation expectation already anchor price stability target, choice reduce nominal interest rate order low real interest rates. however, case japan, inflation expectation level price stability target, room low real interest rate raise inflation expectations. a decline real interest rate stimulate business fix investment consumption, raise actual inflation rate narrow output gap. once price start rise, induce rise inflation expectations, turn work real interest rate decline again. in manner, virtuous cycle start rise inflation expectation take hold. 4 bi central bankers’ speech iii. how far come? so, far come toward goal achieve 2 percent price stability target overcome deflation? to state conclusion first, japan’s economy follow path toward achieve 2 percent price stability target expected, halfway there. the transmission mechanism qqe function initially intended. accord various survey market indicators, judge inflation expectation generally rising. due bank’s massive purchase government bonds, long-term interest rate hover stable manner low levels. in fact, face rise u.s. long-term interest rate 2 percent 3 percent relation speculation fed’s taper asset purchases, japan’s long-term interest rate stable recently around 0.6 percent. a result, real interest rate declining. there also change bank behavior. the year-on-year rate increase bank lend gradually accelerate around 2.5 percent. lend increase large firm also small firms, year-on-year rate change turn positive, suggest lend become widespread variety businesses. partly reflect development bank lending, year-on-year rate increase money stock gradually accelerating, hover around 4 percent recent months. in relation this, last month, bank expand lend facility support financial institutions’ initiative increase lend similar fund lend scheme bank england. the bank japan provide fund financial institution double amount net increase lend and, like long-term refinance operation european central bank, provide long-term funds. it provide fund four-year fix rate 0.1 percent. while bank’s main engine monetary policy qqe, facility design reinforce transmission mechanism policy. we take stance whatever achieve 2 percent price stability target. partly due effect qqe, japan’s economy grow potential growth rate lead domestic demand, real gdp growth increase year-on-year 1.5 percent average 2013, 2.5 percent measure fourth quarter fourth quarter. on employment front, unemployment rate decline 3.7 percent, close structural unemployment rate around 3½ percent. a outlook, japan’s economy expect continue moderate recovery virtuous cycle among production, income, spend work. on price front, year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) exclude fresh food minus 0.5 percent march last year, turn positive june, accelerate mark plus 1.3 percent january. it still low unite kingdom, almost level germany high continental european countries. the rate increase likely around 1¼ percent time, subsequently return uptrend, likely reach around price stability target 2 percent end fiscal 2014 fiscal 2015. achieve inflation rate 1 percent le year since introduction qqe beyond many people’s expectations. in fact, accord esp forecast survey, compile economists’ forecasts, projection year-on-year rate growth cpi january–march quarter march last year plus 0.4 percent. while introduce qqe confidence effects, many people development cpi seem positive surprise. when something occur differ expectations, people strong incentive change past view behavior. our work change deflationary expectation entrench time well people’s behavior expectation progress expected, strong reinforcement actual rise cpi. bi central bankers’ speech 5 a consumption tax raise 8 percent 5 percent april, expect decline demand tax hike follow front-loaded increase demand prior tax hike. base experience economy go recession consumption tax raise last time, 1997, concern outlook economy time well. however, look back 1997, economy one point recover plunge follow consumption tax hike, japan’s financial system instability outbreak asian currency crisis substantially affect subsequent economic deterioration. by contrast, present, japan’s financial system maintain stability emerge economy asia become resilient due partly accumulation foreign reserve establishment safety nets. in addition, japan’s employment situation far favorable 1997. take point account, bank belief that, japan’s economy temporarily decline immediately consumption tax hike, continue grow potential growth rate trend virtuous cycle among production, income, spend maintained. conclude remark a i mentioned, far, qqe steadily exert intend effects, japan’s economy follow path toward achieve 2 percent price stability target expected. of course, halfway steadily pursue qqe. a economy associate upside downside risks, examine make adjustment appropriate order achieve 2 percent price stability target. by firmly continue policy, i convince achieve 2 percent price stability target overcome deflation. in past 15 years, japan sleep want to. it that, even one person one firm want take new challenges, reward meet challenge could expect macroeconomic environment persistent deflation. with qqe government’s various initiatives, unlock “fallacy composition”. therefore, japanese firm originally equip excellent technology human capital start take new initiative again, economy price change dramatically. we let trend reversed. to end, make effort strong resolution. the day japan’s economy contribute global economy hand. bi central bankers’ speech 1 yoshihisa morimoto: economic activity price japan monetary policy speech mr yoshihisa morimoto, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, wakayama, 20 february 2014. * * * i. recent economic price development a. japan’s economy price 1. current state outlook japan’s economy i begin explain current state of, outlook for, japan’s economy. economic activity stop weaken turn 2013. the economy return moderate recovery path around mid-year domestic demand remain resilient, mainly due effect monetary ease various economic measures. japan’s economy since continue recover moderately domestic demand remain firm, although export somewhat lack momentum. business sentiment improve wide range industries, include small firms, regional term economic recovery spread national basis. take close look development demand, export show relatively high growth first half 2013 somewhat lack momentum since second half amid somewhat sluggish movement emerge commodity-exporting economies. a domestic demand, private consumption remain resilient trend, improvement employment income situation, front-loaded increase demand prior consumption tax hike observe mainly durable consumer goods, suggest particularly recent noticeable rise new car sales. house investment increasing. public investment trend upward, mainly reflect effect various economic measure implement thus far. business fix investment pick up, aggregate supply capital good – coincident indicator machinery investment – recently show relatively high growth improvement corporate profits, machinery order – lead indicator machinery investment – improve trend even manufacture sector, albeit fluctuations. take development whole, employment income situation improving, support resilient domestic demand, indicate virtuous cycle among production, income, spend maintained. a outlook, japan’s economy affect front-loaded increase subsequent decline demand prior consumption tax hike, likely continue grow pace potential, estimate around 0.5 percent, trend, virtuous cycle continue operate. japan’s export expect increase moderately overseas economy – mainly advance economy – recover moderately. meanwhile, business fix investment likely follow moderate increase trend, improvement corporate profits. private consumption house investment, albeit fluctuations, expect remain resilient trend, improvement employee income expect gradually become evident. public investment expect trend upward time being, support partly effect implementation supplementary budget fiscal 2013, remain high level. in bank japan’s january 2014 interim assessment october 2013 outlook economic activity price (hereafter outlook report), median policy board members’ forecast economic growth rate 2.7 percent fiscal 2013, 1.4 percent fiscal 2014, 1.5 percent fiscal 2015. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 2. price next, i talk price developments. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) item le fresh food turn positive june 2013 rise 1.3 percent december. the year-on-year rate change cpi, exclude price food energy-related good petroleum products, 0.7 percent december, improvement price spread across wide range item amid improvement aggregate supply demand balance, number item price rise exceed price declined. a outlook, year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food), exclude direct effect consumption tax hike, likely around 1–1/4 percent time effect upward pressure price petroleum product subside. thereafter, likely rise, reflect factor improvement aggregate supply demand balance due recovery japan’s economy well rise medium- long-term inflation expectation response fundamental change public’s expectations. the rate increase cpi likely reach around 2 percent – price stability target – toward latter half projection period, fiscal 2015. specifically, bank’s interim assessment january october 2013 outlook report, median policy board members’ forecast year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food; fiscal 2014 fiscal 2015, exclude direct effect consumption tax hikes) 0.7 percent fiscal 2013, 1.3 percent fiscal 2014, 1.9 percent fiscal 2015. b. major issue surround economic activity price i would like talk key issue concern assumption relate outlook japan’s economic activity prices. japan’s economy expect achieve sustainable growth virtuous cycle among production, income, spend – include wage increase recovery business fix investment – continue operate. however, japan’s working-age population downtrend due age population decline birth rate. for economy achieve high growth rate, important step effort secure sufficient labor force raise productivity, allow firm household raise optimism future income demand. positive development recently observed, progress labor force participation woman elderly, well firms’ effort growth sectors. in future, growth expectation gradually rise active effort government firm strengthen japan’s growth potential bear fruit, turn eventually lead rise japan’s potential growth rate. at point, i discus recent development overseas economy japan’s exports, business fix investment, employment income situation, inflation expectations, likely significant effect outlook economic activity prices. 1. development overseas economy japan’s export i first examine current development overseas economy ass japan’s exports. overseas economy – mainly advance economy – start recover, although performance remain lackluster part emerge commodity-exporting economies. a outlook, overseas economy – mainly advance economy – likely continue recovering. in january 2014, international monetary fund (imf) revise upward projection global economic growth world economic outlook, forecast global economy would moderately accelerate pace growth 3.0 percent 2013 3.7 percent 2014 3.9 percent 2015. look respective regions, recovery u.s. economy gradually become widespread employment income situation continue improve trend, firmness household spend spread corporate sector boost production, although effect winter snowstorm still observed. the benefit shale revolution also felt economy. look ahead, u.s. economy expect gradually see acceleration bi central bankers’ speech 3 pace recovery, lead mainly private demand, partly fiscal drag gradually fade uncertainty surround economy abate somewhat, mainly due progress fiscal debate. in european economy, business household sentiment improve trend financial market regain stability. in circumstances, private consumption pick up, albeit moderately, production start pick up. further development regard european debt problem, effort restore financial soundness, disinflationary trend warrant attention. nevertheless, economy likely continue pick up, domestic demand expect well export likely recover moderately. the chinese economy continue see stable growth back firm domestic demand include private consumption fix asset investment, although pace growth decelerate somewhat. it likely maintain stable growth, government – progress reform address structural problem – expect pursue policy measure take due account economic activity, although uncertainty remain include effect excess production capacity debt. regard emerge commodity-exporting economies, situation face structural problem fiscal deficit current account deficits, outflow fund background u.s. federal reserve’s reduction pace asset purchases. thus, continue attention warrant development economies, include effect economic activity. emerge economy china commodity-exporting economy whole likely lack growth momentum time being, longer-term perspective, positive effect recovery advance economy spill them. amid development overseas economies, japan’s export generally pick continue lack momentum. this may partly attributable structural factor include shift japanese firms’ production site overseas accompany increase local procurement part japanese manufacturers. fundamentally, however, lack momentum consider largely due sluggishness emerge economies, particularly asean economies, closely link japan’s economy. a outlook, export whole – include indirect export via asian economy china ny – likely increase moderately, growth rate advance economy unite state europe increase. 2. development business fix investment turn corporate sector, important increase corporate profit demand lead growth business fix investment. corporate profit recover back firm domestic demand development foreign exchange market. business fix investment pick whole, include manufacture sector, lag behind. go forward, business fix investment likely follow moderate increase trend backdrop improvement corporate profit effect monetary easing. in context investment profitability, profitability business fix investment likely improve extent monetary ease stimulus encourage investment likely strengthen, owe rise rate return capital due economic recovery combine decline real interest rate mainly reflect rise inflation expectations. a object investment, latent demand maintenance replacement equipment build up, reflect past restraint firms’ investment, become likely materialize. investment relate disaster prevention energy also expect increase. furthermore, firms’ medium- long-term growth expectation likely rise moderately, due partly positive initiative strengthen competitiveness growth potential japan’s economy, government’s regulatory institutional reform various tax reduction measures, well firms’ restructure efforts. in environment, business fix investment continue uptrend firms’ effort accumulate capital growth sector increase labor 4 bi central bankers’ speech productivity make headway, potential economic growth rate – real strength economy – also rise moderately. 3. employment income situation i would like talk employment income situation, one key factor achieve sustainable recovery domestic demand. private consumption recently resilient thank continue active spend elderly – baby-boom generation particular – underpin wealth effect rise stock prices. while active spend elderly expect continue firm work capture demand, key economic improvement well-balanced manner lie improvement income support private consumption. look current employment income situation, supply demand condition labor market continue improve steadily, active job openings-to-applicants ratio rise level observe prior lehman shock 1.0 unemployment rate similarly fall pre-lehman shock level 3.7 percent, mainly due resilient domestic demand. firm increasingly experience shortage labor, suggest fact employment condition diffusion index (di) (the proportion firm respond employment “excessive” minus proportion respond “insufficient”) late tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan) deep negative territory, particularly nonmanufacturing sector. reflect supply demand condition labor market, grow number firms, especially among industry increasingly experience shortage labor, ease make flexible hire criteria, adopt “hire-and-nurture” recruit method, involve support workers’ effort obtain qualification necessary jobs. at time, firm make progress term actively employ women, elderly, foreign nationals, increase diversity employment methods. this result active job search woman workforce, result recent growth labor force population. if diverse employment style gradually become establish sustain economic recovery, help secure sufficient labor force despite decline trend working-age population, underpin medium- long-term growth potential japan’s economy. the improvement supply demand condition labor market influence nominal wages. specifically, year-on-year rate change nominal wage per full-time employee become slightly positive, reflect increase overtime pay winter bonuses. in addition, hourly nominal wage per part-time employee remain modest increase trend year year. look worker whole, schedule wage per employee remain slightly negative year year, due partly increase proportion part-time workers, whose wage level relatively low. still, employment income situation improve whole, employee income – wage per employee multiply number employee – continue register year-on-year increases. go forward, improvement supply demand condition labor market continues, nominal wage expect put upward pressure gradually. regard wage negotiation hold spring, labor union demand wage hikes, include increase workers’ base wages. at time, grow number firm appear indicate willingness allow certain rise wage term total remuneration, include base wages. amid increase corporate profits, close attention pay whether firm carry wage hike extent, include increase schedule wages. 4. development price inflation expectation i turn price-related issues. japan’s economy follow path toward achieve 2 percent price stability target, expected, say year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) somewhat high bi central bankers’ speech 5 market expectation thus far. inflation expectation firm household also rise whole, likely remain increase trend bank’s quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe), due part rise actual inflation rate. however, since year-on-year rate increase cpi expect around 1–1/4 percent time, close attention still need pay whether medium- long-term inflation expectation rise expected. in addition, important virtuous cycle price rise wage increase operate effectively order price rise sustainable fashion. discussion effort raise productivity price development upcoming wage negotiation therefore monitor closely. ii. conduct monetary policy a. quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) 1. framework qqe next, i would like turn bank’s conduct monetary policy. in order japan’s economy overcome deflation early possible achieve sustainable growth price stability, bank introduce january 2013 price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi. then, april bank introduce qqe achieve price stability target early possible time, time horizon two years. specifically, bank decide upon following. first, view pursue quantitative monetary easing, bank decide increase monetary base – total amount currency directly supply economy (the sum banknote circulation, coin circulation, current account deposit hold financial institution bank) – annual pace 60–70 trillion yen, thus double two years. second, achieve this, bank purchase japanese government bond (jgbs) amount outstanding increase annual pace 50 trillion yen. in so, bank aim work interest rate across yield curve – include longer-term one – extend average remain maturity jgb purchase seven years. and third, bank purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) amount outstanding increase annual pace 1 trillion yen 30 billion yen, respectively. the bank continue qqe – consist measure – aim achieve price stability target 2 percent, long necessary maintain target stable manner. it examine upside downside risk economic activity prices, make adjustment appropriate. in order achieve price stability target, important create virtuous cycle price rise moderately along balance sustainable improvement economic activity accompany increase corporate profits, employment, wages. 2. effect qqe now i talk development since introduction qqe. the monetary base increase annual pace 60–70 trillion yen – line bank’s guideline money market operation – owe progress bank’s large-scale jgb purchases, reach initial projection 200 trillion yen end-2013. the bank intend increase monetary base 270 trillion yen – correspond much approximately 60 percent japan’s nominal gdp – toward end-2014. despite instability observe jgb market soon introduction qqe last april, market gradually regain stability bank implement detail money market operation measure maintain close dialogue market participants. qqe thus exert intend effects, favorable development spread economic activity financial markets. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the bank conduct qqe keep mind two key transmission channels, is, route effect qqe expect carry economy: (1) low real interest rate exert downward pressure nominal long-term interest rate raise inflation expectations; (2) portfolio rebalancing effect. in low real interest rates, bank first apply strong downward pressure nominal long-term rate tighten jgb market condition massive purchase jgbs. then, clear explanation determination achieve price stability target early possible time continuation massive purchase asset underpin determination, aim raise inflation expectation boost people’s expectation economy become revitalized. consequently, real interest rate could low extent pick-up nominal rate contain within extent rise inflation expectations. a spend behavior firm household influence real interest rates, decline rate would help increase firms’ households’ investment consumption. a recent developments, situation nominal long-term interest rate stable low levels, real interest rate appear decline trend back rise inflation expectation whole. real interest rate expect continue decline trend give bank’s large-scale jgb purchase put strong downward pressure nominal long-term rate inflation expectation rise line increase actual inflation rate. next, portfolio rebalancing effect describe effect produce bank’s asset purchases, encourage financial institution institutional investor shift asset portfolio toward lend investment risk asset stocks. the aggregate flow investment – include household – confirm investment stock investment trust well corporate bonds, addition lending, increasing, amount jgb hold decreasing. the increase partly attributable rise stock prices, increase amount lend still small compare monetary base. nevertheless, portfolio rebalancing – mainly characterize shift investment risk asset – likely gradually gather momentum firms’ demand fund continue strengthen give business fix investment expect continue moderate increase trend. with channel act together, likely aggregate supply demand balance improve actual inflation rate rise further. 3. development financial market meanwhile, financial condition remain accommodative. firms’ fund cost hover low levels, long-term average contract interest rate new loan discount decline 0.8–0.9 percent level, reach historical low. firm see financial institutions’ lend attitude improve trend. the di financial position small firm recovering, reach recent peak level see around 2006. in addition, number corporate bankruptcy low level, figure january 2014 low january since 1991. the amount outstanding bank lend around 2.5 percent, lend small firm extend across wide range industry climb observe year-on-year rate increase amount outstanding lending. issue condition cp corporate bond continue favorable. in circumstances, year-on-year rate growth money stock (m2) high around 4.5 percent. look financial markets, money market rate 0.1 percent level maturities. long-term interest rate stable historically low range 0.6–0.8 percent, even time overseas interest rate rise whole, u.s. long-term interest rate reach around 3.0 percent, mainly backdrop economic recovery. in addition, stock price rise substantially correction yen’s appreciation take place foreign exchange market. regard economic activity, front-loaded increase subsequent decline demand prior consumption tax hike expected. in make future monetary policy bi central bankers’ speech 7 decisions, important ass whether japan’s economy follow path toward achieve 2 percent price stability target expected, smooth relate fluctuation demand. at present, virtuous cycle continue operate effect qqe economic activity become pronounced. nevertheless, important continue carefully examine economic development effect monetary policy. furthermore, order fully ensure effectiveness monetary easing, essential government ensure market credibility fiscal consolidation. japan face serious fiscal imbalances, even international standards. if credibility fiscal management decline, long-term interest rate would likely rise manner inconsistent economic price developments. the government indicate aim halve primary deficit-to-gdp ratio fiscal 2015 achieve surplus primary balance fiscal 2020. base targets, expect government continue make effort toward fiscal consolidation. b. loan support program next, i discus bank’s loan support program. to support full use accommodative financial condition firm households, bank – addition implement aggressive monetary ease measure – establish loan support program. the program consist two measures: fund-provisioning measure stimulate bank lend (hereafter stimulate bank lend facility) fund-provisioning measure support strengthen foundation economic growth (hereafter growth-supporting fund facility). at monetary policy meet hold february 17 18, 2014, policy board decide double scale two facility extend application period them, due expire shortly, one year. it also decide extend duration loans, enable financial institution borrow fund fix rate 0.1 percent per annum four year instead current one three years. let elaborate framework recent enhancement make facilities. first, stimulate bank lend facility aim prompt financial institution take active lend stance stimulate firms’ households’ demand credit. with facility, bank provide long-term yen-denominated fund low interest rate financial institutions, request, amount equivalent net increase lending. there upper limit total amount fund provide bank facility. under enhance framework, policy board decide double maximum amount fund-provisioning financial institution – formerly set net increase lend – allow borrow fund bank amount twice much net increase lending. moreover, duration loan extend former period one three year fix interest rate 0.1 percent per annum four year fix rate 0.1 percent per annum. the amount outstanding fund-provisioning stimulate bank lend facility 5 trillion yen end-2013. base assumption growth rate bank lend utilization rate facility remain le current levels, amount outstanding fund-provisioning enhance framework estimate around 30 trillion yen. i move growth-supporting fund facility, aim support flow fund growth sectors. with facility, bank provide long-term fund – yen-dominated foreign currency-denominated – low interest rate financial institution lend investment area expect contribute strengthen japan’s growth potential, medical nurse care; environment energy; agriculture, forestry, fisheries; tourism. before enhancements, bank set maximum amount fund-provisioning financial institution main rule special rule follows: 3.5 trillion yen main rule financial institutions’ investment loan amount 10 million yen more; 500 billion yen special rule financial institutions’ equity investment asset-based lend (abl) – latter 8 bi central bankers’ speech us asset account receivable inventory eligible collateral; 500 billion yen special rule financial institutions’ small-lot investment loans; 12 billion u.s. dollar – equivalent 1.2 trillion yen – special rule u.s. dollar lend arrangement use u.s. dollar reserve already hold bank. in recent enhancement facility, policy board decide double maximum amount bank’s fund-provisioning main rules, almost reach limit, 7 trillion yen, increase maximum amount fund-provisioning financial institution 150 billion yen 1 trillion yen. it decide duration loan – exclude make u.s. dollar lend arrangement – would extend former period one two year fix interest rate 0.1 percent per annum four year fix rate 0.1 percent per annum. in order maintain virtuous cycle, important firm household actually make use accommodative financial condition fund increase investment spending, turn lead improvement aggregate supply demand balance strengthen economy’s growth potential. the recent enhancement two facilities, extension application period, likely promote movements. the corporate sector accumulate 230 trillion yen worth cash deposit amid firms’ persistent tendency invest much cash flow allows. recently, however, firm increasingly show willingness take opportunity start new investment use external funds. through measure i explained, bank continue provide firm support enable meet challenges. i hope measures, together steady progress implementation japan revitalization strategy – aim strengthen government’s competitiveness – prompt financial institution take active lend stance stimulate firms’ households’ demand credit, view encourage banks’ lend strengthen foundation economic growth. bi central bankers’ speech 1 haruhiko kuroda: aim 2 percent inflation. why? speech mr haruhiko kuroda, governor bank japan, japan chamber commerce industry, tokyo, 20 march 2014. * * * introduction it honor give opportunity speak front you, successful forefront japan’s economic world. the bank japan, aim overcome deflation early possible time, introduce quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) last april. almost one year pass since then, qqe steadily exert effect japan’s economy follow path toward achieve price stability target 2 percent expected. japan’s economy continue recover moderately association virtuous cycle among production, income, spending. the real gdp growth rate mark five consecutive quarter positive growth, domestic demand register high growth annual rate 3 percent since last year (chart 1). a outlook, economy affect swing front-loaded increase subsequent decline demand prior consumption tax hike, expect continue recover moderately trend. a economic recovery continues, price also improving. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) exclude fresh food turn positive june last year accelerate since then, plus 1.3 percent december last year january year. not energy-related good push prices, improvement also see wide range item give underlie upward pressure price increase aggregate supply demand balance improve inflation expectation risen. such spread improvement suggest fact year-on-year rate change cpi exclude food energy increase plus 0.7 percent (chart 2). a outlook, cpi inflation rate – basis figure exclude direct effect consumption tax hike – likely around 1¼ percent around summer, underlie upward pressure price likely strengthen positive contribution stem rise energy price decline. subsequently, background improvement aggregate supply demand balance rise inflation expectations, inflation rate expect gradually return increase trend, likely reach around price stability target 2 percent toward end fiscal 2014 fiscal 2015. the bank consider 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi price stability target bank aim at. on point, various concern raised. among these, two “daily life become difficult price go up” “only price might increase without increase wages.” for firms, might concern cannot mark output price extent input price risen. in particular, consumption tax raise next month, many might worry increase general prices. therefore, today, i would like explain views, focus bank aim 2 percent inflation. i. problem deflation let start confirm deflation problematic, look back past 15 years. in japan’s economy, deflation continue 15 year since second half 1990s. deflation result economic stagnation also cause protract 2 bi central bankers’ speech economic stagnation. amid 15 year deflation, behavior base recognition price would rise price would moderately decline embed economy, lead protract economic stagnation. view firms’ side, deflation, cannot raise price product services, sale profit increase. therefore, firm restrain labor cost business fix investment much possible. for households, wage increase, consumption restrained. if household hold back consumption, firm force reduce price product service order tap consumption. deflation also affect investment decision firms. for firm decide business fix investment, matter development nominal real interest rates. if deflationary expectation embedded, real interest rates, obtain subtract expect rate inflation nominal interest rates, remain high. namely, even change nominal borrow interest rates, expect profit become le price decline expect continue, effective burden repayment borrow increase. in situation, natural firms’ incentive business fix investment wane. also, households, expect general price decline future, become incline defer consumption much possible. they good buy good service price decline. meanwhile, deflation, hold cash deposit become relatively good investment. deflation reduce rate return investment business risk asset stock one hand, hand increase real rate return cash deposits, nominal value decrease. therefore, firm households, become rational behavior restrain business fix investment consumption hold surplus fund form cash deposits. thus, deflation, firm household turn away risk-taking activities, vicious cycle decline prices, fall sale profits, restraint wages, stagnation consumption, decline price continued. look back japan’s economy past 15 year macroeconomic indicators, gdp employee income nominal base peak 1997 since long-term downtrend (chart 3). amid deflation, japan’s economic activity nominal basis consistently scale down. under deflation, japan’s economy face fallacy composition that, despite economic entity act rationally, economy whole contracting. a result, say japan’s economy trap deflationary equilibrium. now, deflation continue japan’s economy, aware extent cpi declined? in 15 year fiscal 1998 fiscal 2012, annual decline cpi actually 0.3 percent average (chart 4). it may safely say rate change cpi period negative, almost 0 percent. this fact suggest even almost 0 percent rate change term cpi actually state deflation. in term firm recognize, tankan survey (short-term economic survey enterprise japan) past 15 years, proportion firm respond output price product service decline almost consistently exceed firm respond price increase (chart 5). take account points, order overcome deflation, aim inflation rate term year-on-year rate change cpi high 0 percent. the question is, extent positive rate aim? the bank consider 2 percent. let explain reason follows. bi central bankers’ speech 3 ii. aim 2 percent inflation. why? a. price stability a stipulate bank japan act, aim monetary policy bank conduct “achieving price stability, thereby contribute sound development national economy.” to achieve price stability aim monetary policy well bank’s responsibility. after all, bank aim price stability sense, intention artificially create inflation. on basis, bank consider that, price stability define numerically term year-on-year rate change cpi, 2 percent. there three reason (chart 6). first, feature note cpi. the cpi upward bias – namely, tendency toward see high figure growth rate cpi. second, view necessary so-called buffer. in order maintain ability monetary policy respond substantial deterioration economic activity, would good secure degree inflation rate. third, view widely share among major central banks, many conduct monetary policy aim achieve inflation rate 2 percent. in words, 2 percent become global standard. let elaborate three reasons. b. feature price indices: upward bias cpi the price monetary policy target price individual good services, course, price whole. that said, measure level price general, necessary weight price individual good service compile them; accord compile methods, various index created. in judge price conditions, index need use take account feature entail. while i go detail, become technical, generally know cpi tendency toward growth rate show high figure – is, exhibit upward bias. a gdp deflator, price index use calculate real gdp, growth rate become somewhat low. this mainly deflator include capital goods, price decline substantial. it also rise import price completely pass output prices, work low deflator. in fact, since fiscal 1998, year-on-year rate change cpi 1 percent high average gdp deflator (chart 7). many central banks, include bank japan, mainly use cpi judge price trends. this cpi index line public’s actual sentiment cover good service household consume, quickly available statistic publish monthly. take account points, bank’s price stability target also define year-on-year rate change cpi. however, i mentioned, cpi upward bias, thus, define price stability target form year-on-year rate change cpi, need present somewhat positive figure. c. ensure room reduce interest rates: so-called buff let turn view need secure room interest rate reduction maintain positive inflation rate, thereby enhance ability monetary policy respond economic deterioration; is, need so-called buffer. put extremely simple terms, interest rate level neutral economic activity determine sum economy’s growth potential average inflation rate. for example, potential growth rate 1 percent inflation rate 2 percent, interest rate neutral economic activity 3 percent．in case, economic deterioration, room amount 3 percent central bank stimulate economy reduce interest rate. however, even potential growth rate 4 bi central bankers’ speech 1 percent, inflation rate 0 percent, room reduce interest rate amount 1 percent level neutral interest rate 1 percent. therefore, level neutral interest rate low, interest rate easily reach 0 percent bound. a situation interest rate reach close 0 percent room monetary ease interest rate control call “zero interest rate low bound.” japan first among advance economy face zero low bound. since bank reduce official discount rate 0.5 percent september 1995, almost 20 year now, japan’s short-term interest rate exceed 0.5 percent hover range 0–0.5 percent (chart 8). of two pillar macroeconomic policy – fiscal policy monetary policy – continue situation whereby effectiveness monetary policy significantly impaired. in meantime, bank take various initiative ahead central bank world, include adoption various unconventional monetary policy measure range zero interest rate policy quantitative ease forward guidance recent terminology. to sure, even zero low bound, still room pursue monetary ease unconventional monetary policy measures. however, also certain that, period, effective traditional monetary policy channel interest rate control lost. in view, bank’s monetary policy yield result extent past 15 year smooth economic fluctuations. however, sufficient stave worsen disinflation preempt deflation become entrenched. if bank aim price stability target 2 percent early stage, could pursue timely bold monetary ease response decline inflation rate, thereby enable economy overcome deflation early stage. with protraction, deflation become problem increasingly stubborn difficult overcome. base difficulty past 15 years, need let japan’s economy overcome deflation early possible time prevent, means, economy fall back deflation again. to end, critical preempt deflation conduct monetary policy aim 2 percent price stability target. and, lose effective measure interest rate control, i believe critical secure room interest rate reduction achieve around 2 percent inflation stable manner allow economic activity-neutral interest rate form somewhat high level. d. global standard so far, i explain reason aim 2 percent inflation two viewpoints: due feature cpi, secure room interest rate reduction. these view special one bank adopting. base similar line thinking, many central bank overseas already implement policy aim 2 percent inflation. for example, central bank unite kingdom, canada, new zealand set inflation target 2 percent, unite states, federal reserve set longer-run goal inflation 2 percent. in euro area, european central bank (ecb) present numerical definition price stability, below, close to, 2 percent (chart 9). while various way expression, conduct monetary policy aim around 2 percent inflation become global standard. if talk buff – namely, secure room interest rate reduction – high inflation rate, better. however, monetary policy aim achieve price stability. an issue balance two. base past experience variety economies, become general view globally around 2 percent would bi central bankers’ speech 5 desirable. in words, global standard 2 percent inflation become establish past experience rather base theoretical analyses. amid long-term stagnation since lehman crisis, inflation rate recently decline globally, mainly euro area. a international monetary fund manage director christine lagarde say speech, “with inflation run many central banks’ targets, see rise risk deflation,” thus risk deflation become important topic globally. the world thoroughly understand japan suffer long-term stagnation amid deflation, strong recognition need avoid like japan particular regard. in fact, cpi unite states, euro area, unite kingdom recently downtrend (chart 10). that said, year-on-year rate change cpi even euro area, risk deflation discussed, plus 0.7 percent. that still sufficiently high level compare japan’s cpi inflation rate past ten year so. nevertheless, press conference follow meet govern council ecb, president mario draghi repeatedly question late risk deflation. while note low inflation protract period time risk would ignore risk, also emphasize medium- long-term inflation expectation well-anchored level “below, close to, 2 percent,” level ecb define price stability. couple prospect economic activity euro area continue pick moderately, unlikely euro area fall deflation. nevertheless, development euro area indicate importance aim 2 percent and, side coin, danger fall deflation, strongly recognize area. iii. wage prices: price view perspective household a i explained, aim 2 percent price stability target term year-on-year rate change cpi appropriate term macroeconomic policy management, conceptually global standard. nevertheless, opinion negative impact take viewpoint household naturally heard. therefore, let next talk price view side households, focus relationship wage prices. from households’ perspective, quite natural think price increase desirable. accord late opinion survey general public’s view behavior bank conduct households, 80 percent respondent felt price “have go up” describe price rise “rather unfavorable.” this surprising. if ask prices, respondent respond assumption conditions, include wages, unchanged. if wage change, price decline ought desirable. however, normally happen price rise without accompany wage increases. if corporate sale grow corporate profit increase due rise price good services, wage pay employee tend increase accordingly. a employee demand portion increase firm’s profit contribute pay wages, macro basis, rate increase nominal wage sum inflation rate rate increase labor productivity. otherwise, ratio labor income total income, employees’ share, continue decline price rise. such thing might happen temporarily, would continue sustainable manner. in fact, underpin past data. compare development rate increase wage per hour cpi phase price rising, rate increase wage exceed cpi occasions. there two period since 1971 thing go way rate increase cpi high wage – second oil shock 1980 surge international commodity price 2007 2008 (chart 11). both episode occur 6 bi central bankers’ speech inflation rate surge temporarily due supply shock; namely, external factor domestic demand. therefore, real option face whether aim world wage price rise moderately, aim world wage price decline, case past 15 years. the choice obvious. in situation bank aim at, 2 percent inflation rate continue stably, wage price would rise moderately normal course things. this kind economy economic entity act assumption price rise 2 percent annually, even economy normal state. in society, 2 percent price increase factor wage setting. in regard, japan, increase base pay – scheme lose amid protract deflation – gradually restore recently. this regard step toward transfer new social economic system 2 percent price increase build social norm, deserve focus attention. the extent nominal wage increase excess inflation, words, extent real wage increase, hinge time extent labor productivity – amount good service produce input one unit labor – increase. an increase real wages, critical challenge, ultimately attain improvement productivity. in regard, addition effort individual firms, important prepare environment improve productivity various growth strategy deregulation. the government demonstrate measure raise growth potential economy accelerate reinforce implementation japan revitalization strategy. it expect improvement productivity achieve initiatives. for firms, especially small medium-sized firms, might concern cannot mark output price extent input price risen. in situation price rise upon escape deflation, i’ve explained, become easy firm pas increase input price output prices. i say early that, deflation, vicious cycle decline prices, fall sale profits, restraint wages, stagnation consumption, decline price continued. in situation, easy pas increase input price output prices. in fact, accord tankan survey, past 15 year compare previous years, diffusion index input price – obtain subtract proportion firm respond input price fall firm respond input price rise – substantially exceed diffusion index output price (chart 12). by contrast, economy society 2 percent inflation continue stably, cycle opposite vicious cycle deflation achieved. start moderate increase prices, virtuous cycle economy increase sale profits, increase wages, rejuvenate consumption, moderate increase price achieve become entrenched. in situation economic virtuous cycle continue firm demand maintained, become easy firm pas increase input price output prices. iv. consumption tax hike inflation let next talk consumption tax hike implication inflation. from next month, consumption tax rate raise 8 percent current 5 percent. a item cpi include tax-free exempt taxation, year-on-year rate change cpi push upward 2 percent association 3 percent consumption tax hike. in relation this, let point two things. bi central bankers’ speech 7 first, increase year-on-year rate change cpi consumption tax hike temporary one. with consumption tax hike next month, estimate year-on-year rate change cpi exclude fresh food push upward surface 2 percent fiscal 2014, disappear fiscal 2015. a specific example, let u look development occur year-on-year rate change cpi consumption tax raise april 1997 5 percent 3 percent. it plus 0.5 percent march 1997 prior tax hike, hike go around plus 2 percent one year, april 1997 march 1998. the rate increase push 1.4 percent. however, april 1998, one year tax hike, rate increase drop plus 0.2 percent effect tax hike disappear (chart 13). needle say, bank aim maintain 2 percent price stability target sustainable manner. therefore, assess price situation pursue monetary policy, believe would appropriate make assessment exclude short-term variation factor price bring consumption tax hike. the second thing negative impact real income due consumption tax hike. give consumption tax tax revenue government, unavoidable consumption tax hike negative effect. the increase year-on-year rate change cpi represent rise value good service themselves, rather result add tax would pay time consumption price good services. the impact consumption tax hike discuss context include taxation, public finance, social security system, necessary clearly distinguish ordinary discussion inflation. in sum, believe increase cpi due consumption tax hike need consider separately price increase trend. the bank aim achieve 2 percent price stability target trend basis exclude direct impact consumption tax hike. i note that, fee public services, old tax rate 5 percent apply transitional measure certain period enter april. such measure reflect compile cpi. therefore, year-on-year rate change cpi exclude fresh food push upward due consumption tax hike remain 1.7 percent april become 2 percent may onward. the bank also take point account assess price situation next month onward. v. future monetary policy let conclude speech briefly mention monetary policy near future. a i indicate today, believe necessary achieve 2 percent price stability target swiftly possible order overcome 15 year deflation prevent recurrence deflation. a state deflation continue many years, process transition 2 percent target, various change might occur economic social system. however, compare economy good expand equilibrium achieve 2 percent price stability target deflationary equilibrium 15 years, room deny former desirable. what important fear change look style business live suit economy overcome deflation. the qqe steadily exert intend effect japan’s economy follow path toward achieve 2 percent price stability target expected. the bank continue qqe, aim achieve 2 percent price stability target, long necessary maintain target stable manner. it thoroughly examine upside downside risk economic activity prices, make adjustment appropriate. if, future, outlook change due manifestation risk 8 bi central bankers’ speech factor adjustment become necessary order achieve 2 percent price stability target, bank make without hesitation. with monetary policy, look overcome deflation early possible time. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 12 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 13 14 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 christopher kent: foreign investment residential real estate open statement mr christopher kent, assistant governor (economic) reserve bank australia, mr david orsmond, deputy head economic analysis reserve bank australia, house representative stand committee economics inquiry foreign investment residential real estate, sydney, 27 june 2014. * * * thank you, chair, opportunity discus topic today. a summarise submission,1 foreign residential investment feature australia’s house sector many decades. foreign demand house support local construction industry, foreign-based developer provide access alternative source finance add degree competition sector. some recent house purchase also associate increase number families, particularly asia, want educate child australia. more broadly, foreign residential demand australia link rise income wealth globally, particularly asia, add business opportunity economy become integrate others region. this welcome expected. an underlie theme much commentary whether foreign residential investment increase demand australian house increase supply, hence whether lead increase house prices, especially first home buyers. the data clearly show increase level approval foreign residential purchase time, difficult know much boost net demand australian housing. while vary bite year year, data publish foreign investment review board (firb) suggest foreign purchase approval fairly low share national house turnover. specifically, firb data suggest value foreign residential approval generally around 5–10 per cent value national house turnover. use several assumptions, estimate number foreign approval around half range. in submission committee, firb include data cover first three quarter financial year, show rise approvals, especially new dwellings. nonetheless, important remember share actual residential purchase foreign temporary resident likely much low firb data suggest approval lead purchase. this point outline submission recent article publish bank’s bulletin.2 it worth emphasise purchase property foreign citizen temporary resident may contribute one one net house demand australia. for instance, would little effect net demand property purchase use house foreign student would otherwise need rent stay here. similarly, net demand house would little change investment property subsequently rent out. there comprehensive information magnitude type transactions. so, seem likely foreign residential purchase add somewhat net house demand australia, way know exact extent case. whether increase net house demand – foreign domestic source – lead high house price depend responsiveness supply. this subject 1 see rba (2014), “submission inquiry foreign investment residential real estate”, 9 may. 2 see gauder m, c houssard d orsmond (2014), “foreign investment residential real estate”, rba bulletin, june, pp 11–18. 2 bi central bankers’ speech especially topical late, house price nationally rise close 10 per cent past year. the rise price primarily reflect increase house demand australian resident citizens, partly owe low interest rates. the supply house responsive rise house demand but, give time need plan build new housing, typically occur lag. however, several factor accentuate lag, including: • shortage well-located land geographical constraint capital city • complexity plan approval process, add time cost new house development • concern exist resident regard new development project vicinity. these easy issue address, although widely agree appropriate balance need strike house provide reasonable cost. through bank’s business liaison, hear house market participant impediment increase supply house greenfield area ease recent years. also, interest convert old office build central business district residential use, may ease shortage land highly seek areas. however, contact also report could do increase responsiveness house supply demand. notwithstanding general concern responsiveness supply, information available suggest foreign residential purchase probably large direct effect price house typically purchase first home buyers. while incomplete, firb data information receive liaison developer suggest foreign residential purchase new, higher-density, inner-city property well property close universities. furthermore, property purchase tend value well average national sale price. in contrast, purchase first home buyer establish home price well national average. moreover, purchase new housing, first home buyer appear generally purchase detach home close fringe main city rather new apartment locate close city centres. of course, foreign buyer purchase cheap home outside inner-city areas, first home buyer purchase inner-city property price national average. but main, foreign buyer appear purchase property typically quite different characteristic purchase first home buyers. finally, i would like comment issue availability data. firb’s main role ensure foreign purchase consistent rules, rather provide data actual level foreign investment. even so, case could make timely provision approval data already collect firb, perhaps publish quarterly rather annual basis. also, granular data could provided, number approval within broad price bracket rather total value number approvals. beyond that, benefit new report requirement area weigh carefully cost collection administration. with introductory comments, colleague, dr david orsmond, i happy take question may have. bi central bankers’ speech 1 daniel

give retrospective first five year supervisory stress testing, highlight accomplishment identify area may consider change future. then i would like turn topic gain increase attention past couple year – qualitative assessment firms’ capital plan process conduct parallel quantitative assessment firms’ capital positions. from scap ccar the potential value comprehensive stress test much discuss among academics, analysts, regulator year precede financial crisis, crisis supervisory tool first use time across large firms. the supervisory capital assessment program (scap) demonstrate practice, theory, value simultaneous, forward-looking projection potential loss revenue base bank’s portfolio circumstances. the forward-looking feature overcome limitation static capital ratios. the simultaneity, along stress test feature use common macroeconomic scenarios, introduce critical macroprudential dimension offer insight condition entire financial system, include whether bank sufficiently resilient continue lend household business adverse conditions. the federal reserve’s basic approach stress test change materially since scap. we continue take multidisciplinary approach, draw wide range staff expertise. we create hypothetical macroeconomic scenario incorporate assume sharp deterioration economic financial conditions. supervisor estimate bank’s expect loss revenue use estimate project post-stress capital level ratio hypothetical scenarios. the estimate capital ratio compare regulatory benchmarks. we use common scenario firms; firm 2 bi central bankers’ speech large trade activities, add market-shock scenario incorporate market turbulence severity similar latter half 2008. while basic approach remain consistent, much else changed. in first place, course, requirement stress test become statutory, congress draw lesson scap craft prudential standard large financial firm dodd-frank wall street reform consumer protection act (dodd-frank act).1 second, annual supervisory stress test incorporate ccar, broad program require large bank organization submit capital plan annually. the ccar process give supervisor opportunity evaluate plan capital distribution backdrop firm’s overall capital position baseline hypothesize stress conditions. it also provide regular, structured, comparative way ass capacity firm manage capital position and, implication, generally manage risks. i return feature ccar bite later. third, substantial enhancement supervisory stress test. perhaps important change development independent supervisory models. because original scap develop fly considerable time pressure, supervisor necessarily rely firms’ estimate loss revenue start point analysis, although evaluate firms’ estimate make significant adjustments. in stress test followed, build upon considerable progress data collection, make completely independent estimate progressively great proportion potential net income losses. these improvement data model increase ability distinguish risk within portfolios. we also refine formulation hypothetical scenario form basis stress tests. the severely adverse scenario design reflect, minimum, economic financial condition typical severe post-world war ii u.s. recession.2 in devise recession scenarios, draw many macroeconomic model tool use make monetary policy. because significant risk face bank tie business cycle, scenario incorporate adverse development exceptionally large decline house prices, sharp drop value stock financial assets, worsen global economic condition severe might normally expect accompany deep recession unite states. we implement dodd-frank requirement “adverse,” well “severely adverse,” scenario simply hypothesize mild recession, test somewhat different risks. the past two year use adverse scenario test impact sudden, significant increase interest rates. more discrete change note include assumption default firm’s large counterparty incorporation salient risk beyond overall scenarios.3 the former obviously serf microprudential purpose, also could promote systemic stability objective identify single exceptionally large exposure entire financial system. the incorporation salient risk help use stress test “lean wind,” build buff future losses. for example, 2011 2012 scenario incorporate possible severe stress europe. inclusion factor may lead great awareness good risk management u.s. firms’ european exposures. 1 dodd-frank act §165(i), 12 u.s.c. §5365(i). 2 see board governor federal reserve system (2013), “policy statement scenario design framework stress test (pdf),” final rule (docket no. op–1452), federal register, vol. 78 (november 29), p. 71443. 3 see board governor federal reserve system (2013), comprehensive capital analysis review 2014 summary instruction guidance (washington: board governors, november 1) (pdf), p. 8. bi central bankers’ speech 3 finally, i might mention change make year actually revert feature scap. we allow bank assume balance sheet would shrink stress scenario way meet minimum capital charge, something many bank do stress test past years.4 foreclose assumption serf macroprudential goal help ensure major financial firm remain sufficiently capitalize support lend severe downturn. a i already suggested, likely continue hone supervisory stress test. in particular, i expect devote attention develop macroprudential element stress tests. for example, might sharpen focus risk financial system significant common exposure among firms. we already adjust market shock apply trade book six large firm ensure firm incentivized hold significant amount certain asset simply perform well second half 2008.5 but could done. one idea would test whether individual firm reveal test vulnerable serious stress might engage asset fire sale could produce knock-on damage firms. another would incorporate assumption pertain increase cost of, reduce access to, fund stress environments, lot credit line may draw simultaneously. in short, regard supervisory stress test ccar finish products. in fact, never regard finish products, since would overlook change real economy, financial innovations, shift asset correlation across firms. but i think fair say supervisory stress test ccar already make important contribution financial stability and, process, lead way transform supervision nation’s large financial firms. first, play key role strengthen dramatically capital position industry. the firm participate ccar double tier 1 common capital since 2009, increase $500 billion additional, high-quality capital u.s. financial system. it noteworthy supervisor country move toward great use stress test centerpiece effort build strong capital position banks. most member basel committee bank supervision use form stress testing.6 the european union unite kingdom currently conduct supervisory stress test whose result publicly released. second, lead edge movement toward great supervisory transparency. the federal reserve’s decision spring 2009 disclose result scap firm-specific basis prove important step re-establishing market public confidence u.s. financial system. in dodd-frank act, congress endorse practice disclose supervisory firm stress test result normal times, well crisis periods. during past five year progressively increase disclosure firm-specific information, methodology use, detail stress test scenarios. from outset, publish broad framework methodology use 4 prior ccar 2014, board send ccar participant letter detail federal reserve’s procedure independently project firms’ balance sheet risk-weighted asset supervisory stress test implication independent projections. see board governor federal reserve system (2013), “federal reserve independent balance sheet rwa projections,” december 16. 5 see board governor federal reserve system, 2014 supervisory scenario annual stress test require dodd-frank act stress test rule capital plan rule (pdf) (washington: board governors, november 1), p. 5. 6 see bank international settlement (2012), peer review supervisory authorities’ implementation stress test principle (pdf) (basel: bis, april), p. 8. 4 bi central bankers’ speech supervisory stress test, include information type model use.7 we solicit comment design framework scenario 2012, incorporate final document idea receive – provide information economic financial condition represent path variable scenarios.8 and past spring, publish additional set stress test result describe firm would perform adverse scenario, addition result severely adverse scenario, previously released.9 because bank portfolio often quite opaque thus difficult outsider value, information allow investors, counterparties, analysts, market generally make inform judgment condition u.s. bank institutions. couple regulatory measures, transparency turn increase market discipline. this level transparency also subject u great outside scrutiny analysis, process increase accountability regulator help u improve assumption methodology time. these choice great transparency supervisory stress test ccar prompt healthy discussion merit disclosure supervisory areas. a i think everyone audience knows, disclose supervisory model themselves. we want firm simply copy model assessment risk capital needs. and certainly want construct portfolio effort game model – kind analogue teach test. but even though publicly release models, put system place ensure oversight accountability. the model evaluate special model validation group make expert within federal reserve work stress tests. we also create model validation council make outside expert provide independent view advice.10 the third important effect supervisory stress test ccar pave way horizontal, simultaneous supervisory exercises. we create large institution supervision coordinate committee (liscc) 2010 implement approach supervision systemically important firm good coordinated, data-driven, focus large institution group.11 while ccar include number firm liscc portfolio, stress test ccar prove grind liscc, committee evolve administer program efficiently, exercise show way horizontal supervisory exercise assessments. some, like new comprehensive liquidity analysis review, focus assess liquidity sufficiency banks’ internal liquidity risk-management practices, intend recurring. others ad hoc effort responsive episodic transitory concerns. fourth, sense extension prior point, ccar particular define approach toward develop maintain good risk management within bank organization subject exercises. let turn address topic somewhat great detail. 7 see board governor federal reserve system (2014), dodd-frank act stress test 2014: supervisory stress test methodology result (washington: board governors, march) (pdf). 8 see board governors, “policy statement scenario design framework stress testing,” p. 71437. 9 see board governors, dodd-frank act stress test 2014, p. 39. 10 for information model validation council, see www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/mvc.htm. 11 for information liscc, see www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-supervision.htm. bi central bankers’ speech 5 ensure strong risk management here again, origin current program lie experience scap 2009, learn great deal beyond post-stress loss capital numbers. the horizontal, cross-firm nature exercise also allow u evaluate compare effectiveness firms’ process determine address capital needs. we discover that, time, many firm critical deficiency fundamental risk-measurement risk-management practice necessary ass capital needs. many firm systematic program assess capital need even lack basic data firm-wide risk exposure need begin program. not surprisingly, appear correlation firm find insufficiently capitalize withstand financial economic stress firm lack effective process assess risk vulnerabilities. in response deficiencies, federal reserve initiate annual ccar process assess capital adequacy internal capital plan process large, complex bank hold company (bhcs). ccar premise belief thorough, rigorous risk management must underpin activity firms. risk identify understand evaluate and, appropriate, assume proper safeguard capital planning. risk overlooked, misunderstood, take outside well-considered comprehensive risk-management framework plant seed serious trouble individual firm potentially financial system. through ccar, seek ensure large bhcs strong capital position determine supervisory stress test, also strong capital plan practice appropriately focus capital need withstand possible loss specific risk firm’s business model. these processes, ground strong quantitative qualitative risk management, also give supervisor clear window firm’s activity thus increase effectiveness regular supervision. since first ccar notable improvement firms’ capital plan processes. many firm make meaningful investment risk-measurement processes, include significant enhancement internal data management information systems. many firm adopt formal framework inform capital plan analysis vulnerability capital adequacy range potential adverse scenarios. they also take step enhance integrity risk measures, analysis, decision-making around capital level distributions. despite advances, continue need improvement firms’ capital plan processes. some firm still lack reliable information business exposures. firm also sometimes unable measure understand stressful condition change performance material business lines. in particular, capacity ass impact tail risk remain need development many firms. these deficiency are, instances, compound weak oversight senior management board directors, lack effective check accountability process. the qualitative assessment ccar the importance attach risk-management capital plan process reflect component ccar know qualitative assessment. this assessment cover range topics, include extent design firm’s internal scenario capture specific risk firm’s activities, firm’s method project loss stress scenarios, firm identify appropriate capital level plan distributions. a detail ccar regulation, process find inadequate, raise safety soundness concerns, may form basis 6 bi central bankers’ speech objection board governor capital distribution plan firm.12 if firm’s internal process unreliable, supervisor necessarily concern firm may properly assess risk clearly and, needed, assure adequate capital many risk cannot fully capture standardize stress tests. a process expectation quantitative test become good understood, attention shift bite qualitative assessment. to place part ccar context, let make several additional points. first, i already noted, many firm long way go meet high standard capital plan back strong risk management begin ccar. give initial gap, allow time firm work toward full achievement standards. thus, may perceive raise bar every year good understand effort provide demanding, still realistic, glide path firm reach goal. we do, however, expect firm continue make steady progress year. second, horizontal nature qualitative assessment mean every year one firm must receive objection qualitative grounds. the comparative approach help ensure firm evaluate consistently fairly. and allow u see specific firm may outlier good practice follow rest industry. but pga tournament – foreordain cut participant miss. third, minimum standard ccar firms, standard stringent firm great systemic importance.13 it enough large complex bank organization meet minimum standard ccar. we expect systemically important firm establish maintain sophisticate risk-management capital plan practices. their risk management capital adequacy sufficiently strong help ensure resiliency range unexpected stress events, since distress could pose threat financial system broad economy. fourth, precisely importance supervisory program, qualitative assessment continue progressively integrate year-round supervision ccar firms. while important feature capital plan observable formal ccar process, risk-management capital plan standard incorporate ccar operative observable supervisor throughout year. these important focus ongoing supervisory oversight discussion firm supervisors. only unusual circumstance supervisor learn first time ccar significant problem quality capital plan processes, unusual circumstance firm surprise outcome qualitative assessment. 12 see 12 cfr 225.8(e)(2)(ii). 13 it also worth emphasize element ccar – qualitative quantitative assessment – apply bhcs $50 billion total consolidate assets. the dodd-frank act require company $10 50 billion asset conduct annual company-run stress test. the federal reserve conduct ccar-like exercise evaluate company-run stress tests, although review firms’ company-run stress test capital plan process normal course supervision. this review tailor small size, reduce complexity, limit systemic risk firms. see footnote 5, p. 14160, board governor federal reserve system, federal deposit insurance corporation, office comptroller currency (2014), “supervisory guidance implement dodd-frank act company-run stress test bank organization total consolidate asset more than $10 billion le than $50 billion,” final supervisory guidance (docket no. occ–2013–0013), federal register, vol. 79 (march 13) (pdf). for other, small bank organization – $10 billion le total consolidate asset – supervisory expectation regulatory requirement firm conduct capital stress testing. bi central bankers’ speech 7 we already take step integration ccar regular supervision. at end ccar process supervisor send firm letter detail conclusion concern qualitative assessment. to extent weakness area improvement identified, letter provide basis regular stocktaking firm supervisors. more generally, last year release paper expectation aspect capital planning, provide great detail include annual ccar instructions.14 i anticipate take additional step integrate ongoing supervisory assessment risk-management internal control process annual ccar exercise, assure communication direction heard. one step recently begun: the committee chair senior board staff responsible oversight ccar, support relevant horizontal assessment teams, directly engage firm course year evaluate progress remediate weakness issue identify post-ccar letters. increasingly, regular supervisory work topic risk-identification internal audit focus process critical risk management capital plan firms, area focus ccar. the aim additional measure make ccar culmination year-round supervision risk-management capital plan process discrete exercise take place time supervisory stress tests. finally, i would note that, provide investors, counterparties, analysts, public good information mean objection qualitative grind capital distribution plan, release decision capital plan and, firm whose capital plan object to, provide summary specific reason objections.15 conclusion although strong capital regulation critical ensure safety soundness large financial institutions, panacea, indeed single regulatory device ever be. similarly, supervisory stress test ccar, central ensure strong capital position large firms, important element supervisory program. have say that, however, i hope take least three point away remark today. first, supervisory stress test fundamentally change way think capital adequacy. the need specify scenarios, loss estimates, revenue assumption – apply specification dynamic basis – immeasurably advance regulation capital adequacy and, thus, safety soundness financial system. the opportunity provide incorporate macroprudential element make it, judgment, single important advance prudential regulation since crisis. second, supervisory stress test ccar provide first significant form supervision conduct horizontal, coordinate fashion, afford single view entire portfolio institutions, well data-rich insight institution individually. a such, program open way similar supervisory activity continue teach u organize supervisory effort order effectively safeguard firm soundness financial stability. 14 see board governor federal reserve system (2013), capital plan large bank hold companies: supervisory expectation range current practice (washington: board governors, august) (pdf). 15 see board governors, comprehensive capital analysis review 2014, p. 7. 8 bi central bankers’ speech finally, supervisory stress test ccar exemplary case supervision aspire keep dynamism financial firm financial market must compose adaptive tools. if regulator make necessary adaptations, must open comments, critiques, suggestion outside regulatory community. for reason, transparency around aims, assumptions, methodology stress test review capital plan must preserve extended. with point, i end i begin – emphasize importance forum one, thank participation. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ardian fullani: overview albania’s late monetary economic development outlook speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, monetary policy decision bank albania’s supervisory council, tirana, 25 june 2014. * * * the supervisory council bank albania review approve today monthly monetary policy report. base recent economic monetary development albania, follow discussion outlook, supervisory council decide keep key interest rate unchanged, 2.50%. the council consider gradual transmission early interest rate cut financial market provide adequate monetary condition inflation return target medium term. let proceed overview economic development key issue discuss today’s meeting. *** annual inflation rate 1.6% may, slightly previous month. inflation fell due reduction health care prices, price item basket record low volatility. a previous months, annual inflation continue determine unprocessed food prices, contribute around 88% final rate. from macroeconomic perspective, performance consumer price continue reflect weak inflationary pressures, domestic economy external sector. the negative output gap favour increase employment wages, lead thus low increase production costs. import inflationary pressure remain subdued; inflation albania’s trade partner rise commodity price low levels, exchange rate stable. inflation expectation liquidity situation economy line low inflation rate period ahead. indirect available data economic activity signal positive growth rate first month year. aggregate demand improved, drive private domestic foreign demand, consolidate fiscal policy pursue period contribute increase demand. incoming data june change assessment performance private consumption investments. while important component aggregate demand upward period, performance remain weak. their steady recovery continue impede uncertainty face household business reflect great risk aversion real financial sector economy. the bank albania expect improvement private consumption investment rest year, reflecting, among others, ease monetary policy. the pace recovery two indicator determine short medium-term dynamic country’s development. data public sector performance show consolidate fiscal policy first five month year. this policy materialise budget deficit 68% low previous year. the tighten fiscal policy evident revenue expenditure side. fiscal revenue increase 9.0% annual terms, budget expenditure 7.5% low previous year. our monetary policy ease also take account feature fiscal policy bank albania urge supported. however, bank albania would like bring attention need uniform distribution expenditure budget deficit year, enhance effectiveness avoid fluctuation excessive concentration may cause country’s economic financial indicators. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the improve foreign demand positive dynamic sector economy reflect increase annual export 10.3% april. the detail analysis trade data reveal encourage signal re-exporting agricultural activities. trade deficit, however, expand 1.8% april, due simultaneous increase import 6.0%. in particular, energy situation continue burden trade balance country due high level energy imports. structural improvement economy favourable external environment would pave way fast growth albanian exports. the bank albania consider channel appropriate tool support country’s sustainable growth medium long term. projection low annual inflation rates, backdrop below-potential economic growth, dictate pursuit ease monetary policy bank albania. at end may, monetary stimulus strengthen cut key interest rate. available information financial market show cut fully transmit interbank government security markets. it also reflect low finance cost bank system, creating, turn, premise transmission stimulus lend interest rate economy. the bank albania call bank system comply important link transmission mechanism. despite ease monetary conditions, economy’s demand financial asset remain weak. monetary indicator april show slow annual growth money supply, 0.7%. it performance reflect weak borrow demand public sector contraction credit private sector. in april, credit private sector 2.4% low previous year, continue shrink year. the poor credit performance reflect mainly contraction credit businesses. the analysis credit demand supply factor show uncertainty sides, materialise high risk premiums. a previously stated, steady improvement credit follow improvement economic activity country. *** at end discussions, supervisory council conclude incoming available information alter baseline projections. the economy see gradual growth year, improve pace second half. nevertheless, increase aggregate demand remain economy’s potential even 2014, thus determine gradual return inflation target. at end discussions, supervisory council decide keep key interest rate unchanged, 2.50%. bi central bankers’ speech 1 sukhdave singh: global economic outlook financial landscape – change since global financial crisis? special address dr sukhdave singh, deputy governor central bank malaysia (bank negara malaysia), 18th malaysian bank summit “global economic outlook financial landscape: what ha change since global financial crisis?”, kuala lumpur, 20 june 2014. * * * i would like thank asli invitation address today. give i speak right lunch, i realise i cast role appetiser therefore, i brief quickly get main course. i plan briefly go state global economy implication malaysian economy. the news largely good. however, number concern could impact quality sustainability growth go forward, i also discus these. global economic outlook change financial landscape the good news five year rather turbulent condition rather bumpy economic ride, global economy seem finally verge sustain growth. the key development improve growth condition emerge many advance economy (aes), economy heart crisis. while continue believe growth advance economy remain low relative historical levels, number reason that, sign economy finally able achieve steady growth. and obviously good global economy. a emerge market economy (emes), do relatively well year since crisis. domestic demand support high commodity price well expansionary fiscal monetary policies. however, growth emes seem hit bump road. the commodity boom taper impact incomes. the fiscal stimulus increase government debt make fiscal expansion le sustainable. on top that, low interest rate environment lead increase household debt. these development begin act brake economic growth. this experience highlight risk limit domestic demand drive easy monetary policy, cheap credit fiscal stimulus. therefore, domestic demand emes grow slow pace. nevertheless, emes still contribute big share global growth aes. the re-emergence growth crisis-affected aes could expect strengthen external demand export emes, thereby mitigate effect slow domestic demand. among asian economies, expect see similar trends. again, sustain domestic demand, low past, continue support growth. there lot concern chinese economy obvious reason – become second large economy world. and among many regional economies, important trade partner. so, chinese economy catch flu, feel effect sneezing. have say that, chinese economy continue grow policymakers seem determine ensure does. implication malaysia malaysia certainly benefit positive growth environment, especially give good growth major trade partner economies. the malaysian economy 2 bi central bankers’ speech project grow 4.5–5.5%. this outlook support strong growth 6.2% first quarter 2014. the outlook improve due good external demand conditions. after grow 2.4% 2013, malaysia’s export grow almost 13% far 2014. for small open economy like malaysia, others like it, experience crisis year since certainly bring home vulnerability risk integrate global economy. but, i believe also highlight dependence global economy need even integrate global economy. at risk slight diversion, allow elaborate bite point. after crisis, excitement domestic demand driver growth, justification enthusiasm. there certainly component relate growth income private demand. but also significant component relate public spend rapid growth domestic credit. the outcome high debt level household government. this clearly sustainable strategy growth. indeed, experience show limit fast sustainably grow rely domestic demand alone. therefore, go forward, domestic demand continue support growth, really need strengthen integration regional global economy, implication, strengthen overall level economic competitiveness, achieve sustainable growth long term. return economic outlook, good news see sustain growth around world already begin benefit malaysia create balance growth malaysian economy. now potential cloud rather sunny outlook? there several, interest time, i mention five. the first slow recovery investment aes crisis. it note recovery, unlike recovery past recessions, accompany rather lackluster investment. this despite fact company sit large pile cash. what company use cash pile for? well, either return cash bucket-fulls shareholder use support share price share buy-backs. it report yesterday’s financial time first three month year alone, s&p 500 company u spend record us$241 billion repurchase share pay cash dividends. while may help keep share price high, create new source growth. meanwhile, capital spend s&p 500 company grow average 3.6 percent per year last five years. ultimately, quantity quality investment determine quality growth well future. the second issue face economy despite drop unemployment, productivity growth remain weak. the way understand recovery process, demand pick up, company first try meet use exist workers. productivity increases. however, demand continue grow, increase productivity exist worker insufficient company hire new worker increase production. so employment increases. therefore, increase productivity accompany increase employment. we witness phenomenon time. in us, unemployment rate fall peak 9.8% 6.3% may 2014 productivity grow 1%, le half year prior crisis. bi central bankers’ speech 3 there number possibility go on: • in uk us, note number business start-ups increase significantly post-crisis years. one interpretation that, increase number people give gain employment decide become self-employed. if true, would help explain decline unemployment low productivity growth. be business mean long unemployed new business generally high productivity. • another interpretation significant part fall unemployment come much people employ rather people leave labour force. the labour force participation rate u fall 66% prior crisis current level 63%. essentially, labor force shrinking. in case would reason believe decline unemployment precede rise productivity. another factor undermine productivity could fact number part-time worker also increase – us, 3% work population 5% 2014:q1. • the question low productivity growth unrelated precede issue low investment. the rate productive investment key determinant future growth productivity economy. whatever reasons, productivity pick up, would dampen effect growth wage incomes, consequently, strength economic growth go forward. the third issue relate policy risk. there i call “monetary policy pendulum”. in post-crisis period, monetary policy aes go central banker go before. my analogy pendulum simply mean pull something one direction, likely go direction let go. there risk process normalisation extreme policy position could create undesirable outcomes, especially give level risk take see extend period easy global liquidity condition result desperate search yields. if economic condition change fast currently anticipate policymakers, would rapid potentially large reversal policy possible, so, could potential side-effects? it would certainly helpful stability global financial markets. there increase interest among policymakers economy also use macro-prudential tool manage build-up risk low interest rate environment. the use tool may helpful economies, also pose potential risk rest world. for example, could push even capital flow direction emerge economy like malaysia. the crisis also stretch fiscal position governments, advance emerge economies. in cases, deterioration relate deal effect crisis (e.g., bank rescues) low gdp growth post-crisis, others reflect outcome year unwise fiscal spending. whatever reasons, constrain fiscal position mean reduce capacity support economic activity reduce ability deal future crisis shocks. it also mean monetary policy may call realistically deliver – phenomenon already witness advance economies. a relate policy issue structural reforms. this topic much discuss post-crisis years. the trans-atlantic crisis blow-up large imbalance distortion – real financial – build many 4 bi central bankers’ speech years. it reflect policymakers delay ignore need reforms. the experience provide lesson long imbalance ignore allow pile up, big mess whole pile finally come crash down. structural reform certainly need many crisis affect advance economies. but also need many emes, include malaysia. they need ensure economic growth base strong foundation therefore sustain sustainable. yet, pace structural reform economy slow lack momentum. the main reason behind inertia often stranglehold vest interest. on point, let quote mr. travis kelanik, founder taxi service app uber, last week cause black cab driver london go strike. he report wall street journal saying: “…there’s much corruption much cronyism taxi industry much regulatory capture ask permission front something already legal, you’ll never get it. there’s upside them.” clearly, taxi industry one characteristics, one would resistant competition structural change. another reason inertia structural reform often entail short-term pain even provide long-term gain. note protest occur crisis-affected economy response structural measure government economy force implement. the short-term pain make structural reform politically difficult decision. there sector society would adversely affect reform take kindly. therefore, take political courage. the point reform occurring, adversely affect pace economic growth due dislocation caused. however, assume government fiscal strength, dislocation mitigate use fiscal policy. therefore, term growth outlook, country seriously undertake structural reform may temporarily reduce growth, would likely lead much strong longer-term growth. if reform undertaken, would create low unstable growth path affect economies. the collateral consequence late outcome could increase cross-border frictions. the fifth final point i would like mention income inequality. you cannot notice become hot topic discussion post-crisis period. the french economist thomas piketty, become superstar write book it. the reason obvious. well-paid banker cause crisis crisis continue well-paid jobs. many low middle income worker lose jobs, suffer sharp decline economic welfare, many even lose homes. furthermore, crisis highlight large disparity income aes, fact precede period prosperity, benefit growth largely go relatively small group society. you say crisis let genie gini-coefficient. how government deal income disparity reflect social political outcomes, also economic one low middle income group high marginal propensity consume. similarly, lack success deal high youth unemployment crisis affect economy could last consequence put young people permanently low earn path, contribute income inequality weak growth. bi central bankers’ speech 5 to conclude, let summarise key message: economically, thing look good long time. however, legacy crisis remain remain u time yet. and continue cloud outlook concern challenge policymakers try steer global economy crisis sustain sustainable growth path. bi central bankers’ speech 1 haruhiko kuroda: toward early achievement 2 percent price stability target sustainable growth japan’s economy speech mr haruhiko kuroda, governor bank japan, keizai doyukai (japan association corporate executives) members’ meeting, tokyo, 23 june 2014. * * * accompany chart find end speech. introduction it great honor invite keizai doyukai (japan association corporate executives) members’ meet opportunity address distinguish business leader japan. in april last year, bank japan introduce quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time, time horizon two years. more one year pass since qqe far intend effects, japan’s economy path suggest 2 percent price stability target achieve expected. however, half way there. the bank therefore continue qqe, aim achieve price stability target 2 percent, long necessary maintain target stable manner. the topic i would like talk today bank’s view concern current state outlook economic activity prices. base that, i talk somewhat depth mechanism base inflation expect increase toward 2 percent. in concluding, i offer view challenge strengthen japan’s medium- long-term growth potential. i. current situation outlook economic activity price economic activity let start economic situation. domestic demand, include business fix investment, remain resilient trend, although decline demand follow consumption tax hike april year – mainly private consumption durable good – observed. in situation, along clear improvement employment income situation, virtuous cycle economic activity continue operate steadily, japan’s economy continue recover moderately trend. look ahead, domestic demand likely remain firm export expect increase moderately, virtuous cycle among production, income, spend likely maintained. therefore, next three year so, japan’s economy trend likely continue grow pace potential, although growth affect fluctuation demand associate two round consumption tax hike (chart 1). for scenario materialize, two factor key importance. the first exports, fuel recovery overseas economies, start increase again. the second domestic demand, drive japan’s recovery far, remain firm. let discus two factor detail. export overseas economy the first key factor development exports. export recently remain le flat lack momentum despite correction excessive appreciation yen (chart 2). these trend export essentially due cyclical factors, including, example, sluggishness emerge economy asean countries. at 2 bi central bankers’ speech time, however, structural factor increase relocation production overseas japanese manufacturer also play certain role. in addition, temporary factor likely put downward pressure exports. example include fact firm place priority domestic shipment response front-loading demand prior consumption tax hike effect unusually severe winter weather unite states. therefore, look ahead, export likely start increase again, albeit moderately, effect temporary factor diminish growth overseas economies, include emerge economies, gradually pick up. look current situation outlook overseas economy detail, overseas economy – particular advance economy u.s. european economy – recovering, although economic performance remain lackluster emerge economies. a outlook, overseas economy likely continue recover moderately. the international monetary fund (imf) expect global economic growth, fell 3.0 percent 2013, accelerate gradually 3.6 percent 2014 3.9 percent 2015 (chart 3). look individual country regions, u.s. economy register negative gdp growth january–march quarter due mainly unusually severe winter weather. however, since march, number economic indicator rebound severe winter weather waned, u.s. economy return moderate recovery trend, lead mainly private demand. give accommodative financial conditions, pace recovery likely accelerate gradually improvement employment income situation become pronounced. in europe, year-on-year rate change consumer price euro area, struggle structural problem excessive debt, le 1 percent six months, give rise concern deflation. that said, business household sentiment improving, force cyclically elevate economic activity recently work economy recover moderately, gdp euro area register positive growth four consecutive quarters. the euro area economy likely continue recovering, reflect recovery domestic demand, also expect moderate improvement external demand. a chinese economy, deceleration growth observe since begin year appear come halt, economy expect continue grow stably around current pace due partly economic stimulus measure implement government. finally, emerge economy commodity-exporting economy likely continue lack growth momentum time being, somewhat longer-term perspective growth expect gradually pick background recovery advance economies. nevertheless, look outlook advance economies, expect main drive force global economy time being, attention pay pace recovery u.s. economy prospect european debt problem. in addition, necessary keep eye issue excess production capacity excess debt china, development emerge commodity-exporting country face structural problem current account deficit high inflation, geopolitical risk emanate countries. thus, remain various uncertainty regard outlook overseas economies, warrant vigilance. sustainability domestic demand let next talk sustainability domestic demand, especially current situation outlook business fix investment private consumption (chart 4). a business fix investment, argue increase investment cannot expect due partly increase relocation production overseas, recent figure show investment grow moderately. in gdp statistics, example, investment register quarter-on-quarter increase four consecutive quarters. quarter-on-quarter growth january–march quarter year, 7.6 percent, particularly high reflect temporary upward momentum due to, example, renewal demand stem bi central bankers’ speech 3 end support software program front-loading demand prior strengthen gas emission regulations. look ahead, since corporate profit likely continue improving, business fix investment project follow moderate upward trend firm seek expand capacity back increase capacity utilization monetary ease continue underpin demand investment. with regard private consumption, outlook crucially depend effect consumption tax hike. to consider effects, need divide two aspects. the first aspect short-term effect decline demand follow front-loading consumption prior tax hike, second aspect longer-term effect decline real income result tax hike, materialize gradually. economic indicator release far indicate clear decline follow tax hike purchase durable good automobiles, demand increase substantially prior tax hike. however, many firm indicate magnitude decline consumption follow tax hike broadly line expectation private consumption continue remain resilient trend. at stage, therefore appear effect decline consumption due front-loading demand likely start wan come months. a adverse effect decline real incomes, key extent improvement employment income situation alleviate effects. with labor market condition continue improve steadily, employee income expect continue rise moderately, private consumption likely remain resilient. how tax hike affect consumption something continue examine come months. price let turn price developments. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi, exclude fresh food) plus 1.3 percent four consecutive month december last year march year, and, exclude direct effect consumption tax hike, accelerate somewhat plus 1.5 percent april (chart 5). break year-on-year rate increase show price increase see wide range item reflect japan’s economy continue recover moderately, energy-related good stop push year-on-year rate increase. with regard outlook, year-on-year rate change cpi exclude direct effect consumption tax hike likely around 1¼ percent time, upward pressure import price – particular energy price – likely wane, trend inflationary pressure – due mainly improvement output gap – increase. specifically, summer, year-on-year rate increase cpi expect slow around 1 percent. subsequently, trend inflationary pressure continue strengthen, year-on-year rate increase cpi expect follow upward trend second half fiscal year reach around 2 percent – price stability target – around middle current projection period fiscal 2014 fiscal 2016, is, around fiscal 2015. thereafter, rate increase likely edge up, since medium- long-term inflation expectation converge around 2 percent output gap expect continue expand positive territory (chart 1). hence, japan’s economy likely achieve inflation rate around 2 percent thereafter shift growth path sustain inflation stable manner. ii. path toward price stability target 2 percent the bank’s outlook price i outline fairly bullish compare average view market participant economists. therefore, following, i would like explain mechanism that, bank’s view, underlie increase inflation toward 2 percent little depth. to sum advance, view upward pressure price increase future follow two reasons. first, output gap likely 4 bi central bankers’ speech improve steadily and, second, medium- long-term inflation expectation likely rise, turn influence actual wage price setting. upward pressure price output gap let start output gap. a key characteristic current economic recovery lead domestic demand public investment private consumption. a result, nonmanufacturing sector play central role recovery. since nonmanufacturing sector labor-intensive manufacture sector, this, whole, lead tighten labor market conditions. those today may aware daily business. in term economic data, unemployment rate approach structural unemployment rate, consider around 3.5 percent, active job openings-to-applicants ratio rise 1.08, level peak reach global financial crisis (chart 6). this tighten labor market condition start influence wages, and, regular annual wage negotiation spring, number firm raise bonus also base pay increase substantially. in addition increase utilization labor, grow number firms, particularly nonmanufacturing sector, experience capacity shortages, output gap narrow moderately. while level output gap subject considerable margin error, gap seem narrow close 0 percent, is, long-term average (chart 7). a outlook, inflationary pressure output gap likely strengthen further, give economy expect continue grow pace potential. upward pressure price inflation expectation let next outline development medium- long-term inflation expectations. accord various survey market indicators, inflation expectation appear rise whole (chart 8). look mechanism behind rise, appear that, first instance, bank’s strong clear commitment overcome deflation qqe, together bold monetary ease underpin commitment, affect expectation economic entities, inflation expectation start rise. subsequently, actual increase inflation rate due narrow output gap lead rise inflation expectations. a mention earlier, year-on-year rate change cpi (excluding fresh food) plus 1 percent. except period surge global commodity price around 2008, first time two decade since 1993 cpi rise 1 percent year-on-year several month row. with firm household experience price increases, inflation expectation change start influence wage price setting. a see wage negotiation spring, increase inflation take account wage negotiation management labor. in addition, shift firms’ price-setting strategy strategy focus low price strategy seek raise sale price increase value add observed. give bank continue steadily pursue qqe inflation continue 1 percent, medium- long-term inflation expectation likely follow increase trend, reinforce inflationary pressure. upward drift phillips curve although somewhat technical, let summarize price rise mechanism use concept phillips curve (chart 9). the phillips curve depict relationship output gap inflation, illustrate follow mechanism: economic condition favorable labor market market good service tight, inflation rise. in chart, vertical axis depict inflation rate, horizontal axis depict output gap. the phillips curve assume upward-sloping; is, economic condition improve move right along phillips curve, inflation rate increase. note inflation rate depict year-on-year rate change bi central bankers’ speech 5 cpi exclude food energy, likely affect change exchange rate yen. let u first look back situation introduction qqe. the green curve base data first half 1990s, blue curve base data since second half 1990s. compare two, see phillips curve shift downward prolong period deflation. a result, relationship economic activity price become even output gap zero – economy normal state – inflation 0 percent. under circumstances, view price decline rise become firmly entrench among firm households. qqe aim drastically change deflationary mindset firm household raise inflation expectation toward 2 percent. in term phillips curve, mean bank aim shift phillips curve upward, slightly green curve, relationship economic activity price inflation 2 percent output gap zero, is, economy normal state. development past year in light aim, much progress made? let u next look change since introduction qqe. the red circle chart illustrate development past year indicate following. first, economy grow pace potential qqe, output gap improve move right. along this, upward pressure prices. second, red circle locate blue phillips curve deflation period. this suggest inflation high explain solely improvement output gap. there likely several reason behind this. one depreciation yen may affect item cpi food energy, which, i mention earlier, already excluded. another reason factor exert strong downward pressure wage price deflation period, especially mid-2000s, increase non-regular worker inflow low-priced import emerge economies, unlikely put downward pressure wage prices. yet another reason that, qqe, inflation expectation seem rise phillips curve start drift upward. this confirmed, mention earlier, development inflation expectation gauge various survey market indicator well recent pattern wage price setting. it difficult clearly disentangle contribution different factors. however, fact see inflation rate notably high anticipate many people time introduction qqe april last year. moreover, least say relationship economic activity price past year different see previously. at bank, believe qqe intend effects. price far develop almost line outlook price publish bank april last year, eye unexpected inflation. so far, cpi inflation increase reach around 1¼ percent accord mechanism envisage time introduction qqe. with mechanism continue work, inflation likely approach target 2 percent. however, aim qqe temporarily achieve 2 percent inflation maintain level stable manner. to end, necessary inflation expectation converge toward 2 percent ensure stay there, is, anchor them. put simply, need achieve world people engage economic activity base assumption 2 percent inflation given. to reach world, 6 bi central bankers’ speech necessary raise actual inflation rate inflation expectations. this reason i say early half way there. the bank therefore continue qqe, aim achieve price stability target 2 percent, long necessary maintain target stable manner. if outlook change due manifestation risk factors, bank make adjustment without hesitation judge necessary achieve price stability target. iii. toward strengthen japan’s medium- long-term growth potential a i explained, japan’s economy recover moderately path suggest 2 percent price stability target achieve expected. against backdrop, discussion labor shortage supply capacity constraint increasingly come forefront. although decline potential growth rate clearly recognize one key challenge face japan, overshadow concern excess labor excess capacity, consider immediate problems, since demand weak. however, situation change past year so. with increase demand thank large-scale monetary easing, fiscal spending, rejuvenation private-sector activity, supply capacity constraint lurk surface become apparent. in situation, seem become widely recognize important enhance supply capacity medium- long-term perspective. in view, supply capacity constraint surfaced, golden opportunity push ahead initiative address challenge japan facing. therefore, i would like offer view issue japan’s medium- long-term growth potential. an economy’s medium- long-term growth potential, words, potential growth rate, depend growth production factors, is, capital labor, well improvement productivity innovation like. japan’s potential growth rate decline trend since 1990s (chart 10). look detail reason decline japan’s potential growth rate, deceleration capital accumulation productivity growth 1990s play major role. during period, japanese firm weigh need resolve so-called three excess – excess labor, capital stock, debt – pile precede bubble period could sufficiently respond change increase globalization revolution information communication technology. in addition, adjustment excess progress smoothly inefficient part economy preserved. this extent lead slowdown metabolism economy whole decline productivity. in addition, decline labor input result demographic trend decrease work hour economy mature short work hour become common put downward pressure potential growth rate. protract deflation additional shock global financial crisis lead firm defer fix investment, growth capital stock subdued. a result various factor successively exert downward pressure economy, japan’s potential growth rate decline since 1990s recently seem hover around 0.5 percent. what do raise medium- long-term growth potential? in short, critical promote initiative address aforementioned factor affect potential growth rate. namely, essential (1) encourage forward-looking investment firm increase capital stock, (2) enhance labor supply capacity raise labor participation woman elderly well utilize high-skilled foreigners, (3) raise productivity regulatory institutional reforms. in regard, government formulate growth strategy, japan revitalization strategy, stimulate private investment implement measure include strategy. take account subsequent bi central bankers’ speech 7 discussions, government process revise japan revitalization strategy. the bank strongly hope government push ahead steady implementation growth strategy. conclude remark in concluding, let briefly touch relationship strengthen growth potential monetary policy management. while initiative strengthen growth potential critical, medium- long-term challenges. some time require initiative bear fruit growth potential actually rise. it course desirable potential growth rate increase steadily. however, even potential growth rate rise, would make difficult monetary policy achieve price stability target. i believe steadily pursue qqe, bank achieve target 2 percent base aforementioned mechanisms, is, improvement output gap rise inflation expectations. the bank’s mission ensure price stability remain unchanged irrespective level potential growth rate. the bank pursue monetary policy management accord achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time. while strengthen growth potential mainly responsibility government growth strategy well private entity action response growth strategy, may way bank help. that is, deflationary environment, proactive initiative conduct business fix investment provide little reward term risk return individual firms, rational firm hoard cash maintain status quo. change environment one deflation one 2 percent inflation change firms’ incentive expect lead proactive investment stance great effort raise productivity. against background, let assure bank steadily pursue qqe achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time. i would like conclude speech express hope bank’s policy conduct provide environment help firm take proactive actions. thank you. 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 12 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: interview de telegraaf interview mario draghi, president european central bank, de telegraaf, publish 21 june 2014. * * * when mario draghi take president european central bank november 2011, step eye hurricane. the euro area confront serious problems. after financial misery greece, portugal ireland, large country like spain italy also threaten collapse. panic widespread, among politician among investors. a first day office president central bank, italian take crisis measures. the serious concern thing past, europe still experience economic woes. draghi remain outwardly calm despite turbulence deal with. do ever doubt take job? “no, no, i never hesitated. thing happen.” mario draghi 66 year old five half year ahead frankfurt. he meet reporter de telegraaf exclusive interview 35th floor ecb tower. in near future, move gleam new premises, moment still surround predecessor jean-claude trichet wim duisenberg leave him. “only book different – mine.” he happy take dutch debate euro. he doesn’t think much politician promise earth outside single european currency. “some people think move back time, thirty forty year back. i prefer go forward.” and also mean continue build monetary union mean completed. minister dijsselbloem say recently crisis over. what view? “the recovery ongoing around nine months. it still weak unevenly distribute across euro area. and vulnerable. accident could happen global economy quickly change situation. that might disruption financial markets, geopolitical risks. in addition, unemployment stabilise six months. very slowly go down. also crisis country portugal. but level unemployment still high. that alone pose risk recovery lead low consumer demand.” you would thus define recovery growth zero? “no, economic activity gradually, though slowly, pick up. both manufacturers’ consumers’ confidence quite good recent times. however, first quarter year saw slow growth.” the trouble iraq cause oil price surge. how much risk that? “our mandate ensure price stability. if inflation medium term high target close to, below, 2%, concerned. but also concern far lower. we constantly ask inflation low euro area. initially, due low energy food prices. later, u dollar price product stabilised, euro appreciated, cause inflation fall still further. high oil price sure impact inflation, least experience appreciation euro. but also good news country produce energy, case netherlands gas.” 2 bi central bankers’ speech at least winter mild, since cost netherlands quite bite term gas sale begin year. “yes, indeed. be remarkable significant fall economic activity netherlands first quarter due primarily fact? many people simply don’t realise large energy sector is. incidentally, one acknowledge low inflation, generally negative growth especially euro area, support real disposable incomes. that one reason consumption euro area rising.” compare unite kingdom unite states, economic activity europe still rather weak. “our recovery early stage unite states, unite kingdom japan. that ecb adopt number policy measure 5 june: low interest rate (and bank negative deposit rate), introduction support bank link provision credit, so-called tltros preparation programme purchase package corporate loans, asset-backed securities. in april, i already say amsterdam three situation could induce ecb take action. one unwarranted tighten monetary policy stance reflect increase short-term interest rates. that could lead high medium-term interest rates, thus also impact economic growth price stability. the second ongoing deterioration lending. that also matter attention lend weak long time. the third development deterioration prospect price stability medium term.” and three occur one time? “no, respond primarily first two. we see deflation sense price decline across whole spectrum euro area, household firm postpone consumption investment wait low prices. what see low inflation persist long time. if last long, adjustment crisis country make difficult. in situation low inflation, wage country need really decline absolute term order improve competitiveness.” doe fact play role debt weigh heavily inflation low? “certainly, yet another consequence low inflation. the reduction debt levels, great importance large part euro area, become difficult event low inflation.” private public sector debt? “yes, private public debt.” low interest rate detrimental savers, people’s pensions. how would answer concern? “it understandable concern. many life insurance policy pension plan promise far high value time agreed.” how long interest rate continue remain low? “we prolong banks’ access unlimited liquidity end 2016. that signal. our programme support bank lend business continue four years. that show interest rate remain low long period. but thereafter increase recovery firm up.” if unite state already raise interest rate spring 2015, would europe wait spring 2017? “we wait see happens, extension end 2016 signal. incidentally, unite state reduce growth figure first quarter.” bi central bankers’ speech 3 in view impairment pension entitlements, people spend le set aside. “we see this. there lack spend country affect low interest rates. i understand concern low interest rates, hand, lead investment high growth. and need take account precisely interest rate talk about. these pension product invest government bond long maturities. many reason interest rate government bond low nothing ecb. they low country netherlands germany become safe havens. prior crisis, life insurer invest bond issue countries, ‘core’ country ‘non-core’ countries. the interest earn investment thus high weak country also included. the crisis create financial fragmentation insurer use government bond issue country fulfil obligations. that cause insurer north confront low yields. return south particularly good. once renew confidence euro area, northern country long safe havens. money flow freely recovery confidence lead high yield northern countries. besides that, conduct monetary policy whole euro area. we cannot consider one single point interest.” do understand fact people north feel pay mistake make south? “i well aware conflict. some month ago, i hold lecture monetary union unite states. i say major imbalance various euro area countries, large debtor large creditor countries. i say never goal monetary union create permanent creditor permanent debtors. that would change order balance union. an american audience respond say ‘what say hold water unite states, state oklahoma always debtor, new york always creditor, cause u worry. so worry it?’ i think touch heart matter. the debt u citizen treat equally, irrespective come from.” because unite state political union. “indeed. the dutch problem pay greeks, pay dutch. but let’s look ‘paying’. it clear country really pay countries. in greece, write-off debt hold financial sector, default. it cost euro area country far save banks.” will greece ever able repay debt? “if greece continue structural reforms, restore order public finance improve competitiveness, growth increase. if happens, greece able so. greece le debt service next five year belgium. much greek debt low interest rate long maturities.” the ecb take many measures, undertake quantitative easing, i.e. purchase bonds. what need happen would start so? “that would answer third situation i mention amsterdam, deterioration inflation expectation medium term. at moment, however, focus measure announce 5 june.” be legally possible buy government bonds? there still court case pending issue. “this indeed possible within mandate, namely purchase aim ensure price stability. we permit provide member state monetary financing.” 4 bi central bankers’ speech you happy unanimity decision take 5 june. would unanimous decision also possible quantitative easing? “any guess would premature. quantitative ease include government bonds, also private sector loans. we discus time comes.” your statement “whatever takes”, save euro cost, make time announcement new government bond purchase programme, mark turn point euro crisis. do feel long need follow it? (smiles) “in contrast initial purchase government bond possible quantitative easing, programme outright monetary transaction (omts) aim specific risk, namely so-called tail risk euro area fall apart.” do ever fear might happen? “in july 2012, enough reason concern. in short statement london, i say one mistake many people make underestimate much political capital already invest euro. i much aware fact. just i make statement, political leader fully commit euro european summit, within scope bank union created.” be omts kind nuclear bomb, threat never carry out? “the market react way make unnecessary use programme. the spread interest rate [on bonds] southern euro area country germany narrow sharply. that something could achieve monetary policy measure.” be surprise effect? “by magnitude effect? yes, certainly. we surprised.” or relieve merely promise action without follow it? “in order credible, also sure could actually use instrument. we bluffing, certainly not.” the side coin buy much time politician long need implement reform rapidly. do also see side? “yes no. we mandate safeguard price stability. we responsible politician make use time have. i want mix responsibility central bank governments. but look extent reform undertake government since 2012. you need admit considerable progress made. take spain, example, restructure bank sector reform labour market. portugal another example ireland yet another. and even greece progress remarkable.” you say repeatedly euro irreversible project. it understandable say that, something politician decide? “our mandate ensure price stability. there enough evidence collapse euro would endanger price stability, therefore action squarely within mandate.” you save euro. in so, take political decision? “no, certainly not. the issue mean political. my statement july 2012 aim price stability. there unjustified uncertainty future euro, political uncertainty financial one. unjustified speculative expectation break-up euro self-fulfilling vicious spiral several months. they produce bi central bankers’ speech 5 high level interest rates. these rate harm real economy bank sector. the consequence might new credit crisis impairment monetary policy, therefore ability maintain price stability. there far often criticism political decision, simply true.” much undertake close gap economic monetary union, strict budget rule bank union. be everything place? “the bank union major step forward direction complete monetary union. the crisis show economic policy one country clear impact countries. economic policy cannot purely national matter. where fiscal policy concerned, certain degree union-wide discipline already given. but mark imbalance euro area country due lack structural reform countries. the next step take subject structural reforms, too, union-wide discipline.” current economic policy coordination euro area merely first step? “yes, indeed, merely first step.” what second step look like? “that matter political domain decide. in case budget agreements, sovereignty share among member states. that also do respect labour market, competitiveness, bureaucracy, agreement internal market. sovereignty need share level national sphere. that i stop. because several option politician choose from. you could grant great power european commission, member state within european council, could create new european institutions. that decide.” the contention politician emu complete thus correct? “no, far necessary perfect monetary union.” be budgetary authority necessary euro area level, fund compensation weak countries? “that highly political issue. compliance exist rule would enough. but clear predecessor office, trichet, make strong case budgetary authority.” return example state oklahoma, would form financial solidarity need euro area? “there least one difference. the unite state single country, euro area not. give complex structure, must seek design best ensure economic policy regard common interest.” do understand concern transfer powers? the outcome european election also view background. do solution issue? “are really sure would good still currency? would good past ten, fifteen years? in 1970s, 1980s 1990s, experience whole number currency devaluation often high inflation result. we currently formidable degree price stability, low rate inflation. that offer enormous opportunity growth job creation. it fault euro economic policy go wrong countries. but let u please conduct debate. it important such. some people feel turn time back thirty forty years, i prefer move forward.” 6 bi central bankers’ speech do understand people see euro cause crisis, unemployment? “the crisis unemployment result severe financial crisis partly also wrong economic policies. the euro may mask cause it. we must end crisis monetary union enable create prosperity job again.” that sound terrific, many eu summit growth job creation lead nothing. what need done? “that complicate issue. we cannot accept present currently low growth insufficient job creation. on hand, dream past cannot bring back cannot mean clearly take better. we must work future order achieve stability, also growth employment.” bi central bankers’ speech 1 cyril roux: the new regulatory supervisory roadmap europe address mr cyril roux, deputy governor (financial regulation) central bank ireland, bank union conference, dublin, 23 june 2014. * * * good morning. my thank irish bank federation invite address distinguish audience. it pleasure you. the last decade see country go back forth conduct bank supervision within without central banks. but one thing remain constant: domestic nature supervision. to coordinate supervision within eu, establish past two main mechanisms: home host arrangements, college supervisors, charge joint risk assessment decisions. the ssm big step beyond two mechanism cooperation: name implies, put place unify bank supervisor eurozone. create international bank supervisor span 18 country trillion asset unprecedented. it significant change ever make european bank supervision. a two pillar fall place, form basis european bank union, arguably main european project time. we hear danièle nouy operational challenge opportunity present single supervisory mechanism see ecb, i share central bank prepare implementation ssm 4 november year. i provide update work transition new regime supervision, impact upon way organise mean irish banks. our transition ssm we establish programme work prepare implementation ssm central bank – project call project europe. this significant project currently progress central bank. it involve eleven division across bank, hr bank supervision it legal enforcement, among others. they work together 23 separate work stream ensure prepare 4 november. so work precisely? we revise internal governance, report decision make processes. we develop supervisory board brief process akin govern council. we prepare change divisional structure bank supervision we plan, devise roll train staff involve ssm we update publicly available material bank supervision enforcement. we upgrade receipt, validation transmission tool supervisory statistical data we revise fitness probity regulation internal workflow around same. we support department finance draft transpose legislation. in doing, establishment ssm provide u opportunity improve strengthen tool procedure even good supervisor. our aim ensure complete preparatory task support ecb’s 2 bi central bankers’ speech preparation also make necessary organisational change allow u deliver supervisory mandate ever effectively. in seek ensure give full expression aim objective ssm – mere implementation minimum require compliant ssm methodology structures. but course, cannot isolation. we recently pleasure host series visit senior management ssm recent weeks, also look forward visit danièle afternoon. in april, visit dr korbinian ibel director general charge dg iv ssm, which, among tasks, charge develop ssm policy methodology ensure national supervisory authority apply ssm rule procedure consistently, significant le significant institution alike. we hold series meet colleague different divisions, include risk division. our risk base approach supervision introduce central bank 2011 consider detail devise ssm approach judgment

walter ramon quintana, director general dg i dg ii ssm, deputies, another fruitful day meet engagement recall involve in. this afternoon, introduce danièle bank supervision team also wide project team include colleague variety division include policy risk divisions, hr, it, statistics, enforcement legal. we host town hall style meet staff affect change bring ssm. this fantastic opportunity staff ask question directly chair. the central bank ireland make continue make significant contribution ssm, every level. like fellow eurozone peers, i take part every fortnight supervisory board meet chair danièle, patrick brady alternate, derville rowland joe gavin represent u legal committee ecb meet ssm composition. other ecb committee address it, data, hr communication issue ssm. in bank supervision matters, also contribute many technical meet take place frankfurt around europe ever increase pace. we also contribute staff ssm. 200 staff authority europe second ssm date; 11 central bank ireland hope increase figure. this indicative commitment success single supervisory mechanism. comprehensive assessment – update of course, parallel change projects, comprehensive assessment. you aware ecb launch comprehensive assessment november last year. in fact, today heavily engage exercise. this project, kind entrance examination significant credit institutions, include asset quality review (aqr), stress test supervisory risk assessment. the aqr point-in-time examination bank’s asset result determination provision adequacy and, case may be, identification capital requirements. the bi central bankers’ speech 3 stress test build aqr provide forward-looking view banks’ shock-absorption capacity prescribe macro-economic scenario constraints. we well advance aqr exercise. this involve examination credit market exposures, off-balance sheet exposures, cover material asset classes. it result 50 per cent asset risk weight review national competent authority teams. for us, mean engage auditor review 4,000 credit file resultant collateral valuations. we cover three large irish bank group also large subsidiary foreign bank groups, headquarter elsewhere eurozone, uk us. the aqr also result completion central bank processes, policy & account reviews, level 3 fair value asset revaluation collective model reviews. the project organisation ensure high level quality assurance intend result aqr fully integrate result stress test. our recent balance sheet assessment, conduct last year, take account aqr determination results. the approach stress test per eba methodology publish april perform eba ecb close co-operation. we expect first submission constrain bottom-up result end month. why publish result now, afford sneak preview? because first set preliminary result may well turn require lot validation, consistency checking, supervisory dialogue, integration rework stand behind them. the next four month see period challenge, quality assurance, integration aqr result finalisation. the result publish eba bank sample. for bank also part ssm, expect result comprehensive assessment publish thereafter – recognise unique integration aqr result forward-looking stress test capital requirements. significant credit institution “joint supervisory team” danièle take u through, detail, operational challenge opportunity go hand hand ssm. one focus point supervision ssm significant institution joint supervisory team jsts, say team comprise ecb national central bank staff work together ongoing supervision significant institution. a jst coordinator lead jst base ecb. the jst co-ordinator support current team leader line supervisor work the jst coordinator responsible plan execution annual supervisory programme coordination communication institutions. they also make proposal formal decision supervisory board, monitor implementation decisions. this apply bank currently subject comprehensive assessment (aib, boi, ptsb, ubil, boaml). a bank differ size complexity, supervise 4 different division ssm; two division dg i two dg ii. except jst coordinator frankfurt, jst member bank bank supervision directorate lead sharon donnery work central bank. the day day work, on-site inspection supervisory engagement continue perform sharon’s teams. for jsts become effective operational obviously much dialogue, cooperation information sharing. some information share commence process infancy jsts become formed. 4 bi central bankers’ speech jst coordinator irish bank come soon dublin meet central bank staff, learn institutions, risk profile current issues. they also meet institution directly responsible for. you expect hear new supervisory team shortly. le significant institution while significant institution undergo change supervisory personnel, le significant institutions, “lsis”, supervise continue supervise directly u dublin. we adopt jst structure them. when talk le significant institution i would like make point mean low risk or, le important. in fact, often small institution may carry risk insofar systems, control governance concern impact risk crystallise significant eu wide financial landscape. yet institution often essential provision service economy, consumers, business sectors. we continue direct supervision le significant institutions. we retain responsibility supervision ecb oversight, dg iii lead mr jukka vesala. this ensure harmonise approach consistency quality. what change that, like significant institutions, move away current prism engagement model supervise accordance ssm supervisory manual. the imf, report observance standard code (rosc), issue begin year, invite central bank review supervisory engagement mix onsite offsite supervision medium low low impact banks. the fund recommend analysis regulatory return strengthen well great focus test sample risk management processes. it important u continue supervise high international standard best practice. we therefore review supervisory engagement model bank tandem ecb year order address find take action necessary. let also mention that, jst banks, expect ssm staff staff supervisory authority may join u inspection part supervisory work. organisational change central bank the central bank make organisational change reflect ssm operation align experience term interaction communications. a know ssm four directorates, i already referred: two significant institutions, one le significant institution one refer horizontal functions. the horizontal directorate include 11 different division contain function provide service across supervisory directorate one centralise management on-site inspections. we give consideration organise ssm hold discussion ssm management national supervisors. it clear u need change structure accommodate ssm structure: • create clear distinction site site activities; • facilitate creation clear linkage relationship central bank ssm; bi central bankers’ speech 5 • respond quantitative analysis become ever prevalent • build report capability; • build skill capability staff ensure development retention. this imply three way split, involve creation specific on-site inspection team one hand, hand team focus ongoing, off-site supervision banks. the introduction separate on-site inspection team task discrete inspection mandate independent on-going supervisory work institution new territory central bank. currently incorporate on-site work on-going supervisory work independent team perform work. combine this, mirror ssm structure, recognise need also third horizontal division, would comprise specialise team liquidity, credit, internal models, like. we expect change structurally come months. we shall ensure build necessary skill capability staff continue deliver supervisory mandate post november. transition ssm institution what mean term engagement ssm team central bank? what need differently? obviously bank part eurozone system supervision, coordinator jst base frankfurt. therefore, stakeholder engagement important increasingly demand institution supervise ecb. at high-level, individual risk element risk assessment largely consistent approach currently take assess risks. however, many fine element change. the supervisory manual prescriptive current processes, provide great linkage individual risk quantitative outcome. final srep decision – include take account comprehensive assessment – likely take shortly ssm commencement within construct new joint supervisory teams. altogether ssm approach probably formal, great emphasis commonality approach treatment peer reviews. however i sure i disappoint i tell le intensive! the on-site inspection prominent formalise different aspect engagement lead different functional expert possibly lead head mission different national supervisory authority. the horizontal function ssm provide special expertise jsts – identify early focus point trend sector-wide analysis, ensure consistency, adequacy best practices; and, focus supervisory action. to successfully ecb probably want leverage specialist capability horizontal function ncas. you may find engage team multiple supervisory authorities. there significant increase volume data require complete assessments, use key risk indicators, level prescription within assessment (e.g. use questionnaire risk categories). in general expect request data increase therefore bank must continue develop data warehouse analytics capabilities. there wide movement towards granular data request allow supervisor conduct analytics. 6 bi central bankers’ speech non ssm task while clear lot change irish central bank come months, supervisory priority remain. we continue focus overall strategic statutory objective – safeguard stability, protect consumers. we continue supervise credit institution respect compliance non-prudential rules, include consumer protection anti-money laundering, fall outside remit ecb ssm. we continue strengthen coverage anti money launder monitor compliance criminal justice act specifically focus anti money launder division. we also continue solely responsible conduct supervision. enforce proper behaviour continue key focus u central bank, particular adherence code conduct mortgage arrears. on note, post programme monitor troika continue throughout 2014 beyond relation ireland’s progress fix mortgage arrears crisis. it shall continue top priority. the high level arrears weigh ireland’s banking, act drag economy, new lend profitability. bank borrower need closure. the target set need achieve bank must continue progress resolutely resolve issue. conclusion in conclusion let emphasise successful implementation ssm key priority u central bank ireland. it also extremely excite challenge. work well advance project europe stage i confident effectively accomplish transition ssm time. we look forward work colleague ssm supervisory authority around europe converge single mechanism supervision, become one team supervisors. this combination skill experience cannot succeed. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-pierre danthine: situation swiss bank financial stability perspective introductory remark mr jean-pierre danthine, vice chairman govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 19 june 2014. * * * a colleague thomas jordan explained, economic financial condition continue challenging. against background, i would like examine situation swiss bank financial stability perspective, look first big bank move discussion domestically focus banks. big banks: strengthen resilience over past year, swiss big bank improve capital situation. in term loss-absorbing capital – define common equity tier 1 capital plus high-trigger contingent capital instrument – risk-weighted capital ratio either already exceed close 13% requirement apply 2019. they also meet close meet correspond leverage ratio requirement 3.1%. in term total capital, big bank also substantially improve ratios. however, yet meet correspond requirement applicable 2019.1 the snb welcome significant progress make big bank improve capital situation compliance requirement applicable 2019. the snb recommend continue improve resilience and, particular, leverage ratios. this important two reasons. first, loss potential swiss big bank – estimate different adverse scenario consider – continue substantial relative capitalisation. these adverse scenario forecasts. they represent unlikely, highly unfavourable coherent development economic financial conditions. for financial stability switzerland, important big bank remain adequately capitalise event scenario occurring. in addition, irrespective scenario considered, substantial loss also result operational legal risks, recent experience shown. second, international comparison reveal uneven picture swiss big banks’ capitalisation, depend capital measure one examines. although risk-weighted ratio average large globally

the disaggregated analysis conduct banco de españa support idea contraction debt aggregate level prove compatible shift mix 4 bi central bankers’ speech debt towards company sound position are, therefore, good place channel fund new investment translate growth employment. spanish bank sector i refer position outlook bank sector. for spanish bank industry, year 2013 mark culmination major reform framework financial assistance programme agree european authorities. this programme begin 2012 and, know, conclude last january. the reform see clean-up, recapitalisation restructure sector. in complex macroeconomic financial environment, require adjustment imbalance build previous expansionary phase, spanish bank sector demonstrate notable adaptability. i briefly review basic parameter mark development banks, particular change structure balance sheets, non-performing loan results. i underscore importance capital conservation measure current setting. change structure bank balance sheet last year, bank sector significantly reduce size balance sheet, well change structure. on asset side, reduction lend private sector persisted. this reduction was, however, compatible increase weight asset relative total balance sheet, whereas asset item – deposit central bank credit institutions, derivative operation – contract high rates. in turn, liability side, shift towards private-sector deposits, thereby further reduction fund borrow eurosystem. in addition, sector also increase funds, relative weight balance sheet gain significance. non-performing asset private-sector non-performing asset continue rise 2013. this increase aforementioned decrease credit explain growth non-performing asset ratio. also play role increase reclassification refinance loan portfolio require banco de españa 2012. in event, banks’ non-performing loan clearly cyclical component. in respect, line onset recovery economy, late data, relate early 2014, show slight fall non-performing asset month-on-month terms. this trend expect firm recovery economic activity gather steam. result the bank sector 2013 report consolidate profit €11 billion 2013, follow heavy loss 2012, basically due sizeable provision make banks. although provision continue eat considerable portion profit, relative significance 2013 appreciably le 2012. margin efficiency the moderate provision note help offset low margin 2013 income statement compare 2012. thus, background small volume bi central bankers’ speech 5 activity low interest rates, net interest income (the difference accrue interest revenue costs) drop nearly 10% year-on-year 2013. in 2013 spanish bank persist effort increase efficiency, readjust operate capacity prune staff branch number business spain, which, compare high mid-2008, around 20% 25%, respectively. in environment characterise persist downward pressure earn factor weak lending, low interest rate still-high provision needs, bank persevere reduce operate cost improve efficiency. conservation banks’ capital in 2013 bank sector strengthen solvency. the aggregate core capital deposit institution stand 11.5% end year, somewhat 2 pp end-2012. from medium- long-term standpoint, bank sector maintain capital conservation policies. the economic recovery still incipient fragmentation persist euro area financial markets. moreover, new solvency legislation come force europe last january implement requirement basel iii accord, whose application yet completed, call for, inter alia, high level quality capital. the banco de españa, recognise desirable conserve capital strengthen solvency levels, last february renew recommendation bank limit dividend pay-out policies. challenge face spanish economy role economic policy i shall conclude think challenge face spanish economy role economic policy. our economy currently set growth firm footing. however, effect crisis term unemployment indebtedness resident sector sizeable absorption require time. the improvement competitiveness reduction private-sector debt must continue. and environment low inflation euro area high euro exchange rates, pose additional difficulty. in area national policies, leeway apply demand-side policy scant. in respect, let discus detail challenge ahead fiscal policy. fiscal policy challenge a i already indicated, progress correction european fiscal imbalance significant. the data 2013 show, however, six year economic crisis began, ten country european union country budget deficit 3% gdp public debt level stand record high many member countries. have emerge phase financial bank instability, need fiscal consolidation continue condition economic policy europe come years, although adjustment plan less scale already implemented. in case spain, consolidation drive still ahead remain substantial. accord late stability programme update, plan reduction budget deficit 2014 2017 5.5 pp gdp, rise 6.4 pp gdp term decrease primary deficit. 6 bi central bankers’ speech complete fiscal consolidation process must remain override priority spain’s economic policy. this effort necessary maintain confidence economic agents, continue advance normalisation finance restore room manoeuvre budget policy. meet target crucial first contain and, subsequently, reduce public debt/gdp ratio. it difficult curb rise trend public debt latter reach high level outlook economic growth inflation moderate. if interest debt high nominal growth rate economy, public debt/gdp ratio grow inertially, even public revenue spend balanced. this effect stem pressure generate interest burden, arise high debt cannot counter growth real gdp change inflation. in situation, then, order avoid increase debt, enough attain overall balance budget (that is, net interest burden); rather, sizeable primary surplus must achieve maintained, particularly difficult set low growth low inflation. furthermore, short-term negative effect economic growth fiscal adjustment considered, contribute above-mentioned inertial increase debt. against backdrop bright economic outlook, expect that, unlike recent years, reduction budget deficit foreseeably boost positive performance tax revenue decrease expense closely link economic cycle, particularly unemployment benefits. the effort contain spend desirably accompany public spend revenue arrangement help ensure public sector make good contribution economic activity achieve last adjustment. a public spending, various action already undertake area public employment health education sectors, well reform local government administration streamline public sector, among others, continue generate save come years. in line recommendation european council, process would gain depth consistency accompany public spend assessment review. give degree decentralisation spain, exercise require active collaboration regional governments. of various public expenditure items, spend pension particularly important give high share challenge face relation sustainability medium term. progress area significant result various reform approved. in particular, 2011 retirement age period calculate regulatory base increased, 2013 so-called “sustainability” factor define revaluation index pension introduced. these measure help ease pressure medium term arise population ageing. the next step develop mechanism increase save retirement future may complement defined-benefit public pensions. turn public revenue, accord find committee expert – deliver report march 2014 – recommendation international agencies, reform need redress problem become visible crisis. these problem include notably low revenue-raising capacity tax system, high legal rate taxation alongside low effective rate taxation due proliferation tax benefits, bias towards distortional system taxation economic growth employment, namely, levy labour capital. give diagnosis, proposal committee expert international agency coincide need increase weight indirect taxation permit reduction taxation labour, particularly social security contributions, also low taxation capital income. additionally, committee suggest tax rebates, reduction bi central bankers’ speech 7 allowance eliminate progress make towards great neutrality across save instruments. these recommendation underline important future change taxation, addition improve efficiency, jeopardise fiscal consolidation required. medium-term economic growth the fiscal consolidation process accompany series reform whose effect become discernible perceive shortly. the increase sensitivity price economic cycle prompt correction competitiveness gap spanish economy, flexible labour framework undoubtedly conducive wage moderation. a change also perceptible role past inflation process determine cost income. this change bolster implementation legislation deindexation economy. the effect term job creation tentative, yet promising. foreseeably, result flexible labour framework, employment grow rate which, moderate, relatively high relation growth gdp. undertake reform increase competition also unavoidable. progress area also significant: may recall law entrepreneurs, single market guarantee insolvency. however, must acknowledge case actual implementation encounter difficulty delayed. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 vítor constâncio: recent challenge monetary policy euro area speech mr vítor constâncio, vice-president european central bank, athens symposium ‘‘banking union, monetary policy economic growth’’, athens, 19 june 2014. * * * lady gentlemen, seven year pass since financial market turmoil summer 2007 mark begin financial crisis ensue recession. these year challenge central banks. they mark end long period remarkably stable, good macroeconomic performance. the widespread adoption explicit price stability objective conducive low inflation outcome environment prolong economic growth. exist monetary policy strategy – mostly variant inflation target model, though notable exception ecb federal reserve – appear adequate sufficient attain goal. consistently tinbergen principle, primary objective price stability achieve everywhere single, conventional monetary policy instrument: short-term interest rate. the global financial crisis change situation abruptly. since then, central bank endow additional macro-prudential instrument explicit mandate preserve financial stability. while explicit change monetary policy strategy take place, fair say generalise increase attention pay banks’ balance sheet condition evolution credit. by far visible innovation since begin great recession however, increase array instrument use monetary policy purposes, particularly forward guidance interest rate notably use central banks’ balance sheet large scale asset purchase (lsap, i.e. quantitative ease qe). in theoretical debates, proposal make namely, change target monetary policy price level target nominal gdp simply, increase establish objective 2% inflation target regime 3% 4%. for practical reasons, proposal retain forward guidance qe new instrument choice many central banks. before crisis, establish instrument monetary policy short-term interest rate steer either traditional open-market operation buy sell security temporary lend bank via repos, like ecb’s case. after crisis, major central bank significantly increase balance sheet respective monetary base. 2 bi central bankers’ speech chart 1 it would, nevertheless, mislead compare change balance sheet size originate policy and, consequently, impact. the case ecb different central bank expansion balance

extend december 2016 (at least) indeed extraordinary unconventional measure. it support bank sector avoid detrimental credit crunch. however, size monetary base decline significantly 2013 bank decide start repayment previous high borrowings. on hand, per follow table, total outright purchase asset ecb two different programme behind increase balance sheet represent relatively small proportion total asset compare central banks. bi central bankers’ speech 3 table 1 before crisis, method conduct liquidity management transaction (via outright purchase lend banks) previously mentioned, objective steer short-term interest rate close policy rate decide central bank. it would therefore mislead interpret increase banks’ balance sheet lsap qe increase scale traditional outright purchases. there different objective intervene directly different asset market high maturity order influence respective price yields. the intention composition asset purchase thus relevant different previously do manage short-term rates. qe several transmission channels: besides direct impact prices/yields purchase asset (treasuries abss), trigger portfolio adjustment assets, like equity exchange rates,

i sustain inflation fluctuation somewhat surprise ever since begin great recession. in part, result adverse exogenous shocks. to extent however, also connect unwarranted variation markets’ expectation future stance monetary policy. second, i argue govern council meet begin june important decision actually adopted. it important also clear signal provide determination future, event additional downward pressure inflation. i develop two point deal way recent policy decision produce effects. the third question is: would ecb react, risk protract period low inflation materialise? at point time, essentially scenario analysis – specifically analysis low probability scenario. outright purchase range financial asset would effective situation, structural reform would also essential spur economic growth. 3 see giannone, d., m. lenza, h. pill l. reichlin (2011): “non-standard policy measure monetary developments”, ecb work paper series no. 1290; de pooter, m., r.f. martin, s. pruitt (2012): “the effect official bond market intervention europe”, federal reserve board governors, mimeo; eser, f., b. schwaab (2013): “the yield impact central bank asset purchases: the case ecb’s security market programme”, ecb work paper series no. 1587 ghysels, e., j. idier, s. manganelli, o. vergote (2014): “a high frequency assessment ecb security market programme”, ecb work paper series no. 1642; altavilla, c., d. giannone, m. lenza (2014): “the financial macroeconomic effect omt announcements”, csef work paper no. 352. 6 bi central bankers’ speech inflation development since great recession euro area inflation development past six year remarkably volatile. from 4.1% peak july 2008, hicp inflation fell markedly trough recession reach negative level short period june october 2009. however, second half 2009, price start increase again, also due rise energy prices. in spite persist level economic slack, hicp inflation climb rapidly steadily peak 3% september november 2011. similar development could observe u.s., inflation remain stable decline first month 2009 give rise debate “missing disinflation”.4 if development somewhat surprise swiftness, recent inflation dynamic display remarkably high degree persistence. a 2012, euro area inflation start fall again, continue date. since october 2013, year-on-year rate growth headline hicp oscillate 1% 0.5%, spite slowly consolidate economic recovery. a situation low inflation common many advance economies, create moral general puzzle. all all, lack tight relationship inflation development estimate slack economic activity, output gap, surprise point view modern monetary theories. the new keynesian phillips curve suggest that, net erratic factors, inflation determine whole path expect future output gaps, current level. hence, economic slack give point time need associate deflationary episode, accompany expectation output gap eventually turn sufficiently positive. in turn, expectation future stance monetary policy play key role determine expect future output gaps. the absence persistent disinflation 2009 may thus ascribe monetary accommodation impart many central bank end 2008 2009 standard non-standard tools. the monetary policy ease commensurate size shock, i.e. roughly offset disinflationary pressure produce recession.5 the recent fall inflation could equivalently ascribe unwarranted fear possible tighten monetary policy stance far future. such fear could clearly observe one year ago, federal reserve announce taper large-scale asset purchases. in spite clear feed communication disconnect decision time “lift-off” policy interest rates, taper announcement quickly lead rise forward interest rate side atlantic. the ecb’s adoption forward guidance july 2013 largely result unwarranted developments. recent study confirm forward guidance successful reverse previous increase forward-rates clarify persistently accommodative intonation ecb policy stance.6 the market logic lead interpretation fed’s taper announcement signal forthcoming tighten policy interest rate may also apply interpret implication reduction size ecb balance sheet occur 4 see, example, coibion, o. y. gorodnichenko (2013), “is the phillips curve alive well after all?

from standpoint, i believe three clear channel decision adopt govern council june effective. the first channel standard expansionary impact measure real economy inflation. to gauge extent impact, useful refer ecb macroeconomic projection recall condition number technical assumptions. these assumption relate evolution macroeconomic financial variables, specifically include market expectation short-term interest rate exchange rate development projection horizon. the condition assumption june 2014 projection compute base information available 14 may 2014. over past month, financial market price adjust reflect ecb decision early june. a result, expect short-term rate fall 10 basis point horizon euro depreciate since may 2.5% 1.354. if take new condition assumptions, development would move whole path inflation projection upwards ensure fast return price stability. the second channel recent ecb decision consequential credit channel, expect positively impact new target ltro facility extension acc programme.7 the third channel expectations. the announcement measure adopt begin june accompany clear communication concern future path policy. in press conference, president draghi emphasise “key ecb interest rate remain present level extend period time view current outlook 7 the additional credit claim (acc) programme extension collateral policy accept directly loan non-financial firm eligible collateral bank borrow ecb. 8 bi central bankers’ speech inflation”. he also add “if required, act swiftly monetary policy easing. the govern council unanimous commitment use also unconventional instrument within mandate become necessary address risk prolong period low inflation.” with statement, ecb leave doubt resolve avoid downward turn euro area inflation developments, development would extremely harmful. with interest rate effective low bind persistently timid growth prospects, low expect inflation rate would increase real value debt, slow deleveraging process borrowers, public private. if low inflation outlook become entrench expectation firm households, real interest rate would rise, lead consumer investor postpone expenditure plans. a vicious circle low demand low price could ensue. how would ecb react, risk protract period low inflation materialise? but exactly could ecb face protract period low inflation economic stagnation? a i already mentioned, ecb stand ready deploy additional unconventional instruments, likelihood scenario increase. the policy response would involve broad-based asset-purchase programme. the experience country programme testify effectively designed. a previously mentioned, various empirical study suggest large purchase carry u.s. u.k. instrumental decrease yield several ten basis points, spillover effect asset prices, include mortgage rate exchange rates. in turn, gdp growth inflation rate also appear significantly affected. after all, even use new instruments, central bank cannot avoid responsibility ensure price stability, long inflation continue determine monetary policy. broad-based asset-purchases would allow ecb continue pursue mandate even adverse circumstances. it however important policy also play part. an extreme adverse scenario recently appear public debate “secular stagnation”.8 this effectively situation “natural” long run growth rate economy fall significantly permanently, e.g. fall growth rate population fall technological progress, both. this scenario still possibility, illustrative broad need structural policy unleash growth potential economies. public spend redirect towards public investment infrastructure education. international trade labour mobility fostered. these best recipe ensure secular stagnation remain purely academic hypothesis. conclusion today, i focus low inflation challenges, let conclude quick reminder remain watchful financial market developments. a necessary condition ensure effectiveness intend monetary policy stance alleviate credit supply constraints. this explain new target ltros part package measure decide govern council june. 8 see e.g. krugman, p (2013) “secular stagnation, coalmines, bubbles, larry summers” http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com; krugman, p.

conduit asset back securities; special purpose vehicle highly leverage activity, serious asset liability mismatch. 7. the financial stability board (fsb), organization financial supervisory authority major economy international financial institutions, develop broad definition shadow bank include entity outside regulate bank system perform core bank function credit intermediation (that is, take money saver lend borrowers). 8. why call shadow banks? because little transparency, often unclear owe (or would owe later) whom. most liability balance sheet; also assets. a someone put it, shadow bank entity characterize lack disclosure information value 2 bi central bankers’ speech asset (or sometimes even asset were); opaque governance ownership structures; little regulatory supervisory oversight type associate traditional banks; virtually loss-absorbing capital cash redemptions; lack access formal liquidity support help prevent fire sales. 9. how come scene? why nobody bother them? that mobilize demand deposit engage payment services. maturity transformation i.e. raise fund indulge lend investment activity legitimate economic activity. since public fund call upon rescue institutions, regulated. 10. however, financial crisis 2007 08, shadow bank receive heighten attention, role precipitate crisis. the world wake rudely crisis specifically existence shadow banks. 11. demand regulate attain increase crescendo. economist paul krugman say shadow bank system core cause crisis. “as shadow bank system expand rival even surpass conventional bank importance, politician government official realize re-create kind financial vulnerability make great depression possible – respond extend regulation financial safety net cover new institutions. influential figure proclaim simple rule: anything bank does, anything rescue crisis way bank are, regulate like bank.” 12. the international monetary fund (imf) also voice spillover effect shadow bank system onto systemic risk need contained. the g-20, duly prod fsb declare shadow bank system regulated. the usa bring regulation 2010 dodd frank act. the uk go even accord central bank liquidity. shadow bank india 13. do shadow bank india? the answer yes. it yes, financial institution accept deposit extend credit like banks, call shadow banks; call non-banking finance company (nbfcs). be fact shadow banks? no, institution regulatory structure reserve bank india, right 1963 i.e. 50 full year develop west so. evolution regulation nbfcs india 14. in wake failure several bank late 1950s early 1960s india, large number ordinary depositor lose money. this lead formation deposit insurance corporation reserve bank, provide guarantee depositors. (later add credit guarantee element, become dicgc). while provide necessary safety net bank depositors, reserve bank note deposit take activity undertake non-banking companies. though systemically important banks, reserve bank initiate regulate them, potential cause pain depositors. 15. late 1996, wake failure big nbfc, reserve bank tighten regulatory structure nbfcs, rigorous registration requirements, enhance report supervision. reserve bank also decide nbfc permit raise deposit public. late nbfcs source fund heavily bank system, raise systemic risk issues. sense cause financial instability, reserve bank bring asset side prudential regulation onto nbfcs. bi central bankers’ speech 3 nbfcs india 16. the definition term “nbfc” entail wide meaning. nbfcs include finance company general public largely familiar with; term also entail wide group company engage investment business, insurance, chit fund, nidhi, merchant banking, stock broking, alternative investments, etc. principal business. today i would concentrate nbfcs regulatory purview reserve bank. 17. traditionally, india bank-dominated financial sector. even so, always nbfcs. these early time small family run business deposit acceptance lend activities. even today, sector may “small” compare bank sector total asset size around 14 percent schedule commercial bank (other rrbs). however, deny sector grow tremendously year size, form complexity, nbfcs operate conglomerate business interest spread sector like insurance, broking, mutual fund real estate. concomitant above, interconnectedness systemic importance nbfc sector also increased. 18. nbfcs financial intermediary engage activity bring save invest community together. in role perceive play complimentary role bank rather competitors, know fact majority population country yet access mainstream financial product service include bank account therefore country need institution beyond bank reach area banks’ presence may lesser. thus nbfcs especially cater urban rural poor namely nbfc-mfis asset finance company complimentary role financial inclusion agenda country. further, big nbfcs viz; infrastructure finance company engage lend exclusively infrastructure sector factor business, thereby give fillip growth development respective sector operations. thus nbfcs also carve niche business area within financial sector space also popular provide customize product like second hand vehicle financing, mostly doorstep customer. in short, nbfcs bring much need diversity financial sector thereby diversify risks, increase liquidity market thereby promote financial stability bring efficiency financial sector. 19. at time, grow size interconnectedness also raise concern financial stability. reserve bank’s endeavour context streamline nbfc regulation, address risk pose financial stability, address depositors’ customers’ interests, address regulatory arbitrage help sector grow healthy efficient manner. some regulatory measure include identify systemically important non-deposit take nbfcs asset size ₹100 crore bring strict prudential norm (crar exposure norms), issue guideline fair practice code, align guideline restructure securitization banks, permit nbfcs-nd-si issue perpetual debt instrument etc. nbfcs component financial sector 20. a broad picture role nbfcs interconnectedness financial sector gauge detail give below: general 21. the total number nbfcs march 31, 2014 12,029 deposit take nbfcs 241 non-deposit take nbfcs asset size ₹100 crore 465, non-deposit take nbfcs asset size ₹50 crore ₹100

deposit take nbfcs non-deposit take nbfcs asset size ₹100 crore above. all figure end march, 2014. role nbfcs financial inclusion 24. financial inclusion define “provision affordable financial services” leave unattended under-attended formal agency financial system. these financial service include “payments remittance facilities, savings, loan insurance services”. micro finance look upon important mean financial inclusion india. microfinance provision micro credit also service small quantity poor i.e. provide essential financial service poor affordable way. financial inclusion also aim provide poor deposit account credit also insurance remittance facility. 25. a articulate committee comprehensive financial service small business low income household (mor committee) report, financial inclusion (defined spread financial institution financial service across country) financial depth (defined percentage credit gdp various level economy) overall situation remain poor and, regional sectoral basis, uneven. bi central bankers’ speech 5 26. while reserve bank’s model financial inclusion essentially bank-led, believe non-bank entity space partner bank financial inclusion initiatives. we enable non-bank entity business correspondent bank achieve large goal financial inclusion. since september 2010, mfis bank-shgs, trusts, society section 25 company permit become bank correspondent (bcs). at time several non-bank entity part parcel great goal, e.g. nbfc-mfis form significant part mfi sector deep reach rural areas. nbfc-mfis formally figure bank lead model financial inclusion wide deep reach catalyst provide necessary handhold poor borrower gain access essential financial services. 27. while new bank envisage would definitely give fillip country’s financial inclusion initiatives, juxtapose humungous task complete financial inclusion also bring focus need explore alternative way achieve goal. the mor committee observe channels, large national banks, regional cooperative banks, non-banking financial company (nbfcs) great deal continue value add focus differentiate capability accomplish national goal financial inclusion partner others bring complementary capability bear problem. role nbfcs capital market 28. investment activity nbfc sector comprise around 16% total assets. these constitute mainly investment capital market. there specialize nbfcs exclusively engage capital market investment i.e. trade securities. these nbfcs therefore help give liquidity capital market. further, nbfcs also lend investor invest capital market. regulatory challenge regard might come form probable overheat market, could address appropriate regulatory measure include enhance disclosures. role nbfcs factor 29. factor define factor regulation act, 2011 involve acquisition receivables (by factor) thereby get entitle undivided interest receivables finance security interest receivables include credit facility provide bank ordinary course business security receivables. subsequent notification factor regulation act government, reserve bank form new category nbfcs call nbfc-factors issue direction them. nbfc-factors almost exclusively engage provide factor service. factor service perceive complimentary bank finance expect enable availability much need work capital finance small medium scale industry especially good quality receivables may position obtain enough bank finance due lack collateral credit profile. by continuous business relationship factor place, small traders, industry exporter get advantage improve cash flow liquidity business also avail ancillary service like sale ledger accounting, collection receivables, credit protection etc. factor help free resource one stop arrangement various business need enable smooth run business. 30. the reserve bank recently also take initiative moot “trade receivables credit exchange” finance micro, small medium enterprises, development stage. the exchange bring together msmes, factor corporate buyer one platform whereby msme’s bill large company accept electronically auction msmes pay promptly. the objective build suitable institutional infrastructure enable efficient 6 bi central bankers’ speech cost effective factor / reverse factor process put place, also ensure sufficient liquidity create stakeholder active secondary market same. role nbfcs vehicle finance / second hand vehicle finance 31. talk niche sector nbfcs cater to, vehicle finance especially second hand vehicle need special mention. certain nbfcs classify asset finance company gain expertise segment play significant role provide livelihood customer drivers. from reserve bank’s side, encourage productive activity nbfcs engage in, accord certain additional dispensation form enhance bank credit, high exposure norm ceiling provision ecb automatic route lease relate infrastructure. role nbfcs infrastructure finance 32. infrastructure finance company infrastructure debt fund nbfcs exclusively finance infrastructure sector. some company asset book run lakh crore rupee expert long term project financing. recognise significance, reserve bank give special dispensation form enhance bank credit, high exposure norm ceiling provision ecb automatic route on-lending infrastructure sector. the asset liability pattern however, matter concern case ifc lend long term comparatively short term liabilities. the regulatory challenge 33. so, may wonder, nbfcs perform wonderful service economy, partner financial inclusion, provide niche finance area like infrastructure, factoring, asset financing, etc. concern reserve bank have? why indicate title oration “regulatory challenges”, may ask me. let explain. 34. the need regulate financial institution arise primarily high leverage operate cause financial instability, asset liability mismatch pose serious risk investor depositors, capacity engender havoc real sector economy. 35. traditionally, regulation bank assume great importance non-banking counterparts. one reason, course, protection depositor traditionally important mandate bank supervisors. bank centre payment settlement system monetary policy transmission take place them. bank play critical role credit intermediation maturity transformation, i.e. acceptance short term liability convert long term asset viz. loan advances. along economic value, function also create potential liquidity risk. moreover, bank also operate significantly high leverage compare type organisation could amplify vulnerability. for reasons, bank subject detail rigorous regulatory framework. 36. non-banks also depositors; depositor also need assurance safety funds. non-banks also lend resource loan advances, thus carry credit intermediation maturity transformation thereby create liquidity risk. further non-banks also operate significantly high leverage ordinary commercial institution. thus, non – bank financial entity undertake bank-like functions, large risk create could potentially destabilize entire system. moreover, global financial crisis demonstrate many way shadow bi central bankers’ speech 7 bank impact global financial system, directly interconnectedness regular bank system, prompt move overhaul regulation shadow bank system. like banks, leverage maturity-transforming shadow bank system also vulnerable “runs” generate contagion, thereby amplify systemic risk. shadow bank also heighten pro-cyclicality accelerate credit supply asset price increase upswings exacerbate fall asset price downswings. these effect powerfully reveal global financial crisis form dislocation asset-backed commercial paper (abcp) markets, failure originate-to-distribute model employ structure investment vehicle (sivs) conduits, “runs” mmfs sudden reappraisal term security lend repos conducted. 37. now may say “yes, agree nbfcs need regulated. but, say challenges? don’t law enable regulate them?” 38. yes, law. and evolve time. the challenge today follows: 39. first, law relate challenge i. number company register finance companies, regulate reserve bank, ii. unincorporated body undertake financial activity remain unregulated, iii. incorporate company unincorporated entity illegally accept deposits, iv. entity camouflage deposit name thus illegally accept deposits. the law stand today inadequate deal issues. in order correct initiate action violations, need bring suitable amendment statutory provisions. reserve bank work government improvement law. 40. secondly, entities, especially unincorporated ones, spring nook corner country operate impunity unnoticed, endanger customers’ interest, need arrangement structure effective market intelligence gathering. the reserve bank restructure organisational setup, especially regional offices, gather market intelligence. 41. thirdly, empower law gather intelligence sufficient. enforcement law challenge. this primarily various agency involve regulate non-banking financial activity entities. right central government ministry like finance corporate affairs, agency like cbi fiu-ind, regulatory agency like reserve bank, sebi, registrar companies, state government agency like police others, share information coordinate cooperate bring effective, timely unify enforcement law. the reserve bank’s state level coordination committee (slcc) strengthen national level coordination committee also considered. 42. fourthly, mention earlier, world increase demand shadow bank bring tight regulations. g-20 already express mission achieve 2015. in case, bring regulation issue, already are. the challenge u differentially closely regulate nbfcs? the demand nbfc sector subject light touch regulation. a mention earlier, nbfcs bring regulatory ambit reserve bank since 1963; bring prudential regulatory framework since 1997. nevertheless, nbfc sector come pressure 2008 crisis due fund inter-linkages among nbfcs, mutual fund commercial banks. nbfcs-nd-si rely significantly short term fund source debenture (largely non - convertible short term debentures), cps, constitute around 56.8 percent total borrow nbfcs-nd-si september 30, 2008. these fund use finance asset reportedly largely mix long term assets, include hire 8 bi central bankers’ speech purchase lease assets, long term investments, investment real estate companies, loan advances. these mismatch create mainly business strategy gain high spreads. however, fall back alternative case potential liquidity constraints. the ripple effect turmoil american european market lead liquidity issue heavy redemption pressure mutual fund india, several investors, especially institutional investors, start pull investment liquid money market funds. mutual fund major subscriber cps debenture issue nbfcs, redemption pressure mf translate fund issue nbfcs, find raise fresh liability roll mature liability difficult. dry source fund along fact bank increasingly become risk averse, heighten fund problems, exacerbate liquidity tightness. the reserve bank undertake many measures, conventional well un-conventional, enhance availability liquidity nbfcs’. conclusion 43. to conclude, i may say challenge therefore nbfc sector grow prudential manner stop altogether financial innovations. the key lie place adequate risk management system procedure enter risky areas. a regulator, constant endeavour reserve bank enable prudential growth sector, keep view multiple objective financial stability, consumer depositor protection, need player financial market, address regulatory

western cape region institute internal auditors, cape town, 6 june 2014. * * * member institute internal auditor guests, thank invitation join lunch network event, host western cape region institute

focus macro-prudential financial regulation. in regard, i take kind reform bank implementing, particularly regard regulatory role form part package response global financial crisis. lastly, i would like touch role audit profession play support achieve objective. the global financial crisis there doubt global financial crisis permanently change course global economy establish new normal. the severity 2008 financial crisis bring significant damage effect develop develop countries. although emerge market economy perform good advance economies, become engine global growth crisis, nonetheless affect trade finance channel consequence growth rates, negatively impacted. in addition, crisis start bank crisis, morph sovereign debt crisis, bring particular challenge central bank previously well-defined mandates, example:  many central bank look much closely build-up imbalance financial system;  a part focus, regulatory reform deal central banks’ role regard financial stability – macro-prudential regulation (which concern idiosyncratic risk soundness individual institution concern soundness stability entire financial system i.e. systemic soundness). rationale financial stability focus the ultimate objective economic policy create sustainable level economic growth investment, employment production. this best achieve contribution make sector economy, include financial sector, historically make substantial contribution level economic growth achieve many advance develop economies. this sector therefore important hence rest responsibility policymakers ensure continue health. in regard, government important role play create stable environment underpin legal framework bring certainty support regulatory supervisory arrangement help ensure constructive incentive financial market participants. the central bank role play task responsibility 2 bi central bankers’ speech contribute towards achievement maintenance price financial stability. instability either carry significant costs, witnessed. accord international monetary fund (imf), direct cost bank crisis past 15 year exceed 10% gdp dozen cases. the relationship monetary policy financial stability important central bank must ensure monetary policy action contribute towards financial instability. hence, central bank important role ensure possible formation asset price bubble may threaten financial stability keep check. the increase interdependence economy interconnectedness global financial system lead significant initiative aim safeguard financial stability, include development standard material strengthen global financial system. a concert effort various international body see agreement common standard principle financial regulator has, furthermore, result central bank focus closely financial stability macro-prudential analysis. what financial stability? matter relate monetary policy monetary stability come naturally central bankers. monetary stability relate directly stability price level value currency speak directly mission south african reserve bank (sarb). traditionally, main objective central bank – often enshrine constitution country – ensure price stability. for bank responsibility define “to protect value currency interest balance sustainable economic growth…”. it commonly believe central bank could achieve price stability (defined target rate target range inflation), financial stability would automatically follow. this assertion find incorrect! therefore, concept financial stability is, general, newer, controversial, le quantifiable difficult define. several attempt make come generally acceptable definition. i use definition bank canada, “…when households, business financial-service firm reliably hold transfer financial assets, without meaningful risk disturbance would undermine financial exchange fundamentally lead macroeconomic costs”. the sarb’s mandate price stability expand explicit responsibility oversee maintain stability south african financial system. while price stability mandate bank narrowly define measureable, mandate financial stability much broad share responsibility stakeholder financial public sectors. during east asian financial crisis late 1990s, however, country low inflation rate experience severe instability financial system bank failed, exchange rate depreciate financial market experience severe volatility. a result many central bank focus increasingly financial stability become implicit secondary objective. in south africa, objective mainly pursue regulation supervision banks, responsibility bank supervision department within bank. it soon become clear, however, sound profitable individual bank guarantee sound bank financial system. bank often inter-linkages might significant common exposure risk visible supervision individual banks. hence need macro-prudential surveillance, monitor “prudence” “broader” financial system identify culminate sarb create capacity purpose far back 2001. the sarb give objective contribute stability financial system south africa, follow global financial crisis. bi central bankers’ speech 3 follow publication policy document national treasury february 2011 call “a safe financial sector serve south africa better” sarb’s responsibility financial stability become explicit. this policy document eventually culminate financial sector regulation bill, state “…the south african reserve bank primary responsibility promote financial stability…”. the bill set detail give effect bank’s financial stability mandate expect promulgate 2014. it important note financial stability share responsibility stakeholder prudential market conduct regulator national treasury. careful consideration need give coordinate monetary policy financial stability objectives, time may result diversion policy choices. in south africa, cross membership bank’s monetary policy financial stability committee structure facilitate coordination. the bill also recommend single committee structure financial stability, namely financial stability oversight committee (fsoc), chair governor bank. the fsoc’s mandate continuously monitor financial system risk initiate action necessary mitigate remedy risk. the fsoc thus financial stability responsibility, way monetary policy committee (mpc) price stability, able hold account various authority economic agent action take mitigate against/reduce systemic risk. the bank’s expand mandate financial stability impact price stability mandate, which, elude above, narrowly defined, formal explicit mandate. the bank therefore still independent free influence pursue primary objective achieve maintain price stability. give expand role, require central bank evolve face increase demand great accountability. central bank need communicate matter relate financial stability, manage situation conflict arise goal monetary policy financial stability, moderate unrealistic expectation achieve financial stability policies. south africa, member group twenty (g20), commit promote financial stability contribute towards strengthen resilience global financial system. the role audit profession support financial stability there number important close linkage financial stability objective central bank audit profession. a mention earlier, one four main aspect bank’s financial stability mandate promote robustness financial system architecture. this perform process benchmarking financial architecture south africa financial stability board’s twelve standard sound financial

ensure efficient allocation capital productive resource economy. market participant need confidence system financial exchange transparent fair. the market system depend trust, regard, good corporate governance critical ensure economic financial stability breakdown governance could significantly erode business efficiency. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in testimony u congress chairman federal reserve board 2002, alan greenspan state lawyers, internal external auditors, corporate board rat agency often fail detect blow whistle breach level trust essential well-functioning financial markets. this could lead widespread misinformation shareholder potential investors. the question corporate governance check balance serve world well past break recent years. both external internal auditor key

non-executive management effective management key risks. the guidance example suggest scope internal audit include, inter alia: (i) the risk control culture organisation this include assess whether

weidmann: dinner speech dinner speech dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank, 20th dubrovnik economic conference, dubrovnik, 12 june 2014. * * * 1. introduction governor vujčić, dear boris it great pleasure wonderful picturesque mediterranean town. so thank much kind invitation give speech conference dinner. you need remind today mark begin world cup football tournament brazil. kick-off open match brazil croatia le two hours’ time. with mind, i try brief. over next month, football centre attention world. national football team promote national identity. accord german sport economist, high correlation national football team’s performance country’s reputation. the team contribute significantly “branding nations”. for now, least, nobody would even dream field european union team, even consider unbeatable. i quite sure people continue feel national rather european – least football concerned. rivalry football, however, imply european team spirit. nor suggest european project one great idea post-war times. the european idea still appeal one. and despite prophecy doom concern crisis euro area, european integration remain attractive. this demonstrated, least, accession croatia european union 1 july 2013. by become member eu, croatia also express willingness join european monetary union one day, convergence criterion fulfilled. and intention lithuania introduce common currency 2015 show join euro area still consider attractive. for time being, crisis euro area slip focus public awareness. nevertheless, early claim victory crisis euro area. even though financial market might suggest otherwise, crisis far over. in particular, sovereign bond yield spread euro-area country affect decrease significantly past two years. the fall long-term interest rate reduce countries’ borrow cost considerably. market reward adjustment progress stress countries. it clear me, however, decline sovereign bond yield spread also support central banks’ actions. the ecb’s announcement conditional unlimited purchase sovereign bond – unsurprisingly – calm investors’ fear lose money. you may know i favour measure. while sovereign bond purchase widely use monetary policy tool, without risks. they bring monetary policy close monetary finance governments, could undermine central bank’s ability maintain mandate price stability. monetary policy may face danger drag drive fiscal policy, find difficult free itself. the government become increasingly accustom bond purchase keep interest rate low. in sense, sovereign bond purchase may act like sweet poison governments. the rude awaken may come purchase reduce stop altogether. 2 bi central bankers’ speech one particular problem sovereign bond purchase monetary union redistribute risk among taxpayer different countries. any decisions, however, take democratically elect government parliaments. the rally market also sustain exceptionally easy monetary policy condition world over. nevertheless, risk market valuation may run ahead adjustment processes. the current long-term yield european government bond already appear factor require adjustment large extent. this, however, create setback potential. it therefore important policymakers ensure necessary economic progress actually achieved. their determination implement reform pivotal. in case, low interest rate run risk create incentive postpone necessary reforms. thus, current environment necessitate even strong political will. there question quick fix eliminate cause crisis. consider risk potential build many years, obvious also take time reduce it. 2. how make emu resilient the question is: how best go make emu resilient? a start point analysis crisis, helpful recall institutional set-up european monetary union. when emu established, monetary policy centralise fiscal economic policy remain national hands. this set-up create vulnerabilities. it give rise deficit bias, allow cost fiscal imprudence partially shift countries. if fiscal situation one country unsustainable, imply repercussion monetary union whole. moreover, abandon national currency favour single currency two major implications. first, member state cannot regain lose price competitiveness depreciate currency trade partners’ currency internal devaluation substitute much painful. and second, member state issue debt currency making. fiscal discipline therefore essence even important country national currency. this apply even great extent, explicit fiscal transfer among governments. however, although fiscal transfer deliberately rule out, central banks’ balance sheet serve conduit shift risk among national taxpayers. this undermine countries’ individual fiscal responsibility central banks’ independence. the found father euro clearly foresee risk unsustainable public finance stability-oriented monetary policy. therefore, precaution term fiscal rule put place safeguard sound public finances. they take form bail-out clause, stability growth pact prohibition monetary finance government deficit reason i mentioned. a turn out, however, precaution sufficient prevent crisis. the introduction euro associate disappearance exchange rate risk lead strong capital flow country previously high interest rates. unfortunately, capital inflow always put productive use; bank capital market fail many case allocate money efficiently. instead finance productive investment, shift money boom real estate sectors, example. and government member state miss opportunity bi central bankers’ speech 3 low interest rate consolidate public finances. instead enjoy relax budget restriction. capital inflow also enable high wage while, time, productivity growth weak. this result rise unit labour cost undermine price competitiveness. economy become le competitive export markets, lead large persistent current account deficits. they suffer sudden halt external fund financial crisis lender rein risk appetite flee risky investment safe havens. current account deficit well budget deficit become hard finance – hard private fund substitute public funds. fiscal stabilisation measure euro area countries, eu imf well central bank operation eurosystem help stress country bridge finance gap prevent financial system euro area collapsing. however, bridge save economy immediate tough adjustment process, remedy underlie problem crisis. in order foster groundwork emu, three challenge met. the macroeconomic adjustment process continued. this adjustment process accomplish primarily deficit countries, country – include germany – face challenges, too. regard adjustment euro-area periphery countries, remarkable progress make far. current account deficit public deficit reduce significantly structural reform labour product market implemented. nevertheless, necessary adjustment complete yet. in footballing terms, i would say “the half-time whistle blown” time break. and let’s forget second half usually exhaust first, may even go extra time. actually, sign grow reform fatigue rise reluctance implement austerity measures. however, crucial stay ball. in respect i also wish look large euro-area economy significantly lose competitiveness. both france italy need implement structural reform make loss thereby act role model crisis country well eu countries. the second requirement stable monetary union resilient financial system. owe regulatory weaknesses, financial system act amplifier crisis. it become apparent financial system achilles’ heel european monetary union. without sound bank system stable monetary union. the establishment bank union include single supervisory resolution mechanism provide opportunity make financial system resilient boost investors’ confidence. at current juncture, ecb together national supervisor comprehensively assess balance sheet bank candidate direct ecb supervision. i agree jaime caruana, general manager bis, recently said, “the asset quality review great opportunity spur necessary balance sheet adjustment. this chance must missed.” the bank union close vulnerable gap face emu help strengthen financial system. however, bank union sufficient strengthen institutional architecture emu. 4 bi central bankers’ speech rather, need fundamental reform emu framework. and third challenge meet make emu resilient. let elaborate point. the implementation maastricht framework able save euro area crisis. one underlie reason insufficiency rule strongly focus fiscal policies, implementation weak. it keep mind germany france drive force behind stability growth pact reform decade ago turn pact toothless tiger. with hindsight, score goal efforts. another flaw framework restrict credibility bail-out rule. if market believe rule, would experience strong convergence sovereign bond yield saw prior crisis. when emu framework establish early 1990s, risk contagion among euro-area member state clearly underestimated. financial market significantly le develop time. the credit default swap market, example, even exist back then. that may help explain fiscal firewall deem necessary emu framework established. while rescue measure establish later, efsf esm, manage contain fallout somewhat, weaken principle individual responsibility. fiscal decision make essentially remain national, liability partially mutualised. in words, balance liability control become lopsided. this balance, however, fundamental stability monetary union. but restore fundamental balance, put monetary union solid footing? in principle, two options. the first way create genuine fiscal union; second way would confirm maastricht framework, essentially mean make principle individual responsibility work better. the first option, genuine fiscal union, would require member state surrender fiscal sovereignty favour european level. in setting, mutualisation future liability would consistent. such giant step towards fiscal union would require considerable change european treaty national constitution well. to honest, however, i see willingness national government let brussels say fiscal matters, result recent election european parliament suggest electorate support shift either. against backdrop, avenue seem blocked, least foreseeable future. this leaf u second option: make principle individual responsibility work better. in order so, stability growth pact tighten enhance early warn system macroeconomic imbalances. a fiscal compact introduce accord member state commit incorporate balance budget rule national legislation. regard effectiveness changes, i would refer english proverb “the proof pudding eating”. in words, clear yet whether new rule really bite. it crucial european commission apply stiff rule strictly consistently. unfortunately, fiscal policy rule become highly complex and, turn, scope interpretation grown. the assessment procedure give commission great discretionary leeway. bi central bankers’ speech 5 however, france example allowed, third time, postpone correction excessive deficit, would severely undermine credibility new stability growth pact. if i may use another football metaphor, commission stick role referee try move goalpost mid-game. to make emu resilient, confirmation maastricht framework go beyond tighten fiscal rules. make principle individual responsibility workable mean make governments, bank investor feel consequence actions. hence, credible bail-out rule needed. a credible bail-out rule, however, would ultimately require orderly insolvency regime government exists. a long sovereign default impossible owe imply risk stability financial system, investor sovereign bond expect bail out. in order make state insolvency bearable, need robust financial system sufficient loss absorption capacity one closely tie government. the so-called sovereign-bank nexus huge obstacle permanently overcome crisis euro area. during crisis, many banks, notably euro-area periphery, raise exposure domestic government bonds; tie fate even closely national government. this development assist preferential regulatory treatment government bonds. it include zero risk-weighting government bond issue local currency lack exposure limits. in order strengthen bank union monetary union, i believe need end preferential treatment sovereign debt reasonable period time. sovereign bond adequately risk-weighted, exposure individual sovereign debt limited, already case private debt. 3. conclusion lady gentlemen, the french writer françois fénelon said, “the say, le people remember.” moreover, i promise brief. so let conclude. accord econometric study history world cup football tournaments, advantage home team statistically significant – surprise there. look ahead tonight’s match, bad news croatian team, since play host country world cup. it show positive relationship exist country’s population performance world cup tournaments. so statistic croatia, too. what’s more, brazil lead world cup all-time table, croatia rank 27th. brazil favourite win competition. on hand, football incalculable. you never know match go end. that’s make appealing. there plenty surprise history world cup football tournaments. i remember, example, germany beat 3–0 croatia quarter final 1998 world cup france. so reason optimistic. pope john paul ii said, “amongst unimportant subjects, football far important.” but even football basically unimportant, john paul ii claimed, nevertheless enjoyable player entertain spectator greatly. in contrast that, resolution crisis euro area offer enjoyment factor close zero entertainment value also limited. 6 bi central bankers’ speech if european policymakers succeed overcome crisis make emu resilient, would certainly trigger euphoric celebration world cup victory. nevertheless, would hail important achievement, central banker’s perspective, would benefit all. in particular, would finally allow central bank shed role decision maker last resort and, thus, return normal business. moreover, would help preserve independence central banks, key precondition maintain price stability long run. thank much attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mugur isărescu: the regional finance investment south east europe keynote address mr mugur isărescu, governor national bank romania, euromoney regional finance investment conference south east europe, bucharest, 12 june 2014. * * * prime minister, lady gentlemen, it honour invite speak front distinguish audience. i glad that, three year “off”, euromoney conference re-launching event romania. time come bucharest host important event, hold several year dubrovnik. the joy give keynote address conference big i opportunity read first issue euromoney magazine young research fellow world economy institute early ‘70s. for year one favourite magazines. back 1978, i also opportunity visit editorial office london. i could help notice choose generous theme: “the regional finance investment south east europe” set approach theme i particularly interest in, like: pro-growth strategy age austerity; policy-makers do?; government incentivise overseas investors?; region increase eu fund absorption rates? i wish fruitful discussion i look forward see answer might find address issue highlight panel conference. a focus conference economic growth development romania wide south-east europe region, allow elaborate topic. i approach subject perspective central banker. let start say sustainable economic growth romania region rely mainly economic policy consistency. the global economic financial crisis prove yet valid substitute consistent economic policies. the correction economic policy error is, everywhere always, painful and, difficult comprehend public large, absolutely necessary. the case romania highly illustrative respect. large macroeconomic imbalance steadily accumulate boom years, result sizeable foreign capital inflow credit expansion, impact augment pro-cyclical stance fiscal policy, especially last two year onset crisis. a result, romania large twin deficit start crisis, specifically sizeable structural fiscal gap (around –8% gdp 2008) current account deficit double-digit area (between 2006 2008). after crisis hit, romania choice undertake necessary adjustment order eliminate imbalance orderly manner. the effort seem already pay – year 2013 mark turnaround romania’s economic development: economic growth 3.5% drive mostly robust export industrial output supply side; small current account deficit; historically low inflation; fiscal deficit keep well 3%. and i every reason believe romania see growth year come. and that, unlike pre-crisis period, time sustainability name game, hopefully learn lesson previous mistakes. a say, one really learn mistakes… 2 bi central bankers’ speech talk sustainable economic growth, one need put thing perspective order ascertain whether economy right track. this mean short-term policy must harmonise long-term vision goals. euro adoption could serve long-term goal. and romania choose use anchor. let say word subject. in post-crisis period, non-euro area eu country central eastern europe float exchange rate regime (czech republic, hungary, poland romania), well bulgaria, shift wait-and-see approach regard euro adoption, even though, them, maastricht criterion already fulfil within reach. nobody dispute long term best interest country adopt euro, heighten degree business cycle correlation market integration. however, benefit euro adoption unconditional; therefore essential make sure nominal convergence criterion achieve sustainable basis. also important attain certain degree per caput income convergence switch euro (a large convergence gap may complicate business cycle management absence independent monetary policy). additionally, important demonstrate effectiveness new institutional setup prevent deal pending imbalance alternative policy instrument exist order take monetary policy case correction needed. this recent years’ experience substantially alter approach euro adoption. before crisis, opinion prevail meet nominal criterion enough prove eligibility euro adoption. some economist even debate excessive severity nominal criterion conflict fulfilment real convergence progress (buitter grafe, 2002; szapary, 2001; kopits, 1999; rostowski, 2002). but crisis, become obvious maastricht criterion enough ensure successful ea membership. nominal convergence criterion cannot sustainably meet unless competitiveness, financial stability solid fiscal equilibrium ensured. “the big picture”, mean macroeconomic imbalance procedure, gain grind real convergence criterion come forefront. the side story show u last couple years, euro area undergo extensive governance reforms, design address flaw reveal crisis. however, actual effectiveness still test practice. we still unchartered waters. there recent statement refer fact europe might exit crisis yet. a jean monnet use say: “europe would build crises” would “the sum solutions”. consequently, non-member state eastern south-eastern europe seem close ever comply maastricht criteria, readiness successful euro area membership need work. labour, product market structural reform still require order observe convergence letter, also spirit. non-member states, road towards euro adoption, comply maastricht criterion choose right moment it. each every member state put house order prerequisite successful euro area enlargement. only way new candidate able obtain opportunity single currency, turn valuable contributor monetary union. romania recently reach political consensus, high level, namely president prime minister, target date euro adoption january 1st, 2019. the rationale decision objective – feasible, yet ambitious – could act catalyst coherent policy action. at point time, romania fulfil three four maastricht criteria, namely sustainability fiscal position, convergence long-term interest rate exchange rate stability (although technically erm ii). meet price stability criterion bi central bankers’ speech 3 probably matter months, recent low inflation number fee 12-month average rate use reference. but, fully aware still long difficult road ahead, several year relentless effort need order ensure last fulfilment maastricht criteria, make progress catching-up process area real convergence, well push forward structural reform require enhance resilience flexibility domestic economy. closely link euro adoption approach decision participate bank union, suppose break negative feedback loop sovereign banks. euro adoption automatically imply bank union membership therefore, since changeover target date already set, join bank union merely matter timing: occur euro adoption date soon possible? in opinion, strong argument favour rapidly join bank union. first foremost, project still work progress always advisable partake inside construction mechanism eventually join anyway. secondly, bank union place, domestic financial system affect regardless whether romania member not, good say decision-making process generate effects, since latter impact u one way another. besides, bank union membership expect benefit participate country removal incentive deleveraging part foreign banks, effective supervision improve access information eliminate possibility jurisdictional arbitrage, well creation competitive market reduce distortion entry barriers. give share foreign capital romania’s bank system, make even sense support project. in light above, romania aspire part three pillar bank union. it view adhere european project strengthen financial stability, increase confidence national bank sector (through harmonisation supervisory practice deposit guarantee schemes), well foster sustainable lend economic growth (by reduce fragmentation european financial markets). i shall stop here, thank attention. i wish fruitful outcome conference, hope enjoy stay bucharest! bi central bankers’ speech 1 andreas dombret: financial regulation global challenge remark dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, reception say goodbye mr jakob orthacker, financial attaché, welcome successor, m julia becker, london, 11 june 2014. * * * lady gentleman thank you, ambassador ammon, host event german embassy london. i happy opportunity officially thank bundesbank’s depart representative, mr jakob orthacker, welcome successor, m julia becker. i particularly happy sir jon cunliffe, deputy governor bank england, today. thank you, jon, remarks. now let say word financial regulation need international cooperation. my argument begin idea global financial system require global regulation. to push idea further, i would define term “global” least three dimension argue regulation consistent them. first, regulation need consistent across jurisdictions. this necessary provide level play field reduce scope regulatory arbitrage. against backdrop, recent regulatory initiative country indicate “balkanisation” regulatory space represent genuine risk. we aware that. second, regulation need consistent across sectors. this necessary prevent regulatory arbitrage. in practical term mean deal shadow bank system. consequently, g20 move shadow bank high agenda. third, regulation need consistent across asset classes. take regulatory treatment government bond example. i cannot see single good reason bank back government bond balance sheet capital, i see many reason – least objective break sovereign-bank nexus. financial regulation consistent along three dimension help make financial system safe place. however, safe place aggregate, financial system necessarily safe place individual banks. after all, live market economy creative destruction central element. individual bank must able fail like enterprise. this must also hold large bank often label “too big fail”. to allow fail without destabilise entire system need resolution mechanisms. and again, global dimension. bank deem big fail globally operate enterprises; resolve require great deal international cooperation. i think obvious make financial system safe place cooperate regulation, supervision, resolution banks. however, challenge face. last week, ecb govern council take far-reaching decision reaction long period low interest rates. it low key interest rate refinance operation 0.15% cut interest rate deposit facility –0.10%. at time, decide conduct series target longer-term refinance operation aim improve bank lend euro area non-financial private sector. 2 bi central bankers’ speech while decision last thursday appropriate give present economic environment, analyse effect decision start next round monetary policy easing. and let make one thing clear: monetary policy play important role fight crisis cannot solve euro area’s problems. another challenge face concern unite kingdom germany, particular. both country confront rise property price overarch question whether bubble build up. at least germany, see bubble point time. price increase focus large cities; country whole price rise moderate 4.5% last year. nevertheless, monitor in-depth analysis certainly necessary. and regard, bank england certainly lead way. although structure property market differ many respects, still lot learn other’s experience. thus, i highly value cooperation bank england bundesbank. in case, international cooperation always start personal level. this representative london come play. their task build networks, share information ideas, explain bundesbank’s position facilitate cooperation. for past three year mr orthacker fill position london. and judge distinguish crowd gather today, do excellent job. i would like thank personally name bundesbank service. i

“the chronicle great crisis – the bank greece 2008–2013” speech mr george a provopoulos, governor bank greece, publication “the chronicle great crisis – the bank greece 2008–2013”, athens, 11 june 2014. * * * the chronicle great crisis result joint effort bank greece staff. first all, i would like thank contribute write book. but far beyond preparation text, joint effort par excellence require order successfully address crisis itself. the purpose book record intense multifaceted activity bank greece year 2008 2013. this period certainly mark watershed history modern greece. in time critical characterise high risks, one question, decision policy make also critical characterise high risk. the bank greece actively involve decision making, sometimes directly time indirectly, play important role domestically internationally, member eurosystem. the chronicle purport course compete book economic history write future order recount explain great crisis greek economy. besides, event discuss recent allow objective historical inquiry. for reason, account provide limit bank’s decisions, action public interventions, reflect own, institutional, interpretation lead crisis; crucial decision make address it; bank’s contribution exit it. the bank’s role mainly two aspects: first, participation eurosystem ecb decision-making, responsibility monetary policy implementation greece; second, supervision bank system view safeguard financial stability. with specific regard second aspect – large part book focus – bank greece face enormous challenge crisis. in response, many occasion act rapidly decisively, extremely press conditions. during crisis bank also seek strengthen role advisor society, time inundate conflict information originate greece abroad, result confusion high uncertainty. through reports, speech interview try present true fact simple, easily understand manner; dispel misconceptions, inform public available option implications. the book present extensive discussion bank’s public intervention position crisis period describe action take safeguard financial stability. it provide detail information enhance bank supervision carry challenge period; cash management liquidity provision bank system; implementation resolution liquidation measure credit institutions; strategy restructure bank system. in brief speech i could cover full spectrum action crisis. nevertheless, i would like discus three topics: first, view bank greece cause crisis; second, bank’s key position regard policy orientation exit crisis; third, step take safeguard financial stability. 1. what cause crisis in address crisis, bank greece first assess root causes. of course cause crisis, come forefront particular intensity 2 bi central bankers’ speech 2008. back 2001 expect greece’s inclusion core european economy would act catalyst accelerate real convergence advance european countries. unfortunately, expectation materialise. in year followed, economic growth rely mainly consumption rather save investment, attempt change long-established structure meet strong reactions. public spend keep increasing, revenue could possibly keep pace, lead large deficit historically high level public debt, despite unprecedented low interest rates. the political system hesitate take decisive reform initiatives. the country enjoy benefit single currency, fail show respect obligation arise participation monetary union. the distortion growth model country follow repeatedly highlight bank greece. it warn however heeded. the country continue carefree path, borrow accumulate debt order consume increasingly good service produce. with onset global financial crisis international environment drastically deteriorated, country large structural imbalance hit severely. a early late 2008, bank warn crisis, hit greece well, would deep structural nature, add overcome crisis would require long, methodical painstaking effort, give imbalance structural rigidity accumulate several year urgently addressed. by late 2008, become evident implementation multiannual programme need order reduce fiscal deficit, control debt dynamic carry extensive structural reform would boost economy’s weak competitiveness. however, policy adopt timid, even though market start move towards overall reassessment credit risk preclude greek default, therefore impose new, onerous lend conditions. by early 2010 long possible cover deficit finance markets. in greece, international financial crisis evolve sovereign debt crisis. in april 2010 greek government submit euro area country imf request financial support, may first memorandum economic financial policy signed. this trigger process sharp economic adjustment order avoid default lay groundwork rebalancing economy. this process, currently advance stage, linear painless. for one, clear outset country could indeed achieve orderly adjustment. this exit euro area often present loom unavoidable. moreover, conduct economic policy period subject critical swing consistent implementation adjustment programme hesitation due political cost considerations. in climate, significant modification make original agreement partners, order make implementation delay error initial forecasts. fortunately, collapse exit euro area prevented, thank society’s choice favour country’s future within euro area, assistance provide partners, effort successive governments. thus, today look forward future great confidence, expect economy recover and, certain conditions, enter new, virtuous circle. the economic social cost adjustment remain heavy. the citizens’ sacrifice painful. however, loss term output, employment income price pay prevent collapse economy. have collapse averted, loss would much greater. an exit euro area, i put interview, would open gate hell. bi central bankers’ speech 3 2. policy orientation overcome crisis against today’s favourable background country, recovery appear ante portas. the year 2014 mark halt deep protract recession. of course, economy’s adjustment completed. but first, difficult cycle seem come positive end, would helpful evaluate action omission and, importantly, draw lesson future. the bank’s position concern exit crisis express base number policy orientations, reflect publication describe detail chronicle. these policy orientation summarise follows:  first, greece make every effort remain euro area steer clear default, would incalculable economic social consequences.  second, adjustment programme agreement partner ensure finance greek economy. without them, default would inevitable. this must implement consistently. moreover, large extent programme’s term relate change implement long ago.  third, order return growth, secure european perspective, country eliminate fiscal imbalances, improve competitiveness enhance export orientation economy, modernise state, restore competitive condition market reduce burden public debt. greece also need new, outward-oriented growth model.  fourth, fiscal adjustment rely primarily rationalisation expenditure. revenue must increase reduce tax evasion broaden tax base make possible necessary low tax rate tax burden future.  fifth, historical challenge country face necessitate great possible alignment political social forces, understand national level wide possible convergence views.  finally, adjustment programme necessary sufficient condition exit crisis. a radical reorientation economy towards new model require comprehensive national plan growth, far-reaching goal implement consistently. adhere policy orientations, bank greece perform institutional functions, inform citizen advise government. 3. safeguard financial stability in addition, however, advisory role economic policy making, bank greece also decisive power responsibility shape strategy bank sector, constantly gear safeguard financial stability. although crisis greece start public sector, contagion bank system inevitable. the bank system hit successive downgrade greek government’s credit rat lead correspond downgrade banks’ credit ratings. this fact, one hand decrease value collateral available bank borrow eurosystem, hand make access interbank market particularly hard expensive, gradually lead exclusion. with debt restructure 2012 value bond hold greek credit institution severely impaired. thus capital position erode even turn negative. at time, recession lead continuous increase non-performing loans, surround uncertainty encourage deposit withdrawals. 4 bi central bankers’ speech to safeguard financial stability, bank greece intervene take several target steps. i shall briefly refer important among them. first, bank greece ensure uninterrupted supply liquidity bank system, include emergency assistance extent required. the provision emergency liquidity assistance review every two week ecb govern council could put stop variety reason (lack collateral, low capital adequacy ratio banks, incomplete implementation programme, etc.). we therefore thoroughly prepare position persistently intervene prevent negative developments. second, avoid shake confidence depositor constantly supply bank network banknotes, prevent cash shortage bank branch atms. in chapter 8 book release first time data increase demand cash bank’s cash management crisis, i believe find interesting. third, map strategy recapitalisation, restoration soundness restructure bank system. the point departure strategy first diagnostic assessment greek bank conduct help blackrock 2011, viability study follow 2012. the bank greece engage foreign agency assist efforts, primary objective consolidate international confidence objectivity impartiality assessment banks’ capital needs. the four credit institution assess viable recapitalised combination private public funds. non-sustainable bank fail raise private fund resolve without depositor suffer slight loss. overall, twelve bank resolutions, carry accord provision new legal framework establish 2011, formulation bank greece crucially contributed. the restructure bank system continue absorption subsidiary and/or branch foreign bank large greek banks. this way, reach 2014 four large banks, plus small ones, instead approximately 20 bank exist onset crisis. in 2013 ask blackrock conduct new diagnostic assessment. base result new exercise, bank greece update banks’ capital needs. the credibility exercise markets’ confidence evidence successful capital increase recently carry four core bank span two months, attract interest foreign investors. in fact two core bank manage cover capital needs, assess stress test, also raise fund need repurchase preference shares. the contribution bank greece field safeguard financial stability restructure bank sector course judge results. thank action take bank support provide eurosystem critically important decisions, bank continue operate smoothly, even period widespread uncertainty. this prevent open bank crisis – would also direct impact country’s future within (or outside) euro area. at time, bank system, despite heavy loss suffered, manage effectively deal problem restructure solid foundation guidance provide bank greece supervisory authority. to sum up, the chronicle great crisis tell story country’s effort – time successful, time – setbacks, risks, achievement delay mark turbulent eventful time 2008 2013. it hope narrative use historian future focus period. bi central bankers’ speech 5 i would like close recall last year bank greece cope historically unprecedented condition require swift decision-making difficult delicate handling. the bank respond heavy challenge outstretching capacities, thank hard work, ethos dedication staff. it therefore – member family bank greece, successfully shoulder heavy load – i would like say big “thank you” dedicate book. bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: rethink economics crisis introductory remark mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, panel discussion third conference ecb macro-prudential research network, frankfurt main, 24 june 2014. * * * i wish thank jean-édouard colliard sebastian schmidt contribution remarks. i solely responsible opinion contain herein. lady gentlemen, in short run central bank need quick answer specific questions, whether obtain depend largely research progress make long before. to use metaphor, central bank sometimes ask fix system, must prepare toolbox year advance. in short remark i discus why, view, economics sometimes fail give u necessary tool address policy challenge recent crisis, underline paradigmatic changes, rather extension already exists, would welcome order build strong link economic policy economic thinking. in end, i believe overcome different perspective work together. economic think central banks: friction policy-makers academic live different world face different constraints. while idea bear academia instrumental establish key tenet modern monetary policy, sometimes prove le useful deal challenge face crisis. to (mis-)quote john maynard keynes, difficult central banker distil “their frenzy academic scribbler year back”. let start remark mention friction try overcome economic research even impact policy: different temporality robert solow famously observe 1967 economist “determined little thinkers”. they progress step step study small problems, gradually get close answer big questions. this temporality well adapt academia search truth long-run objective. policy-makers however luxury long time horizon, would get much help big think academia. unfortunately, different temporality impact economic thinking. the typical methodology economic theory first consider frictionless benchmark, correspond instance long-run steady state equilibrium, enrich frictions. while understandable methodological point view, approach easily imply neglect short medium-term dynamics, drastic adjustment complexity important central banks. another unfortunate outcome typical economics curriculum tend emphasise frictionless benchmark realistic variants. shift academic focus world friction would welcome impact teaching, allow central bank hire pool young economist good equip method tool address policy challenges. different objective the world policy-makers one enough reject null hypothesis, actual decision need taken, often basis partial information. 2 bi central bankers’ speech economics use input form discipline educate judgements. while task make best possible use economic knowledge, deep collaboration could achieve constraint internalise academics. academic research develop accord internal logic research questions, may always overlap social priorities. the choice question address sometimes depend intellectual appeal policy relevance. the publication “game” even generate short-term herd fads. the validation economic model typically backward-looking exercise: model able replicate past observations? in world policy-makers, one think seriously happen data-generating process changes. forecast change also important, policy action often impact lag. issue like robustness, non-linearities parameter instability key concern central bank take seriously academic research relatively recently. the recent crisis course perfect example situation robustness would necessary. in crisis condition many standard result long apply, establish asset price relationship break down, transmission mechanism monetary policy become problematic. let mention element view become particularly important, relate economic thinking. answer new policy question – example insufficient data crisis time new question asked, policy-makers “open hood car” understand mechanism would normally look into, assume well functioning. this typically require data granular need normal times. while steer macro policy normal time typically require little monitor aggregate price quantities, act crisis require draw map complex network interdependencies, make available simulation. without data prepare advance, policy-makers bind rely anecdotal evidence provide actor potentially benefit measures. the development study base target2 data intraday payments, i see positive by-product mar network, typical this. financial instability macroeconomy we address urgent question still rather new field financial stability macro-prudential supervision. central bank rely development new conceptual frameworks, model tool allow u ass effectiveness transmission channel alternative policy instrument (such loan-to-value ratios, bank capital requirements, leverage caps, liquidity ratio etc.) well interaction broad economy. this requires, instance, integrate widespread financial instability aggregate models, account fundamental role bank defaults, design bankruptcy rules, fire sale elevate discontinuity typical financial (in)stability. macro stress-tests, instance, require integrate complex second-round effect bank deleveraging shock. in so, aware potential contagion risk across eu country feedback effect amplify financial instability. policy-making real time also rely diversity forecast tool successful early warn indicator allow u ass current level systemic instability. the mar team work hard development evaluation tool well utilisation data source use tasks. bi central bankers’ speech 3 this approach go beyond understand macro-prudential policy better. another important example analyse impact unconventional monetary policies. in regard, experience central bank around world various non-standard measure offer unique opportunity improve understand effectiveness alternative tools. structural changes? we also face important question ongoing change structural feature underlie economies. to start topical example, witness persistent decline equilibrium real interest rates. our understand development still limited. of course, shortage opinions, commentators, start lawrence summers, even proclaim emergence “new normal” refer alvin hansen’s 1939 concept “secular stagnation” interest rate stay permanently low level economic activity remain subdued. there many examples. for instance, imperfect understand current slope phillips curve trend productivity one reason ecb reluctant complement forward guidance numerical triggers. i share pessimism i think great importance understand extent development drive long-term forces, demographic change low potential growth, extent drive medium-term forces, change risk aversion perception macroeconomic risk wake recent crisis. friction rationality institutional detail frictions, side market participant regulatory institutions, impact difficult detect normal periods. interbank markets, instance, use see academic somewhat dull topic crisis, little know functioning. both europe unite states, centre recent policy debates, generate welcome crop new research, mar contributing. the dominant “rational expectations” model paradigm economic research postulate strong assumption human decision-making, implying, instance, economic agent always able assign sensible probability alternative outcomes. clearly, characterisation human decision-making stand stark contrast recent experience. we need understand panic bubble emerge psychological biases. the nobel prize co-awarded robert shiller last year certainly encourage research direction. while much progress make study notion knightian uncertainty, sentiment, confidence sunspots, work probably need part standard model toolbox. a challenge course come test robust behavioural theories. another important departure rationality key practical concern simple behavioural rule adopt market participant normal time lead entirely different outcome even market meltdown crisis periods. agent-based model promise way look problems, need develop close cooperation practitioner policy-makers take proper behavioural rule inputs. on issues, policy-makers need work integrate approach rich framework impact policy tool analysed. a lot progress course already make many topics, small part due mar efforts. the crisis act wake-up call spur lot interest research along line i briefly sketched. but lot work still ahead. even crisis many paper discuss many mechanism play role, form consistent body knowledge could use outside academia. 4 bi central bankers’ speech let conclude think new paradigm would like see emerging. make economics relevant policy. towards new paradigms? from policy perspective i think clear need realistic friction toolbox. many friction i mention study already, key requirement policy perspective study independently, often done, integrate general framework. we need able think behavioural issues, financial friction macroeconomics inside common set-up. central bank also need economist train think along different dimension able tackle substantial degree complexity pose problems, part curriculum. in line policy-makers’ concern robustness, essential several paradigm approach develop parallel. the recent economic crisis also large part crisis economic thinking, paralyse policy institution need act. with pluralistic approach, likely new conceptual tool find standard one helpful. of course balance must find plurality, bring robustness, proliferation, i.e. many approaches, would prevent comparability. the nature crisis invariably mean understudy unravels. it surprise period “great moderation” generate lot study crises. one way anticipate potential problem important topic would least understand crisis past, work economic historians. at minimum, let u hope lot economist continue work late crisis over, instead go back “business usual”. because friction i mention beginning, may necessary central bank stimulate research topic approach relevant them. the mar network successful promote new approach tool need, particular build aggregate framework incorporate financial instability. we would find desirable approach take root academic circles, permeate development new paradigm, influence research teaching. in words, invite researchers, academia policy institution outside escb, follow progress already make establish close link current policy challenge economic thinking. i thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 fabio panetta: on special role macroprudential policy euro area remark mr fabio panetta, deputy governor bank italy, netherlands bank (de nederlandsche bank), amsterdam, 10 june 2014. * * * introduction i would like thank klaas knot de nederlandsche bank (dnb) invite seminar. it pleasure here, carry discussion challenge associate implementation macroprudential policy (map). policy-makers around world engage recent year wide-ranging debate potential role new, yet broadly untested, map regime connection two regime share similar feature much long history, namely microprudential policy (mip) monetary policy (mp). the fact map soon operational many advance economy diminish importance continue debate, especially euro area, many way natural laboratory study challenge pose map. first, euro-area economy rely heavily bank credit finance real economy. second, bank market become increasingly concentrate recent years, might become future consequence market pressure bank union. third, euro area subject single mp regime, stance cannot take account heterogeneity among member state transmission mechanism weaken financial fragmentation. finally, major change take place institutional side mip map, increase centralisation function within ecb, also notable retention responsibility national level. i argue state affair two main implications. the first one map likely particularly important powerful euro area. the second one interaction mip mp raise issue – opportunity well difficulty – specific euro area many way delicate face policy-makers elsewhere. in particular, open dialogue micro macroprudential regulator absolutely essential respect, especially today: handle interplay map mip set precedent shape public expectation two policy work future, opacity doing, it, could extremely damaging. in follow paragraph i first recall three key factor make euro area’s case special: high reliance bank (section 2); heterogeneity fragmentation (section 3); concentration bank system (section 4). i comment “what next” (section 5) discus practical challenge surround implementation map (section 6). the thread run arguments, i come back conclude remarks, map certainly play prominent role euro area, structurally today’s situation, special care must take operationalising exploit synergy mip mp. 1. high reliance bank one key common denominator euro-area economy rely heavily bank finance. financial market non-bank intermediary le develop u uk, typically fully compensate shift supply bank credit. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the map toolbox generally think operate mainly bank sector; certainly case instrument begin explore follow introduction basel iii crd-iv-crr regulation.1 hence, regime could powerful important market-based economies. if variation map capital buff broadly similar impact supply bank credit u ea, i would expect impact total credit strong ea, non-bank credit small relatively le elastic. the linkage capital buff aggregate credit gap also likely strong bank-centric economies. other thing equal, tend make risk potential gain use countercyclical capital (or liquidity) buff great ea elsewhere. the structure financial system endogenous (it react change regulation), map policy focus bank may ultimately affect market shadow bank sector.2 in medium term, however, structure financial market ea arguably take given, high reliance bank imply powerful transmission map. 2. heterogeneity fragmentation the second distinctive factor euro area heterogeneity among member states. the business cycle national economy synchronous; real financial market completely integrated, despite significant progress since 1999. the fragmentation european financial market structural dimension: many european bank operate mostly retail markets, nature local markets. furthermore, cross-border bank penetration always relatively low europe.3 this place severe strain mp transmission mechanism. with macroeconomic outlook (in general) differ widely among member countries, monetary transmission mechanism (as today) work strongly asymmetric fashion – least effective precisely needed, namely periphery – value introduce policy tool national focus considerable. in environment, country-specific map regime use enhance financial stability also prevent financial possibly real imbalance stem “one size doesn’t fit any” problem may time associate mp. this point intuitive, also formalised, show map rule reduce macroeconomic volatility improve aggregate welfare.4 we plenty evidence, crisis, discrepancy real financial cycle among euro-area countries. a example, let u consider bank lend firm household last decade (figure 1). germany, france, italy spain start 2000 ratio corporate loan gdp relatively narrow range 35 45 per cent (panel a). over follow ten years, however, ratio decline germany, remain constant france, increase italy, literally balloon spain. this diversity also appear household credit (panel b) house price (panel c). 1 countercyclical capital buff risk weight obvious example bank-focused map instruments. on market side, one could think instead restriction specific transaction (e.g. short selling). 2 panetta (2013b). 3 from 2007 on, foreign bank account 9% average total number active bank france, germany, italy, spain hold 6.5% total bank assets. by contrast, unite kingdom foreign bank account 57% total headcount hold 14% total bank assets. for us, figure 28% 23% (claessens van horen, 2013). banks’ foreign credit claim euro-area country decline significantly consequence financial crisis (see bologna caccavaio, 2014). 4 angelini, neri panetta (2014) examine gain coordinate mp map close economy. brzoza-brzezina et al. (2013) extend analysis case two country face asymmetric shock subject mp, find country-specific ltvs capital buff significant stabilise effects. bi central bankers’ speech 3 evidence suggest set country- and/or sector-specific map measure could use run-up crisis limit emergence imbalances. in fact, crisis emphasise policy-makers concern whole distribution future economic outcomes.5 some argue mp could take active stance case inflation target financial imbalance generate large upside downside risk around expect path.6 in case clear that, deal situation kind illustrated, target map tool powerful complement – possibly alternative – “lean wind” mp stance. to extent credit booms, excessive concentration exposure within specific sector specific countries, stem externality among banks, map clearly potential usefully complement pure mip regime.7 many commentator indeed point strategic complementarity – specific form externality pay-offs associate bank’s decision positively affect number bank behave way – one key driver behind financial exuberance early 2000s.8 give focus solvency individual institutions, mip historically, probably could general, respond type behaviour. instead, map could discouraged, instance, excessive mortgage lend high ltvs real-estate loans, disproportionate reliance wholesale fund nsfr-type instrument.9 crucially, would operate across board, regardless whether bank appear individually resilient not. 3. concentration the bank system euro area relatively high, rising, level concentration.10 in medium term impetus direction could stem market pressure bank union. so far debate macroprudential policy ignore question structure bank system might affect map regime. yet least three reason structure – particular high concentration – matter. first, literature bank lend channel11 bank capital channel12 suggest large bank highly liquid diversify asset le sensitive mp impulse (they adjust credit supply gradually change mp stance). a high level concentration, credit market dominate large players, would thus make hard mp affect bank credit cycles: credit multiplier associate monetary 5 visco (2009). 6 a stein (2014) notes, activist approach justify even monetary authority explicit financial stability objective. the point tackle underlie financial imbalance reduce variance inflation unemployment around target values. 7 brunnermeier et al. (2009). 8 acharya yorulmazer (2013), build rajan (1994), strategic complementarity cause herd banks’ investment strategies: bank choose take correlate exposure because, do, negative shock likely cause systemic crisis institution-specific (e.g. reputational) loss negligible public bail-outs likely. one could think similar complementarity liability side balance sheet. 9 see catte, pagano visco (2010) role map us, i.e. whether adopt would prevent bubble; see also neri (2012). 10 between 2005 2011, market share three large bank european union increase roughly 46% 60%; us, go 20% 30%, japan remain stable 40% (bijlsma zwart, 2013). 11 kashyap stein (2000). 12 van den heuvel (2001); gambacorta mistrulli (2004). 4 bi central bankers’ speech policy low, attempt control credit aggregate mp intervention would require large swing interest rates, turn could cause significant distortion relative price outside financial sector. while effectiveness map tool still largely untested, euro-area-wide map framework might well fill important gap respect. indeed, big, liquid, diversify bank may respond map impulses, know right onset crisis capital ratio large bank close regulatory minima. if regularity confirm future despite regulatory changes, could conclude large banks, thin capital buffers, likely sensitive countercyclical capital buff (ccb) tightening. a second, relate point interaction mp map ought weak thus le problematic market concentrated. one important find literature interaction mp map significant overlap them.13 however, insofar concentration weaken financial stability spillover mp make banks’ lend decision le dependent monetary policy stance, also widen scope independent macroprudential decision-making.14 this would good news euro area, policy framework place national map authority good position internalise conflict map mp. finally, concentration industry also important determinant extent overlaps, hence potential tensions, map mip. to see concentration matter context, think two polar cases. in one-bank economy, overlap mip map perfect, coordination crucial. if coordination, recession mip authority raise requirement, map authority reduce own, end neutralise one another. in economy many (n) small banks, hand, overlap must le significant. a long banks’ level capitalisation differ, map authority low requirement bank mip authority pursue objective prevent idiosyncratic bank failure raise capital requirement k bank identify fragile. in net terms, capital requirement effectively reduce n-k banks. this mean map dilute mip, dilution target bank need high ratio relation risk. furthermore, combine intervention stimulate reallocation credit fragile sound banks, course desirable outcome.15 mip map clearly complementary operational standpoint. the synergy work two ways: map analysis inform help focus activity micro supervisors; time, micro supervisor key role play implement macro policy interventions, largely base use micro tool pursue macro objectives.16 however, two policy different aims, example suggest tension may severe concentrate bank systems. compare systems, ea economy many way close polar one-bank case. this mean crucial work explicit rank policy objectives. a consequence, clearly define process regulate interaction mip map authority particularly important ea. to mind clear 13 angelini, nicoletti-altimari visco (2013); angelini, neri, panetta (2014); collard et al. (2013). 14 of course, channel mp affect financial stability, via risk take (e.g. borio zhu, 2012). 15 heterogeneity among bank crucial argument: n small bank hold identical portfolio capital buffers, tension map mip arise exactly one-bank world. this another argument prevent sort herd behaviour mention section 3, incentivising instead diversification business model investment strategy banks. 16 bank england (2011). bi central bankers’ speech 5 overarch map objective reduce systemic risk logically precede mip objective prevent idiosyncratic bank failures, three complementary reasons. first, individual bank deem sound significant systemic risk loom large: learn 2008–9, even liquid well-capitalised bank quickly corner fund market seize asset price plummet owe fire sales. second, idiosyncratic bank failure matter concern almost exclusively systemic spillovers: bank’s failure may may constitute serious problem, depend whether counterparties withstand demise. third, experience show big, well-diversified bank largely shelter idiosyncratic shock become insolvent systemic shock. on premises, view mip work fine-tune regulatory requirement individual institution subject provision adequate aggregate financial stability map. the governance structure set euro area might strike external observer overcomplicated. yet design conceptually appealing, put u good position insure coordination mip map european national level. what crucial ecb retain mip responsibility (through single supervisory mechanism) and, coordination european systemic risk board, direct map power adjust policy stance individual national authority (through crr/crd iv). the govern council thus able internalise tension mip map establish well-defined hierarchy them. 4. caveats: get map work there are, course, risk uncertainty attach implementation map euro area. a first challenge – one clearly confine euro area – financial cycles, like economic phenomena, notoriously difficult identify ex ante. assess real time cause behind divergence among country markets, establish extent reflect fundamentals, easy. one guard temptation look handful indicator isolation. map ideally ground analysis broad set risk indicator rely join up, holistic view relate economic fundamentals, domestically abroad. structural economic model certainly help, plainly rich enough capture dimension problem. hence, map policy-making largely judgmental, remain time come. to operationalise map also crucial identify far bank (that is, leverage financial intermediaries) involve hypothetical build-up risks. the amount systemic risk generate bubble depend number factors, include finance whether fund come form equity debt. typically, direct participation bank bubbly market turn local problem systemic event.17 real-estate market interest example problem, allow return briefly credit house price data i use earlier. preliminary statistical evidence suggest several eu country bank lend predict house price (table 1). this consistent credit important determinant demand housing. an inverse causation, high price drive real-estate finance banks, potentially problematic may signal asset price distort banks’ choices: price might grow exogenous possibly non-fundamental reason (a “bubble” wave optimism), bank might pile reap capital gain house stock. in case probability sharp correction price higher. such correction also likely translate bank crisis unless macroprudential measure appropriately tighten 17 aoke nikolov (2012); reinhart rogoff (2008). 6 bi central bankers’ speech beforehand. interestingly, country house price predict credit among list table 1 spain.18 even diagnosis reasonably clear (as apparently case spanish mortgage market early 2000s), political economy may get way map: practice, difficult “take punch bowl away”. furthermore, risk national authority may design manage national map regime way which, although rational domestic perspective, could undesired consequences. for example, national authority may relax constraint lend order stimulate expansion domestic bank sector, potential adverse spillover financial stability markets. the control esrb ssm level mitigate risk negative spillovers, risk subtle hard address. when face increase specific sectoral risk, relate instance real-estate loans, national map authority could force bank hold capital a) raise overall capital requirement, b) create ad hoc buff real-estate exposure (although presently allow crd-iv/crr), c) increase risk weights. these seemingly identical measure actually differ important ways. one degree regulator wish transparent concern are: nature vulnerability may fully disclose case a). another impact market perceptions: compare foreign peers, domestic bank would look relatively good capitalise case a) b), would perceive relatively undercapitalised c). the euro-area configuration, ecb-ssm position top national measures, go direction assuage political economy concern kind. the punch bowl may take away someone host, namely supranational authority. furthermore, fact individual initiative must pas collective examination esrb and/or govern council limit scope strategic choice individual countries. map certainly go “an adventure job”, entail lot adaptation learn doing. here practice must necessarily come theory. but since map play crucial role resolve current economic difficulties, euro area sound institutional framework place handle it, practice begin earnest, sooner rather later. 5. what could map today, how? these reflection suggest map could make considerable difference euro area. it likely powerful instrument; reintroduce degree flexibility could compensate lack national monetary policy frameworks; relieve monetary policy burden. the question relate structural discourse current impasse. a know, euro area good shape: inflation low, growth weak, mp stretch affect financial segmentation, banks’ balance sheet still strained, credit scarce. credit growth weak across area, although underlie cause might differ across countries, need stimulate credit supply accordingly rank high policy-makers’ agenda.19 thus, dilemma face map today improve finance condition without undermine banks’ resilience. 18 an alternative explanation predictive relation rise house price relax households’ borrow constraints, allow take debt. the two hypothesis cannot disentangle look plain correlations. mile pillonca (2008) suggest expectation capital gain play significant role drive house credit spain, sweden, belgium uk crisis. 19 draghi (2014) clarify ultimate objective comprehensive assessment address capital constraint credit supply. bi central bankers’ speech 7 how dilemma resolved? the set recent policy initiative take discuss within esrb suggest decision-makers reach consensus. in netherlands central bank announce introduction systemic risk buff bank start january 2016, similar initiative take belgium, croatia estonia.20 the core consensus thus appear (a) key map instrument circumstance bank capital ratio (b) conservative policy stance call for. in short, need “more bank capital”. this consensus emerge without explicit debate underlie policy trade-offs, implicitly reduce broad question “what map do” narrow debate “whether capital requirement go down”. this state affair dangerous potentially harmful, regardless one’s conclusion pro con raise capital requirements. this three reasons. first, pay enough attention relation map mip. i argue early (i) interplay two delicate, (ii) coordination important, particularly euro area, (iii) map take priority mip objective appear clash. from point view, conduct seem example run map. interaction coordination indeed largely absent policy discussion. for example, give great heterogeneity banks’ conditions, one could ask whether resilience could improve set selective mip intervention weak institutions, rather non-discriminatory increase map capital requirements. this option, however, discussed. we gloss issue coordination map mip. the absence discussion bad per se, also carry subtle equally negative implication: observe alignment map mip authority (both push bank hold capital) could interpret sign simply place mip objective map. a i remark above, i consider approach deeply problematic. the second pitfall seem accept bank capital ratio practically weapon map toolbox. a behavioural economist would view focus capital example ambiguity aversion. that is, might act mainly capital ratio reason stock market investor over-buy domestic stock – simply know better.21 like home bias investment, “capital bias” obviously suboptimal: could gain great “diversification” intervention “portfolio”. furthermore, determine tight capital requirement necessary

speech the third problem consensus seem rest clear, share understand cause credit crunch. it should, ready-made, cookbook-style answer question map recession weak credit (or situation matter), policy measure mitigate crunch differ causes. we wary recipe simply suggest capital “risk high”, le capital “credit weak”, without analysis fundamental factor drive data. for example, credit crunch cause high credit risk, high capital requirement would certainly right choice. but instead depend high fund cost bank regardless individual situation (say, poor condition domestic sovereign), raise capital charge might work (well-capitalised bank also obtain fund low rates) would clearly second-best (central bank range alternative tool affect banks’ fund directly). finally, consider crunch cause problem coordination among banks. when economy concentrate bank system turn point, large lender certainly notion speed recovery depend lend strategies, might well realise lend more, soft terms, optimal strategy would stimulate growth generate high returns. even case, however, could well nobody will bear risk expand balance sheet unless everybody else likewise. the reason without coordination recovery start lender take solitary initiative pay cost run large balance sheet still recessionary environment: credit crunch could emerge suboptimal nash equilibrium. in case, map policy could facilitate coordination among lender bring crunch end make bank sector sounder.23 these story possible credible. any policy prescription base discussion believe plausible. it seem far discussion – like map-mip interaction map tool mention – largely bypassed. the current conjuncture obviously put pressure policy maker act decisively narrow room wide-ranging discussion governance general principles. the map mechanism operate condition different, probably complex, prevail future: pre-crisis period bank build sufficient macroprudential capital buffers, greatly complicate policy dilemma. after all, increase prudential capital requirement might well right policy choice give uncertain prospect economies. my main contention that, even so, cannot afford restrict strategy, stick way public may see a-critical. the decision take today set important precedent map work expect work future. accordingly, i submit transparent logic behind map initiative make sure logic consistent agree principles, least important get detail specific intervention right. the cost set bad precedent weaken credibility map, particularly countercyclical nature, hardly quantifiable, i suspect would high

bubble, exactly reason one ex ante, build-up phase: correct externality (a strategic complementarity) could otherwise bring suboptimal equilibria. bi central bankers’ speech 9 6. from theory practice speculate interaction mp, map mip abstract one thing. bridge gap theory practice, set mechanism run reasonably smoothly, another. like many central bank euro area (and beyond), bank italy micro (mip) supervisory function coexist macro (mp) function.24 this coexistence require two elements. the first one protocol regulate bottom-up flow information allow board form consistent view state affair relate risks. the second one mechanism define top-down transmission decisions, assign clear responsibility sub-structures involve implement policy intervention agree board. see financial stability-map lens, information flow within bank italy divide three phases. first, risk examine separately area relevant expertise. micro risk relate banks’ balance sheet examine supervisory directorates; risk relate money market monitor market payment system directorate; macro condition kind look economics statistic directorate. this information share debate within financial stability coordination committee. meet ordinarily hold twice year, call time committee member – head key directorate – chair – deputy governor. the third last phase involve discussion board key conclusions, include critical assessment evidence, rank risk and, necessary, list suggestion potential policy actions. a supervisory initiative launch bank italy 2012 provide example work mechanism. in case, prolong fall non-performing loan coverage ratio (a micro signal) deem potential threat market confidence, particularly recessionary scenario (a macro issue). the bank therefore launch target broad on-site review position low coverage ratio ensure account practice correct.25 in order avoid pro-cyclical effects, parallel wave inspection bank italy ask bank increase internally-generated resource cut costs, sell non-strategic assets, adopt sustainable dividend policies, revise criterion remuneration director executives. these actions, result published, improve banks’ practice standards; help reverse decline trend coverage ratios, increase transparency assuage investors’ concerns. thus, rely micro tool macro spirit. these process adapt light radical institutional change introduce national level (establishing new map authority) international level (mip map coordination burden-sharing national authority esrb, eba, ssm). often, devil detail, admittedly many detail need sort architecture work well. therefore, would sensible divide time speculation conceptual challenge pose interaction mp, map mip le excite equally crucial effort create sound effective governance structure. 7. conclusion

chairman august organization. you continue deliver great program speaker many come expect club. a many know, centennial year federal reserve. in spirit anniversary, hat go the economic club new york, around 107 years. what great storied history have, honor here. i note congress create decentralize central bank 100 year ago. that decentralize structure one great strengths, require i begin usual disclaimer view i express necessarily reflect federal reserve system colleague federal open market committee (fomc). in remark morning, i want discus benefit rule-like, systematic behavior design conduct monetary policy. such behavior, combine great transparency, lead communication effective. this, turn, help public understand fomc’s strategies, individual policy decisions, likely path policy. i go one step illustrate fomc might take step toward systematic policy framework produce detail monetary policy report, similar issue many central bank around world. one aspect report could highlight policy path imply taylor-like robust rule use benchmark set communicate policy systematic, rule-like way. i begin brief overview think economy fomc’s recent policy decision i discus role systematic policy play communication policy. the economy recent policy decision first, economy. my overall view economy fairly optimistic. after first quarter buffet winter storms, i believe poise grow rate somewhat trend 2 bi central bankers’ speech remainder year next revert back trend, i see 2.4 percent. steady employment growth healthy household balance sheet support consumption activity. the current data suggest economic strength fairly broad based, evidence recent indicator optimism express firm manufacture service sectors. a inflation, recent read move bite higher, mitigate somewhat concern low inflation persist decline further. we ample monetary accommodation economy ensure able achieve 2 percent target time. it important, however, continue reinforce commitment goal inflation expectation remain well anchor near target. at meet last week, fomc release late summary economic projection (sep). the outlook go forward largely unchanged. while real gdp growth 2014 mark down, reflect disappoint first quarter, outlook second half year projection 2015 2016 unchanged. unemployment projection reduce slightly, inflation forecast remain stable. my submission economic growth generally line colleagues. but forecast unemployment bite low near term. specifically, i think unemployment rate may reach 5.8 percent end year 5.6 percent end 2015. my view inflation stabilize 2 percent 2015. some market participant commentator focus so-called dot chart movement imply median fund rate 2014–16. i would remind everyone dot forecast policymakers think committee actually do, reflection policymakers’ view appropriate policy. some note median path steepen ever slightly. this come particular surprise likely reveal great confidence economy improving. the rebound bad winter seem progressing, outlook unemployment bite better, inflation rate appear firming. the change dot thus simply tell u something individual policymakers reaction change economic conditions. the fomc statement note committee adjust future fund rate decision base progress toward objectives. so, entirely reasonable expect path “appropriate policy” adjust close objectives. indeed, would surprise behave manner. i believe close goal – perhaps fast people might think. so, i support recent policy statement, i grow concern may adjust communication not-too-distant future. specifically, i believe forward guidance statement may passive, give underlie economic conditions. the benefit systematic monetary policy let turn importance conduct monetary policy systematic manner. by systematic policy, i mean conduct policy rule-like manner oppose rely discretion. decision always make period period, rules-based approach, decision guide rules. discretion opposite rules-based decisionmaking. discretionary decision make without constrain past promise previous forward-looking statements. the monetary policy debate whether rule-like behavior preferable pure discretion date back least henry simon 1936.1 more recently, nobel prize-winning 1 henry c. simons, “rules versus authority monetary policy”, journal political economy, 44:1 (february 1936). bi central bankers’ speech 3 work, finn kydland ed prescott demonstrate credible commitment policymakers behave systematic rule-like manner lead good outcome discretion.2 since then, numerous paper use variety model investigate benefit rule-like behavior monetary policy find indeed significant benefits. policy characterize commitment show lead economic stability. in fact, mainstream theoretical model use monetary macroeconomic analysis build notion monetary policy conduct rule-like manner. the benefit rule-like approach arise, part, consumer business forward looking. when policymakers credibly commit rule-like approach set policy, alter expectation way make policy effective le uncertain. the appropriate way make policy systematic, rule-like, base policy decision state economy. that is, policymakers describe reaction function determine current future policy rate set depend economic conditions. policymakers are, course, certain future course economy anyone else is; therefore, cannot realistically commit particular future value policy rate. nonetheless, describe reaction function rule explain policy rate determine future function economic condition highly informative. unfortunately, science monetary policy progress point specify optimal rule set monetary policy. give current state knowledge, judgment still require set policy. one reason optimal rules, is, maximize economic welfare, highly dependent particular model derived, broad-based consensus right model. another factor optimal rule one model produce bad outcome another model. a third reason optimal rule often quite complex, thus make difficult implement communicate public. in words, may transparent. however, limitation implement optimal policy rule deter u effort adopt systematic, rule-like approach conduct policy. indeed, great deal progress make identify simple, robust rule appear perform well variety model environments. the well-known rule attributable john taylor.3 the taylor rule reaction function indicate set policy rate function deviation inflation inflation target measure economic slack. the attractiveness taylor-like rule go beyond intuitive appeal fact seem describe actual behavior monetary policy reasonably well. the reality taylor-like rule yield good result variety theoretical models. while surprise some, enormous practical importance. give uncertainty true model economy, know systematic policy form taylor-like rule deliver good outcome variety model mean simple, robust rule provide useful guidance policy. moreover, rule-like policy also play important role central bank communication. 2 finn e. kydland edward c. prescott, “rules rather than discretion: the inconsistency optimal plans”, journal political economy, 85 (june 1977), pp. 473–91. 3 john b. taylor, “discretion versus policy rule practice”, carnegie-rochester conference series public policy, north-holland, 39, 1993, pp. 195–214. 4 bi central bankers’ speech communication the fundamental reason communication important monetary policy appropriately view path policy rate, simply current rate. this evident today market seem highly attentive signal regard future path fund rate simply current setting. because systematic policy easily communicate public, also greatly improve transparency predictability monetary policy, reduce policy surprises. business consumer inform course monetary policy understand policymakers likely react change economic circumstance even certain economic condition might be. equally important view great clarity policymakers’ reaction function strengthen accountability. thus, systematic policy, communicate transparently, strengthen accountability serf preserve central bank’s independence. in regard, taylor-like rule many desirable features. they systematic, base limit number variables, perform well variety models, therefore provide important guidance policy decisions. if policy guide state-contingent rules, report assessment evolution forecast key economic variables, public get good understand appreciation likely path policy. indeed, likely best information provide regard future path policy. rule benchmarks: step forward give model uncertainty data measurement problems, are, course, limitation use simple rule. a robust rule intend work well average, central bank look many variable determine policy. inevitably, time economic development fall outside scope model warrant unusual monetary policy action. event 9/11, asian financial crisis, collapse lehman brothers, 1987 stock market crash may require departure simple rule. however, unusual circumstances, policymakers expect explain departure rule. with rule baseline, departure quantify inform u excessively tight easy policy might relative normal. if event temporary, policymakers explain policy likely return normal. thus, simple rule provide valuable benchmark assess communicate appropriate stance policy. the operational question might go effort implement rules-based policy? one strategy could indicate likely behavior interest rate base taylor-like rule consistent conduct monetary policy past one consider robust across various models. do would require agreement particular model order produce result rule-based behavior. for fed, economic model develop board’s staff seem like reasonable place start. such exercise could also enhanced, i believe, use dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, dsge, model develop within federal reserve system. a start, result type exercise could publish fomc’s current biannual monetary policy report congress. perhaps might consider release report quarterly basis keep central banks. the committee could indicate whether anticipate policy somewhat restrain accommodative relative projection give various rules. the monetary policy report could also include various view may differ baseline summaries. bi central bankers’ speech 5 a major benefit exercise would illustrate various dimension uncertainty policymakers face. financial market often prefer certainty future path monetary policy, unrealistic necessarily desirable. for example, exercise would indicate extent model uncertainty, forecast uncertainty, variation imply different rules. many central bank use fan chart device highlight band uncertainty forecast, feed same. overall, exercise would provide good sense likely direction policy variable relate systematically policy. it would also lead fomc discus policy context rule systematic approach decision-making, i believe lead good decision good economic outcome long run. moreover, would require policymakers explain choose deviate benchmark guideline provide. an example a i discussed, communication important aspect monetary policy. i long advocate feed produce periodic monetary policy report similar central banks. it simply difficult convey monetary policy design strategy within confine brief statement issue conclusion fomc meeting. therefore, i suggest view isolation one part periodic report public. so, let illustrate might begin incorporate systematic transparent approach rule-like decision-making. i view one step journey, end result. my example us five simple rule discuss literature describe implication project path fund rate 2015. since rule contingent economic conditions, i use midpoint forecast derive recent sep apply okun’s law relationship convert projection unemployment projection economic slack. i immediately note completely coherent exercise participant’s projection base view optimal policy and, well aware, view differ. put differently, midpoint projection arise amalgam different model thus represent one’s forecast model. thus, result likely diverse otherwise expected. so example purely illustrative yet easily replicable. however, give relevance sep, i think exercise would interest i use off-the-shelf economic model. the rule i choose these: first, original taylor 1993 rule; second, variant taylor’s original rule, sometimes call taylor 1999 rule, place great emphasis output gap; third, version taylor 1999 rule allow considerable interest-rate smooth call inertial taylor 1999 rule; fourth, performance- outcome-based rule develop staff philadelphia feed simply estimate rule best mimic previous fomc actions; fifth, first-difference rule base academic work athanasios orphanides design take account imprecision uncertainty measurement level output gap slack underlie steady state real rate interest.4 i plot outcome exercise figure 1. so take away picture? first, rule suggest liftoff fund rate zero bind occur next quarter. this considerably sooner many seem expecting. 4 see appendix precise mathematical formulation rule relevant references. 6 bi central bankers’ speech second, also see although rule point policy tighter, present somewhat different profile future path interest rates. the taylor 93 taylor 99 rule steep path next several quarter rules. the primary reason rule play catchup would liftoff occur earlier. after catchup, increase slowly. this dispersion pace tighten also reflect model uncertainty. but ignore dismiss rule avoid problem uncertainty poses. robust rules, first-difference rule, tend good outcome average across models. third, see three policy path different other. taylor 93, taylor 99, performance base rule tend converge 2.5 3.0 percent mid-2015 remain close thereafter. my assessment appropriate policy similar describe first-difference rule. however, point decide path correct, illustrate benchmark useful communications. for example, exercise might suggest policy choice fall outside bind rule view caution. that mean would wrong would require careful substantial discussion justification. even policy choice might fall within bounds, exercise provide meaning, quantitative qualitative, phrase rate expect “lower normal”. another way highlight uncertainty surround future path policy consider different path economy. consider figure 2. here i employ first difference rule consider implication strong weak path economy. to illustrate range policy path could ensue, i use three different forecasts, midpoint forecast sep, previous chart, well two hypothetical forecasts. the first take combination low inflation high unemployment forecast (a weak forecast), second opposite combine high inflation low unemployment forecast (a strong forecast). of course, neither represent particular forecast model; combine various element different forecasts. thus, exercise represent fairly extreme construction forecast uncertainty. in event, observe wide range predict fund rate path first experiment. the weak forecast anticipate fund rate nearly 1 percent end 2015, strong forecast envision fund rate 4.7 percent part inflation unemployment “overshoot” long-run sustainable value correction must follow. note, however, even weak economic view couple first-difference rule fund rate rise zero low bind next quarter. this picture analogous, precise way, fan chart. i indicate throughout talk imprecision knowledge economy. my understand precise understand colleague private-sector economists. these two exercise highlight model forecast uncertainty policymakers face. rather try target particular future value policy rate, monetary policy report rules-based approach could convey uncertainty still assure decision drive state economy. these two exercise indicate need explain fully policy deviate suggest rules. no doubt, variety view issue, i think policy process communication policy would benefit greatly produce detail monetary policy report feature i discuss today. bi central bankers’ speech 7 8 bi

example expansion growth. this give confidence puerto rico capability economic success story. however, discussion range stakeholder confirm condition want – particular, growth expansion happen either fast enough broadly enough. at urge several business community leaders, i commission team new york feed analyze challenge face puerto rico economy put forth recommendation capitalize island’s strength restore growth. inform consultation local, national international expert stakeholder island, release report 2012.1 we present five recommendations: (1) reduce barrier labor force participation job

electricity. additionally, commonwealth’s economic development strategy seek capitalize strong pharmaceutical presence island, promote knowledge-based service and, importantly, improve general business environment island. more recently, though, serious fiscal challenge surface closely interrelate island’s ongoing weak economic performance. persistent deficit commonwealth’s fiscal account well mount deficit operation several major public corporation substantially raise island’s overall level public debt lead serious concern whether island’s fiscal position sustainable. in light fiscal

determine future trend. in ways, data puerto rico’s public debt clearly define fiscal problem island faces. but meet variety stakeholders, i visit, help inform analysis provide u concrete evidence issue play across puerto rico economy. the clear challenge go forward commonwealth government continue make progress effort raise economic growth rate time take credible step constrain buildup debt. the demand choice puerto rico make today affect long-run economic prospect future livelihood residents. now i would like review recent development puerto rico economy outline consideration discussion several step help put island path toward fiscal health. a always, i say reflect view necessarily federal open market committee (fomc) federal reserve system. economic condition puerto rico let turn economic condition puerto rico. a well aware, news good. puerto rico’s economy slump nearly decade. after decline five straight years, real (inflation-adjusted) gross national product (gnp) rise 0.9 percent fiscal year 2012 0.3 percent 2013, rate considerably respective u.s. mainland growth rates. a monthly index produce government development bank puerto rico paint similar picture economy stabilize depress level. we finally begin see sign improvement economic activity island, though little evidence suggest strong recovery seek yet take hold. puerto rico’s labor market remain weak. overall payroll employment fell 10 percent 2006 2010 level since then. employment private sector increase modestly, notable pocket relatively brisk job creation leisure hospitality, professional business service private education health service – employment sector far exceed prerecession levels. cutback government employment, however, largely offset private-sector gain realize past years. bi central bankers’ speech 3 low labor force participation rate high unemployment rate remain perhaps big challenge puerto rico economy. our early report cite low labor force participation among young le educate worker one important factor limit island’s competitiveness. since report, overall labor force participation continue decline. the unemployment rate island consistently exceed rate mainland several percentage points. although rate fall full percentage point year date, gap mainland remain wide. moreover, poor labor market opportunity many worker contribute significant increase rate out-migration puerto rico’s residents, accelerate island’s population decline. the prolong period weak economic growth compound puerto rico’s fiscal problems: puerto rico’s public sector debt upward trend decade. the stagnation economy persistent fiscal deficit underlie debt buildup. the level outstanding debt percentage island’s annual gnp, ratio use many fiscal analysts, rise 60 percent 2000 100 percent 2013. debt ratio range inhibit economic growth generally lead high finance costs, turn, lead constraint access financing. the recent downgrade puerto rico’s public debt non-investment grade clear signal current fiscal situation pose serious risk island’s economic future. step toward fiscal sustainability next, i discus buildup puerto rico’s public debt provide think way improve island’s fiscal health. to open discussion, worth note key feature puerto rico’s fiscal institutional environment. the commonwealth close relationship u.s. government which, many ways, analogous mainland state. puerto rico share common market common currency u.s. mainland lead strong economic interdependencies. federal aid major source revenue commonwealth puerto rican resident participate large u.s. social insurance program social security medicare. in addition, puerto rican debt trade municipal security u.s. capital markets, much interest earn debt exempt local, state federal income taxes, regardless u.s. investor lives. and like one state, vermont, puerto rico self-imposed requirement balance budget. in many ways, however, commonwealth operate independently jurisdiction mainland. resident puerto rico, unlike states, pay u.s. personal income tax unless employ u.s. government. the many large public corporation commonwealth’s balance sheet also distinguish many states, although state – new york example – also house number public corporation authorities. finally, notable difference mainland jurisdiction puerto rico’s balance budget requirement, find constitution relatively stringent form, appear effective constrain growth commonwealth’s debt. the debt buildup reflects, part, unique feature puerto rico’s fiscal institutions, policy practices. in particular, public sector puerto rico comprise commonwealth government also municipal government number public corporations. prominent among public corporation puerto rico electric power authority (prepa), puerto rico highway transportation authority (prhta), puerto rico aqueduct sewer authority (prasa). the public corporation especially important role play issue debt well scale public service provide island’s population. currently, account almost 40 percent island’s total debt responsible much debt buildup – roughly 43 percentage point increase debt-to-gnp ratio 2000 2013, public corporation account almost 85 percent increase. 4 bi central bankers’ speech several measure put island’s weak fiscal condition perspective. total public debt puerto rico quite high – roughly 100 percent gnp. this far high u.s. mainland state; among states, high ratio new york 29 percent.2 however, since puerto ricans pay federal income taxes, large federal debt burden could arguably consider burden puerto rico, contrast mainland states. rank state puerto rico federal debt burden add mainland states, exclude puerto rico, push puerto rico 14th rankings. however, even adjustment puerto rico still high debt burden. in addition grow stock publicly issue debt, puerto rico face large future contingent liability via unfunded pension system liabilities. while commonwealth variety option manage liabilities, nonetheless obligation relevant assess commonwealth’s overall balance sheet. it seem likely country similar debt situation puerto rico would face difficulty continue raise money bond market would face question sustainability debt level. debt sustainability generally define condition government debt reasonable level – one acceptable risk market confidence long-term economic growth – path increase indefinitely relative measure national income. stabilize puerto rico’s debt share island’s income reduce debt sustainable level key goal island’s fiscal economic policy. while precise path toward low debt burden uncertain, trend largely determine interaction three factors: government’s fiscal policy, growth rate economy interest rate public debt. regard buildup new public debt, commonwealth government state intention general fund budget balance fiscal year 2015. this intention, together stance use deficit finance support public corporations, greatly limit issuance new debt. the measure put place year already success cut project budget gap current fiscal year. but step take move island toward fiscal health? let start say puerto rico alone face fiscal problem like these. government frequently find public sector management become especially challenge economy undergo major transition sort take place puerto rico last decade. in mainland u.s., city like new york, washington philadelphia experience major fiscal stress adjust transition manufacture service-based economies. those city face market pressure unlike face commonwealth today, leadership tackle issue head-on, city emerge stronger. the problem city face require government private sector work together find solutions. in case require important change sacrifices. this effective necessary adjustment share broadly rather concentrate single group. in spirit assist commonwealth endeavor, i want preview issue appear me, suggest step improve fiscal outcome island. i present idea order solicit input, base deep understand situation. i present quick fix – quick fix fiscal situation – change financial practice next several year help restore fiscal health island. the first step would commonwealth government reinvigorate effort raise economic growth. while puerto rico number feature make potentially 2 the debt figure report u.s. mainland state refer debt hold public exclude debt hold government agencies. most puerto rico debt hold public. bi central bankers’ speech 5 strong economy, economic growth island weak almost decade. to restore growth raise live standards, critically important policymakers expand effort marshal island’s considerable strength – bilingual well-educated adult population, open economy occupy central position caribbean, wide experience host multinational corporations, close tie u.s. mainland economy. while challenge restore growth clearly complex, i want highlight key area policy support efficiency growth might strengthened. first, barrier job creation active participation labor market reduced. the current structure labor market incentive could examine ensure firm face significant hurdle create job worker discourage enter labor force. second, policymakers continue effort create dynamic business environment, include elimination unnecessary cost set operate business, particularly respect energy costs. third, economic development effort consider proactive approach utilize island’s educate workforce well-established high education system. one possibility look way expand support formation partnership high education industry, prove effective way region promote innovation, entrepreneurship economic growth. puerto rico many ingredient place harness benefit industry-education partnership policymakers begin look promise opportunity mutually beneficial collaboration. a second step comprehensively reform commonwealth’s tax system, heavily dependent income tax tend levy high rate narrow bases. when rate high, increase incentive activity shield taxes, perhaps move activity informal sector, perhaps halt activity altogether. either way, collect necessary revenue require rate even high activity remain base, reinforce problem. typically, comprehensive reform necessary break cycle simultaneously broaden tax base reduce rate across range taxes. such reform would likely produce significant bonus term fast economic growth, particularly formal sector. a third step would improve commonwealth’s financial reporting. puerto rico’s unique status mean one jurisdiction whose finance regularly survey public agency. the u.s. census bureau report annually mainland state finance international monetary fund generally report finance nations. these survey provide significant transparency finance entities, invaluable policymakers citizen wish understand, monitor exert control discipline fiscal policy governments. they may also serve purpose increase investor understand commonwealth’s finance compare governments. new york city’s experience 1970s show value good financial reporting. prior city’s fiscal crisis 1975 1977, new york relatively poor financial report practices. a part recovery crisis, condition access credit, city’s report improve dramatically since several awards. along improvements, city’s access credit market steadily improved. economic research indicate transparent budget associate low public sector fund costs. a fourth step would look way strengthen performance public corporations. a major difference puerto rico’s balance sheet state presence large, heavily indebted, corporate-like entity continue lose money increase borrowing. for financial reform agenda successful, must confront issue head on. key element successful reform strategy might include strengthen public corporations’ financial stand control future flow liabilities. 6 bi central bankers’ speech puerto rico could also seek opportunity benefit outside management expertise, include wide experience u.s. mainland states. an independent regulator utility norm throughout mainland states. by leverage expertise reputation exist independent regulatory agencies, puerto rico may improve efficiency public corporation reassure investors. a fifth step, commonwealth could benefit adopt fiscal institution like mainland states. balance budget rule far perfect, follow states’ model – split budget operate piece must balance capital piece finance debt – puerto rico could good align finance method spend priorities. a sixth step commonwealth implement framework help ensure budget target met. a key aspect framework would require authority implement multi-year budgeting, revenue expenditure plan articulate three five year horizon. such framework also incorporate review central government’s macroeconomic fiscal forecast non-partisan independent entity, view analysis could publish coordination commonwealth’s propose budget give fiscal year. new york city, instance, us type framework. the step view potential way improve puerto rico’s finance time i present consideration discussion. the decision obviously you. other countries, u.s. mainland state municipality face similar fiscal issue able overcome them. i believe island develop strategy enable return fiscal health. thank kind attention i happy take questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 vítor constâncio: the ecb macro-prudential policy – research implementation speech mr vítor constâncio, vice-president european central bank, third conference macro-prudential research network, frankfurt main, 23 june 2014. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure open third conference macro-prudential research network (mars). mar establish general council european central bank (ecb) spring 2010 objective develop core conceptual frameworks, model and/or tool would provide research support order improve macro-prudential supervision european union (eu). this significant collective undertake european system central bank (escb), i.e. eu central banks, order broaden analytical foundation area. nobody would expect launch mar ecb would soon become bank supervisor distinct macro-prudential policy competencies. now, single supervisory mechanism (ssm) start months, glad start investment much advance. moreover, macro-prudential policy much agenda. take historically low interest rate range unconventional monetary policy around world order support modest recovery low rate inflation. this environment investor search yield financial imbalance build up. and, fact, ecb’s imf’s financial stability analysis confirm specific asset segments, among real estate, point overheat several countries. the issue arise whether macro-prudential policy need react. in fact, last quarter, consider euro area, four country – belgium, the netherlands, slovenia estonia – activate macro-prudential policy tool (all capital-related measures), line eu regulatory framework. this new policy area get traction robust analysis need allow timely adequate interventions. in remark today, i want first start concept systemic risk discus way understand systemic risk shape objective macro-prudential policy. most importantly, i argue build-up systemic risk financial cycle endogenous outcome – man-made construct – job macro-prudential policy try smoothen cycle much possible. beyond increase resilience system, i argue macro-prudential policy ambitious lean imbalance so, prepare bold intrusive. decision timing, design calibration intervention need underpin robust analysis. while monetary policy employ smoothen credit cycle, principle “one objective, one tool”, macro-prudential policy function rest responsibility central bank give synergy interaction two policy functions. this reflect macro-prudential policy framework adopt ecb/ssm. the nature systemic risk objective macro-prudential policy macro-prudential policy aim maintain stability financial system whole contain systemic risks. systemic risk define risk that, materialised, potential make financial instability become widespread function financial system impair extent growth welfare suffer materially (ecb 2009). ecb staff, combine available literature practical experiences, develop conceptual framework rely three mechanism lead systemic financial instability: risk come large aggregate shocks, contagion risk, 2 bi central bankers’ speech risk unravel widespread financial imbalance build endogenously time.1 contagion occur failure one institution “infects” hitherto “healthy” institutions. prominent recent example materialisation contagion risk include dry interbank fund follow collapse lehman brothers. large aggregate shock always important source widespread financial instability history. gorton (1988) document negative economic news best lead indicator likelihood bank panic 19th century usa. the third, and, view, important source systemic risk risk unravel financial imbalances. these imbalance may build gradually, mostly endogenously, unravel abruptly. they form part inherent pro-cyclicality financial system.2 it crucial recognise financial cycle important endogenous component arise bank take much solvency liquidity risk. the aim macro-prudential policy temper financial cycle rather merely enhance resilience financial sector ahead crises. it seem unacceptable macro-prudential authority would passively watch development bubble house price asset prices, comfort idea bank sector prepare weather storm central bank would deal painful aftermath. the crisis show amount risk endogenously generate financial cycle spin “out-of-control” dwarf “mopping up” ability fiscal monetary policy due fiscal capacity limit zero low bind nominal interest rates. in matter financial instability, prevention always good cure. tame financial cycle the challenge tame financial cycle is, doubt, formidable. the nature systemic instability fully understood, token, analytical tool risk detection, risk assessment support policy response developed. this progress researcher mar elsewhere welcome. despite difficulties, new field macro finance already identify number important financial amplification channels. “collateral amplification” important way think procyclicality ever since seminal work kiyotaki moore (1997).3 this mechanism operate easy credit would increase value collateral, thereby encourage supply credit. during boom, firm household borrow

(2014)17 gregory et. al. (2014)18 present mar conference. these analytical tool exploit multiple novel data sources, variable model order generate accurate crisis predictions. many tool already use regular macro-prudential surveillance work ecb. let summarise. systemic risk largely endogenous phenomenon due inherent procyclicality financial system. prevent instability occur good deal consequence therefore lean financial cycle key objective macro-prudential policies. of course, implicitly assume effective efficient tool disposal. i turn issue effectiveness. what instrument use lean imbalances? understand transmission channel macro-prudential policy in advance economies, actual experience use macro-prudential policy relatively limited, exception administrative intervention usual many european country 60 80s, like limit credit minimum payment consumer credit. these instrument play containment role credit cycle time le sophisticate financial systems. nowadays, transmission channel stylise macro-prudential instrument far complex make calibration especially hard. policy maker inevitably start trial-and-error approaches, help identify address main operational issues. have say that, i would also underline mar relevant research macro-prudential policy area shed light transmission channel financial instability well select policy regulatory instruments. but enhance understand analytical work much need support choice implementation policy instruments. macro-prudential policy may address financial imbalance build specific sectors, use target instruments. this could facilitate analysis transmission mechanisms. at time, though, variety possible combination macro-prudential instrument also make implementation macro-prudential policy complex endeavour, take account interactions, leakage waterbed effects. go forward, analytical framework also need take element account. macro-prudential policy: implementation issue effectiveness it worthwhile group macro-prudential policy two category accord way operate. a simple distinction make measure act cost-price incentives, like capital requirements, depend quantitative limits, like large exposure ltv/dtis limits. capital base instrument act restrain boom long banks’ overall cost fund sensitive structure liabilities. we know 15 since country credit boom also experience crisis (on average), seem trade-off macroeconomic performance stability (rancière, tornell, westermann, 2008). 16 alessi, l. detken, c.

recent economic development ireland capital 21st century show value comprehensive data understand trend capital debt. so, see data lens, recent boom-and-bust experience ireland compare? do data? well, aggregate household wealth indebtedness many important element (cf. cussen phelan, 2010, 2011, cussen, o’leary smith, 2012),1 i speak aggregate number minutes. but wealth indebtedness distributed, much le known. to sure, systematic collection income inequality poverty data ireland well establish since 1980s carry forward notably cso’s silc survey. the share top percent income distribution also track long period time ireland, data (nolan, 2007) part world top income database employ piketty. use source extensive work understand impact boom bust income distribution (cf. mcginnity et al. 2013)

emphasise relate asset liability distinct income expenditure – stock distinct flows: aggregate data, little distribution. we would like have, indeed piketty include book many country long time period, size distribution household wealth. in addition would valuable purpose government policy know distribution different element household wealth different income deciles, age categories, social class,

bank cso.3 this mean that, come discussion wealth distribution, luxury data-free speculation much longer. so let hasten indulge myself! how main component wealth change ireland boom bust? the financial crisis dramatic effect net worth household ireland…as prior boom. a show figure, measure aggregate household net worth peak ireland mid-2007 €719 billion, almost €300 billion five year before. just five year later, mid-2012, fall back mid-2002 level. from trough since small net increase again.4 (i touch asset liability corporate sector, area greatly complicate large presence multinational corporations; i think omission much distort i say.) 3 like exercises, survey may throw light top end wealth distribution. 4 a point note data. about two-fifths household financial asset represent insurance pension fund asset hold benefit households, two-fifths represent currency deposits. quote non-quoted equity account remainder. 4 bi central bankers’ speech figure: main component household government net worth, 2002, 07, 12 13 (€ bn. source household: cussen phelan, 2010 update authors; government: net financial asset central bank quarterly financial accounts.) household save throughout decade, tend increase net worth. but up-and-down swing measure net worth primarily relate change price land housing.5 the value house asset grow much quickly household net worth 2002 2007; accompany rapid increase aggregate household debt. indeed, 2007 aggregate household debt represent third high ratio disposable income among 24 european country data available (cussen, o’leary smith, 2012). the increase household debt 2002–7 increase aggregate household financial assets. but course would true individual households: distribution matters. when price property fell back, debt remained. the two factor transform might seem rather benign valuation blip cripple debt crisis are, course (i) distribution issue, namely fact different household affect dramatically different ways, depend mainly whether borrow buy over-priced property (ii) fact government’s net debt position also deteriorate €150 bn since 2007: third attributable bail-out bank creditors6 rest result borrow undertaken, especially official sources, course smooth transition restore budgetary balance.7 5 the role valuation change show cussen phelan (2010, 2011). aggregate equity withdrawal mortgage lend boom year amount €8 billion (lydon o’leary, 2013). 6 though bank shareholders, lose essentially investment; subordinate debt holder bank also lose heavily. between them, investors, mostly foreign, absorb half bank losses. 7 the latter need become evident automatic fiscal stabiliser (e.g. unemployment payment reduction tax revenue) kicked-in global domestic economic crisis coincide erode employment income levels. bi central bankers’ speech 5 if everyone’s asset liability affect way, return net asset 2002 level might seem relatively painless. but modest net change aggregate household net worth 2002 2012 mask increase aggregate indebtedness €100 bn. not everyone borrowed. but height price bubble, devastate effect net worth subsequent price fall significant wealth outcome crisis. it send net worth negative territory many, especially take account future earn potential (sometimes know “human capital” wealth analyses). current future earn also damage unemployment.8 migration flow also factor. the whole size distribution net wealth move left: push bottom negative positions. while i cannot prove it, i think may take (based evidence have) also widen inequality within wealth distribution (using conventional measure inequality) since begin millennium. furthermore, churn within distribution substantial. clearly many people become rich lose gains. other rich people relatively unaffected. but sizable group incur heavy debt acquire property close top market see net worth (even modest begin with) wipe entirely. it’s question analyse relative impact bust rich boom versus poor boom. also strike is, instance, fact loss net worth concentrate mainly borrow mid-century.9 this group turn concentrate age group 30–45, confirmed, example, data duffy o’hanlon (2013). while, piketty’s account well illustrates, many factor alter net worth different household time – poor investment decisions; adverse shock one sort another – large movement strongly affect sizable fraction society short period time represent huge shift distribution household worth, well overall widen wealth inequality. it constantly provoke question: “what more, anything, government policy alleviate result stress?” what government do? in experience, question incline elicit wide range response display wide range fundamentally different approach question ownership debt. there are, one hand, may call “contract fundamentalists” disregard extreme nature crisis occurred. on one hand attach little importance conventional principle ownership private property. in practice – part underlie mid-20th century story show piketty europe – sudden major debt crisis scale around world often accompany surge inflation currency depreciation. such surge effect low real burden indebtedness pass real loss holder monetary assets. unanticipated inflation crude mechanism redistribution, though, typically result output cost subsequent year monetary authority struggle bring back control. in event,

another category often mention retire person whose wealth concentrate traditional long-standing hold bank equity. 6 bi central bankers’ speech because reach limit debt capacity (for reason mention above), government little room leave policy involve net additional spending, practice limit broadly cost-neutral adjustment tax spending. along limit capacity, little appetite transfer taxpayer indebted household still afford service debts. personal insolvency legislation has, however, modernise streamlined, offer viable option over-indebted borrowers. ideally, though, lender be,

concession would largely fall bank system’s large shareholder, state. i need hardly recall walk tightrope slow process. some home-owners see income situation deteriorate point long afford service

still, also important question wide economic impact change wealth high scale. many irish family moderate wealth also saw capital shrink dramatically crisis bi central bankers’ speech 7 property

introductory remark mr thomas jordan, chairman govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 19 june 2014. * * * lady gentleman welcome swiss national bank’s six-monthly news conference. a usual, i begin explain monetary policy decision outline assessment economic situation. afterwards, jean-pierre danthine present late financial stability report, fritz zurbrügg comment current development financial markets. follow introductory remarks, please answer question might have. monetary policy decision i begin monetary policy decision. the snb maintain minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro. the target range three-month libor remain unchanged 0.0–0.25%. the swiss franc still high. we therefore continue enforce minimum exchange rate utmost determination. if necessary, prepare buy foreign currency unlimited quantity purpose. with interest rate close zero, minimum exchange rate right tool avoid undesirable tighten monetary conditions. this apply especially upward pressure swiss franc intensify again. and, required, also will take measures. our new conditional inflation forecast show inflationary pressure recede medium term. the inflation forecast come quarter slightly high march. this departure point forecast move upwards, inflation somewhat high may expected. however, mid-2015 onwards, inflation low forecast previous quarter. the reason global economic outlook deteriorate slightly. another factor unexpectedly weak inflation euro area. at 0.1%, inflation forecast current year 0.1 percentage point high march. for 2015 2016, new forecast – 0.3% 2015 0.9% 2016 – 0.1 percentage point lower, case, previous monetary policy assessment. it important bear mind forecast conditional. it base assumption three-month libor remain 0.0% next three year swiss franc weaken forecast horizon. in forecast, therefore, assume snb pursue expansionary monetary policy. even assumptions, still sign inflation risk switzerland foreseeable future. global economic outlook the snb’s inflation forecast embed global economic scenario. i would therefore like give assessment global economy. the global recovery remain hesitant overall. last quarter register weak growth anticipate march monetary policy assessment. world trade also declined, exhibit strong growth last month 2013, raise hope sustain economic recovery. 2 bi central bankers’ speech in us, gdp decline first quarter. however, consider transitory phenomenon largely put exceptional cold snap experience winter. growth euro area weak vary greatly one country another. while economic activity continue pick germany, renew stagnation france italy give rise disappointment. we continue expect global economy firm come quarters. however, global economic recovery remain subdue historical standards. compare last monetary policy assessment, anticipate somewhat slow growth, advance emerge economies. it entirely possible, however, global economic growth weak assumed. the euro area continue face significant challenges. these include consolidation public sector finance well implementation institutional reform reform promote growth. in addition, various emerge economy suffer structural problems. should current geopolitical conflict worsen, would also hold back activity international economy. since major currency area different phase monetary policy cycle, also danger great volatility financial foreign exchange markets. all generate high level uncertainty regard future development global economy. swiss economic outlook i look economic development switzerland. a expected, growth switzerland pick somewhat first quarter, relatively weak previous quarter. the rebound mainly attributable upturn business activity manufacture bank sector. on demand side, export good – still decline previous quarter – construction investment main growth drivers. nevertheless, capacity swiss economy still fully utilise overall. technical capacity utilisation manufacture remain considerably long-term average. although employment first quarter, unemployment rate remain unchanged. we expect moderate recovery continue come quarters. for 2014, anticipate growth rate remain around 2.0%. a continue see gradual improvement international environment, export demand likely rise. over time, encourage corporate investment stimulate demand labour. the level residential construction order remain high. on whole, however, expect considerable slowdown growth momentum residential construction investment. in addition global risks, swiss economy also face uncertainty home. in past weeks, snb’s delegate regional economic relation ask company ass impact popular initiative curb mass immigration business activity. the result suggest tangible level uncertainty economic conditions. most company take specific measures, however. monetary financial condition i turn monetary financial conditions. after two year negative inflation, consumer price inflation practically zero month now. this restrain development also reflect inflation expectations. the majority market participant expect inflation remain unchanged short term. over long horizon two years, relevant survey show expect rate inflation approximately 1.0%. these result consistent assessment inflation outlook. bi central bankers’ speech 3 geopolitical risk mix economic data major economy lead strong demand secure investments. this reflect fall yield long-term government bonds. my colleague, fritz zurbrügg, talk development financial market detail. mortgage rate also decline again, thereby bolster demand mortgage loans. however, slowdown momentum mortgage lending, observe time now, continued. this step right direction. nevertheless, imbalance remain. it therefore still early all-clear. give high level liquidity, money market rate remain low level. even prior introduction negative interest rate european central bank (ecb), swiss franc libor future slip well negative territory. we closely monitor impact recent interest rate reduction euro area switzerland. should need action, snb take necessary measures. the export-weighted real external value swiss franc remain well long-term average. since introduction minimum exchange rate, change slightly. thus, swiss franc still high. the slight inflation differential past quarter mean real adjustment swiss franc euro come virtual standstill. in environment, minimum exchange rate remain essential guarantee appropriate monetary conditions. snb monetary policy to conclude, i would like mention number challenge snb face near future. overall, environment remain extremely challenge swiss economy monetary policy. with high level international integration, switzerland strongly affect global developments, especially neighbour countries. the ecb’s measure support economic development euro area also likely favourable impact swiss economy medium term. nevertheless, give low interest rate europe rest world well strong swiss franc, snb’s monetary policy environment remain highly complex. we continue take action necessary fulfil mandate ensure price stability, take due account economic developments. the financial crisis show balance economic development require price stability; financial stability also key importance. the snb’s annual financial stability report contribution towards this. in report, draw attention development might present risk financial stability. in respect, still concern imbalance mortgage real estate markets. the financial crisis show serious effect problem financial sector overall economy. it precisely current environment globally low interest rate danger imbalance financial market particularly high. with report, would like urge participant market exercise caution. in addition, recent development area legal risk demonstrate importance strongly capitalise swiss banks. my colleague, jean-pierre danthine, present important conclusion financial stability report. lady gentlemen, thank attention. it pleasure give floor jean-pierre danthine. bi central bankers’ speech 1 hiroshi nakaso: the conquest japanese deflation – interim report remark mr hiroshi nakaso, deputy governor bank japan, athens symposium “banking union, monetary policy economic growth’’, athens, 19 june 2014. * * * introduction it great pleasure able take part discussion distinguish panelist. i hope forgive presumption borrow title remark today nobel laureate thomas sargent’s influential book, ‘‘the conquest american inflation’’.1 i would like talk important challenge face bank japan moment, conquer deflation japan. however, so, let spend time consider come struggle mild persistent deflation. i. deflationary equilibrium japan’s cpi begin dip negative territory 1998, remain whole next 15 years. this deflation two distinctive features. one long duration, clearly set apart usual business cycle frequency. the mildness. for time, deflation remain le minus 1 percent year-on-year basis, except short spell period lehman crisis. give length deflation, economist naturally argue temporary disequilibrium phenomenon, indication equilibrium shift deflation prevail (chart 1).2 i incline believe case, equilibrium shift trigger two huge shock hit japan simultaneously 1997: bank turmoil asian currency crises. the combination two shock would severe challenge monetary authority try protect economy threat serious deflationary pressures. the bank turmoil particularly severe blow ability credit intermediary function bank sector support economic recovery seriously impaired, turn exacerbate deflationary threat. bad still, little room cut interest rate: policy rate already low ½ percent prior shock hit japan. give magnitude negative shocks, question arise deflation mild japan. there may several determine factors3 i believe decline potential growth play important role. even begin struggle deflation, potential growth japan start show secular decline due age fall trend population, well slowdown capital formation. thus, potential growth estimate drop current level low ½ percent 4 percent early 1990s (chart 2). this good news itself, help prevent negative output gap widening. 1 sargent, t. j.

(2010): ‘‘seven face ‘the peril’,’’ federal reserve bank st. louis review, september/october, pp.339–352. 3 another important hypothesis inflation become le responsive output gap. 2 bi central bankers’ speech ii. lesson learn what lesson learn experience? to avoid fall deflationary equilibrium, especially face huge negative shocks, i think important authority adhere follow three principles. first, definitely need avoid financial crisis. in 1997, lack solid safety net deposit insurance system bank resolution mechanism could effectively deal systemic disruption. we fail stop large-scale bank crisis institutional framework place. it wake painful experience set robust system prevention management financial crises. second, need keep close eye external events. in 1997, underestimate vulnerability asian economy take time u realize depth, magnitude interconnect aspect asian currency crisis. third, anchor inflation expectation critical monetary authorities. we must become complacent seemingly stable long-run inflation expectations. this inflation expectation inherently difficult measure accurately susceptible downward shift low inflation observe certain period time (i.e. inflation expectation formulate adaptive manner). we careful confuse benefit fall price necessary relative price adjustments. we need maintain credential deflation fighter much inflation fighter show clear unequivocal commitment overcome deflation; credential lost, experience suggest extremely difficult regain. furthermore, crucial show ‘‘whatever-it-takes’’ stance prevent inflation expectation fall face negative shocks. this one motivation underlie bank japan’s quantitative qualitative monetary easing. moreover, repeatedly stated, hesitate make necessary adjustment monetary policy downward risk inflation materialize. some observer argue europe face significant risk deflation, least low inflation. in view, however, exemplify recent decisive action, ecb already make considerable progress three area i mentioned. iii. get deflationary equilibrium the story far prevention, but, today, i also would like talk far progress break free deflation trap (chart 3). inflation rise steadily japan. exclude food energy, april figure cpi inflation 2.3 percent, around 0.8 percent subtract effect hike consumption tax rate. admittedly, still halfway achieve target stable 2 percent, situation change dramatically start quantitative qualitative monetary ease year ago. a i emphasize elsewhere,4 need provide sufficient escape velocity economy order break free deflationary equilibrium. to achieve escape velocity, need employ policy measure arsenal. a monetary policy, bank japan introduce decisive quantitative qualitative monetary ease measures, comprise strong commitment price stability powerful suppression entire yield curve. a fiscal policy, government simultaneously launch expansionary policy, partly supplementary budget, take due account 4 nakaso, h. (2014): ‘‘what lose decade leave future,’’ keynote speech 2014 international conference hold international association deposit insurers, asia-pacific regional committee, april 23, 2014. http://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/press/koen_2014/ko140423a.htm bi central bankers’ speech 3 long-term fiscal sustainability. in try escape deflationary equilibrium, i believe monetary fiscal policy use conduct independently inflationary equilibrium, need pursue use different approach. the joint statement issue bank government january last year may play important role coordination device enable collective conduct monetary fiscal policies. this joint statement important foundation abenomics. close cooperation monetary fiscal authority observe japan, also area unconventional monetary policy deployed.5 for instance, bank england introduce asset purchase facility, letter chancellor make clear british government would provide indemnity cover loss arise facility. however, close cooperation necessarily imply loss central bank independence follow two reasons. first, clear mandate inflation target guarantee active monetary policy road. the zero low bind nominal interest rate tie hand central banker come deflation. a inflation, central banker adjust policy rate flexibly inflation likely stay state target. second, government well understand importance fiscal prudence. in recent g20 communiqué, respective government make firm commitment maintain fiscal sustainability. a second arrow abenomics, japanese government already make important step forward respect raise consumption tax rate april year. presumably commitment fiscal sustainability, survey figure long-run inflation forecast advance economy increase level much target inflation rates, although figure subject considerable uncertainty, i mention before. these forecast japan yet reach even 2 percent, although seem steady rise trend. iv. importance raise potential growth since i talk first second arrow abenomics, let touch upon third arrow conclude presentation. a i mentioned, decline potential growth japan limit range negative output gap. together demand recovery, low potential growth seem contribute recent rise inflation tight capacity constraint. in fact, late output gap estimate largely balance (chart 4). we often hear anecdote capacity constraint, especially relate labor shortages, partly current economic recovery drive primarily non-manufacturing sector, inherently labor intensive thus absorb workforce otherwise. under circumstances, raise potential growth vital importance. what envisage achieve price stability sound development national economy.6 in words, stable inflation attain robust growth, accompany healthy job creation reasonable wage hikes. low potential growth bode well scenario, even if, ceteris paribus, contribute raise inflation capacity constraint. 5 kohn, d. l. (2009): ‘‘interactions monetary fiscal policy current situation,’’ speech conference monetary-fiscal policy interactions, expectations, dynamic current economic crisis, princeton university, may 23, 2009. 6 the bank japan act state ‘‘currency monetary control bank japan shall aim achieve price stability, thereby contribute sound development national economy.’’ (article 2) 4 bi central bankers’ speech this argue imminently favor supply-side policy third arrow abenomics. ambitious labor market reforms, decisive deregulation strong governance reform suppose raise potential growth effectively increase labor capital inputs, well improve total factor productivity. they indeed japanese government intend deliver, i think make steady progress respect, include revise growth strategy announce end month. in meantime, success monetary policy achieve 2 percent price stability target would help transition deflationary equilibrium, disinvest save use consider virtues, inflation equilibrium, revival animal spirit generate fix business investment turn contribute elevate potential growth. conclude remark perhaps get bite far ahead here. for us, immediate challenge still remain deliver stable 2 percent inflation, discussion situation may premature stage. after all, point count chicken hatched. that i put ‘‘interim report’’ title presentation today, hop i report ‘‘mission complete’’ someday, hopefully distant future. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 5 6 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 fritz zurbrügg: current development financial market introductory remark mr fritz zurbrügg, member govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 19 june 2014. * * * i begin today look situation financial markets. then i discus structural change foreign exchange money market importance snb. i close comment progress make reform benchmark interest rates. situation financial market the positive sentiment financial market overall continue since begin year. on one hand, investor encourage fact economic recovery continue side atlantic, even hesitant, well mainly positive business results. on other, general low-interest-rate environment, accompany search yield investors, likely major factor. nevertheless, positive sentiment put test number occasion – instance, january, sign economic weaken political risk number emerge economy give rise considerable uncertainty, march, political conflict ukraine intensified. the gradual taper u federal reserve bond purchase programme, however, take quite calmly market participants. in situation, stock market index register gain since begin year. indeed, number indices, switzerland’s spi, u s&p 500 germany’s dax, attain record level recent weeks. meanwhile, demand sovereign bond issue euro area peripheral country high. this attributable, first gradual improvement fundamental data, also fact investor anticipate monetary policy ease measure introduce european central bank begin june. consequently, risk premia german sovereign bond decline significantly. they currently level last see 2010, onset sovereign debt crisis. sovereign bond issue emerge economy also benefit investors’ increase risk appetite. despite uncertainty begin year i mention before, risk premia low end 2013, apart exceptions. alongside sink risk premia, volatility financial market also decrease since begin year. chart 1 show standard volatility measure u equity (vix), u government bond (move) foreign exchange market (global fx), derive option prices. to ensure comparability, individual data series normalised. they show many standard deviation long-term average figure situated. in addition, trough since 2000 indicate right-hand edge chart. in january, volatility measure rise temporarily; since then, however, return decline path. at present, least one standard deviation average market – marginally low level. apparently, expectation major central bank continue exceptionally accommodate monetary policy foreseeable future firmed. the danger risk long correctly priced, thereby make financial market vulnerable sudden mood swing part investors. despite fundamentally positive investor sentiment, demand secure investment remain high. yield sovereign bond high credit rat therefore decline significantly since begin year, particularly us, germany switzerland, ten-year yield currently around 50 basis point low end 2013. the 2 bi central bankers’ speech decline yield especially mark january, uncertainty number emerge economy surprisingly weak economic data u spur demand. in april may, yield decrease further. this time, demand attributable le publication economic data investor who, speculate rise yields, cover short position yield declined. the cautious attitude many investor also reflect continue high value swiss franc. chart 2 show swiss franc move sideways euro u dollar since begin year. in trade-weighted terms, swiss franc currently almost unchanged january. structural change foreign exchange money market a know, swiss national bank (snb) implement monetary policy via money foreign exchange markets. consequently, structural change market particularly important us. i would like talk briefly major change significance work. on foreign exchange market, see substantial decline turnover primary interbank market. meanwhile, size market whole decrease slightly. this mean interbank market lose market share. the primary interbank market cover trade via electronic communication networks. between 2010 2013, turnover network fell almost 40% overall. in chart 3 see example decline turnover eurchf usdchf currency pairs. in 2013, already previous levels, decline turnover become evident current year. this development attributable, essence, three factors. first, increase tendency large merchant bank use internal clear customer transactions. this mean need hedge transaction interbank market declined. second, increase extent, merchant bank offer liquidity via electronic distribution channel trade platform multibank platforms. this enable attract business benefit additional internalisation. third, small bank increasingly become direct customer large banks, mean le trade take place interbank market. nevertheless, interbank market allow price determination therefore provide reference prices, perform key function foreign exchange market. consequently,

central bankers’ speech chart bi central bankers’ speech 5 bi central bankers’ speech 1 christian noyer: doe europe face prospect lose decade? speech mr christian noyer, governor bank france chairman board director bank international settlements, international economic forum americas, conference montreal, montreal, 9 june 2014. * * * it always privilege speak alongside larry. but also challenge. i make refer often salient remark make larry recent months. i address three questions: euro crisis over? doe europe face prospect lose decade? what short-term policy challenge face today? i/ – be euro crisis over? le two year ago, euro area fight existence. euro pessimist question ability survive. not anymore. analyst may question europe’s ability grow. but challenge face different. they macroeconomic, existential systemic. thanks, mainly, eurosystem’s actions, financial condition normalising. spread peripheral country dramatically reduced. soon, budget reasonably balance fiscal drag economy. household corporates strong balance sheets. recent forecast put german growth 2%, italy positive territory, outlook france improve markedly. growth business activity euro area april high past three years. but crisis leave important legacy: • money financial market remain excessively segmented. the monetary transmission mechanism severely impair credit condition still different across country sectors. • deleveraging bank sector still act impediment recovery growth. bank credit remain flat euro area whole, smes’ finance major concern, especially stress countries, percentage financially constrain viable borrower estimate 25% v 1% “core” countries. we aware balance sheet repair prerequisite credit resume monetary policy efficient. so, address problem priority. 1. we build safe robust system financial intermediation. a major step creation bank union that, know, delink bank sovereign risk ensure harmonise tough financial supervision. it easy underestimate achievement. the idea adopt le two year ago. the single supervisory mechanism running. there example contemporary european history much achieve little time. 2. we launch tough comprehensive aqr subsequent stress test complete end year. for first time, exercise conduct fully integrate way – aegis ssm – full accountability results. completion mark turn point doubt sustainability bank credit resume normal pace. 3. in long run, major policy challenge euro area “reinvent” new robust financial integration model. we need sound cross-border capital flows, 2 bi central bankers’ speech want eurosystem intermediate permanently borrower lender different countries. develop safe securitisation process priority, despite major technical difficulties. ii/ – be europe face prospect lose decade? question long-term growth limit europe. what hear continent reflect general concern: possibility “secular stagnation” advance economies. larry launch crucial debate. i don’t know whether think specifically europe, but, course, question relevant us. secular stagnation rest assumption natural interest rate negative. this may happen two reasons: • in short run, may downward shock demand increase save result deleveraging process. i explain currently address issue. • in long run, age slow innovation may push save rate bring return capital. therefore, ultimate response risk secular stagnation improve return investment, thus push natural interest rate back positive territory. again, european problem. but difficulty regard. structural reform easy. many, however, currently implemented. italy abolish provinces, generate save allow reduction tax liberalise labour market. france track reduce tax labour cost well improve labour market flexibility. iii/- short-term policy challenge response the main challenge, course, low decline inflation, inflation expectation euro area drift downward short medium-term horizons. this prevent adjustment relative prices, – important mechanism eliminate gap competitiveness – increase risk outright deflation, negative shock occur future. strangely, euro area, growth inflation move opposite directions. a growth accelerates, inflation keep go down. this “disconnect” philip curve puzzling. we must look, then, broad picture. euro area economy attract strong capital inflow recent months, two opposite effect financial conditions: first, ease low long-term interest rates. and, second, appreciation euro exchange rate. it’s clear whether overall effect positive. while nominal condition accommodate euro area us, real indicator point restrictive stance. we may see perverse feedback loop develop, low inflation, increase real rates, capital inflow exchange rate appreciation mutually fuel other. the financial economy may head towards bad equilibrium would threaten real economic recovery. the situation call appropriate policy response and, know, govern council agree last thursday strong package four significant measures: first refinance deposit rate reduce – bring deposit rate negative territory first time. this encourage financial intermediary actively put cash balance work credit asset markets. those cash balance significantly boost as: bi central bankers’ speech 3 second, ordinary regime unlimited liquidity provision extend end 2016. third, eurosystem conduct new set target longer-term refinance operations. this exceptional liquidity provide long maturity (up four years) guarantee fix rate, clear sign monetary accommodation persist long time. finally, eurosystem actively prepare buy asset base security help channel monetary accommodation ease financial condition private non-financial borrowers, especially smes. bi central bankers’ speech 1 raghuram rajan: financial sector legislative reform committee report (fslrc) – when? talk dr raghuram rajan, governor reserve bank india, first state bank “banking economic conclave”, mumbai, 17 june 2014. * * * the financial sector legislative reform committee (fslrc) report one important, well researched, well well-publicized report indian financial history. it lay function financial sector structured, also legislation regulation govern ought look like. the author report truly commend national service. the report’s influence felt many year come. there much like agree report. in lay need consumer protection, raise issue whether product sell suitable target customer, put onus financial institution determine suitability, report force regulator review consumer protection frameworks. we rbi indeed engage exercise, inform valuable guideline fslrc report. there great value. the fslrc’s emphasis need clear monetary framework culminate dr. urjit patel committee report, guide think year come. similarly, focus create new institution like financial resolution authority, help u resolve distress financial institution minimum cost economy, much needed. i could go on. but i come praise fslrc report, debate it. i argue two fundamental area tension. one oversight regulators. the fslrc suggest law micromanage, give regulator freedom fill detail consonance change need economy. at time, fslrc want check balance activity regulator judicial oversight. too much check balance could completely vitiate flexibility afford rewrite laws. we need find proper balance, balance may vary level development. i worry think fully. the second area tension appropriate size scope regulators. the fslrc’s recommendation seem somewhat schizophrenic here. on one hand, emphasize synergy bring together regulator one entity. but process suggest break regulators, attendant loss synergies. there discussion empirical magnitude synergy gain synergy lost, make recommendation seem faddish impressionistic rather base deep analysis. indeed, across world, see variety organizational structure existence, suggest one right structure. if so, strong argument depart status quo, fslrc provide. let elaborate two issues. the logic regulation the logic regulation accord fslrc deal market failure or, colloquially, bad behaviour. the commission talk incomplete information poor incentive reason bad behaviour, one important reason bad behaviour necessitate regulation economist call incomplete contracts; is, behaviour regulate entity (vis vi customers, public large, taxpayer, market) cannot completely specify contract difficult observe verify real time, gauge across many contracts. 2 bi central bankers’ speech this mean court enforce specific contracts, regulator sometimes better. for instance, bank may attract lot complaint credit card customers. while single customer may think case worth take court, customer may able prove bank wrong, large number complaint suggest regulator bank need shape up. by compare nature complaint get bank’s customer complaint get banks, regulator gauge whether something wrong bank act. similarly, particular product attract lot complaint products, regulator ask industry modify product appropriately, even ban it. a regulator may also prevent certain form contract – cdo square cdo cub emerge financial crisis. if regulator think certain kind security impose undue risk system, ban security, even though would trade amongst consent adults. while regulator proof security behave thinks, regulator cannot wait till risk occur, may late. the broad point lot regulatory action stem regulator exercise sound judgment base year experience. in so, fill gap laws, contracts, even regulations. not everything regulator prove court law. court interfere specific decision corporate board – use business judgment rule, second guess business decisions, pull board violation legal process arrive decision. in way, range regulatory decision regulatory judgment second guessed. the danger excessive legal oversight yet one read fslrc almost everything regulator does, frame regulation process decision reach also exercise regulatory judgment well policy decisions, subject legal appeal. for that, want create financial sector appellate tribunal. the intent place check balance regulatory actions. note process regulator reach decision, well conformity decision basic principle natural justice, already challenge writ petition high court. even now, regulatory decision appeal central government. but much check balance enough? do want even policy decision appealable? can legal oversight become excessive? there three danger guard against. the first ask tribunal make judgment simply capability, experience, information make, precise evidence may lacking. if attempt this, undermine purpose regulator. of course, one could trust good sense tribunal follow “regulatory judgment” rule intervene broad array matters, imply double standard – trust tribunal’s judgment regulator. more likely, though, past experience suggest entity like justify existence, set up, tribunal intervene necessary. the second danger ease appellate process invite appeal. in develop country well-established regulations, case history judgments, speedy delivery justice, would problem. in india, financial system develop many new regulation frame (more move principle base approach legislation), tribunal significant amount learn do, encouragement appeal could paralyze system create distortions, need regulation hold participant exploit loopholes. finally, every country, healthy respect regulator serf keep participant straight narrow. in develop country, private behaviour le constrain norm institutions, especially important. but extent private party bi central bankers’ speech 3 high price lawyer check regulator, healthy respect dissipates. so final danger regulator could become paper tiger, lose power influence good behaviour, even area subject judicial review. be i argue check balance needed? certainly not! but already check balance place, include review constitutional court like high court writ petitions. senior officer regulator appointed, removed, government. the fslrc recommend annual report parliament, well regular discussion parliamentarians. these good suggestions, would add oversight. some could argue sebi already security appellate tribunal, bring regulator tribunal? so long tribunal question administrative decision size proportionality penalties, i see problem. but go beyond, start entertain question policy, function regulator like rbi, constantly make judgment intend minimize systemic risk, greatly impaired. indeed, tendency new organization overreach justify existence, one careful tie financial regulator judicial oversight. good revisit issue year regulation oversight mechanism good developed. finally, understand regulator want trusted, display great competence integrity. the rbi, despite general deterioration probity public institutions, maintain reputation integrity. we cannot complacent work maintain culture, well service conditions, encourage integrity. we also work continuously upgrade capability match fast pace change financial sector. regulatory architecture another area tension fslrc’s reason regulatory architecture. let u take suggestion merge regulation trade new unify financial agency. so forward market commission, well bond regulation activity currently undertake rbi, would move new roof, would sebi. but assume central synergy fact instrument traded. but could synergy exist? and important they? for instance, forward trade real commodity delivered, regulatory oversight real market commodity price discovered, well warehouse commodity delivered, may important source regulatory synergy. should fmc subsume unify financial agency would good strong link ministry oversee real commodities? i think answer need investigation. similarly, regulation bond trade synergistic regulation debt product bank loan operation monetary policy (which require bond trading) form trading? once again, i sure compel answer fslrc report. my personal view move regulation bond trade time would severely hamper development government bond market, include process make bond liquid across spectrum, process rbi engage in. the fslrc also seem inconsistent emphasis synergy regulatory uniformity. it propose regulation trade move one roof, regulation consumer protection move another roof, regulation credit balkanize – bank continue regulate rbi regulation quasi-bank nbfcs move unify financial agency, regulatory behemoth 4 bi central bankers’ speech would combine supervision trade well credit. this balkanization would hamper regulatory uniformity, supervision credit growth, conduct monetary policy. more broadly, fslrc seem somewhat idealistic view benefit reorganization. it seem believe activity combine organization, synergy fully exploit exist separate organizations, synergy exploited. i share view, i believe extreme. silo within large bureaucratic regulator may prevent synergy exploited, frequent inter-regulatory meet allow regulator capture many available synergy activities. indeed, one particularly useful proposal fslrc put financial sector development council firm footing. it good venue inter-regulatory cooperation, benefit augment personal interactions. for instance, chairman sebi i try get together every month note resolve issues. at time, negotiation cooperation regulator overcome organizational barriers, wise give regulator responsibility leave tool exercise responsibility hands. the rbi responsibility manage internal external value rupee, broadly, macroeconomic stability. a number multilateral agency academic recognized, ability shape capital inflow recognize part macro-prudential tool kit. but take away control internal capital inflow rbi, isn’t fslrc take away important tool rbi? if ain’t broke… l sound like unthinking defence regulatory turf, let add place rbi could give powers. for instance, government want manage debt, reason rbi stand way. i don’t believe government suffer le conflict interest debt management (unlike view fslrc), rbi could well carry government’s instruction without loss welfare. i imagine, however, government depend deputation rbi advice. instead, think remark attempt draw important undoubted benefit fslrc report, eschew grand scheme dubious chance success. undoubtedly law need reform, reason try entirely new approach legislation, overlay entirely new regulatory structures, complement entirely new oversight regulation. undoubtedly, had, have, period regulator get along other. but reason merge organization break others, perhaps ensure dysfunctionality along many dimensions? after all, single regulatory architecture emerge distinction crisis. instead, different regulatory architecture succeed fail base circumstance country quality regulator. undoubtedly, also occasion regulator exceed remit high-handed. but reason subject every action judicial second-guessing? be reason need check balances, try solve problem exist. a chinese would say, let u recognize value cross river feel stone put weight it. let u take blind jump hop stone support u land. or american, ain’t broke, don’t fix it! bi central bankers’ speech 1 christopher kent: cyclical structural change labour market address mr christopher kent, assistant governor (economic) reserve bank australia, wall street journal’s labour market development gathering, sydney, 16 june 2014. * * * i thank david jacobs, kim edwards, daniel de voss, sharon lai josef manalo help prepare remarks. i appreciate opportunity talk today key cyclical structural force affect australian labour market recent years. not surprisingly, spend considerable time effort bank try understand labour market development give relevance unemployment inflation. development past couple year over recent months, labour market condition show sign improvement. follow modest growth last year, employment grow almost 0.9 per cent far year. the unemployment rate tick month ago participation rate appear stabilise somewhat, significant decline 2013. these improvement appear consistent sign good growth economic activity, although i’ll come back point minutes.1 despite improvements, still fair degree spare capacity labour market. this apparent across number dimension (graph 1): • unemployment rate high relative recent history • participation rate around low it’s past eight year • there’s significant decline ratio employment working-age population since 2010 • wage growth declined, well average past decade. graph 1 1 the lag activity labour market discuss rba (2014), “box b: lag activity labour market“, statement monetary policy, may, pp 39–41. 2 bi central bankers’ speech my plan today discus key force play lead labour market point, think prospect future. demand supply: what’s drive labour market developments? like markets, development labour market reflect interplay demand supply. these determine outcome term quantity (such employment) price (namely wages). there three key development help explain dynamic past years: • first, period weaken growth labour demand, reflect decline mine investment still weak state overall demand across non-mining economy. • second, there’s decline growth labour supply, reflect cyclical “discouraged worker” effect, age population also significant endure influence. • third, wage adjust degree spare capacity labour market. moreover, slow growth wage play part real exchange rate adjustment require term trade mine investment decline. to large extent, development reflect unwind adjustment see period commodity price rise mine boom midst investment phase. a colleague i note elsewhere, period saw significant appreciation nominal real exchange rates, alongside relatively strong growth employment wage – particularly mine mining-related activities.2 these change work reverse, nominal exchange rate growth wage low been. both helpful part necessary adjustment process. monetary policy also play role provide support demand. labour demand: transition away mining-led growth in large part, subdue growth labour demand past couple year reflect below-trend growth output much period. the economy face various headwind time, including: decline term trade; decline mine investment; high level exchange rate; weak growth public demand. the demand labour think derive demand good service help produce. so surprise employment growth weaken unemployment rate turn around middle 2012. that correspond noticeable slow growth economic activity, remain relatively subdued, least late 2013 (graph 2). in turn, much owe decline mine investment. meanwhile, growth activity non-mining economy subdue period, pick slightly late last year. that modest pick-up may contributed, least part, improve employment growth past months. it may also improvement reflect “catching-up” employment growth modest growth 2013. 2 a discuss plumb m, c kent j bishop (2013), “implications australian economy strong growth asia“, rba research discussion paper no 2013–03. bi central bankers’ speech 3 graph 2 gdp growth lift noticeably around turn year – run bite trend year march quarter 2014. but much owe strong contribution production export resources, draw much labour. the strength resource production late partly reflect improvement labour productivity mine sector, expect new productive capacity come line. however, measure labour productivity growth improve past year across broad range industries, follow period quite weak growth (graph 3). if sustained, would positive development, include employee time benefit sustainable gain earnings. over past couple years, mean growth output we’ve see achieve relatively moderate growth employment. outside mine sector, general improvement productivity growth may response range competitive pressure come bear period weak growth aggregate demand. the still high level exchange rate one competitive pressure. graph 3 4 bi central bankers’ speech the transition relatively labour-intensive investment phase mine boom capital-intensive production phase apparent employment growth across different industries. step back minute period 2008/09 2011/12 (just prior appear peak mine investment), resource-related activity account bite half growth employment (graph 4).3 much mine industry itself, much also industry provide input resource extraction investment. business services, manufacture construction benefit directly resource-related activity. graph 4 now, start see decline mine investment, reversal early trends. most notably, business service employment decline significantly, firm expose mine sector particularly affect (graph 5). also, mine employment plateaued since mid-2012. meanwhile, strong growth employment household services, account significant share growth employment recent years. there’s also slight upward trend employment construction, consistent prospect strong pick-up residential non-residential building, require worker sector period ahead. 3 rayner v j bishop (2013), “industry dimension resource boom: an input-output analysis“, rba research discussion paper no 2013–02. bi central bankers’ speech 5 graph 5 the relatively weak state overall labour demand past couple year evident measure employment intentions, job vacancy advertisements. some show sign improvement late, remain relatively low levels. households’ expectation adjust well; weak growth labour demand translate concern job security. in turn, concern job security labour market condition lead decline rate employee resignation which, spite increase rate dismissals, see turnover labour market decline little. labour supply labour market outcome also depend supply labour. like labour demand, growth labour supply slow substantially past year so. this reflect cyclical structural influences. the slow growth labour supply evident rate labour force participation. a small proportion working-age population employ look work. this decline participation rate large average experience early episode rise unemployment (graph 6). so even though population continue grow strong rate, growth labour force little slow previous experience might suggested. graph 6 6 bi central bankers’ speech it unusual participation rate fall period weak demand. a job become difficult find (at prevail wage), individual become discourage searching. these individual may still available work, might choose sit sideline labour market, ready take opportunity least begin search one condition improve. discourage individual represent element labour market slack capture conventional measure unemployment “marginally attached” labour force.4 in recent years, rise proportion working-age population marginally attach labour force, consistent discourage worker effect (graph 7). this contribute decline participation rate – is, rise share working-age population labour force. but since 2010, rise marginally attach account le one-quarter rise share working-age population labour force. many labour force may still discouraged, choose make unavailable work; example, may embark period study decide retire early might otherwise case. graph 7 the noticeable increase number people labour force consider marginally attach suggest other, potentially structural factor play. an important one ageing. an increase share populace move old age brackets, tend low rate participation (graph 8). also, old worker likely work part-time, even participate few hour average prime working-age lives. 4 the definition marginal attachment include individual available search work, (in case would classify unemployed). note “discouraged” worker may classify marginally attached; example, individual choose take study, case long available work search it. conversely, individual consider marginally attach even “discouraged” search job; example, search yet available enter labour force. bi central bankers’ speech 7 graph 8 the age population new. by itself, age estimate subtract participation rate 0.1 0.2 percentage point per year past decade half (graph 9). however, effect pick little recent year baby boomer begin reach age 65 years. graph 9 what begin deviate noticeably historical path recent year participation rate among old workers. in past, rise participation people old age bracket work offset effect increase share old people population. that is, workforce ageing, people work late life case past. in particular, old woman likely participate case predecessors. but recent year trend increase 8 bi central bankers’ speech participation old age group slowed, participation rate flat even fall touch (graph 10). graph 10 what’s clear though upward trend taper off. it may response cyclical weakness labour market, case participation rate age 55 year might trend again, time. alternatively, may structural. perhaps early forces, include rise longevity general ability preference work late life, may largely run course. however, give long history rise longevity, seem likely continue. one possibility though force underpin early rise participation old age (including longevity) run current incentive many retire age 65 years. however, story low participation rate entirely age behaviour old workers. participation also decline groups, notably young people – many participate education (graph 11). again, decline may cyclical structural elements. graph 11 bi central bankers’ speech 9 wage while growth rate labour demand supply weak past couple years, know former significant latter. the fact labour supply constrain employment growth evident rise unemployment rate substantial decline growth rate wage period (graph 12). graph 12 the slow wage growth clear also leftward shift distribution wage growth across individual firm (graph 13). the data show nab business survey. this also consistent bank’s liaison suggest wage outcome 4 per cent become far le common case year ago. indeed, outcome 2–3 per cent common 3–4 per cent. slow wage growth also help inflation expectation remain contained.5 graph 13 5 see rba (2013), “box b: the slow wage growth“, statement monetary policy, august, pp 51–52. 10 bi central bankers’ speech the implication slow labour demand (relative supply) depend significantly responsiveness wages. change demand le effect employment output wage respond sooner otherwise. in respect, flexible labour market comparison early term trade boom helpful. this flexibility allow rise relative wage encourage labour resource resource-related activity run-up mine investment, without lead large rise growth rate wage across economy broadly. the flexibility help term trade mine investment turn down.6 indeed, decline wage growth late particularly pronounce mine business services, evident elsewhere (graph 14). the move investment production phase mine boom free continue free labour move back non-resource sector economy. this weigh wage growth across economy likely yet. graph 14 the slow wage growth across industry mean firm experience relatively slow growth labour costs. this strike account growth productivity labour, i’ve already note pick somewhat compare pace become accustom much 2000s. over past year half, growth nominal wage match growth labour productivity. a result, increase cost labour require produce unit output.7 in turn, slow growth labour cost beneficial effect international competitiveness. the link labour cost competitiveness illustrate measure real exchange rate base unit labour cost (the real trade weight index (twi) graph 15). this tell u labour cost produce unit output 6 see battellino r (2010), “mining boom australian economy“, rba bulletin,

(both measure equivalent currency terms). over decade 2011, real exchange rate appreciate significantly, consistent rise term trade mine investment boom. much occur via nominal exchange rate, appreciate little 50 per cent period. but part adjustment occur via pick-up pace wage growth, time labour productivity growth relatively slow. hence, nominal unit labour cost australia increase around 25 per cent relative trade partner period, contribute noticeably decline competiveness (outside resource sector, benefit much high commodity prices). graph 15 now process begin change course. a decline real exchange rate one important way economy adjust decline term trade transition production phase mine boom. over past year, we’ve see noticeable decline nominal exchange rate, although still remain high historical standards, particularly give decline commodity price recent months. at time, australian unit labour cost stop rise relative trade partner even decline little since mid-2012. this part adjustment decline commodity price assist non-mining economy regain competitiveness generate employment growth demand labour resource sector turn down. adjustment via slow wage growth strong productivity growth may contribute much quickly real depreciation might expect decline nominal exchange rate. however, still preferable alternative little adjustment growth unit labour costs, would come expense unemployment associate economic social costs. conclusion to conclude, growth labour demand labour supply slow recent years. demand labour affect several headwinds. the downturn mine investment weigh domestic demand, commensurate pick-up export le labour intensive. on labour supply side, much slowdown likely cyclical element, although structural factor age also play role. 12 bi central bankers’ speech the slow growth wage past couple year helpful part process adjust downturn commodity price mine investment. the decline wage growth contributed, margins, turnaround real exchange rate help cushion effect slow growth domestic demand employment growth. it also help contain domestic cost pressure thereby offset effect low exchange rate consumer prices. the demand labour improve recent months, although may reflect “catch-up” period weak employment growth last year. some forward-looking indicator high been, though still level consistent moderate employment growth next months. the bank’s late forecast employment growth pick gradually next two years. the unemployment rate expect remain elevate period, decline late 2015 anticipate gdp growth pick above-trend pace. look well beyond horizon, demographic change loom large play increase role discussion labour market developments. a we’ve suggest number occasions, time likely availability workers, jobs, main concern.8[8] and world, one imago real wage might grow little rapidly otherwise, order encourage participation. 8 see stevens g (2014), “economic condition prospects”, speech american chamber commerce

bi central bankers’ speech 1 luis m linde: monetary policy follow great recession presentation mr luis m linde, governor bank spain, papeles de economía issue: “monetary policy follow great recession”, fundación de la cajas de ahorros, madrid, 13 june 2014. * * * let first thank funcas kind invitation inaugurate presentation issue review papeles de economía española dedicate “monetary policy great recession”. in address i briefly review predominant view crisis. i discus crisis affect consensus. finally, i shall conclude think two change which, result foregoing, already take place monetary policy conduct: structure interaction macro-prudential policy role unconventional monetary tools. before crisis before crisis, low inflation, low price volatility high degree economic stability attain advance economy enable certain consensus forge essential component successful monetary policy be. monetary policy would delegate independent central bank whose remit saw maintenance price stability main objective. this objective, turn, could translate explicit goal term inflation targets. to fulfil mandate, central bank would confine control short-term interest rate. it intervention would transmit real economy three main channels: long-term interest rate, inflation expectation financial asset prices. the credit channel play secondary role. indeed, macroeconomic model use central banks, private bank sector would play marginal role, all. the assumption financial market efficiency self-regulation mean credit central variable. the consensus prevail also that, order ensure financial stability, suffice supplement price stability regulatory micro-prudential supervisory policy action gear ensure strength individual credit institutions. in step concept, role monetary policy face potential risk financial stability would confine clean repair damage risk ultimately materialised. the federal reserve’s measure follow burst “dot.com” bubble illustrate type conduct. the crisis from summer 2007 and, all, follow lehman brothers’ debacle september 2008, crisis break generate severe global economic contraction since great depression. among side-effects, crisis oblige u revise much previous consensus monetary policy. it would however unfair ignore fact that, specific monetary policy realm, discordant voice year back raise objection predominant model. in particular, bank international settlement maintain since early 2000s that, specific circumstances, central bank conduct face severe risk financial stability would pre-emptive reactive. simply put, damage wield financial crisis might great price stability slippage present would 2 bi central bankers’ speech warrant exchange prevent future, serious deviation might prove difficult costly reverse. the bank international settlement also assert combination price stability-oriented monetary policy merely micro-prudential supervisory policy ensure stability financial system whole. in connection third tool needed: macro-prudential supervisory policy. while still early draw economic policy lesson arise experience crisis, i believe certain necessary change discerned. among these, need pursue macro-prudential policy one evident implications. macro-prudential policy the crisis demonstrate previous combination monetary policy micro-prudential policy insufficient shore stability financial system whole ensuring, event crisis, impact real economy limited. to achieve goal macro-prudential policy also needed, must equip new objective instruments. there already agreement need new macro-prudential policy rest two level dimensions. first, cross-sectional dimension, focus control distribution risk within financial system point time. this require analysis institution interact consequence interaction system whole. the aim identify interaction global systemic significance order subject them, logically, demand soundness requirements. further, macro-prudential policy also heed time dimension, analysis aggregate risk evolve interact normal function real economy. this perspective need order design, example, measure temper procyclical tendency inherent financial system. a known, banco de españa pioneer field when, 2000, introduce dynamic provisioning. in initial stage crisis potential tool evident; however, subsequent heighten crisis also show limitations. the interaction monetary macro-prudential policy pose complex challenge central banks. theoretically, monetary policy continue focus maintain price stability; macro-prudential policy, ensure financial stability. in practice, however, action inevitably exert strong influence objective other, implication institutional design macro-prudential authority. the advantage arise coordination policy would suggest assign central bank pivotal role pursuit macro-prudential policies. this path follow date cases. thus, instance, unite kingdom sister committee set within bank england alongside monetary policy committee, namely financial policy committee. italy, belgium ireland follow similar arrangements. in country france germany, committee set participation economic authorities, central bank play important role them, actually wield veto power decision macro- prudential body relate affect field competence national central bank eurosystem. nonetheless, concentrate different occasionally conflict economic policy objective within single institution doubt make accountability complicate may make institution’s mandate ambiguous. this indeed one reason instances, unite states, option choose create institution bi central bankers’ speech 3 responsibility distribute symmetrically central bank economic authorities. this doubt complex debate unquestionable political connotations. i see advantage drawback european approach, since i believe achieve good coordination monetary macro-prudential policy ensure sufficient capacity speed response, central bank play important role design management new macro-prudential instrument measures. the use unconventional measure monetary policy implementation the second change i wish discus regard monetary policy management role dub unconventional measures. a recall, central banks’ immediate reaction first sign crisis deploy available conventional instruments. firstly, face clogged-up interbank markets, central bank directly assume task liquidity re-distribution among banks. also head conventional measures, central bank aggressively cut official interest rate prevent abrupt deep decline activity trigger deflationary process. this policy ultimately take intervention interest rate low levels. accordingly, worsen crisis make necessary relax monetary policy stance even further, central bank look unconventional instruments. unconventional measure group three major blocks: forward guidance; measure aim expand central bank balance sheet, change composition balance sheet. the use forward guidance steer inflation expectation interest rate spread among main central banks. the ecb resort last summer anchor interest rate expectations. the federal reserve and, less extent, bank england also use instrument signal intention provide great stimulus economy. unconventional measure affect size composition central bank’s balance sheet also extensively used. in euro area, october 2008, ecb change liquidity management policy, implement main refinance operation fix rate full allotment. in may 2009 lengthen average maturity period monetary policy operation set train purchase programme cover bond similar asset reactivate market segment. one year later, face qualitative leap euro area sovereign debt crisis entailed, introduce security market programme. under programme purchased, always secondary market, public debt country tension disproportionately restrict fund economies. finally, doubt viability euro reach critical level summer 2012, ecb respond announcement would, within mandate, whatever need save euro. it design new security purchase programme – outright monetary transaction programme – which, though use necessary, instrumental change expectation favourable direction market stability normalisation. conversely, unite states, change federal reserve balance sheet link massive asset purchase part standard quantitative ease programme. these purchases, far high europe, conduct express purpose contribute ease monetary financial conditions. the bank england has, respect, close federal reserve ecb. there therefore notable divergence use unconventional instrument ecb, one side, federal reserve bank england other. 4 bi central bankers’ speech these divergence reflect characteristic respective financial systems, particular predominant role bank euro area compare great significance capital market unite state unite kingdom. however, also respond different perception risk central bank assume term credibility reputation. widespread opinion fed’s strategy involve blur boundary monetary, fiscal financial stability policies. the ecb, hand, keep great distance boundary joint existence single central bank fiscal financial authority 17 independent country (18 today and, possibly, 19 january) pose particular challenge difficulties. in sum, i focus structural aspect monetary policy. i believe, nonetheless, brief think monetary policy decision adopt ecb govern council last week would go amiss. a know, broad raft measure agree last thursday cover three main sphere action ecb throughout crisis. the conventional monetary policy stance additionally ease cut official rate which, practical purposes, reach low bound. the horizon policy generous liquidity provision extend 2016. and, lastly, step take respect unconventional measure launch new, four-year, long-term refinance operation aim

research officer gratefully acknowledged. good evening, lady gentlemen! 2. it honour privilege attend important conference indian chamber commerce (icc) kolkata. from humble begin early 1920s, icc come long way presently evolve lead national chamber operate kolkata. with bank mainstay financial system, i sure deliberation conference would provide important insight attendee banks’ role get re-oriented new milieu. the conference healthy mix participant span representation government eminent commercial bankers, also people audit firm general audience. i sure diversify representation would provide vary perspective issue debate throw possible solutions. financial sector economic growth 3. banks’ primary purpose mobilize otherwise idle save purpose lend productive investments. a lot research work undertake study relationship financial sector real sector economic growth. the old model economic growth function land i.e. capital, labour, technology entrepreneurship modified. the new paradigm economic growth function save rate, return investment cost intermediation. we easily see role importance financial sector regard three factors. thus consensus finance significant impact quantity, quality ie productivity efficiency capital, jury still determine whether bank capital market drive economic growth. research opinion conclusion equally divided. very often example unite state america unite kingdom quote prove capital market drive growth. to counter that, example germany japan quote establish bank drive growth. 4. bank constitute backbone nation’s financial system, perform manifold function liquidity, maturity risk transformation. indeed, need gainsay health economy is, way, mirror reflection bank system, especially bank-based financial system ours. of course, reverse also equally true. i remind say bank like heart human body capital provide akin blood it. so long blood circulate seamlessly, organ remain sound healthy. however, reason, blood supply organ, part would render useless. not surprisingly therefore, always conscious attempt part reserve bank provide adequate liquidity credit productive sector economy. indian experience 5. india distinction long history bank capital market. economic history india narrate vibrant many important cities, though mumbai dominate others. however, slowly steadily, especially last twenty five year financial sector reforms, bank sector emerge the source investment funding. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 6. what actual contribution bank engineer investment indian economy? bank credit increase 5 billion end march 1951, 13 billion march 1961, 47 billion march 1971, 254 billion march 1981, 1164 billion march 1991, 5114 billion march 2001, 39420 billion march 2011 52604 billion march 2013. what contribution capital market years? during 1970s, capital market help raise 10 billion worth equity, bond debentures, bank extend credit worth 207 billion period. during 1980s, correspond figure 233 billion 910 billion. in 1990s, 1172 billion 3950 billion respectively 2000s 2115 billion 34206 billion respectively. in fiscal 2011 2012, 318 billion capital market 13284 billion banks. 7. actually bank extend fund way investment bond debentures. a heavily government bonds, rather issue corporates split figure readily available, i include here. 8. while lament lackluster performance capital market, redeem feature growth private placement market past twenty years. though issue thereat predominantly form bond debentures, growth size reassuring. it gain popularity mid 1990s; 1995–96 2000–01, market raise 752 billion, next ten years, help raise 7614 billion fiscal 2011–12 1012–13, market raise 2009 billion. 9. while happy bank wonderful yeoman service growth economy, happy continue depend bank finance predominant mode? be compel bank take much risk, thereby endanger depositors’ money? 10. however, take note predominant position bank indian financial system take realistic view, expect bank finance comprehensively cater type investment needs? irrespective whether short, medium long term, whether loan, debt equity financing, low, medium high risk propositions? should turn bank like universal bank germany, cater every type investment demand entire economy? 11. or, alternatively, develop capital market cater increase need investment also risky investments? like usa? 12. these set question need ponder take strategic decisions. twelfth plan 13. 12th five year plan aim usher faster, inclusive sustainable economic growth. it note today, india sustain gdp growth 8 percent year. increase 9 10 percent need mobilization investment resources; good allocation resource efficient capital markets; high investment infrastructure public ppp routes; efficient use public resources. 14. twelfth plan ambitious target investment usher high growth rate 8 percent 2012–17. it aim mobilise resource worth 5.4 trillion. the total public sector investment infrastructure envisage twelfth plan 16 trillion

eleventh plan. accordingly plan aim eclectic mix development capital market, specifically debt market, besides exhort bank finance. 15. be reserve bank, let ponder banks’ role come years. bi central bankers’ speech 3 bank sector reform 16. lead economist often cite importance sound financial sector reform central healthy bank system aid economic growth. india large country south asia extensive financial system characterize vary financial institutions, comprise bank non-banks. bank mainstay financial system bank asset comprising, average, around 70 percent gdp post-reform period. the commercial bank segment comprise 26 public sector bank government majority equity stake, 20 private sector, include 7 de novo (which become operational initiation economic reform 1991) private banks, although rbi recently do away distinction 40 foreign banks, operate branches. 17. prior inception financial sector reform 1991, indian financial system best characterize highly regulate financially repressed. the prevalence high reserve requirements, interest rate control allocation financial resource pre-designated sector adversely affect banks’ resource mobilization allocation. 18. the period 1992–97 lay foundation reform bank system. the reform comprise five major planks: cautious proper sequencing, mutually reinforce measures, complementarity bank reform associate policy (e.g., monetary, external, etc.), develop financial infrastructure nurture develop financial markets. some salient reform undertake financial system, included, among others, low statutory reserve requirements; liberalize interest rate regime, first lend side later, deposit side; infuse competition allow liberal entry foreign bank permit establishment de novo private banks; institution prudential measure (capital adequacy requirements, income recognition, asset classification provision norm loans, exposure norms, account norms) enhance disclosure level transparency annual audit statement promote market discipline. 19. over period reform begin 1992 2013, real bank asset grow compound annual rate 10%; growth rate deposit credit real terms, period roughly order 10% 12%, respectively. 20. i happy note issue deliberate today likely shape future industry, go forward. i would like take opportunity share view relate concerns, which, i see it, shape contour industry year ahead. finance infrastructure 21. the first issue, immediately come mind, issue infrastructure financing. i sure issue also uppermost mind well. inadequate infrastructure exert cascade impact economy, negatively affect productivity, employment, personal income international competitiveness costs. the 12th five year plan mention early estimate infrastructure requirement around inr 56 trillion, gradually increase role private sector. give limit fiscal headroom long gestation lag involve fructification, need rope long-term provider funds. can bank chip in? yes fact already do so. a capital market’s significance waning, bank finance infrastructure steadily grew. the outstanding bank credit infrastructure sector, stand 72 billion 1999–2000, increase 7860 billion 2012–13, register compound annual growth rate (cagr) 40 per cent overall cagr bank finance industry 20 percent period. however, kind growth general economic downturn policy conundrum result concentration risk bank (infra fund high 15% 4 bi central bankers’ speech bank books); bank saddle large scale stress asset infra segment. further, structural problem use short term nature bank fund long term funding. bank evolve midway solution, medium tenor fund 12 15 years. this, though solve initial problems, fundamentally weak arrangement recent stress period bring crack open. bank appropriately structure infrastructure lend keep view asset-liability mix; also may raise long term resources. they develop long-tenor fix rate float rate product develop appropriate hedge instrument tackle counterparty risks. takeout finance another possible solution, infrastructure debt fund (idfs). these initiative presently nascent stage, hold long-term promise. 22. over longer-term, efficient vibrant corporate bond market sine qua non ensure viable finance infrastructure. by facilitate long-term fund sector, provide much-needed debt capital beneficial borrower investor alike. this also ensure deep broad financial markets, one key pillar rbi’s financial sector policies. finance smes 23. a second issue i would like touch upon finance micro, small medium enterprise msmes, call them. in 2011–12, sector account significant proportion manufacture output 12 per cent gdp. in addition strong export orientation, also strong employment potential, provide bread- butter nearly 100 million people, perhaps next agricultural sector. with big chunk locate rural areas, also offer tremendous potential rural development. give forward backward linkage corporate sector, i view “silent” engine growth, especially slow economic cycles. 24. numerous study document that, give lack reputation tangible collateral, debt financing, mostly informal sources, comprise primary source external fund entities. give often onerous documentation requirement banks, entity tend get raw deal come bank finance. the fourth census msme reveal 5.2 per cent unit (both register unregistered) avail finance institutional sources; majority unit – 93% fact – either finance depend self-finance. a world bank enterprise survey 2011 also reinforce conclusions. the moot point credit flow msmes institutional source commensurate economic activity undertake them. 25. a rbi discussion paper 2013 propound innovative combination bank private equity, potential role state provide credit enhancement mechanisms/ solution way credit constraint. it also put forth proposal small bank provide useful role cater need segment, example, relationship banking. 26. there also oft-heard complaint banker msmes often quite lackadaisical come settle dues. it need recognise msmes often act ancillaries large industries, cash flow lumpy. the business orientation large industry often affect msmes directly, turn hamper recycle fund business operation msme units. bank need take proactive view, carefully analyze linkage msme units, sanction funds. the exist provision interest delay payment act, 1998 entity suitably modify take board unique characteristics. in addition, bank advise sanction separate sub-limits within overall limit sanction corporate borrower meet payment obligation respect purchase msme sector. the parliament pass factor regulation bill expect address delay payment liquidity problem micro small enterprises. i sure bi central bankers’ speech 5 measure contribute small measure towards alleviate extant constraint plague sector. mobilise resource 27. a seen, country need enormous resource development. how raise them? bank sector major role here, mobilize save people. a end march 2014, schedule commercial bank mobilize deposit tune 76 trillion. there 146 schedule commercial bank (including regional rural banks) country, 1.2 lakh branch undertake activity. however, support economic growth, need reach hence need bank function india. not banks, perhaps need variety banks. i talk public, private, foreign bank variety here. i talk variety function undertake, niche want excel. accordingly, reserve bank decide license banks. two license give recently. we intend offer tap basis. we work new set guideline full service commercial bank differentially license banks. we hope number players, bank sector mobilize resource fund fast economic growth, bring financial inclusion thereby support inclusive growth sustainable way. conclusion 28. i touch upon several issue contemporary relevance expect remain important quite time near future. conference offer platform interchange view structure systemic manner, whilst take consideration regional-specific concern well. i hope organizer stop one-off conference instead, arrange follow-up discussion brain storm issue ensure discussion reach logical conclusion. 29. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 juyeol lee: bank korea’s 64th anniversary speech mr juyeol lee,

system review, ottawa, ontario, 12 june 2014. * * * good morning. it pleasure hold press conference carolyn wilkins. carolyn assume post senior deputy governor bank canada 2nd may. we please today inaugural press conference financial system review (fsr). the bank publish june issue morning. an important part bank’s work promote stable efficient financial system. we number ways: provide liquidity facility serve lender last resort; oversee key domestic clear settlement systems; collaborate domestic international policy-makers develop implement policy. our research analysis financial stability vital work. since 2002, fsr flagship publication promote inform public discussion aspect financial system. this morning’s press conference extend effort. our job today help leave solid understand bank’s assessment financial stability canada, appreciation complexity analysis and, importantly, work fit think bank policy. let provide context. over two decade lead global financial crisis, consensus emerge keep inflation low, stable predictable best contribution monetary policy could make financial well-being canadians. our inflation-targeting framework always degree flexibility build it; financial stability issue always part discussion. however, crisis crystallize view financial stability outlook economic growth inflation intrinsically linked. a result, bank canada – like many central bank – reconsider good integrate financial stability monetary policy objectives. the assessment financial stability become rigorous follow structure analytical process, inform models, good data rich dialogue. this lead inform judgment around risk financial system. in issue fsr, introduce enhance framework explicitly identify underlie vulnerability canada. these pre-existing condition could amplify propagate shock canadian system, regardless originate. this set stage assess risk – event that, occurred, would threaten ability financial system perform core functions. such risk materialize trigger event interact vulnerability cause stress financial system. this add depth allow complete understand financial stability concerns. one see diverse risk cannot literally sum estimate overall level risk. nevertheless, weigh risk financial stability improve framework apply judgment, level comfort policy-makers remain similar six month ago. the clear separation cause effect – vulnerability risk – allow accurate weigh risk economic financial stability. it allow u consider integrate fashion deliberate policy. that’s assessment risk financial system relevant. and that’s we’re now. before carolyn i take questions, let note highlight today’s fsr. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the top two vulnerability relate household sector. the first imbalance canada’s house market. we still anticipate soft landing. however, stretch valuation sign overbuilding would expose financial system sharp correction house price – risk we’ve identified. the second elevate level indebtedness among canadian households. this leaf household vulnerable unemployment shock sharp rise interest rates. the third vulnerability exposure sizable potential external shocks. an example significance global commodity price economy financial system. the risk view context vulnerabilities. the important domestic risk is, mentioned, sharp correction house prices. the probability risk materialize low, give expect strengthen global canadian economic recoveries. however, happen, impact economy financial system would severe. we also focus three key risks:  sharp increase global long-term interest rates;  stress emanate china emerge markets;  serious financial stress euro area. before i open floor you, important note canada’s financial system remain robust. it continue benefit enhance policy measure g-20 reform agenda implemented, domestically globally. with that, carolyn i happy take questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mark carney: speech mansion house banker merchant dinner speech mr mark carney, governor bank england chairman financial stability board, lord mayor’s banquet banker merchant city london mansion house, london, 12 june 2014. * * * introduction my lord mayor, lady gentlemen. a year ago predecessor lord king deliver final mansion house speech, note “clear sign recovery uk, albeit modest, [was] underway.” that recovery due small part measure colleague initiate include extraordinary monetary stimulus, recapitalisation bank system innovative support lending. the task year ago secure recovery face continue domestic frailty ongoing international weaknesses. at home, unemployment underemployment remain elevated, productivity growth anaemic, debt level high. abroad, european crisis move acute chronic phase financial market demonstrate fragility “taper tantrum”. with backdrop real wage around 10% pre-crisis levels, surprise consumer confidence, though improved, remain low. business confidence similarly shake past shock current scepticism ongoing strength demand. the bank respond challenges. forward guidance give household business confidence bank rate would raise least jobs, income spend grow sustainable rates. guidance encourage business hire spend, help keep expect interest rate low, even economy recover strongly. in parallel, encourage bank continue repair balance sheets. change bank’s liquidity policy support lending. the core financial system sound foot make increasingly important contribution recovery. we face challenge turn recovery, steadily gain momentum breadth past year, durable expansion. to so, need balance. it absence serious consequences. one look back 1931 britain’s economic prospect strain high unemployment, large budget deficit deteriorate balance payments. in ensue crisis sterling force gold standard government day resigned. 2 bi central bankers’ speech and governor? with uncanny foresight central banker, montagu norman already leave scene “to get bite rest [in quebec]”, said, “for i hard time lately i well i would like be.”1 however tempting, i lean canada restoration nautical analogy describe address challenge face. rather appeal stately duchess york predecessor sailed, i look trusty canoe – craft navigate rapid treacherous waters…provided paddler work sync. those economic current flow swiftly, economy expand annualised rate 4% job grow record pace.2 but rapid ahead, old imbalance persist new one emerging. the economy still over-levered. the house market show potential overheat. and current account deficit record level. navigate hazard require close coordination boat; is, fiscal, monetary prudential authorities. tonight i want explain bank’s contribution deliver durable expansion characterise balance macroeconomy, house market, financial sector. before so, i would like join chancellor pay tribute two individuals. the first sir david lees, chairman court oversee transformation governance responsibility bank. david, i extremely grateful support first year governor. i’m also enormously grateful wise counsel charlie bean past year. always working, charlie tonight discharge duty president royal economic society. throughout career, treasury, academia bank, charlie lead thinker practitioner pursuit macroeconomic balance. internationally inspire countless policymakers, included. on behalf colleague past present, i would like echo chancellor thank charlie exceptional period public service enormous contribution make economic well-being country. macroeconomic balance the uk economy currently unbalance internally externally. internally, wasteful spare capacity – output gap – concentrate labour market. the monetary policy committee (mpc) currently estimate gap around 1–1½% gdp, though caution false precision wide confidence band around central view. the mpc’s current guidance make clear set monetary policy meet inflation target use spare capacity. this implication timing, pace degree bank rate increases. there’s already great speculation exact time first rate hike decision become balanced. it could happen sooner market currently expect. 1 a report montreal gazette, august 17, 1931. the financial time day report norman say “i feel i want bite rest, i hard time lately. i haven’t quite well i would like, i think trip good”. 2 bank staff project annualised growth 4% current quarter. that incorporate expect upward revision early official estimates. bi central bankers’ speech 3 but clear, mpc pre-set course. the ultimate decision data-driven. at point safe conclude, mpc has, remain scope spare capacity use policy tighten host labour market, capacity utilisation price indicator watch closely determine slack evolving. growth much strong unemployment fall much fast either anyone else expect last year’s mansion house dinner. so far largely match indicator suggest supply capacity labour market previously thought. a result two welcome developments, despite rapid job growth, pay pressure unit labour cost growth remain subdued.3 the mpc expect rate slack erode slow second half year output growth eas productivity growth recovers. but thus far sign deceleration output growth. and challenge decide begin normalise policy actual output observe potential supply cannot. that mpc monitor broad range indicator include coincident one behaviour wage prices. of course navigate upcoming bend river isn’t end journey. the mpc rightly stress time first bank rate increase le important path thereafter – is, degree pace increase start. in particular, expect eventual increase bank rate gradual limited. that economy face ongoing challenge public private balance sheet repair, 10% appreciation sterling past year so, mute growth main export markets. in addition, medium term, high capital, liquidity prudential requirement expect lead high spread borrow rate risk-free rate crisis. moreover, highly indebted private sector particularly sensitive interest rates.4 caution path rate increase begin also need start point interest rate cannot easily reduced. the effect excessive excessively rapid tighten monetary policy could prove damage difficult undo. perhaps reasons, financial market expect bank rate rise 2¼% next three year and, basis, mpc expect economy move towards internal balance – almost close output gap – period. just achieve internal balance enough guarantee durable expansion. it matter so. excessive reliance consumption non-tradable sectors, housing, finance borrow abroad overvalue exchange rate would prove temporarily satisfying. the uk’s current account deficit record level. the perennial trade deficit reinforce fact uk grow much fast main trade partners. more 3 in may 2013, mpc project annual growth 1.7% 2014q1, half rate estimate economy grow period. meanwhile 2014q1 outturn unemployment, 6.8%, 0.8ppt mpc’s may 2013 central projection. despite upward surprise activity, annual earn growth 2014q1 0.5ppt weak expect may last year. that contribute annual unit wage cost growth around 1ppt mpc’s may 2013 central projection. 4 private non-financial sector debt 163% gdp. around two third bank loan individual half loan business variable interest rates. 4 bi central bankers’ speech recently sharp fall return earn investment abroad lead negative 3% swing net investment income. this immediate cause alarm. a world particularly europe recovers, demand product return investment increase. more competitiveness gain past depreciation may yet realised, event, unlike much montagu norman’s time, exchange rate remain flexible. nonetheless, sustain borrow abroad consume home hardly recipe balance sustainable expansion. borrow invest, improve productivity, competitiveness income is. amidst much commentary unbalance recovery, forget business investment account quarter gdp growth past six months. the mpc’s forecast rely continue rapid growth business investment next years, lead revival productivity real wages, turn allow consumption grow without unsustainable decline household savings. create right condition investment thus essential. in world corporate caution likely require interest rate consistent guidance. the bank well aware monetary stance could encourage risk develop. for instance, evidence grow vulnerability financial markets. across asset classes, imply volatility well long-term averages. spread high yield peripheral bond market collapsed. and covenant-light loan new normal. while bank system much robust spike volatility, end investor may fully absorb extent financial reform distribute shock across financial system. this may case still water run deep – often dangerous time river. that essential counterpart monetary stance macroprudential vigilance activism. nowhere need acute house market. balance house across country, house price rise around 10% past year, approach early 2007 levels. price inflation broaden accelerate across regions. expectation price continue rise mark outside london. there sign slowdown activity, mortgage approval fall back mid-2013 levels. the bank watch closely determine extent reflect underlie slow house demand. however, likely stem lender adjust financial conduct authority’s (fca) tough new mortgage market review underwrite requirements. more worryingly, survey suggest slow could reflect would-be seller hold back property market anticipation high future price – early sign extrapolative price expectations. the underlie dynamic house market reflect chronic shortage house supply, bank england can’t tackle directly.5 since able build single house, i welcome chancellor’s announcement tonight measure increase house supply. 5 ten year ago, former mpc member kate barker estimate construction around 260,000 home year would necessary contain real house price growth 1 per cent per annum (barker, 2004). far few fact build year since – 110,000 2013. because house demand tend rise one- bi central bankers’ speech 5 to clear, bank target asset price inflation general house price particular. it indebtedness concern us. this partly over-extended borrower could threaten resilience core financial system since credit household represent lion’s share uk banks’ domestic lending. it also rapid growth high level mortgage debt affect stability economy whole. an economic expansion precarious large proportion heavily indebted households. history show british people everything pay mortgages. that mean cut back deeply expenditure unexpected happens, potentially slow economy sharply. that’s recession follow rapid credit growth tend deep long lasting. it reason bank england’s financial policy committee (fpc) mandate address systemic risk arise unsustainable level debt, leverage credit growth. in regard, uk start vulnerable position household debt 140% disposable income.6 there sign underwrite standard become lax, proportion new mortgage high loan-to-income ratio all-time high.7 the increase house price past year mean expect proportion high loan-to-income mortgage grow come year even house market begin slow. this concern durable expansion require mortgage serviceable lifetime interest rate record lows. the vulnerability associate debt build long period up down monetary policy usually concerned. in sense, credit business cycle distinct. use monetary policy target indebtedness would risk undershoot inflation target damage growth. for reasons, monetary policy last line defence financial instability. raise interest rate today would wrong response potential vulnerability tomorrow. fortunately, proverbial creek without paddle. we many use steer towards two objectives. the first ensure bank system resilient. to end, bank conduct stress test ass well major bank build society withstand sharp house market correction prolong painful recession. the result consequence flow announce late year. the second objective reduce risk excessive indebtedness take insurance. give recent experience, believe right policy wait mop for-one income, supply constraint likely put increase

hear thunder falls, wise get river. measure take insurance graduate proportionate action take sufficiently early. we limit risk tomorrow act loosen underwrite standard new mortgage lend today. the value act early reinforce uncertainty around precise impact macroprudential tools. while prove effective countries, still relatively novel here.8 by acting, assessing, necessary re-calibrating, likely

bankers’ speech 1 prasarn trairatvorakul: the asean economic community’s impact great mekong subregion’s economy keynote address dr prasarn trairatvorakul, governor bank thailand, euromoney conference “the great mekong investment forum”, bangkok, 12 june 2014. * * * excellencies, honorable speakers, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, 1. it honor back euromoney great mekong subregion investment forum. let thank organizer invite speak distinguish forum again. this conference take place important juncture eve asean economic community launch end next year. my remark today focus aec meaningful impact gm economies. also, i share think overcome challenge capitalize region’s growth prosperity. 2. the gm become one vibrant region world, transform new investment frontier. the global attention region reflect large inflow foreign direct investment, increase dramatically past two decades. accord world bank statistics, fdi inflow clmv country period increase forty-fold around 13 billion dollar 2012.1 this wealth investment opportunity underpin smooth transition market-based economies, rich diverse resource well improvement intra-regional logistics. 3. most importantly, excite time gm aec draw closer. a gm country member aec, gm significantly benefit growth opportunity aec come years. 4. with integrate market forge aec, greatly benefit gm interconnect production base. let give three key example i see materialize: 5. first, tariff reductions. much already complete here, group asean-6 countries,2 include thailand, already remove tariff almost product since 2010. the plan accord aec blueprint, see clmv countries’ tariff remove 2015. the benefit course multiply throughout production distribution chain region. the increase trade relate investment naturally spill peripheral area southern china, strong trade tie region part gms. 6. second, trade logistics facilitation. this another crucial element complement tariff reduction reduce cost time order facilitate cross-border trade. one key initiative area “asean single window”, streamline custom procedure expedite cargo clearance. owe this, cross-border trader save cost time custom clearance region-wide. 7. third, payment system linkages. what asean central bank aim enable business individual make receive electronic payment conveniently yet le costly. a prominent example “asian payment network” translate full regional atm interoperability. through initiative, asean 1 world bank website (2014) (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/bx.klt.dinv.cd.wd) 2 asean-6 include brunei darussalam, indonesia, malaysia, philippines, singapore thailand. 2 bi central bankers’ speech resident, instance, use local atm card withdraw cash machine another asean country without pay fee charge third-party payment providers. 8. we see upcoming realization aec springboard vibrant gm region. however, benefit region go beyond aec. i see point tangible outcome take place near future. 9. the first one integrate production network main industry dominate gms. we know region comparative advantage primary industry demand asean countries. this observe large inflow investment agro-industry, garment mine sectors. realize high potential sectors, also see contract farm practice laos, key commodity corn sugarcane produce use advance technology practices. 10. the point concern development infrastructure. this particularly important give lack well-developed road rail network region. country gm address various projects, main one road corridors. the north-south corridor connect yunnan china, myanmar, lao thailand completed. also, east-west corridor link vietnam, laos, thailand myanmar near completion. this make whole region closely interconnected, hence investment gm country stand benefit rest. 11. the final point demand side. the gm enjoy large consumer market base distinct need increase purchase power. the aec home 600 million people. in tandem significant rise middle class population. the asian development bank estimate share asean’s middle class expect increase 65% 2030.3 moreover, asean continue pursue close integration global economy various free trade agreements. this include china india, superpower crossroad gms. therefore, aec also important gateway, connect gm major market asia-pacific region. 12. the bright future making. the gm economy bless abundant resource promise growth prospects. with realization aec, region’s opportunity multiplied. yet remain important challenges. the bright future work overcome challenge together. i list two important challenges: first share resource expertise capitalize region’s growth. second match regional demand regional supply save investment much-needed infrastructure development. 13. on first challenge. our resource good utilize regard neighbor competitor rather partner regional production network. here, need explore new opportunity create industry cluster region take diverse comparative advantage specialization. an exist example cluster industry relate garment industry, one gm country import textile yarn another country, manufacture apparel export country outside region. 14. the second challenge concern infrastructure financing. the project i mention early cannot efficiently realize without proper fund mechanisms. what need match huge amount regional save much-needed investment infrastructure, high 8 trillion dollar next decade estimate 3 adb website (2012) (http://www.adb.org/features/fast-facts-asean-prc-and-india-great-transformation) bi central bankers’ speech 3 adb.4 to match huge demand funds, asean along china, japan korea put place several initiatives: two key project include asean infrastructure fund, pool regional save fund investment infrastructure project asian bond market initiative, develop deepen regional bond market tap regional savings. 15. to conclude, great opportunity store ahead. at end day, benefit trade liberalization infrastructure development extend u work collectively overcome challenges. the aec springboard benefit whole region, particularly gms. this whole region closely knitted, term physical connectivity also term share production networks. i believe conference today excellent platform u come together share idea towards realize long-lasting prosperity gm region. thank you. 4 adb website (2009)

board european central bank, information management network (imn) global ab conference, barcelona, 11 june 2014. * * * lady gentlemen, it pleasure 2014 global ab conference. over last year ab become major focus discussion within european policymaking circles. there grow consensus instrument see part problem could fact part solution. i therefore happy see conference agenda contain many session touch key issue think about, regulation economic growth. i sure several useful insight draw on. in remark today i would like provide ecb’s perspective securitisation market fit within overarch objectives. i also want offer proposal think stimulate european ab markets, i hope provide food think remainder conference. the eurosystem’s interest securitisation market let start ecb’s perspective. a may know, recent month ecb put great deal public focus revive european ab market. why interest particular market segment? there three part answer: price stability, financial stability, stability balance sheet. first, importantly, see ab mean end, end achieve primary objective price stability. ab provide channel fund liquidity-rich bank non-bank investor reach real economy, particular opaque segments. by stimulate credit creation, turn fee consumer prices, support transmission monetary policy fulfilment mandate. this mechanism useful stage cycle, especially environment low interest rate low inflation see today. it context govern council decide last week intensify preparatory work relate outright purchase ab market. under initiative, eurosystem might consider purchase simple transparent ab underlie asset consist claim euro area non-financial private sector. moreover, see longer-term monetary policy benefit strong ab market: firm le reliant bank finance future downturns, bank le constrain lend decision capacity hold credit risk. the second reason interest ab potential financial stability role. of course, know overly-complex opaque abs, particularly us, contribute financial instability witness 2007 2008. but i long argued, alongside policymakers, simple transparent instrument spread well-understood risk across different financial actor hence play stabilise role. a ab customised, example term asset exposure, geography, maturity, satisfy need non-bank investors, whether pension fund, insurer, asset manager. and share credit risk among non-bank sector important because, severe market disruption, correlation bank non-banks’ financial health likely low within-banking industry correlation. 2 bi central bankers’ speech finally, ecb take close interest ab important component eurosystem’s balance sheet. a end march year, 307 billion ab collateral pledged, amount 15% total pledge collateral eurosystem operations. if counterparty default obligations, eurosystem would gain ownership ab collateral would seek liquidate secondary ab market without incur loss. thus, strong interest ensure ab safe transparent asset class trade well-functioning, liquid markets. so reason ecb see ab deserve specific attention. let add, however, ecb believe ab warrant special treatment justify theoretical, empirical practical perspective. the ecb interest ab insofar help u achieve policy objective compliance legal obligations, ensure risk equivalence collateral framework. in words, support ab market end itself. if ab market benefit along way secure objectives, much better, priori favour one type financial instrument another. still, secret that, broadly speaking, european securitisation market well. market-placed issuance low, trade thin segments, size investor base recover various conservative regulation discussion. what do revitalise securitisation market context? proposal unblock european ab market much already write topic i attempt repeat argument limit time today. i would like instead offer three proposal i see important keep move debate forward. these relate regulatory treatment abs, transparency standardisation requirement treatment ab credit rat agencies. the proposal see complementary suggestion make elsewhere, include recent joint discussion paper ecb bank england. regulatory treatment my first proposal revive eu ab market find holistic approach regulatory treatment. there lot discussion various individual issue relate abs: example, excessive securitisation capital charges, transparency risk retention improvements, high credit enhancement requirements, well current liquidity rule proposals, i see overly constraining. and regulator respond make effort overhaul securitisation capital framework, categorise ab liquidity categories, finalise securitisation capital requirement insurers, reform transparency disclosure requirement instruments. in view, however, focus discrete issue cause u miss continuous dimension. there still sense regulatory agenda proceed uncoordinated manner. one example concern “high quality” treatment across regulations. the bcbs’ effort finalise securitisation capital framework end-2014 consider “high quality” preferential treatment. in weeks, however, european commission must identify ab “high quality liquid” liquidity coverage ratio. another example concern transparency requirement across asset classes. substantial effort underway improve transparency disclosure requirement ab pan-eu manner, build improvement ab transparency bring ecb’s ab loan-level data templates. yet, much effort devote improve transparency asset class substantial progress already made, cover bond continue common transparency framework indeed bi central bankers’ speech 3 common supervisory framework. nonetheless, benefit preferential risk weight capital requirement regulation – which, way, deviate basel capital framework. still another example concern capital requirement across different investors. the propose insurer securitisation capital requirement set use spread risk approach calibrate 99.5% value risk. by contrast, bank framework base credit risk approach calibrate 99.9% value risk. finally, close home, ecb, bank england, esma involve loan-level data report requirement abs, appear significant perfect overlap. one might reasonably respond coordinate approach would challenging, deadline fix legislation, difficult coordinate simultaneously global, eu, national level – especially give different mandate scope various party involve regulation. however, i believe actor present piece place go route. indeed, european commission, ecb, bank england, three european supervisory agencies, european systemic risk board, cover near totality eu ab consideration discussion moment. they also posse many legal power reframe regulatory debate holistic sequentially-sensible manner. would challenge regularly align view least eu level, speak common voice global fora? this already beginning, much could do view. transparency standardisation requirement my second proposal concern transparency standardisation requirement ab products. i wholeheartedly support disclosure abs. this ab always potential highly complex, imply much room opacity standard financial products. a i mentioned, much already achieve envisage area ab transparency: loan-level data requirements, proposal esma minimum common information ab single portal, reform mandate prospectus directive. yet could still streamline report requirements: example, ab investor report could standardise allow consistent set information provide across transaction across time. these investor report could also aligned, term data cut-off dates, loan-level data submissions. this would provide great mean market participant verify accuracy data provide issuer exert market discipline. another interest area exploration provision standardise ab prospectus templates, include common diagrams, would allow non-specialised investor great ability make comparison across products. ab course highly diverse instrument i would propose shoe-horn type single form. rather, idea provide common start template describe ab transaction could depart needed. my concern prospectus broad transaction documentation must inform legal financial specialists. some creative think present information accessible manner may help preserve legal precision avoid information overload. this would build i believe helpful esma proposal transaction summary. look forward, i believe great standardisation ab product key goal stimulate great market activity. sme abs, instance, widely acknowledge extremely heterogeneous across eu countries, part reflect type business bank relationship prevail jurisdiction. any effort could make 4 bi central bankers’ speech enhance transparency consistency ab structure could, i believe, provide great comfort investor reluctant take plunge instruments. treatment ab credit rat agency my third proposal relate treatment european ab credit rat agencies. currently many ab stress economy constrain rat correspond sovereign. the rationale put forward rat agency immitigable risk affect issuer asset particular country, sovereign. a regard calibration, quantitative many qualitative factor take account agency set ceiling. yet, i question whether ceiling appropriate. for example, i aware default greek rmbs ab transactions, despite partial sovereign debt exchange 2012. or, italy, vast majority rmbss appear constrain sovereign ceiling despite average 25% current credit enhancement. and, late check, ecb’s composite index systemic stress euro area around 5th percentile distribution since january 1999 six time low median 2010 2012. this suggest many systemic risk use justify country ceiling approach seem far off. from examples, others, i find hard believe redenomination risk drive many sovereign ceiling still justify stringent caps. moreover, i fully reassure double count take place calculations: words, country credit risk already capture credit risk assessment pool third party ab transaction. be may, i recognise rat agencies’ prerogative decide best methodology ass risk methodology change overnight. i believe nonetheless provide transparency rat derive and, particular, disclose rat absent sovereign ceiling investor could certainly help, suggest recent paper bank england. this proposal underpin conviction investor decide whether apply sovereign cap assess transaction. in fact, i would argue rat agency publish rat absent cap – whether sovereign, swap counterparty, account provider, entity – add cap build block approach, sake clarity. and, view, behove rat agency provide transparency precise methodology determine apply sovereign ceilings, give impact measure structure finance market. this point important role market participant play revive european abs. it one thing regulator improve transparency credit rat agency provide granular information; another market participant analyse trade it. for example, i recommend market participant look closely ecb loan-level data initiative. we provide much high quality information make inform credit risk assessment abs, either basis individual underlie loans, basis summary information make available respective data repositories. i realise free lunch, financial resource implication detail scrutiny. but i convince market participant “get hands’ dirty”, ab market whole benefit. this inform market participant mean great discipline data providers, le automatic reliance others’ opinions, great awareness gap transparency requirement across financial products. bi central bankers’ speech 5 conclusion let conclude. the eurosystem place great importance health european ab markets. ab important mean achieve policy objective prudent manner, could achieve either ensure applicable haircut outright purchase market. our decision intensify preparation could help catalyse new securitisation activity. but virtuous circle take hold, regulatory market barrier prevent revitalisation european ab market need come tandem. much work already on-going improve environment ab issuance. what i try outline today several practical step take take work forward. i believe holistic coordinate approach among eu policy-makers, well great standardisation methodological transparency rat agencies, could help encourage revival ab market want see. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jwala rambarran: the change face supervision feature address mr jwala rambarran, governor central bank trinidad tobago, caribbean group bank supervisor xxxii annual conference, port spain, 5 june 2014. * * * good morning, to friend caribbean beyond, i extend warm welcome trinidad tobago. for next two days, discussing, “the change face supervision”. to us, it’s catchy theme, say man street port spain, kingston, even castries, see little connection lives. but bank crash next week can’t access life savings, man street would immediately demand explanation. finger would naturally point towards government would rightfully say “talk central bank, it’s job”. the “who” blame would little comfort man street lose money. however, someone must call upon account bank failure and, course, “someone” us, central bankers. if i sound like i’m talk experience, well, know i am. follow collapse clico, large insurance company, central bank trinidad tobago, listen sentiment repeatedly last five years, know many room also deal contagion effect clico crisis send shockwaves throughout caribbean. so, i therefore want give three messages, begin conference change face supervision. 1. first, let’s consider clico contagion early warn u caribbean region. let’s look warm something even bigger, risk regional financial system ominously gather distance...this lead second message. 2. our protection gather storm change approach supervision…and finally third message. 3. the change face supervision one room. i’m go start third message first – – face supervision, represent change need occur supervision. a supervisor are, course, distinct supervision; heads, reasoning, human element, supervision essentially black white, hardly shade grey. today’s central banker long enjoy obscurity. the spotlight beam u supervisor last six years. supervision financial system task, responsibility and, perhaps times, burden, must carry countries. before 2008, typical person save account, mortgage, insurance policy, never really care keep eye people institution manage money. now scrutinize financial player themselves. no regulation, matter sophisticated, fully anticipate potential situations. a supervisor look entire financial ecosystem preside. we must pay particular attention individual tree but, importantly, branch intertwine nearby trees, form entire forest support existence. in financial ecosystem may want play fire; don’t care burn entire forest. our success, supervisors, measure managing, even better, prevent fire actually starting. when first occur, may small 2 bi central bankers’ speech fire spark quickly stamp out. such prevention is, course, much cheap billion would cost resuscitate entire ecosystem. here home, clico fire far cost taxpayer trinidad tobago us$3 billion dollars. three billion u dollars, that’s size eight neighbor economy caribbean. in trinidad tobago, us$3 billion could build twenty new, state-of-the-art children’s hospitals, build fully outfit one thousand new primary school (more double exist number primary schools), purchase medicine major hospital next decade. clico also damage confidence financial sector leave psychological scar many citizens, trinidad tobago countries, well. successful supervision happen behind scenes. it public never ever see. we never thank job, one suppose see sparks, far le smell see smoke. but save day get go home light hearts. it’s fire supervisor miss could control time bring villager run pitchfork rope fire starter us, supervisors. so third message change face supervision “you”. the word “face” give supervision human element, supervisor face supervision. so metaphorical/symbolic face supervision – yours, supervisor inspector – changing? good supervision extremely challenge often underappreciated task. at central bank trinidad tobago, two initiative support good supervision: ability act act. this intend give face supervision, supervisors, power presence . . . face good looks. we currently regulate banking, insurance private pension sector financial system, also plan supervise five systemically important financial institutions, credit union bureau de change. we re-examine area must supervise re-resourcing suit. we luxury time grow supervisor entry level season professional – process take upwards decade. the country tolerate excuse enough competent highly-skilled supervisors. we are, therefore, take pragmatic approach build supervisory capacity. we aggressively recruit experience people private sector place key supervisory position financial institution supervision department. we recruit second deputy inspector, bring highly seek chief actuary first time hire pension fund specialist, credit risk specialist anti money launder expert. the face changing. they move middle-aged central banker come ranks, specialize experience professional come private sector. we explore area currently need supervisory attention also think ahead. we continue head-hunt respect talent private sector. let ask question, “what background staff respective supervision departments?” therefore change face supervision, i’ve discuss face change go to, please allow address major changes, face supervision, supervision itself, black white. my second message change approach supervision. your approach represent one change desperately need true success, ensure spark turn rag fires. the clico crisis teach u it’s even important supervisor level keep eye ball, times. here central bank trinidad tobago, instill supervisor need intrusive. our bi central bankers’ speech 3 supervisor must long stay sideline regulate financial institutions, rely solely result institutions’ “internal control risk management systems”. over past five years, supervisory priority central bank trinidad tobago seem seriously affect clico crisis, lead legalistic approach deal supervise institutions. i find supervisor display overemphasis compliance formal letter notify institution sometimes minor breaches, which, respectful view, divert attention away important issue safety soundness institutions. for example, minute one fisd’s “breaches meetings” refer effort force financial institution address perceive under-provision doubtful accounts. these effort include consultation legal department well six letter two email affect institution. i wonder whether matter could deal one meet follow completion fisd’s analysis, institution advise make additional provision, quietly remind central bank’s legal powers. of course, i fully understand appreciate need enforcement activity ensure high standard compliance law regulation. while important, i believe important address safety soundness financial institutions, whether issue cover specific legislative requirements. without abandon compliance function, supervisor must find way balance rule discretion, free time supervision issue could cause institution fail, potentially destabilize financial system. you must move beyond compliance mentality, inspection consider thorough check boxes. you must brave look beyond, place list box tick. supervisor need move inspector investigators. so supervisor central bank trinidad tobago must stay sidelines, i may humbly suggest, i know virtually everyone room know already, all supervisor caribbean must become intrusive. look risk you. if identify suspect risk, say nothing, territory, make culpable fire starters. i know may take aback i saying, often warn stray territory peek fence jurisdiction. however, another change come supervision central bank trinidad tobago team fellow regulator sign memoranda understand work share information cover base come supervision. so come across something suspicious that’s jurisdiction, refer one, perhaps two partners, financial intelligence unit trinidad tobago security exchange commission. there cliché, time everything, overlook context conference. while gather enter discussion next two days, i want keep second message mind change supervision third message face supervision, rest you. let take first message – gather risk caribbean region. we precarious position right now. several financial conglomerate control large market share many country throughout caribbean interconnect financial institutions. please allow give three example rise interconnectedness caribbean financial sector. • the four large bank group – rbc financial, scotiabank, first caribbean international bank republic bank – control 75 percent total bank asset region. 4 bi central bankers’ speech • in eastern caribbean, many government national insurance scheme connect indigenous banks, shareholder also important provider deposits. • the sagicor financial group, large insurance network caribbean, 60 percent investment portfolio jamaica barbados, make group connect vulnerable sovereign credit risk event two countries, rat non-investment grade standard poors. the two large shareholder sagicor national insurance board barbados republic bank. this increase interconnectedness build systemic risk raise chance financial contagion spread throughout caribbean region, especially another major hurricane strike another government undertake significant restructure sovereign debt. i must remind live one natural-disaster-prone region world: six small island state eastern caribbean currency union stand term frequency hurricanes. a natural disaster expect hit eastern caribbean roughly every two half years. the caribbean also home nine small island state consider among world’s heavily indebted countries, rise probability debt default. grenada currently negotiate restructure sovereign debt, which, completed, bring ten (10) number sovereign debt restructure episode caribbean within past decade. we, therefore, cannot afford tick-box, compliance mentality. a supervisors, must underestimate gather risks. we must expand cross-border cooperation exchange information policy collaboration. remember … caribbean’s financial ecosystem stake. a i close, let encourage use opportunity discussion, talk shop. take meet seriously, give current situation discuss potential impact caribbean region. take experience return home, wise ready act. a supervisors, need remember heart financial system. we need remember real human hearts: teacher loan, market vendor save account bank, bus driver insurance policy, double vendor investment mutual fund. our duty market participants, rely us. when story told, let say you, guardian financial system, could power, protect economy region. to conclude, let reiterate follow key messages: • first, clico contagion early warn u caribbean. rise financial interconnectedness build systemic risk likelihood financial contagion throughout region. this require supervisor see whole financial ecosystem individual trees. • second, change supervision protection gather financial storms. supervisor must brave enough move beyond compliance, tick-box mentality investigators, address safety soundness financial institutions, whether issue cover specific legislative requirements. • finally, every one room must desire change face supervision. lady gentlemen, work begun. i confident continue improve learn other’s experience, apply lesson prevent another systemic financial failure caribbean future. i wish productive session hope enjoy stay. i thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 yves mersch: tackle unemployment europe – increase mobility, enhance flexibility, optimise education keynote speech mr yves mersch, member executive board european central bank, university luxembourg, luxembourg, 26 september 2014. * * * lady gentlemen, first all: congratulation doctoral students, whose graduation celebrate today! i confident bright future ahead you, stand well prepare enter labour market find job match skill – academia, private public sectors, luxembourg elsewhere. hold relevant qualification precondition receive suitable job offer. however, might always enough secure job. in several european countries, prospect rather dismal, especially young people. i aware unemployment may obvious challenge talk celebratory occasion. it is, however, major concern euro area. and i convince well-educated people like really make difference. high unemployment euro area – merely temporary phenomenon? temporary rise unemployment rate typical cyclical downswings. such cyclical increase unemployment distress affect dire consequences, tend reflect transitory downturn labour demand necessarily strong structural component. firm uncertain strength recovery unlikely invest rehire workers. at low interest rate level high labour market rigidities, firm tend favour capital intensive investment hiring. yet, development second recessionary episode europe differ observe begin crisis. during great recession, unemployment rose, shortage vacancies. however, second recessionary dip, unemployment increased, although aggregate vacancy rate remain close long-term averages. in addition, second recessionary period lead extensive, also persistent job loss euro area economies. the proportion people long-term unemployment rise substantially. this particularly worrisome, reduce chance rehired: worker unemployed long period time, skill might simply erode. long spell unemployment may thus easily turn structural unemployment. indeed, mere fact firm will hire, people will work unable find job already indicative structural factor play role. estimate suggest structural unemployment euro area, already high prior crisis, rise 17% 2008 2013.1 structural unemployment distress 1 the european commission, organisation economic co-operation development (oecd) international monetary fund (imf) use different estimation methods, result average structural unemployment estimate 8.8% 2008 10.3% 2013. 2 bi central bankers’ speech affected, substantial impact potential output long term. it essential, therefore, avoid hysteresis effect rise spell long-term unemployment. particularly country hard hit, large part decline employment attribute certain sectors. for instance, estonia, ireland spain, previously oversized construction sector downsize substantially. the spanish construction sector alone account around half job loss country since start crisis. moreover, collapse construction sector enormous impact production chain. so, number people affect – instance provide build material real estate service – estimate much great 1.8 million lose job construction sector. the result mismatch skill offer unemployed worker employer require explain vacancy filled, despite people will work. in fact, skill mismatch increase noticeably euro area seem become entrenched.2 potential solution increase high qualify employment if labour market development heterogeneous across countries, don’t unemployed simply move place demand labour higher? indeed, labour mobility powerful tool tackle high localise unemployment level alleviate emerge bottleneck faster-growing euro area economies. that labour mobility core element successful currency union. it lead good match workers’ skill employers’ demands. in economic jargon, aid factor re-allocation move labour needed, turn contribute overall growth monetary union act effective adjustment mechanism. so, europe fare term labour mobility? the free movement worker fundamental right enshrine treaty function european union. but much use citizen make right practice? since enlargement european union (eu) 2004, labour market mobility certainly risen, albeit low levels.3 [the number eu worker reside another eu country rise 4.7 million 2005 8 million 2013, represent increase 2.1% 3.3% total labour force.] the crisis boost intra-eu mobility. some study suggest migration response crisis might even strong eu unite states.4 this quite remarkable give unite state often take benchmark mobility. moreover, sizeable macroeconomic effects: estimate suggest post-enlargement mobility flow period 2004–09 increase gdp eu15 around 1%. the impact gdp major destination country migration, ireland, spain, italy unite kingdom even higher. increase labour mobility certainly good news – originate destination countries. another piece potentially good news level education migrant 2 ad hoc task force european system central banks, “comparisons contrast impact crisis euro area labour markets”, occasional paper series, ecb, frankfurt main, forthcoming. 3 oecd economic surveys: european union 2014, http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union.htm. 4 jauer, j., liebig, t., martin, j. puhani, p., “migration adjustment mechanism crisis? a comparison europe unite states”, oecd social, employment migration work papers, no 155, http://www.oecd.org/eu/adjustment-mechanism.pdf. bi central bankers’ speech 3 bring destination country improved. with highly-skilled people will move work, skill shortage destination country could compensate worker emigrate countries. at least, work ideally. what worrying, however, many intra-eu migrant worker employ skill level. the result underutilisation human capital show reform need improve efficiency cross-border mobility order fully reap benefit workers’ migration. one issue recognition qualification remain uneven across eu member states. accord recent survey5, current procedure tend cumbersome could easily replace automatic ones: 90% request submit result qualification recognised. but even qualification recognised, migrant might simply able take position match level education owe lack language skills. more train area would certainly welcome. beyond effort member state level, reform european social fund could instrumental respect. among things, objective include investment “in education, skill lifelong learning”, well measure “promoting employment support labour mobility”. it european commission member state make opportunity mobility operational programmes, language course exchange programmes. another barrier worker move one country another uncertain happen cannot find employment immediately. unemployment benefit transferable limit extent. eu law adjust accordingly need implement rigorously. the apply transferability pension rights. to summarise, adjustment mobility merely theoretical concept, european reality. however, scope inter-regional inter-country labour mobility. mobility sole answer, though. after all, employment rise firm will hire. and condition favourable. while policy-makers cannot interfere employers’ decisions, certainly provide right set eliminate barrier efficient labour markets. euro area country simply need achieve labour market flexibility compatible membership monetary union. traditionally, policy-makers focus passive labour market policies, unemployment benefit de-linked incentive find job. in view, policy complement active policies, job-search assistance target productivity-enhancing train measure foster employability. to ensure sustainable economic development, reform necessary beneficial country currently face high unemployment rates. country rapidly age population also need prepare, might soon face bottleneck labour supply. some country already confront skill shortages. just give example implications: accord oecd survey, potential gdp growth germany could decline 1% soon 2020 result age population skill shortages.6 once i meet boy say professional ambition become pensioner like grandfather. when i explain relate age, say alternatively 5 oecd economic surveys: european union 2014, http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-european-union.htm. 6 oecd economic surveys: germany 2014,

kuroda, governor bank japan, meet hold international banker association japan, tokyo, 29 september 2014. * * * introduction thank event commemorate 30th anniversary international banker association japan iba japan. the iba business association foreign banks, security firms, associate financial service firm operate japan. since establishment 1984, iba make substantial contribution economic financial development japan. i wholeheartedly honor 30th anniversary iba japan pay respect constant effort date. to start with, let look back development cross-border integration financial market role foreign financial institution play 30 year since iba japan established. then, i touch importance financial system stability central bank’s perspective, close speech briefly explain bank japan’s monetary policy management. financial globalization financial system stability the establishment iba 1984 coincide publication report joint japan-u.s. work group yen/dollar exchange rate, financial capital market issues. the report work group include liberalization of, entry foreign financial institution into, japan’s financial markets, well development euro-yen market order promote, speak, open japan’s financial market rest world. in 30 year since publication report, globalization economy financial system progress significantly. with globalization financial system grow cross-border integration financial markets, role play foreign financial institution japan quite significant. many foreign financial institution start business one another japan play lead role japan’s financial market various aspects, include adoption new financial technologies, development new markets, introduction advance risk management methods. in addition, play important role tightly link financial market across borders. the economic financial globalization proceed rapidly recent year first advance economies, involve emerge economies. naturally, development part process increase interdependence financial system different countries. in case shock market, effect spread globally immediately. that suggest financial system stability need achieve global basis, individual country. in fact, global financial crisis trigger collapse lehman brother make clear impact manifestation risk globalize market severe spread wide range areas. although japan’s financial system relatively robust crisis struck, immune crisis. look back situation, large impact japan’s financial markets. that include heighten concern counterparty risk money market, distortion price financial market due liquidity shortage, decline function cp corporate bond markets. 2 bi central bankers’ speech unfortunately, foreign financial institution cut back activity japan follow crisis. stability function financial system it become share recognition global basis that, avert reemergence financial crisis, important analyze ass risk entire financial system well take adequate measure prevent systemic risk manifest itself. it so-called emphasis macroprudential perspective. various international forum financial stability board basel committee bank supervision vigorously examine substantial reform international financial regulation. in line developments, individual country independently strengthen regulation substantially review supervisory system financial institutions. one aspect strong macroprudential approach regulatory supervisory front might clean individual problem surface process global financial crisis. the clean include ensure soundness individual financial institutions, solve too-big-to-fail problem thereby prevent moral hazard problem, avoid taxpayers’ burden resolution fail financial institutions. during past decades, financial business become increasingly sophisticate complex, financial system globalized, financial market integrate across borders. in context, pay attention another aspect, strengthen financial system whole global basis. therefore, critical bear mind interconnectedness financial institution market transaction gauge extensively overall change financial institution financial market compose financial system. on basis, also critical implement wide range initiative maintain financial system stability. in implement initiative enhance stability financial system, ignore initiative enhance function system firmly support sustainable economic growth financial side. it appear financial institutions’ role support firms’ innovation growth strategy financial side, bind become large future. financial institution play variety role encourage firms’ growth, develop new financial product correspond social changes, provide efficient settlement service risk-hedging measures, well support m&as reorganization firms. it extremely important financial institution enhance role constantly. go forward, perspective support japan’s economic growth financial side, i strongly hope foreign financial institution continue implement new initiative respond change surround environment. while take account change include financial economic globalization, bank japan continue make effort strengthen function japan’s financial market enhance payment settlement services, include development new bank japan financial network system, so-called boj-net, extension operate hours, participate initiative improve market practices, closely cooperate market participants. a macroprudential perspective central bank now, let talk issue financial stability macroprudential perspective central bank take account relationship monetary policy. monetary policy aim ensure price stability aim ensure stability financial system. however, close relationship monetary policy stability financial system. to begin with, monetary policy substantial impact price stability also financial system stability effect financial intermediation various asset prices. for example, central bank advance economy bi central bankers’ speech 3 pursue ultra monetary ease unconventional monetary policy achieve price stability respond economic downturn global financial crisis. in situation, investment high-risk asset high-yield bond emerge economies’ bond stock expand considerably backdrop decline volatility interest rates, stock prices, foreign exchange rates, well investors’ search yields. since effect monetary policy transmit real economy financial system, financial system stability basis monetary policy aim ensure price stability. if function financial system declines, effect monetary policy decline extent. if chance function financial system significantly impair due financial crisis, certain see adverse impact price stability plunge economic activity. in event, central bank cannot unconcerned stability financial system. nowadays, macroprudential perspective attract attention context regulate supervise financial institutions, new central banks. traditionally, central bank posse lender last resort function. while take form central bank lend individual financial institutions, aim secure stability financial system bail single financial institution. in global financial crisis, bank japan central bank respond rapid contraction market provide liquidity market whole open market operations, purchase asset like cp corporate bond well unlimited fund provision markets. those response often call central bank’s function market maker last resort. and also say policy clearly associate macroprudential perspective. it safeguard financial system stability deal liquidity provision individual financial institution directly decline overall market liquidity. in consider central bank’s initiative macroprudential aspect, often argue may sometimes trade-off central bank’s objective ensure price stability ensure financial system stability. that point discuss home abroad jury still out, least one point history suggest substantial imbalance financial economic activity emerge feedback loop change output gap change financial cycle reinforce other. that evident look back global financial crisis burst bubble japan 1990s. there many discussion deal substantial imbalance include bubble: extent change could gauge advance preemptive measure could taken, measure implement response imbalances. in event, recognition become widespread financial cycle could lead significant change economy whole. even normal times, important appropriately grasp condition financial system monetary policy management. analysis assessment risk financial system take point account, bank examine risk financial system establish guideline monetary policy. in establish guideline monetary policy, bank ass economic price situation two perspectives. the first perspective concern examine whether outlook economic activity price come two year suggest economy path toward sustainable growth price stability. at time, second perspective, base longer-term viewpoint, concern examine risk bank consider relevant monetary policy management achieve sustainable growth price stability. this second perspective include examination risk financial system one element medium- long-term risks. japan’s financial system currently maintain stability substantial resilience shocks. capital base financial institution adequate whole, give 4 bi central bankers’ speech accumulation capital continue amount risk bear financial institution increase slightly. development financial intermediation show indication overheat excessively bullish expectations. in future, globalization economy transformation industrial structure could lead change financial intermediation function risk profile financial system. in addition, financial economic development home abroad would affect financial institutions’ performance security investments. the effect various environmental change financial system stability continue warrant attention. analysis form basis bank’s assessment risk financial system whole semiannually publish financial system report. the next issue publish mid-october i hope chance read it. conclude remark let conclude briefly touch bank’s monetary policy management. although decline follow front-loaded increase demand prior consumption tax hike still remain weakness export industrial production, steady improvement employment income situation continue household sentiment improving. firm maintain proactive stance business fix investment corporate profit improved. the virtuous cycle income spend operate steadily household corporate sectors, japan’s economy expect continue moderate recovery trend effect decline demand follow consumption tax hike expect wane gradually. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index, exclude volatile food direct effect consumption tax hike, expect around 1¼ percent time. it expect subsequently follow uptrend second half fiscal year reach 2 percent around middle current projection period fiscal 2014 2016. quantitative qualitative monetary easing, dub qqe, far produce intend effects. the bank continue qqe, aim achieve price stability target 2 percent, long necessary maintain target stable manner. if outlook change due manifestation risk factor judge necessary achieve price stability target, bank make adjustment without hesitation. i high hope foreign financial institution continue play significant role play japan’s economy past 30 year contribute robust growth japan’s economy future. with hopes, let conclude speech today. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 timothy lane: be yet? the unite state canada global financial crisis remark mr timothy lane, deputy governor bank canada, carleton university, ottawa, ontario, 24 september 2014. * * * introduction it pleasure carleton university. it long time since i student here, i still get catch back-to-school feel september. it’s time fresh start renew energy. today i would like talk economy unite state canada economic tie evolve recovery financial crisis 2008–09 continues. i discus impact canada federal reserve’s unconventional monetary policies, canada affect policy gradually bring back normal. while risk associate process, bank canada see positive sign u.s. economy experience fresh start gain renew energy. tie bind ... sort let start tie unite state canada. we neighbours; perhaps like fourth-year roommates. economically, need strong links. over years, we’ve good time bad. we live comfortably together, provide respect other’s space. on whole, fortune link unite state work canada’s favour. our business take advantage opportunity much large market. that mean job canada. but, past several years, also remind strong tie expose u adverse force time stress. the old cliché “when u.s. sneezes, canada catch cold.” there element truth adage, go far. our economy move perfectly sync, partly structurally different: obviously, much reliant natural resources. and despite strong influence unite states, economic policy-makers canada, plenty scope follow different path. to explore tie – particularly relate field, monetary policy – let’s take close look financial crisis 2008–09, subsequent worldwide recession bumpy recovery. first, i’ll talk briefly canada’s experience period similar to, yet different from, unite states. then i’ll elaborate now, challenge face policy-makers unite states, mean canada. tale global recession the financial crisis, start overheat precariously finance u.s. house market, affect canada – trigger worldwide recession. in 2008, dramatic failure lehman brother effective, nothing else, concentrate minds: world look aby take notice. in historic display consensus, g-7 agree take whatever step require stem crisis. they low policy interest rate sharply (chart 1) coordinate 2 bi central bankers’ speech manner; flood financial system liquidity quell panic; stand behind systemically important financial institutions. these aggressive coordinate policy action prevent financial economic collapse could rival great depression. nonetheless, prevent severe protract global recession, lead period weak uneven global growth continue present day. through crisis beyond, federal reserve act aggressively unconventionally – first stem crisis and, late on, support recovery. like central banks, feed begin boldly low standard monetary policy instrument, federal fund rate, low could go. with policy interest rate low bound, federal reserve also go unusual length provide forward guidance – communicate long rate would likely stay current level and, recently, factor would take account decide start raise them. the feed also innovate introduce large-scale asset purchase (lsaps), best know quantitative easing, qe. qe provide injection liquidity stall economy central bank’s purchase financial asset government bond mortgage-backed securities. these operation pervasive effect financial market – unite state globally. they work variety channels, include push long-term interest rate external value u.s. dollar push price risky financial asset equity (chart 2). bi central bankers’ speech 3 a relate effect, operation federal reserve – together unconventional policy central bank major economy – push volatility financial asset near historically low level (chart 3). the result exceptionally buoyant financial condition suggest risk vulnerability increase financial system. but, period, return unite state sustain economic growth paramount importance. while concern qe could result runaway inflation, hasn’t happened. in fact, u.s. economy remain weak inflation mainly federal reserve’s target. that’s qe carry context widespread 4 bi central bankers’ speech private sector deleveraging financial crisis; and, despite unprecedented scale operations, still enough break economy post-crisis funk. canada: innocent bystander? here canada, didn’t homegrown financial crash. while bank canada act promptly aggressively provide liquidity keep financial market functioning, bank rescue house price didn’t plunge. this say lily pure. in fact, 2007, specialize canadian market collapse – market non-bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper (abcp). it timely forceful action public private sector situation resolve without generate wide fallout. nevertheless, recession canada painful. this mainly export collapsed. it’s three-quarters export go unite states, also link sector u.s. economy, house business investment, fare particularly badly recession. to get u period weak exports, also rely stimulative monetary policy. like unite state advance economies, low rate “effective low bound” – case, 1/4 per cent. unlike unite states, need qe, although provide forward guidance policy rate, form unconventional monetary policy, year follow april 2009. our financial system robust, easy monetary policy transmit expand credit canadian household companies. in contrast unite states, buoyant, albeit uneven, house market recession beyond. another important factor natural resource price remain elevate levels, resource industry recover quickly. these price support strong growth china emerging-market economies, slow global recession quickly pick again. the resource economy power ahead, boost disposable incomes, employment, engineer investment government revenues. canada bounce back quickly. by late 2010, pass pre-crisis peak gdp employment – recovery expansion. at bank canada, saw need get interest rate floor raise series step 1 per cent. but round disappointment challenge own. a canada’s recovery unfolded, economy become increasingly unbalanced. our non-energy exports, pick quickly, stall well pre-recession level (chart 4). economic growth become increasingly reliant build homes, mortgage rock-bottom interest rate drive indebtedness canadian unprecedented level (chart 5). that source growth increasingly tap out. and build vulnerability financial system, could spell trouble road. another disappointment that, last year, even u.s. economy begin strengthen, canadian non-energy export pick expected. why not? this puzzle much close understand – understand still imperfect. i won’t dwell topic, colleague already say lot weak export sector.1 suffice say weak export mean canada rely exceptional monetary policy stimulus even long expected. our policy interest rate stay 1 per cent since 2010. 1 s. poloz, “float loonie,” speech deliver société de développement économique de drummondville drummondville, quebec, 16 september 2014. bi central bankers’ speech 5 what effect federal reserve’s unconventional monetary policy canada period? our analysis indicate that, canada, net effect positive. the fed’s policy push market interest rate and, promote u.s. growth, add demand exports. on downside, policy may one factor put upward pressure canadian dollar. but, balance, effect positive canada. 6 bi central bankers’ speech morning america? so now, long process get back sustain economic growth? the u.s. economy expansion, private sector take lead. the headwind come deleveraging – consumer whittle away heavy debt load – abate net worth consumer improve markedly (chart 6). and process fiscal consolidation – bring federal budget deficit sustainable level – largely complete (chart 7). bi central bankers’ speech 7 but growth remain fairly modest. it’s quite clear why. perhaps uncertainty demand still hold back business decision investment. give rocky road last years, expected. while u.s. house market reviving, follow uneven uncertain path, lot room improvement. home construction well pre-recession level, excess house stock largely deplete (chart 8). likewise, room improvement labour markets, long way normal. on average, 200,000 net new job create month past three years. unemployment, spike recession, fall 4 percentage point since peak. how canada compare? since canada experience short recession, labour market condition deteriorate much, also fast recover. for instance, january 2011, canada recover number job lose recession – whereas unite state reach point may year (chart 9). but since 2011, canada create new job much slow pace unite states. similarly, unemployment rate rise much recession, come slowly – and, measure way, level unite states. in countries, unemployment rate fully capture labour market slack. in unite state canada, still elevate level long-term unemployment involuntary part-time employment, wage gain continue moderate relative historical norm (chart 10). and here, unite states, young people hard time find jobs, many drop workforce. our comprehensive measure labour market slack show le slack unite states, gap narrow (chart 11). 8 bi central bankers’ speech in all, u.s. economy improving, bump road, expansion continues. bi central bankers’ speech 9 what feed doing? it context federal reserve wind qe purchase signal plan return gradually normal monetary policy stance, start sometime next year. the precise time pace exit depend economy performing. like decisions, involve balance risks. tighten monetary policy early could plunge economy back recession. move late could let inflation take require tighten get back control. it could also result big financial imbalance which, late on, unwind, could throw inflation another downdraft. a formal difference federal reserve bank canada fed’s “dual mandate” promote goal maximum employment stable prices. this contrast bank canada’s monetary policy framework: target 2 per cent inflation. but contrast inflation target fed’s dual mandate sharp seems. when inflation expectation well anchored, bring inflation sustainably target depend mainly bring economy potential – words, close output gap. in assess output gap, condition labour market one main thing look at. last week, feed reconfirm likely end qe program next meet october. this mean feed long expect purchase additional financial asset program, gradually taper since last january. the next challenge feed unwind various element unconventional monetary policy stimulus, include ultra-low interest rates, large volume excess reserve financial system large federal reserve balance sheet (chart 12). the composition balance sheet (e.g., government bond different maturities, mortgage-backed securities) may also matter. when time start reverse policies? what right pace sequence element? 10 bi central bankers’ speech a key step normalize policy start increase target federal fund rate, currently still range 0 1/4 per cent. this accomplished, part, gradually raise interest rate feed pay excess reserves. the feed also remove excess reserve financial system, order control short-term interest rates. they introduce test-driven overnight reverse repo facility use purpose. restore federal reserve’s balance sheet normal size process likely accomplish long period. it important note, however, size balance sheet hind fed’s ability control policy rate liquidity economy. the framework outline limit risk large excess reserve could lead excessive loan creation sharp increase inflation. doe sound complicated? yes – complicated. but full confidence colleague federal reserve manage process well. how renormalization monetary policy play financial system – unite state globally? asset prices, risk spread volatility level reflect abundant liquidity provide unconventional monetary policy unite state countries, together expectation interest rate keep low level long time. while federal reserve seek guide renormalization process market readjust smoothly monetary policy bring back normal, important risk bump along way. what exit mean canada? on whole, federal reserve’s plan exit unconventional monetary policy part good news story canada. it sign sustain u.s. expansion well way. a sustain u.s. expansion – strong house market robust business investment – help non-energy exports, remain pre-recession level. a u.s. economy regain vigour, also contribute improve business consumer confidence canada. bi central bankers’ speech 11 however, policy-maker’s perspective, renormalization u.s. monetary policy act tighten canadian monetary financial conditions. the analysis indicate qe stimulative effect canada also work reverse: unwind unconventional policy tend push market interest rate canada dampen u.s. expansion. this effect would partly offset downward pressure exit would put value canadian dollar. in event fed’s renormalization play smoothly financial markets, impact canada could significant. so influence bank canada would do? you probably already anticipate answer: “it depends.” the bank canada’s goal achieve 2 per cent target inflation sustainable way, require economy run close full potential. we need ass various countervail effect context canadian economic financial condition generally. like fed, balance risk act soon stifle burgeon economic growth risk act late let inflation overshoot fuel imbalance house markets. but balance risk likely different unite states. thus, monetary policy unite state important impact canada, i want stress canadian monetary policy independent diverge fed’s policies. in fact, policy rate already high fed’s result move make four year ago response improve economic condition time. look forward, always, rate decision depend state canadian economy. preserve value money keep inflation low, stable predictable mandate. be yet? let conclude. the financial crisis 2008–09 remind u tightly link u.s. canadian economy – good worse. and economic recovery show u heal financial crisis slow often painful. the step take u.s. federal reserve, central bank close epicentre crisis, prevent crisis subsequent recession much worse. and continue support u.s. global economy long heal process. the fed’s unconventional monetary policy affect canada various channels, notably push market interest rate worldwide. by token, feed policy return normal – likely different state crisis – tighten financial condition canada. but happen backdrop strong economic growth. it’s another step away dark day great recession affirmation hard work economic reconstruction last six year take hold. bi central bankers’ speech 1 graeme wheeler: new zealand’s exchange rate – reserve bank belief level unjustified unsustainable statement mr graeme wheeler, governor reserve bank new zealand, wellington, 25 september 2014. * * * introduction in september monetary policy statement (mps) reserve bank comment that: “the exchange rate yet adjust materially low commodity prices. it current level remain unjustified unsustainable. we expect significant depreciation, reinforce monetary policy u begin normalise”. similar sentiment level exchange rate “unjustified unsustainable” express 24 july ocr review. the september mp note economy appear respond policy measure take bank past year would prudent undertake period monitor assessment consider policy adjustment. nevertheless, expect policy tighten need ensure objective policy target agreement met. this article discus exchange rate strong, reserve bank belief level exchange rate “unjustified unsustainable”, impact high exchange rate broad economy1. it also look episode exchange rate correction new zealand, draw possible implication future exchange rate adjustment. what drive current strength exchange rate? the new zealand dollar exchange rate exceptional level compare history. the trade weight index (twi) 90th percentile calculate historical data. relative u dollar, japanese yen euro exchange rate 90th percentile. it close 90th percentile sterling australian dollar. there sound reason new zealand dollar strengthen recent years. three factor particularly important stimulate demand new zealand dollar denominate assets. first, rise export commodity price lift new zealand’s term trade late last year high level since 1973, 40 percent average level 1990s. china’s expand urbanisation grow demand protein drive much this. china new zealand’s main export destination, increase share new zealand’s export 5 percent 21 percent past decade. second, investor also attract broad strength economy high interest rates. over past three year new zealand’s annual gdp growth 1.3 percentage point high average advance economies2. the differential new zealand’s ocr policy rate advance economies, order 1½ – 2 percent since 2009, begin widen late 2013 market 1 the concept “unjustified” part reserve bank’s exchange rate intervention assessment. for detail reserve bank new zealand’s intervention framework see eckhold, k hunt, c (2005)“the reserve bank’s new foreign exchange intervention policy” rbnz bulletin march 2005. 2 base imf’s 36 country classification world economic outlook database. 2 bi central bankers’ speech factor prospect ocr increases. country cumulatively produce around two-thirds global output policy rate zero 1 percent, rate close zero. meanwhile, reserve bank increase ocr 1 percentage point period march july 2014. third, relate previous point, weak uneven recovery advance economy see many central bank adopt unconventional monetary policy low bind short-term policy rate reached. central bank large advance economy keep policy interest rate close zero inject usd 6 trillion liquidity global financial markets. this inflate price financial real assets, depress yield compress spread risk assets. yield 10 year sovereign bond germany recently all-time low, france spain reach 250 year low bank england’s policy rate low level since bank’s inception 1694. the subsequent “search yield” investors, couple excess liquidity low level financial market volatility, generate substantial portfolio inflow new zealand put upward pressure exchange rate. an additional factor exert upward pressure exchange rate many year persistent gap save investment. over past forty year new zealand demand investment housing, infrastructure asset domestic save could finance. new zealanders’ relatively high propensity spend mean interest rate need high elsewhere achieve similar inflation outcomes. the high interest rate also need fill domestic save gap attract save foreigners. this effect put upward pressure exchange rate. unjustified unsustainable when assess implication current strength weakness new zealand dollar, bank focus two broad concept – whether exchange rate unjustified whether unsustainable. the bank examine real effective (or trade weighted) exchange rate make assessment. this correct nominal effective exchange rate difference relative price (or relative unit labour costs) new zealand major trade partners. it good measure overall competitiveness nominal exchange rate. an exporter’s competitiveness determine nominal exchange rate, also cost business relative foreign competitors. figure 1 show movement new zealand’s real effective exchange rate since 1964. the current level real effective exchange rate well 50 year historical average. the level real effective exchange rate consider unsustainable clearly deviate long-run equilibrium. that is, exchange rate would expect settle business cycle factor fully dissipated. the long run equilibrium exchange rate consistent external balance long term, give certain assumption regard term trade, domestic world growth rates, interest rates, external debt level etc. persistent deviation equilibrium likely result external debt ratio eventually become unmanageable misallocations resource inhibit country’s long term growth potential. the bank consider real effective exchange rate unjustified level real exchange rate inconsistent economic factor typically explain movement business cycle. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the bank us range short term economic model ass whether real effective exchange rate unjustified. these model normally explain much cyclical fluctuation real exchange rate. for example, economic variable commodity prices, house price relative interest rate account much movement deviation real effective exchange rate long term average level. it important note cyclical variable necessarily underlie cause movement real exchange rate. they proxy broad consideration strength economy expect return invest new zealand investor compare international investment alternatives. even allow new zealand’s economic outperformance relative advance economies, new zealand’s real effective exchange rate level justified. in particular, real exchange rate adjust materially recent downward movement commodity price – factor normally best explain movement real exchange rate. since july, bank estimate real effective exchange rate depreciate around 3 percent. since 11 july 2014, nominal cross rate usd depreciate around 7.5 percent. global dairy price fall 45 percent since february 2014 fonterra cut milk price $8.40 per kg milk solid 2013/14 season forecast $5.30 per kg milk solid current season. dairy farm income season expect $5 billion low – equivalent 2.2 percent decline national income3. despite this, august, new zealand’s real effective exchange rate 1 percent high february 2014 level. 3 dairy export account almost third new zealand’s annual merchandise exports. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the bank’s analysis indicate real exchange rate well sustainable level also level justify short term business cycle factors. other institution also consider new zealand’s real exchange rate unsustainable. in may 2014 imf suggest new zealand’s real effective exchange rate 5–15 percent level consistent medium-term fundamentals4. the peterson institute washington dc assess effective real exchange rate 15 percent sustainable level, high 34 currency reviewed5. unjustified unsustainable important consideration assess whether exchange rate intervention feasible. another consideration whether condition foreign exchange market conducive impact exchange rate. the economic impact high exchange rate the elevate exchange rate affect economy many ways. the appreciation new zealand dollar help low inflation tradables sector. annual tradables inflation negative much past two year result global oversupply manufacture goods, fall capital good price high exchange rate. this boost real disposable income consumers. the high exchange rate also make cheap firm obtain capital good access new technologies, provide incentive improve productivity. through channel high exchange rate help spread benefit elevate commodity prices. however, high exchange rate continue significant unhelpful headwind non-agricultural trade good sector restrict export earn encourage import domestic tradables production. it impose high cost firm force exit re-enter market due large movement competitiveness. it impact hard export firm experience high international price products, manufacturer business compete foreign imports. an unsustainable real exchange rate diminish tradable sector’s profitability affect investment employment decisions. it also result small desirable tradables sector. international experience indicate country enjoy sustain rapid rate economic growth generally significant growth contribution competitive tradables sector strong international trade linkages. new zealand’s past experience elevate exchange rate since float new zealand dollar, new zealand experience four major exchange rate cycles, include current cycle. each previous cycle notable unjustified unsustainable real effective exchange rate follow initial depreciation rapid correction (table 1). on average, exchange rate reach peak, peak-to-trough decline occur 13 quarters. the average total decline 28%, average decline first year 11%. 4 imf staff report 2014 article iv consultation new zealand. 5 petersen institute international economics, policy brief 14/16. bi central bankers’ speech 5 several factor lead depreciation real exchange rate late eighties. the share market crash 1987 initiate period deleveraging new zealand economy compound strong rise oil price 1990 downturn global economy 1991. the asian crisis key driver exchange rate depreciation 1997. the downward pressure currency exacerbate series drought 1997–1999 financial shock russian debt default collapse long-term capital management. the new zealand dollar decline significantly 2007, global financial crisis. the failure lehman brothers, subsequent crisis u global financial market drive significant downturn demand new zealand’s export damage business consumer confidence. conclusion our model work indicate real effective exchange rate level justify cyclical economic variable current level unsustainable long term. the nominal twi currently 4 percent historical high reach july 2014. this decline twi small relation 45 percent fall global dairy price since february 2014. we expect significant depreciation exchange rate result weaken price dairy log exports. past experience suggest new zealand dollar begin depreciate unjustified unsustainable level, ultimate adjustment large. some reflect limit overall liquidity new zealand dollar markets, potential price discontinuity overall investor sentiment change markedly investor cut exit position volume. several factor could cause change financial market sentiment. these include deterioration global risk appetite result adverse economic geo-political shock, decline new zealand’s commodity export prices, slow new zealand’s china’s economic growth, strong indicator economic growth us. under current u outlook, federal reserve expect start raise interest rate second third quarter next year. a strong outlook u economy would likely trigger great investor flow u dollar expectation federal reserve would begin tighten sooner. 6 bi central bankers’ speech in reserve bank’s view, combination factor make new zealand dollar susceptible significant downward adjustment come six nine months. such adjustment would welcome bank move towards sustainable exchange rate level. bi central bankers’ speech 1 amando m tetangco, jr: convergence divergent world speech mr amando m tetangco, jr, governor bangko sentral ng pilipinas (the central bank philippines), aci phils-fmap-ihap-mart-toap joint general assembly, makati, 23 september 2014. * * * introduction last time i address general assembly, i little “word association” game you. i don’t know many recall that, i last year highlight fact often, word hear different mean us. often, individual “positions” market. in words, adage “where stand depend sit” true among you. last time, i highlight bsp’s desire get everyone page, wherein word would mean thing. because clearly ideal situation common understand make effective efficient bsp policy implementation. this year, i game anymore. rather, let focus two words. can anyone hazard guess two word would be? any guesses? the first word the first word divergence. i choose word late, become quite important word describe remarkable feature current global economic environment. first. divergence growth path among major economies. we see u continue sprinkling/sputtering positive economic indicators, eu japan still struggle economic growth gain traction. second. divergence current growth path emerge market economy previous forecast growth path economies. eme growth broadly slow early anticipate growth trajectories. together, two “divergences” important implication speed manner global growth rebalancing policy normalization. third. divergence monetary policy stance among aes. major central banks’ policy rate remain historic lows. but feed keep phrase “considerable length time” statement, raise expectation future path target rate (i.e., infamous dots). it also reiterate exit plan – state depend data developments, could raise target rate sooner early expected. my sense market take statement feed relatively hawkish tone, therefore usd supportive. particularly market would contrast statement against: 1. ecb action offer liquidity directly bank tltro (which, subsequently receive weak take-up banks), and, 2. boj prepare qe. 2 bi central bankers’ speech this apparent divergence monetary policy posture among aes necessarily bad situation. it give market comfort global liquidity dry anytime soon. in bsp, refer “countervailing forces”. but also give u cause pause… sentiment could well lead perpetuation low volatility financial markets. for disparity expect direction policy among aes, disparity transpire very, low level interest rates. with forward guidance provide fed, eu well japan, help reduce uncertainty interest rate changes, low volatility may actually lead investor complacency. this lead fourth divergence. the possible divergence “true state” global economy financial system low volatility financial market portraying. those “around block” time (i see number front row!)… you witness serious episode market stress often precede unusually low volatility, oftentimes signal gradual build-up risk-taking. what current global backdrop divergence mean us? for domestic markets? our monetary policy stance – reason behind our last policy action speak issue. keenly aware domestic market, i.e., industry associations, extremely reactive u rate movements, bsp act “pre-emptively” expect rise u interest rates. lady gentlemen, i maintain time that, early, measure action superior belated, large, discrete re-actions. the latter could create volatility market general, p/l particular. therefore, prepare eventual feed “lift-off”, may wish also consider make gradual, non-chunky adjustment portfolios. let spend minute speak current stance monetary policy. the bsp do number thing past months. we raise reserve requirements, hike sda rate, rrp rate then, recently, sda rrp rate together. these response various factor achieve follow results: 1. to rein domestic liquidity growth. m3 growth 30 percent 18 percent july year. we expect m3 growth continue deceleration path reach normal level late year.; 2. to help manage financial stability risk over-all low

addition, survey private sector economist show inflation forecast precariously close upper end target range. this particularly true forecast 2015, ng target low 2–4 percent. further, forecast also higher. we see 2014 inflation average 4.48 pct, previous 4.33 pct, 2015 inflation average 3.79 pct, previous 3.72 pct. while reason cite heighten inflation expectation due supply side pressures, elevate expectation need address sooner rather later. these could fuel second-round effects, may difficult arrest set in; 4. to reduce possible financial stability impact extend period negative real interest rates. right excess liquidity system, industry doesn’t seem mind much real interest rate negative. but lady gentlemen, tide turns, project may “approved” base specific expect value may provide “return” anticipated. with mind, policy action aim help manage risk appetites. give fundamental reason series bsp action far, market expect bsp go forward? a i always said, bsp remain watchful. we keep ear grind eye price financial stability mandate. and remain flexible use available tool enhance tool kit, include strong external liquidity position. validate position strength

more. we ask quite often: do really now? in response, i ask remember decade half ago. i believe quite presidential table already then! a year remove immediate impact asian financial crisis, philippine strong enough devastate jurisdiction around u strong enough deem resilient. before so-called tequila crisis philippine figure several publication among “most likely jurisdiction” fall next. during years, change also introduced. back then, question also raised: do reform now? the point matter reform inconvenient introduce change change need managed. the strength see around u industry by-product calibrate change. and central monetary authority, every intention continue enable operate environment within context pro-active culture risk management financial governance. the point, lady gentlemen, “position strength” cherish today result reforms. this reward introduce facet change needed, even unpopular so. but end, cannot standard make difference. instead, recognize market – large extent although absolutely always – conduct prudent professional manner. it combination prudential governance market conduct get u far. a community, clearly value it. it best interest sustain also find way

exercise leave u short breath. whether pro-active effort intervention address parochial concern, intention make u good require deliberate effort. there short cut cannot easy win long term competitiveness objective. strength achieved, granted. reform consciously lay out, wantonly enforced. our effort therefore need converge towards purposeful reforms. if value see around u industry today, let u actively find way improve operate environment. we vest party future collective interest. this message i would like share today. be part pro-active change. reform never convenient. but, right mix, make u better. indeed, must find convergence divergent world operate in. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mark carney: put right idea practice speech mr mark carney, governor bank england chairman financial stability board, institute faculty actuary general insurance conference, wales, 25 september 2014. * * * introduction it honour invite address today. insurance core new bank england. a regulator, task ensure safety soundness uk’s insurance company protection policyholders. to discharge responsibilities, draw entire resource bank. fully one third regulatory staff – 200 supervisor 50 actuary – engage supervise insurance companies. but start. our supervisor support hundred credit risk analysts, score monetary policy expert macro-financial analysts. a central bank responsibility monetary financial stability, view asset liability side balance sheets. and highly active participant global financial reform, influence measure reshape global system. in actions, recognise importance insurance economy. the uk insurance industry make major, direct contribution: £25bn annual gdp 300,000 high-paying job include many 14,000 member institute & faculty actuaries. it major exporter 30% premium earn overseas. and lloyd’s market underline london’s status world centre insurance excellence innovation. but economic contribution insurance go much deeper. by spread manage risks, increase resilience corporations, investor financial institutions. it make entrepreneurship trade viable. and safeguard company individual peril could otherwise shoulder. from financial system perspective, insurance company play vital role efficient allocation capital. by match long-term save investment, finance infrastructure essential build economy. the long-term perspective insurance company diversify financial system reinforce resilience. the contribution uk insurance industry can’t take grant – especially macro-financial environment challenge traditional business models. challenge macro-financial environment of course, relative recent past, economic outlook much improved. the uk experience strong growth g7 past year. job creation quick record. inflation fall target past five years. with many condition economy normalise met, point interest rate also begin normalise get closer. in recent month judgement precisely raise bank rate become balanced. 2 bi central bankers’ speech while always uncertainty future, expect interest rate begin increase. we pre-set course, however; time depend data. moreover, precise time first rate rise le important expectation that, rate begin rise, increase likely gradual limited. why bank expect case? in part, headwind face economy likely take time die down. demand major export market remain muted. public balance sheet repair ongoing. and highly indebted private sector likely particularly sensitive change interest rates. over medium term, several dynamic likely keep rate low past. uk rate could restrain continue imbalance global save investment, together potentially low rate global productivity growth. central bank also expect accommodate low risk-free rate high spread likely result new regulatory requirements. all factor likely mean that, even spare capacity use up, bank rate need materially low past order keep economy operate potential inflation target. the bank well aware prolong period historically low interest rate could encourage risk develop. in uk, big risk associate house market, last spring bank take graduate proportionate actions. we also alert possibility financial market may mispricing risk. a fsb conclude last week, “there increase sign complacency financial markets, part reflect search yield amidst exceptionally accommodative monetary policies. volatility become compress asset valuation stretch across grow number markets, increase risk sharp reversal.” in circumstances, insurers’ prove ability look short term volatility invaluable. nevertheless, abrupt correction term risk premia could sharp impact valuation security mark market reduce effectiveness availability proximate hedge strategies. more fundamentally, squeeze margins, persistently low interest rate challenge business models. insurer feel pressure side balance sheet: mute investment returns; long-term obligation policyholder – common life firm increasingly relevant general insurer periodic payment order book – become expensive today’s terms. an understandable response would move towards le traditional type investment – infrastructure; new complex type business – like telematics pricing; new geography like emerge markets. all strategy bring new risk must well understand prudently managed. low rate encourage inflow external capital sector like reinsurance. in effect, “soft cycle” financial market reinforce “soft cycle” insurance – particularly problematic combination. more capital boost market capacity, also test underwrite discipline. put right idea work a supervisor, bank england monitor closely new risk manage business model evolving. bi central bankers’ speech 3 at time we’ll implement reforms. reform promote resilient insurance sector without stand way effective insurance sector, without impose unnecessary impediment ability evolve business model response challenge i described. to borrow theme conference “putting right idea work”. today i want highlight three them: • tailored, consistent robust capital standards; • hold right people account; • global standard globally systemic insurers. with right ideas, promote resilient, innovative insurance industry support real economy. right idea 1: tailored, consistent robust capital standard the first right idea implement tailor consistent capital standard ensure safety soundness insurers. resilience unexpected loss require risk-based capital standard robust valuation practices. the uk’s individual capital adequacy standard deliver one reason uk’s insurance sector weather crisis well. the bank england want principle behind icas apply widely possible; establish level play field possible. that support solvency ii. it embed across europe core principle necessary sound regulation, namely: • appropriate market-based valuation methodologies; • comprehensive measure risk solvency cover group activities; • capital resource appropriate quality absorb loss. solvency ii big change insurance regulation generation, live year. while share history icas mean uk insurance industry relatively well placed, must underestimate scale challenge. even standard formula, nine ten uk insurer use determine solvency requirements, significantly advance solvency i approach replaces. although demanding, work ensure standard formula impede provision long-term finance real economy. step take make solvency ii accommodative securitisation. and parallel, bank england work european central bank remove impediment revitalisation securitisation markets, include push revision regulatory requirement bank development simple, transparent consistent products. where standard formula good fit firm’s risk profile, firm ask consider develop partial internal model; make application undertaking-specific parameter; adjust underlie business model. many room acutely aware demand solvency ii model approval process. 4 bi central bankers’ speech this rigour purpose. the danger use poorly design model make clear bank sector. so bank won’t hesitate withhold approval inadequate opaque models. model must base appropriate data account quantifiable risks. board responsibility ensure model remain appropriate show use practice. of course, risk-based capital standard models. model never rely upon circumstance isolation, substitute sound judgment. solvency ii recognise three-pillar approach – supplement modernisation quantitative regime new supervisory review, governance, risk management transparency requirements. these requirements, pillar 2 3, build coherent framework future. tool like scenario test own risk solvency assessment therefore fundamentally important. by think risk could harm future solvency – possible response stress – orsas promote protection safety soundness insurance firms, provide insight overall financial stability. right idea 2: regime hold right people account the step-change regulatory standard solvency ii several implication industry. risk professional like central role play build models; use expert judgment marry quantitative qualitative assessment risk; make technical subject matter accessible boards. your work vital make new standard reality thereby establish stronger, consistent standard resilience across eu. but amidst work embed new regulatory standards, must forget responsibility run insurer rest board senior managers. this lead second right idea put practice: people run insurance company clearly hold accountable actions. it clear part financial sector, link seniority accountability become blur even severed. the parliamentary commission bank standard recognise recommend new regime senior-most manager banks, ensure accountability. the principle underlie regime widely relevant. those individual run financial institution act integrity, honesty skill regardless whether work global investment banks, regional build society general insurance sector. solvency ii recognise imperative. it require firm regulator monitor fitness propriety staff key responsibility insurance sector. a consequence, bank england work regulator develop regime key people industry. that doesn’t mean extend bank regime indiscriminately. for one thing, unlike banking, statutory provision apply “reverse burden proof” insurance sector. in develop regime tailor insurance also consider particular skill role matter. this include central role actuaries, one important bi central bankers’ speech 5 function specifically recognise solvency ii. in 18th century london, title “actuary” often interchangeable chief executive. it’s role back entrepreneurship science; ensure premiums, reserve capital prudent; scan horizon new risk opportunities, mean mind include life general insurance actuary within scope update fit proper regime individual insurance. by include profession new regime, recognise importance skills, range contributions, personal propriety. late year consult regime include senior actuary – alongside ceos, chairman chief financial risk officer – senior manager regime, make directly accountable firm run, decisions, actions. these senior person expect prove fitness regulator take role, onus ensure risk understood, measure properly considered. right idea 3: global standard globally systemic insurer while much progress make home front, focus global reform agenda since crisis put third idea practice: common global standard systemically important insurers. the goal work increase systemic resilience; prevent spillover failure insurer wide financial sector real economy. policymakers agree traditional insurance activity need source systemic risk. indeed, recent event demonstrate three reason insurer good able withstand crisis financial institutions. first, underwrite cycle generally correlate business cycle; second, inherent resilience business model take long-term view, third, insurer’s production cycle invert collect premium today view pay claim tomorrow. this model reduce liquidity risk immunise insurer risk run. insolvency take time manifest, wind-down happen historically orderly. give that, might ask: concern systemic risk insurance? the answer simple: the financial crisis lay bare action individual insurer – like aig – broad spillovers; insurance market – like monolines – systemic, insurance sector play systemic role diversify financial sector thereby reinforce resilience. aig extreme case systemic insurer. that sorry experience highlight need understand activity insurer engaged, include occasion substantial business beyond boundary traditional insurance. regulator group activity “non-traditional” “non-insurance” – include business involve extensive use market instruments, like derivatives, instrument engage substantial maturity transformation. where type business carry scale across borders, risk system substantial. the crisis also show particular insurance market affect systemic stability. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the monolines demonstrate sub-sectors excessively concentrate undercapitalised amplify shocks. the failure multiple insurance company response economic stress disrupt provision critical economic functions. it also suddenly transfer risk part financial system may ill-equipped manage them; shift asset around way amplify spread distress. a i say previously, insurance sector systemic positive way. insurance company different risk bear capacity many financial institutions. they play stabilise role deploy fund long time horizons, manner le vulnerable sudden outflows. the resilience large insurer therefore important safeguard positive contribution global economy. the start point application global standard identification systemically-important insurers. more four-fifths assessment rest extent non-traditional non-insurance activity firm’s business model interconnectedness wide financial system. nine firm designated. it vital systemic insurers, like systemic bank financial market infrastructure, resolve event failure without need taxpayer support without disruption wide financial system. that’s development resolution plan top priority. nonetheless, give externality failure systemic insurer, course preferable probability failure lower. that’s systemic insurer subject high global standards. the high loss absorbency requirements, develop iais, ensure activity systemic insurance group – especially non-traditional, non-insurance activity – back appropriate minimum level capital resources. give patchwork capital standard across major jurisdictions, first step towards apply heighten resilience requirement development basic capital requirement – internationally comparable capital measure act baseline additional resilience. last week cairns, fsb approve final bcr proposal present g20 leader brisbane summit november. it simple factor-based, contain common valuation approach, capture activity insurance groups. this important milestone – one take u towards embed right idea increase resilience insurer capacity impact global financial system. i look forward continue support iais build progress put practice overall package requirement systemic insurer 2019. and need support develop, time, international capital standard apply internationally active insurance groups. our aim nothing le standard embody principle underpin icas solvency ii. conclusion the idea i’ve describe today vital preserve positive role insurance financial system real economy. bi central bankers’ speech 7 these idea – tailor capital standard promote level play field; framework hold right people account; global standard globally systemic insurer – need practice. the bank know reform implement business model evolve need regulatory approach regularly reviewed, adjust necessary; take account evolve financial conditions, product innovation change markets. robust interaction industry essential ensure right idea put action now, future. the institute & faculty actuary heart insurance industry 150 years, change regulation, industry world around u mean contribution essential ever. have right people put right idea work never important. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: interview lithuanian

cold” absolutely true aftermath dramatic collapse lehman brother autumn 2008. we see sign recovery unite state unite kingdom, still see euro area. doe worry you? what missing? i sure i agree last part. the euro area has, fact, recover since second quarter 2013, economy return growth six quarter recession. it true, however, recovery seem lose momentum recently: flat gdp read second quarter 2014 disappointing. accord preliminary information receive summer, economic condition somewhat weak expected. overall, however, expect modest growth second half year continue expect euro area domestic demand support various factors. these include accommodative monetary policy stance, favourable finance condition structural reforms, sustain private consumption investment. at time, unacceptably high unemployment continue weak credit growth likely curb strength recovery. there clear risk sight: particular, heighten geopolitical tension could dampen business consumer confidence. furthermore, risk insufficient structural reform could weigh business environment. how uncomfortable cocktail high unemployment (11.5% july) ultra-low inflation euro area (0.3% august, i.e. far ecb’s target below, close to, 2%) overcome? how, all, europe avoid stagnation scenario face japanese economy decades? we see japanese-style deflation euro area, number factor differ distinctly japan 1990s. firstly, we, ecb, take decisive action early stage crisis, continue so. most recently, backdrop persistently weak inflation outlook, slow growth momentum subdue monetary credit dynamics, decide early september adopt number additional monetary policy initiative complete complement measure already announce june. on basis current information, expect inflation remain low levels, gradually increase 2015 2016. furthermore, inflation expectation declined, particularly short maturities, measure underpin firm anchor inflation expectation line aim maintain inflation rate below, close to, 2%. additionally, comprehensive assessment stress test rigorous thorough; mean banks’ balance sheet problem deal necessary transparency provide health european banks. this contrast pronounce balance sheet problem japan

essential government conduct fiscal adjustment growth-friendly. economist politician lithuania sometimes voice concern economic benefit part euro area offset rise cost euro, e.g. implementation single supervisory mechanism, contribution member state european stability mechanism, etc. what would response 2 bi central bankers’ speech concerns? why lithuania need part euro area despite costs? join euro area free lunch: entail significant obligations, many benefit time. the obligation state clearly treaty eu regulations. in respect, compare country join first wave entry, lithuania advantage join strong euro area. the euro area painfully recognise flaw original design take major step repair them. there tough rule fiscal policies, strong oversight macroeconomic imbalances, lender last resort sovereign form european stability mechanism, soon sound integrate bank sector thank creation single supervisory mechanism. the euro area go difficult initial learn phase, new member reap benefits,

fall outside mandate ecb. a regard economic effects, recent crisis concern ukraine consequent imposition sanction russia far limit spillover effect euro area economy, either via trade financial links. however, baltic state finland likely feel negative effect euro area economy owe strong trade tie eastern neighbours. but economic risks, i would like add european “family” provide safety net partly

bank italy, iea-isi strategic forum 2014, final roundtable “accounting long-term cost recession”, rome, 23 september 2014. * * * 1. the legacy great recession many multifaceted; affect current cyclical developments, may also permanent bear economies. however, today’s difficulty opportunities, well tomorrow’s prospects, result deep underlie force already reshape function world economy well great recession began. a. crisis legacy economic growth 2. in advance country u uk, gdp (imperfect indicator may be, especially face increase role digitisation) overtake pre-crisis level: however, growth rate remain low 2008. in euro area whole, current gdp still remain pre-crisis level, might return late next year. it also underline weak recovery long confine exclusively stress country area. 3. what worry crisis may leave last scars. the high correlation increase estimate output gap since 2007 fall (estimated) growth rate potential output suggest low investment high unemployment (or under-employment) may impact extend well beyond current cycle. 4. this particularly worrisome country high public debts, whose sustainability require return steady economic growth, may also suffer, presently case euro area, excessive disinflation. and structural reform accommodative monetary policy much demand days. 5. that legacy crisis go well beyond short term best epitomize ongoing talk risk hysteresis (the extent cyclical development affect economy’s longer-term dynamics) revival (by larry summers) alvin hansen’s 1930s hypothesis secular stagnation. in essence, hypothesis relate factor generate permanently high save low investment, context monetary policy unable reduce real interest rate require (negative) equilibrium level zero low bound. 6. a second version secular stagnation hypothesis, focus demand side, contend productivity-boosting innovation already invented. critic version reply underline digital revolution yet deploy effect productivity potential frontier research field robotics genomics powerful. b. technological progress labour market 7. this bring u role technology, major structural force change world economy well great recession: globalisation demographic trends. 8. the labour market best see intertwine structural change effect crisis. the latter result dramatic increase unemployment: although u uk labour market recovered, unemployment rate back around 6 percent, euro area unemployment remain slightly peak levels, 11.5 percent july 2014. in italy unemployment rate 2 bi central bankers’ speech double 6 12 percent since 2007. youth unemployment shoot 20 40 percent. 9. furthermore, also broad tendency advance country employment rate decrease. between 2007 2013 employment fall u 72 67 percent work age population; italy 59 56 percent (from 25 16 percent among youth). 10. the critical point, policy perspective, extent rise unemployment structural rather cyclical. in principle, fight former difficult sustain aggregate demand, normally imply reallocation labour across sector (and countries): many displace worker may find skill long demand aftermath crisis. long-term unemployment euro area double pre-crisis level, 6 percent workforce. globalisation technological progress erode labour demand europe. 11. in last two centuries, technological progress generate widespread wealth new employment opportunities. product innovation automation may cause job loss innovative sector short term, quickly create new employment opportunity economy whole, virtuous sequence cost reduction productivity increases, income growth, increase demand new good services. 12. today, however, recognize great benefit society whole technological progress generate long term, distinctive property innovation trigger digital revolution emphasized: high speed new technology tend reduce use labour, major impact, qualitative quantitative, employment. in words, “technological unemployment” place among various drive force behind currently high unemployment rate sluggish wage income developments. 13. new information communication technology complementary managerial intellectual job provide substitute routine jobs. the ict revolution resulted, u countries, polarisation professions, job increase concentrate either low-paying service sector high-paying, highly educate job positions, expense middle-skilled jobs. furthermore, expectation automation future lead new wave technological revolution area robotics genomics also artificial intelligence development may challenge demand lower- higher-skilled jobs. 14. give country’s specialisation traditional products, italy far suffer impact globalisation, ensue surge competition emerge markets, rather technology. but italy course immune challenge pose technology. a frequently cite 2013 study oxford university economists, carl frey michael osborne, estimate 47 percent current job u would risk automate possibly decade two. by apply risk computerisation generate work data european employment, estimate recently extend european country recent paper bruegel’s fellow jeremy bowles. with caveat suggestive exercise necessarily requires, italy find among country large number job would vulnerable computerisation: 56 percent versus 51 percent germany, 50 france, 47 uk. we may yet see full impact technological innovation. c. investment 15. this consideration must see substantial slowdown accumulation capital since crisis erupted. public private real investment fell italy 30 25 percent, respectively, 2007 2013, well already high average 20 percent record euro area whole. bi central bankers’ speech 3 16. despite low interest rate allow accommodative monetary policy, widespread uncertainty prospective demand growth deleveraging over-indebted firm hold back private investment. in stress euro-area countries, difficulty compound limit access credit, balance sheet repair bank sector, increase cost capital, owe financial fragmentation. fiscal consolidation often imply massive cut public investment, may cast shadow potential future output. 17. investment linkage today’s demand tomorrow’s supply. revive investment – public private, national european – would thus go long way towards address cyclical weakness structural challenge future potential growth. indeed, suggest inter alia barry eichengreen, lack investment infrastructure, education train another possible source secular stagnation. d. conclude remark 18. in many respects, travel unchartered territories. refocus economic policy sustain aggregate demand, particular stimulate investment, necessity. on hand, force technological progress imply much capital accumulation may save labour inputs. be legacy great recession outcome engrained trends, traditional policy tool appear increasingly ineffective. 19. central bank devise new innovative way respond crisis. much close attention pay responsibility monetary policy financial stability and, generally, interaction possible conflict policy foster price financial stability. macro-prudential policy feature highly agenda financial authorities. with policy rate major advance economy virtually zero low bound, unconventional monetary policy increasingly considered. 20. yet, main challenge pose development real economy. it must exercise ingenuity. the business environment must make conducive private investment. and investment infrastructure return high policy agenda. in euro area, policy aim keep cost capital low, develop capital market source finance complement bank loans, implement structural reform improve expectation favourable aggregate demand go forward, reduce policy uncertainty. 21. in italy, urgent intervention safeguard legality efficiency public administration. to repeat i say last may conclude remark bank italy’s meet shareholders: “corruption, criminal activity tax evasion undermine community also distort behaviour economic agent market prices, reduce effectiveness government action, increase tax burden duty, restrict productive investment job creation. well-functioning public administration improve operation market competition, reduce firms’ costs, reflect quality cost public service thus tax burden. the efficacy reform depend it.” 22. these policy action eluded. for effective, must see part fully-fledged strategic reason prospective function economies. more generally, try good understand challenge pose structural technological change, question fundamental address. among them: how education system adapt enable teach skill essential keep new technologies? how enable displace worker

speech 1 narayana kocherlakota: on objective monetary policy speech mr narayana kocherlakota, president federal reserve bank minneapolis, economic club marquette county, marquette, michigan, 22 september 2014. * * * thank david fettig, terry fitzgerald sam schulhofer-wohl assistance remarks. introduction thank generous introduction, thank invitation join today. this second trip marquette since become president federal reserve bank minneapolis five year ago, i’m glad back. i’m plan spend time today talk objective monetary policy. a hear, fomc make great progress formulating, communicating, objective monetary policy public. i discus progress move idea committee make improvement along lines. i look forward questions, well – i always learn lot q&a sessions. before i start, though, i must remind view i express today necessarily federal reserve colleagues. federal reserve system basic let begin basic federal reserve system. i like tell people feed uniquely american institution. what i mean that? well, relative counterpart around world, u.s. central bank highly decentralized. the federal reserve bank minneapolis one 12 regional reserve bank that, along board governor washington, d.c., make federal reserve system. our bank represent ninth 12 federal reserve district include montana, dakotas, minnesota, northwestern wisconsin upper peninsula michigan. eight time per year, federal open market committee – fomc – meet make monetary policy. all 12 president regional federal reserve bank – include – governor federal reserve board contribute deliberations. however, committee consist governors, president federal reserve bank new york rotate group four presidents. i’m one four president year. in way, structure fomc mirror federalist structure government, representative different region country – various president – input fomc deliberations. this basic federalist structure long history. in fact, year centennial open 12 reserve bank start work undertake federal reserve system. it’s fascinate hundred years, many twist turn along way. i’m sure many question journey. the answer question – probably – website feed create federalreservehistory.org. i encourage visit site learn people, place event shape federal reserve history. i won’t say much feed history – perhaps relief you! – i want draw attention one thing i think change federal reserve’s history: communication public. a hundred year ago, congress create system design specifically resident main street would voice monetary policy. technology change lot since 1914 – i’m tell didn’t even smartphones back – way gather 2 bi central bankers’ speech information main street changed. but fact-finding still important part make monetary policy. indeed, tomorrow, i meet upper peninsula business leader gather exactly kind information. communication two-way street, however. during past century, federal reserve’s communication public monetary policy action also evolve greatly. the pace change especially rapid eight year chairman bernanke’s leadership. so, federal reserve system plan second century, i would say importance two-way communication key lesson system’s first century. in order feed continue effective, need communicate policy decision transparently public. conversely, also need public’s input policy affect them. event like one today, meet business leader tomorrow, key part foster two-way communication. with background mind, let turn back fomc make monetary policy. i mention fomc meet eight time per year. at meetings, decide level monetary stimulus economy. i won’t get many detail term “monetary stimulus” means, although i’m happy take question later. for now, i’ll note fomc change level stimulus, action tend push inflation – is, rate growth price – employment direction. raise level stimulus put upward pressure inflation employment. low level stimulus put downward pressure inflation employment. i turn main theme remainder speech: goal fomc seek achieve vary level monetary stimulus. congressional mandate the natural start point discussion monetary policy goal federal reserve act, law congress create feed define purposes. through federal reserve act, congress require federal reserve make monetary policy promote effectively goal maximum employment, stable price moderate long-term interest rates. most economist believe feed achieve first two mandate (maximum employment stable prices), would automatically achieve third (moderate long-term interest rates). hence, monetary policymakers unite state usually describe dual mandate: promote price stability maximum employment. congress’ short, overarch description federal reserve objective foundation current monetary policymaking, address many specifics. in january 2012, key milestone evolution fed’s communications, fomc adopt long precise description long-run goals. i’ll call short pathbreaking document “framework statement”. it contain number important idea – indeed i encourage american read entire statement – i’ll stress three main elements. the first element framework statement explicitly translate word “price stability” longer-run goal 2 percent annual inflation rate. here, term “inflation rate” refer specifically personal consumption expenditure (or pce) inflation rate. this measure rate increase price good services, include relate food energy. the adoption explicit 2 percent target mean american public need guess long federal reserve’s inflation intention – either upside downside: 2 percent goal. second, framework statement discus challenge provide similar fix goal employment. it quite rightly emphasize monetary policy prime determinant maximum employment, even long run. the committee’s policy stance base ever-evolving assessment maximum level employment medium long term. my assessment long-run unemployment rate, consistent 2 percent bi central bankers’ speech 3 inflation, currently 5 percent – assessment fall greatly past 18 months. finally, framework statement describe committee weigh two mandate – promote maximum employment promote price stability – one another. importantly, stress that, point view monetary policy, two mandate typically complementary. a i note earlier, monetary policy push employment inflation direction. but, turn out, shock push employment also tend push inflation medium run. hence, monetary stimulus design raise employment also help fomc pursue inflation objective. i think point often underemphasized popular discussion monetary policy. the statement note may case mandate complementary – mean inflation expect target unemployment rate expect unduly high. the framework statement explain that, circumstances, fomc use balance approach two mandate formulate monetary policy. in early speeches, i’ve discuss language detail. in view, language imply fomc will allow inflation run 2 percent time facilitate fast decline unemployment rate. possible improvement fomc’s framework statement the framework statement adopt fomc january 2012. it reaffirmed, minor word changes, january 2013 january 2014. however, minute january 2014 meet note fomc participant saw come year appropriate time consider whether statement could improve way. i concur: the time right consider sharpen fomc’s statement objective several ways. the minute note two possible change along lines. i’d like explain, express support for, these. first, i believe fomc clear inflation objective symmetric. many observer emphasize need keep inflation rise 2 percent. but view, inflation 2 percent much problem inflation 2 percent. the central bank canada also 2 percent inflation target. it language symmetry pretty clear, least central bank communication go: “the bank equally concern inflation rise fall target act ... order bring inflation down, push back up, 2 percent.”1 in view, fomc use similar language characterize inflation objective. why i see symmetry important? without symmetry, inflation might spend considerably time 2 percent 2 percent. inflation persistently 2 percent target could create doubt household business whether fomc truly aim 2 percent inflation, low number. this kind unmooring inflation expectation would reduce effectiveness monetary policy mitigant adverse macroeconomic shocks. another way improve fomc’s framework statement would describe clearly mandate goal maximum employment price stability link financial stability considerations. many observers, include fomc participants, note stance monetary policy could affect buildup risk risk sensitivity financial system. for example, sometimes argue current low interest rate policy design stimulate economic activity also encourage household corporation 1 “monetary policy”, bank canada, may 29, 2012. 4 bi central bankers’ speech accumulate large amount debt. we saw 2007 kind leverage, undertake sufficient magnitudes, potential create risk employment inflation. two possible improvement the two issue i’ve mention – symmetry inflation objective role financial stability – note discussion previous fomc minutes. in view, two possible improvement fomc’s statement long-run goal yet mention minute deserve committee study. first, i believe fomc consider articulate benchmark two-year time horizon return inflation 2 percent goal. (two year good choice benchmark monetary policy generally think affect inflation two-year lag.) right now, although fomc 2 percent inflation objective long run, specify time frame achieve objective. this lack specificity suggest appropriate monetary policy might engender inflation far 2 percent target year time thereby create undue inflation (and relate employment) uncertainty. relatedly, lack public timeline goal sometimes lead lack urgency pursuit goal. i believe that, fomc publicly articulate reasonable time benchmark achieve inflation goal, committee would lead pursue inflation target even alacrity. some might argue kind time horizon impractical. in fact, many central bank incorporate similar time benchmark. for example, bank canada typically make monetary policy choice inflation rate project return 2 percent within two years. i say “typically” – certainly situation bank canada choose policy inflation project return target slowly (sometimes take long three years) rapidly (sometimes quickly 18 months). but continue treat two year benchmark, sense feel compel explain choose different time horizon. the second possible change framework statement deserve study consider target price level, oppose inflation rate. i’ve discuss benefit price level targeting, relative inflation targeting, length prior speeches. the relevant issue somewhat technical, i don’t plan talk today. however, i’m certainly happy talk two kind target q&a period anyone interested. conclusion the federal reserve exist hundred years. no organization last long without ability evolve response change conditions. the federal reserve exception. the change public communication monetary policy especially notable. the release framework statement monetary policymaking january 2012 key milestone evolution communications. but i glad that, indicate january 2014, will consider amend statement possibly substantial ways. we always learn communicate policy good ways. thank listening. i look forward take questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 encik abu hassan alshari yahaya: continue effort combat money launder terrorism finance malaysia keynote address mr encik abu hassan alshari yahaya,

concurrent session late morning. money launder serious global problem money launder serious global problem. at global level, international monetary fund (imf) estimate extent money launder 2% 5% global gdp. accord unite nation office drug crime (unodc), translate 800 billion 2 trillion u dollar current gdp. unodc acknowledge margin figure huge agree even low estimate underline seriousness problem. money launder directly link crime crime largely motivate money. in malaysia, period 2011 2012 alone, total amount investigate serious crime law enforcement authority stand rm13.1 billion. this amount potential launder system. we recognize actual extent money launder difficult measure. certain type crime may even reported, let alone investigated. for example, case corruption, giver

hugo frey jensen: create relation digital new (banking) world speech mr hugo frey jensen, governor national bank denmark, director’s conference danish banker association, copenhagen, 8 september 2014. * * * thank invite speak today. the head today’s conference – “creating relation digital new (banking) world” – show bank strength resource look forward year shadow financial crisis. this positive whole tally danmark nationalbank’s assessment economic situation general condition bank sector. the danish economy recover difficult years. admittedly, recent figure show small decline gdp 2nd quarter, view large context, activity grow since end 2012. it important stay focus underlie trend become hypnotise quarter-on-quarter fluctuations. decrease north sea oil output reduce overall production years. if factor disregarded, value add danish economy 2 per cent high 2012 – rising. the increase activity also reflect labour market, employment pick last year so. employment develop steady pace production. a result, productivity development little jerky, quite normal danish economy. a economy improved, pressure danish bank gradually eased. but bank suffer repercussion crisis several bank still struggle low return equity. the sector ample excess liquidity cover, reason danmark nationalbank phase temporary measure introduce boost banks’ liquidity. these include option raise 6-month loan danmark nationalbank pledge sector company share credit claim collateral. the financial crisis over, leave mark. above all, crisis reduce number bank denmark. a chart shows, amplify trend evident many years. in monetary review 4th quarter 2013, examine productivity cost efficiency financial sector. in term cost-to-income ratio, denmark seem differ comparable countries. the figure indicate resource consumption within sector yet fully adjusted. in addition, future slope graph show number bank denmark could well depend bank manage tackle challenge pose today’s theme – increase digitalisation. *** competition cooperation new world bank await u also affect role danmark nationalbank. a case point future participation danmark nationalbank jointly own infrastructure companies. i could also mention issue danmark nationalbank’s oversight financial infrastructure – include area heart today’s conference: competition non-banks field payments. 2 bi central bankers’ speech in denmark, long tradition share solution leverage economy scale network effects. this reflect e.g. joint ownership core company within financial sector, often danmark nationalbank co- owner. this mean user – customer – also owners, general operation company place hand board director represent owner – typically people like me. when company set up, natural way things. it ensure various stakeholder say, precondition full support. in addition, company focus primarily service danish owners, mean business competition issue limit scope. but time form ownership come mount pressure. the reason differ company company, frequent explanation include increase competition result international regulation, technological advances, undesirable tying-up capital need achieve economy scale. on balance, doubt become complex operate companies. this increase need strong managerial skills, include ability secure commercial interest company. an early example jointly own company necessary change ownership structure many year ago copenhagen stock exchange. some part process right back stock exchange reform ii, cse convert limit liability company, merger omx late nasdaq. i go detail, simply conclude no-one question need modern, efficient stock exchange, even time possible existence credit crunch discussed. foreign ownership without participation customer stakeholder prevent stock exchange raise capital – contrary. more recently amid much medium attention, danish norwegian bank danmark nationalbank sell share nets. this do away structure bank owner customer case also competitor nets. it eliminate number rather obvious oppose interest among company’s owner provide suitable framework operate net commercial term – ultimately benefit end user payment services: citizen firms. vp security another jointly own company undergo transition establishment independent institution 1980 conversion limit liability company 2000 operate market framework condition change radically. the single important change area establishment target2 security – t2s – future trans- european security settlement platform. at time, security sector thoroughly harmonised. so year european central security depository change national monopoly operate competitive terms. vp decide join t2s soon make number strategic choice regard position competitive environment. a i mention earlier, danmark nationalbank co-owner several jointly own companies. each shareholding history. however, i would like take opportunity emphasise danmark nationalbank’s role authority, include relation oversight financial infrastructure. our role co-owner competitive company operate commercial terms. for reason gradually begin withdraw companies. the first step take sell share nets. since danmark nationalbank acquire shares, pbs/nets develop international enterprise compete company offer advance payment solution multiple countries. it clearly long company central bank stake. furthermore, want beyond reproach relation performance oversight tasks, also comprise nets. bi central bankers’ speech 3 another jointly own company danmark nationalbank point divest share bk cash service. danmark nationalbank bank establish bk order support secure supply cash. we response several serious robbery disclose need raise level security relation cash handling. at time, number security standard lay down, must observe cash-in-transit companies. together come long way term meet new standard – get there. when that, main objective danmark nationalbank’s co-ownership bk fulfilled. we still consider security aspect lay requirements, danmark nationalbank long natural co-owner company like bks. but jointly own company simply abandon bks. there still plenty work done. in due course, danmark nationalbank retire group owner orderly manner. *** now let turn potentially increase role non- bank field payment come years. there clear trend. danmark nationalbank’s payment instrument – cash – become le le important. cash share retail turnover dive sharply years, trend set continue. bank still account vast majority payments, come new payment solutions, banks’ product – mobilepay swipp – get attention. but widespread popularity solution show dynamic area could rapidly undergo significant changes. a recent report danish payment council make broad distinction two category non-banks could become significant player field payments. one firm receive payments, see advantage offer customer solutions. there several reason firm choose launch payment solution, case desire provide optimum customer service, thereby boost turnover. the category comprise wide range non-bank provider payment services. their payment service vary considerably, common feature service include deposit accounts. the provider often rely exist account structure payment solutions, possession customers’ fund point payment process primarily want collect data – make profit actual payment transactions. non-banks offer payment service currently regulate e-money payment service directives. these two directive lay rule e-money payment institutions, respectively. a major objective type institution increase competition area. some year directive come force conclude still payment e-money institution denmark – still strongly position field payments. another – potentially extensive – legislative initiative proposal european commission allow third- party access execute payment via bank account approval customers. this proposal present last year analyse payment council. the analysis result number recommendation danish views, especially relation security aspect give third party access bank accounts. precisely issue security hence user trust may decisive factor determine success non-bank solutions. and underestimate competitive value trust banks. user typically strong trust bank 4 bi central bankers’ speech solution – believe fund secure protected, solution work data misused. a survey conduct danmark nationalbank last year, 1,300 dane ask view various payment methods, etc., confirm this. one question extent respondent trust public authorities, bank others treat personal data discretion. a see, dane seem great faith data security bank firms. other survey others perform show trust – along price convenience – actually determine customers’ choice payment solution provider payment services. experience also show trust rapidly evaporate. one unfortunate experience – fund lost, solution work, breach data security – could undermine it. trust one banks’ major asset must cultivate – also come payments. this key element effort provide competitive payment solution generate value firm consumers. *** undoubtedly, high trust bank extent due regulation oversight sector public authorities. danmark nationalbank’s role relation oversight financial infrastructure enshrine danmark nationalbank act, state objective “maintain safe secure currency system facilitate regulate traffic money extension credit”. although act date back 1936 actually future-proof: distinguish cash payment electronic payments, objective today’s oversight clearly defined. the objective danmark nationalbank oversight ensure safe efficient settlement payment denmark. in term audit supervision, oversight may seem somewhat elastic, yesterday’s safe efficient solution necessarily safe efficient today. it important infrastructure – “tracks” – always prepare need citizen firm convenient, fast safe payments. example intradagclearing forthcoming straksclearing. in opinion, bank danmark nationalbank show due diligence “straightening tracks” train run faster. on top that, new, automate liquidity tool provide enhance security. this support new payment options, swipp mobilepay. without new systems, i think would increasingly difficult explain user may take several day settle payments. for retailers, straksclearing offer settlement finality credit transfers, unlike e.g. dankort payments, retailer guarantee receive first 4,000 kr. so straksclearing pave way digital development field payments. for economy extremely important electronic payment effect safe efficient manner, people faith them. like central banks, include ecb, danmark nationalbank intend strengthen oversight payment solutions. oversight target systemically important payment solution denmark, currently dankort, betalingsservice credit transfers. this support safe efficient payment – shops, online transfer fund accounts. since net danish banker association responsible payment solutions, receive letter enhance oversight. a usual, base good close cooperation. although oversight resource-intensive parties, include danmark nationalbank, i convince danmark nationalbank’s oversight payment infrastructure boost one key asset come payment – trust. bi central bankers’ speech 5 but “third parties”? can fly danmark nationalbank’s radar simply get free ride safe efficient payment infrastructure? no. if payment service acquire certain size, subject oversight danmark nationalbank. that also apply service offer countries, central bank long tradition cooperation come oversight. *** danmark nationalbank decide set credit register cooperation danish financial supervisory authority. a register individual credit information debtor, collateral, etc. improve basis danmark nationalbank’s oversight financial stability supervisory activity danish financial supervisory authority. we aware credit register involve lot work sector term establish report system regularly report information. but see credit register prerequisite danmark nationalbank’s danish financial supervisory authority’s work ensure financial stability, establishment register also help ensure denmark’s supervisory oversight instrument least good apply elsewhere europe. the euro area decide establish similar register end 2016. obviously, credit register relieve individual bank responsibility pursue prudent credit policies, market economy bank differ – also term credit policies. however, would like engage dialogue design standardise reporting, useful tool compare credit financial sector whole. we hope support work. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 peter pang: promote prudent development m-payment hong kong speech mr peter pang, deputy chief executive hong kong monetary authority, “tapping potential mobile commerce innovation” conference, hong kong, 18 september 2014. * * * distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, 1. i would like thank south china morning post invite talk excite topic mobile commerce. i. prelude – quick recap technology evolution (a) the past 2. mobile technology come long way past two decades. i recently come across article indicate upcoming technology exhibition london, futuristic smartphone put show. it offer wide range compute features, stylish screen. if carry street today, i quite sure “wow effect” le new model offer right now. 3. don’t get wrong – i talk late phone models. i talk first “smart-phone” world, ibm simon, go sale summer 1994, would put display london’s science museum october year.1 4. the model disappear market around two year launch. with limit battery life hour weigh pound, might entirely surprising. but another key reason probably – m-commerce time. (b) the present – opportunity offer m-commerce/m-payment 5. let’s fast-forward 20 year late birth first smart-phone, get back present. we witness sea change landscape e-commerce, enjoy huge benefits. 6. most smartphones much light much long battery life. but importantly, know “e-commerce” expand call “m-commerce”. it name game. 7. people long satisfy buy sell thing online use desktop notebook computers. they want virtual real world anywhere, anytime, use mobile device like smartphones tablet computers. 8. let’s face it: business take place virtual marketplace, people don’t live there. book make digital, coffee cannot. we still enjoy – need – physical good services. that’s “m-commerce” become “game changer”, fill gap “e-commerce” make portable connect virtual world real world. 9. furthermore, penetration power m-commerce significantly boost new market tool make possible combine mobile technology big data analytics. location-based “push” market mobile coupon help company attract new 1 bbc: world’s first “smartphone” turn 20, aug 15, 2014 (http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28802053). 2 bi central bankers’ speech customer encourage exist one spend more. and sort creative “apps” make “matching” process buyer seller much fun efficient. that beauty “online-to-offline”, “o2o” value chain, increasingly vital element m-commerce. ii. the hkma’s policy objective towards electronic payment 10. the benefit m-commerce confine individual companies. from macro perspective, m-commerce m-payment will, doubt, help enhance economic efficiency cut cost businesses, make payment process safer, facilitate price discovery good services, contribute directly price stability increase competition. 11. a study conduct moody’s analytics last year estimate great use electronic payment add nearly us$1 trillion global economic growth five-year span 2008 2012. that growth gdp equivalent create 1.9 million jobs. 12. in view importance electronic payment, hkma carefully consider approach adopt view dual role regulator facilitator promote healthy development electronic payments. 13. in short, adopt three-pronged approach. i) first, make priority promote adoption electronic payment means. this achieve project e-bill platform, launch last year, e-cheque initiative, schedule launch next year; ii) second, take proactive step facilitate development mobile payment services, iii) third, put place robust legal regulatory framework manage risk may arise new technologies. let elaborate second third component strategy. iii. embrace m-commerce opportunity hk 14. talk m-commerce, i believe that, “app” would guide market player search place launch m-payment business key word – “market readiness”, “policy support”, “sound regulatory framework”, choice pop app screen would likely include hong kong. let explain. (a) market readiness 15. in term market readiness, relevant statistic clearly indicate hong kong ready will embrace m-commerce. accord research, market size hong kong’s mobile commerce exceed hk$6 billion 2012, expect reach near hk$18 billion 2015.2 16. these online shopper well-equipped mobile payment. the mobile subscriber penetration rate hong kong, stand 237% may 2014, one high world. moreover, many new smartphones ship hong kong nfc-enabled. 17. thank promotional effort various payment service providers, people hong kong use make contactless payment. some statistic show among non- 2 sources: paypal consumer online mobile shop insight 2012. bi central bankers’ speech 3 cash transactions, portion contact-less transaction amount 85%.3 with technology-savvy population, huge market m-commerce merchant tap into. (b) policy support 18. now, let turn “policy support”. development policy framework mobile payment service start year back. in 2012, hkma commission consultant examine city best embrace m-payment technology, promote creativity competition, ensure sufficient protection user term prepay store value data security. the consultant make two recommendations. “soft” infrastructure – best practice 19. the first one focus build critical “soft” infrastructure. the consultant suggest hkma work industry develop set standard ensure inter-operability system security. we agree point, work proactively bank industry produce best practice nfc mobile payment, release 2013. 20. this common set technical standard lay foundation achieve security interoperability among different m-payment services. in concrete terms: i) consumer use smartphone download one payment service, different payment service choice; ii) consumer switch new network change new smartphone without disrupt continuity exist m-payment services; iii) all m-payment service provider require comply common security data protection measure conformity international standards. “hard” infrastructure – market-driven approach 21. the second recommendation consultant “hard” infrastructure. the consultant recommend hkma should, base agree standards, encourage facilitate market develop robust infrastructure drive growth. 22. international experience indicate hard infrastructure support nfc mobile payment achieve market-driven approach government-led approach. after careful consideration, decide adopt market-driven approach, several compel reasons. i) first, emerge payment technology fast-evolving. payment service provider close market therefore able make fast business decision develop infrastructure service would respond market need timely manner. ii) second, success new retail payment product service hinge personal experience individual user. here, again, market players, know good anyone else taste customers, good position develop payment product service truly fit customers’ need therefore good chance success. iii) third, domestic card association indicate early would build share nfc platform member banks, able support 20 bank 3 base statistic octopus, hkicl, hkma. 4 bi central bankers’ speech provide nfc payment services. the project would large extent achieve objective piece interoperable infrastructure. 23. so far, market-driven approach serve u well. one store value card company launch services, four banks, partnership two major card associations. by end year, share nfc payment platform i mention ready operation. iv. sound regulatory framework 24. while hong kong well-positioned capture business opportunity bring m-commerce, need legal regulatory framework address relate risks. with mind, hkma financial service treasury bureau jointly propose regulatory regime store value facility retail payment system hong kong. 25. under new framework, multi-purpose store value facility would need licence observe set regulatory requirements. for instance, must physical presence hong kong must body corporate hong kong law. the issuer must meet minimum ongoing capital requirement hk$25 million. there

monetary policy speech mr haruhiko kuroda, governor bank japan, meet business leaders, osaka, 16 september 2014. * * * accompany chart find end speech. introduction it great pleasure opportunity today exchange view distinguish gather business leader osaka. i would like take opportunity express sincere gratitude cooperation bank japan’s branch osaka, kobe, kyoto. in april last year, bank introduce quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time, time horizon two years. when i speak last november, i say qqe positive turnaround area economic activity, financial markets, people’s sentiment expectations. since then, qqe continue steadily exert intend effects. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi, exclude fresh food) minus 0.4 percent april last year qqe introduced, improve since then, recently register 1.3 percent exclude direct effect consumption tax hike. japan’s economy thus path suggest 2 percent price stability target achieve expected, although halfway there. today, exchange view you, i would like explain bank’s view current situation outlook economic activity price well bank’s monetary policy management. i. economic activity japan abroad current situation outlook japan’s economy let start discuss current situation outlook japan’s economic activity. japan’s economy continue recover moderately trend, although decline observe demand follow front-loaded increase prior consumption tax hike. the gdp statistic (second preliminary estimates) release last week show real gdp april-june quarter 2014 fell substantially rate 7.1 percent annualized quarter-on-quarter basis (chart 1). however, decline follow front-loading demand january-march quarter, real gdp grow significantly rate 6.0 percent. to exclude fluctuations, compare real gdp january-june period year july-december period last year, annualized growth rate 1.0 percent. therefore, average, japan’s economy continue grow pace potential. more specifically, employment income situation continue improve steadily, household sentiment improving, although decline follow front-loaded increase prior consumption tax hike still observed, export well industrial production show weakness. moreover, firm maintain proactive stance investment due mainly favorable business performance. in way, virtuous cycle income spend operate steadily household corporate sectors. with mechanism intact, japan’s economy expect continue moderate recovery trend, effect decline demand follow front-loaded increase expect wane gradually. next i discus household corporate sectors, respectively. 2 bi central bankers’ speech household sector: resilient private consumption in household sector, private consumption remain resilient trend employment income situation improve steadily. with regard durable good automobile household electrical appliances, recovery decline drag reflect large degree front-loading purchases. on hand, sale department store supermarket follow recovery trend average. moreover, consumption service resilient, see example food service outlay travel, effect consumption tax hike limited. although development consumption consumption tax hike vary item bad weather may adversely affect development regions, effect decline demand follow tax hike gradually begin wane whole. look ahead, employment income situation continue improve steadily, private consumption expect remain resilient. with regard household sector, claim wage increase fail keep pace inflation real wage declined, put downward pressure private consumption. on point, important distinguish increase inflation rate result consumption tax hike trend inflation. with year-on-year rate increase cpi since april year push temporarily due consumption tax hike, year-on-year rate increase nominal wage low cpi. however, consumption tax hike schedule advance, additional factor put downward pressure economic activity prices. even since tax hike april year, bank’s outlook economic activity price factor two round consumption tax hikes. while hike adversely affect real income, effect households’ spend behavior might mitigate extent confidence enhance sustainability government’s fiscal condition social security system. look recent income situation households, employee income increase 2 percent year year, exceed inflation rate, hover around 1¼ percent exclude direct effect consumption tax hike (chart 2). specifically, year-on-year rate change schedule cash earn turn positive reflect rise base pay many firm – first increase many years. in addition, special cash earn clearly rise due mainly increase summer bonuses. furthermore, number employee growing. look ahead, economy recover moderately, employment situation expect maintain improve trend, exert upward pressure wages, therefore employee income likely continue increase moderately. underpin improvement employment income situation, private consumption expect remain resilient, effect decline demand follow front-loaded increase expect wane further. corporate sector: moderate increase business fix investment turn corporate sector, industrial production recently show weakness, particularly durable goods, automobiles, construction goods, significantly affect decline follow front-loading purchases. export lack momentum due mainly delay recovery overseas economies, i explain late detail. even situation, corporate profit business sentiment favorable, firm maintain proactive stance business fix investment. in fact, corporate profit list company april-june quarter appear surpass projections. survey point favorable business sentiment, firm plan increase business fix investment – mainly investment japan – previous year. while claim growth business fix investment long expect due japanese firms’ accelerate relocation production overseas, i hold view environment support increase investment (chart 3). the reason bi central bankers’ speech 3 follows. first, result restrain investment years, capital stock become outdated hamper smooth production cases, prompt increase demand renewal investment. second, wage rise due labor shortage interest rate borrow finance business fix investment low levels. therefore, might become advantageous firm invest labor-saving machinery equipment hire new employees. third, nearly two year pass since correction excessive yen appreciation, appear japanese firm start invest improve domestic base businesses, particularly research development. against backdrop, corporate profit expect continue improve whole, virtuous cycle income spend likely operate steadily, business fix investment expect continue moderate increase trend. export overseas economy a i mentioned, domestic demand expect remain firm. on hand, external demand continue lack momentum (chart 4). this due cyclical factor include sluggishness global economy emerge economies, also structural factor accelerate relocation production overseas japanese manufacture firms. nevertheless, cyclical factor expect become favorable – particularly accelerate growth overseas economy (mainly advance economies) – export expect head moderate increase, especially high-value-added products. in fact, sign pick-up exports, uptrend external demand machinery order – lead indicator export capital good part – improve trend forecast diffusion index overseas supply demand condition product show tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan). of course, outlook export base assumption overseas economy continue recover. while concern include geopolitical risk part world, global economy likely continue recovering, lead advance economies, since economic recovery unite state become increasingly evident. in world economic outlook update publish july international monetary fund, annual global economic growth – slow 3.2 percent 2013 – project accelerate gradually 3.4 percent 2014 4.0 percent 2015 (chart 5). look individual country regions, u.s. economy, firmness household sector spread corporate sector pick-up business fix investment recently become evident. these development likely lead increase demand capital good part – japan enjoy competitive advantage – therefore deserve attention consider outlook japan’s exports. in euro area economy, disinflationary trend – see decline year-on-year growth rate consumer price 0.3 percent – matter concern. however, international markets’ view european debt problem remain stable european central bank implement series additional monetary ease measure june september. this background support view euro area economy basically continue recover, albeit moderately. in china, economy expect maintain stable growth around current pace, since government plan give due attention economic recovery, provide economic stimulus measure monetary fiscal fronts, although adjustment real estate market persisted. while emerge economy commodity-exporting country continue lack growth momentum whole, positive effect recovery advance economy expect spread gradually. in meantime, geopolitical risks, include ukraine iraq, still warrant attention. 4 bi central bankers’ speech therefore, bank’s baseline scenario overseas economy – mainly advance economy – likely continue recover, japan’s export expect head moderate increase. ii. price development japan let turn price development japan. a i mention outset, year-on-year rate increase cpi (excluding fresh food) – minus 0.4 percent april last year qqe introduce – subsequently turn positive increase around 1¼ percent recently (chart 6). these development reflect improvement output gap rise inflation expectations. the output gap improve around 0 percent – long-term average – japan’s economy continue grow pace potential trend, although effect front-loaded increase subsequent decline demand prior consumption tax hike observed. inflation expectation appear rise whole, albeit monthly fluctuations. with year-on-year rate increase cpi (excluding fresh food) continue exceed 1 percent, shift observe firms’ price-setting strategy, low-price strategy one raise sale price increase value-added. a wage setting, see annual wage negotiation spring, rise inflation increasingly take account wage negotiation management labor. this improvement output gap rise inflation expectation expect continue. therefore, year-on-year rate increase cpi, likely around 1¼ percent time, expect subsequently follow uptrend second half fiscal year reach 2 percent – price stability target – around middle current projection period fiscal 2014 2016. iii. monetary policy management toward achieve price stability target 2 percent finally, let discus bank’s monetary policy management. the bank pursue qqe, aim achieve state 2 percent inflation rate maintain stable manner. in state, inflation rate around 2 percent economy normal level. that is, firm able base decision assumption 2 percent inflation consider set price management labor negotiate wages. if economy achieved, economic entity act base expectation inflation return 2 percent sooner late – even economy face temporary downward pressure price wage due to, example, downturn economic activity. therefore, risk fall deflation, price wage continue decline, lowered. a i mentioned, japan’s economy path suggest price stability target 2 percent achieve expected. we halfway there, however, bank continue qqe, aim achieve price stability target 2 percent, long necessary maintain target stable manner. if outlook change due manifestation risk factor judge necessary achieve price stability target, bank make adjustment without hesitation. i would like conclude speech today assure that, bank’s monetary policy management, prolong deflation overcome economy base moderate inflation rate 2 percent achieved. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 5 6 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 7 bi central bankers’ speech 1 stephen s poloz: float loonie remark mr stephen s poloz, governor bank canada, société de développement économique de drummondville, drummondville, quebec, 16 september 2014. * * * introduction thank invite today. it’s great back, i guess know i change job since i last saw you. company region go difficult time wake global financial crisis – many across canada. we’re good place now, economy still back normal. so i appreciate opportunity come meet understand situation good share what’s mind. a entrepreneurs, i’m sure know global trade recover partially, world economy still work fallout crisis. compound issue exporters, course, relative strength loonie. while come past several months, still 40 per cent high early 2000s. many people room may wonder bank canada limit appreciation loonie, weaken rose. after all, say time strong export need bring economy home. in remark today, i best answer question. if i job well, leave understand it’s bad idea try manipulate exchange rates. i’ll give context explain role exchange rate bank’s inflation-targeting framework. and i talk believe need help economy eventually return home, balance sustainable growth. target inflation: bank’s best contribution canada’s economic well-being the bank canada’s mandate promote canada’s economic financial welfare. we target inflation, measure consumer price index. our target range 1 3 per cent, bank’s monetary policy aim keep inflation 2 per cent target midpoint. in pursue target, set place necessary condition strong, sustainable economic growth. a low stable inflation rate allow business consumer make financial decision confidence value money won’t erode inflation. parent put money away help child education retirement without worry inflation erase real value savings. business plan expansion reasonable forecast inflation affect need wage investment. the benefit inflation control confirm history. since adoption inflation-targeting regime 1991, inflation average close target, economic growth stable, unemployment low le variable. and, height crisis, inflation-targeting regime credibility garner year help u weather storm. rid tide global economy canada’s flexible exchange rate essential element monetary policy framework, help u ride tide global economy. 2 bi central bankers’ speech our economy open rest world. it must be, depend sale country support standard living. we diversify export sector, depend export resource advance countries. for reason, currency tend move commodity prices, turn move rise fall global demand. indeed, benefit currency ride rise fall tide global economy. it act buffer. when world economy strong, commodity price rise currency tend float facilitate adjustment economy. similarly, world economy weak, commodity price fall, currency tend float down. it’s like float breakwater across mouth harbour rise fall tides, absorb wave help keep water harbour calm. without freely float currency, prices, wage unemployment could fluctuate markedly, would create havoc people businesses. a flexible exchange rate essential u able pursue independent monetary policy interest canada. let illustrate “what-if?” scenario. back 2002, canadian dollar worth around 65 cent u.s. by early 2008, rise around parity. the world price oil $25 per barrel 2002, early 2008, price rise well $100. it would hard imagine canadian dollar stay mid-60-cent range, give rise oil prices. a i’ve say before, loose predictable relationship oil price currency – like dog master, connect one leash stretch rewind. but let’s suppose try stop canadian dollar rise reach around 85 cents, sometime 2005. the obvious way limit rise dollar would bank cut interest rates. give underlie upward pressure dollar come rise oil prices, estimate hold loonie around 85 cent back 2005 would require cut interest rate 4 per cent almost zero. a would expect, economy would two source stimulus – high price oil export ultra-low interest rates, would boost borrow spending. this combination would overheat economy 2006–08, inflation would begin rise target. we estimate inflation would approach 4 per cent 2008. a aside, let’s talk actually happen 2008 – global financial crisis. while it’s tricky introduce slice reality hypothetical scenario, worth note interest rate already near zero, clearly would room manoeuvre. but let’s set aside complication, finish “what-if?” scenario. by 2008, inflation would approach 4 per cent still rising. your companies’ cost production would rise 4 per cent more, export competitiveness would erode steadily, even though would hold exchange rate steady 85 cents. and would end story. with anti-inflationary credibility increasingly risk, bank would force action – would abandon hypothetical attempt control dollar, interest rate would rise significantly slow excessive growth economy, unemployment would increase inflation would eventually make way back target. the exchange rate would find level point, bank could target inflation hold exchange rate constant time. bi central bankers’ speech 3 although counterfactual think experiment, inform hard analysis. try hold dollar constant would give u large fluctuation unemployment, output inflation, end would help u maintain international competitiveness. it would also mean would le policy credibility come time take action financial crisis. in short, target exchange rate, would lose ability pursue independent monetary policy interest canada. by token, imagine scenario u.s. economy pick speed economy lagging. in situation, u.s. interest rate might rise time maintain inflation target would require canadian interest rate remain unchanged. if try hold exchange rate unchanged instead target inflation, would probably need match u.s. interest rate increase lockstep; would risk push inflation rate back target. again, attempt control exchange rate would mean give independent monetary policy. now, none mean indifferent exchange rate movements. in fact, closely analyze effect exchange rate movement economy. our aim, however, achieve specific value dollar. it achieve inflation target. the best place exchange rate determine markets. the market trade canadian dollar toward value consistent relative fundamental economy trade partners. this trade happen around clock, new information instantly take account multitude participants. market perfect – overreact, break time stress – best bet. some argue bank ways: use interest rate pursue inflation target, independently intervene foreign exchange market achieve desirable level dollar. this mean buy sell canadian dollar exchange u.s. dollar open marketplace. but, give depth global market, bank would need undertake truly massive transaction even small effect exchange rate. those effect would short-lived and, attempt, thwart good work market u every day. the time direct intervention market might practise would case breakdown market, case bank could offer transact either side normal trade resume – short, emergency situation market fail reason. still others suggest bank could offer exchange market verbal guidance value dollar be. behind suggestion presumption bank good understand macroeconomic fundamental drive dollar market. this difficult claim defend. our exchange rate depend host domestic foreign fundamentals, many beyond bank’s influence. good myriad effect weighed, debate wrestle deep marketplace simple statistical model develop central bank. in short, i believe markets. manipulate try guide game plan. what bank do continue clear possible see force play economy, major source uncertainty risk lie. to bring uncertainty policy dialogue, make change past year analyze talk monetary policy. our effort reflect fact business central bank adapt real time change environment. we begin put growth inflation forecast form range rather points, give even prominence uncertainty risk monetary policy report. we refine analysis financial stability risk raise profile financial system review. and, begin offer fulsome description risk enter policy deliberations. these change bring 4 bi central bankers’ speech transparency policy decision making, policy narrative shift one traditionally see almost “mechanical engineering” one characterize “risk management.” get home – natural sequence let’s talk policy narrative now. in aftermath financial crisis, export sector contract significantly. the household sector pick much slack response record-low interest rates, especially invest housing. but cannot rely policy-induced growth maintain live standard forever. the canadian economy require major rotation toward sustainable growth track. first, need substantial recovery exports, canada’s natural engine economic growth. from follow investment spend companies, accompany employment growth. all help absorb spare capacity, bring inflation sustainably target 2 per cent. and along way, gradual reduction financial stability risks, household imbalances. this natural sequence monitor carefully. it start point, critical ingredient, substantial recovery exports. where critical revival export come from? well, energy export already lead way. this main source natural growth economy today – new energy exports, new investment, new jobs. furthermore, high oil price boost income across entire country, create jobs, too. but growth energy export alone cannot make loss export experience since crisis. non-energy export also contribute, sluggish several years, least recently. after weak start year, surge non-energy export past months. about half rebound weather-related, export delay winter. but underneath fluctuation start see early sign recovery. the fact is, though, global economy remain uncertain place and, forecasters, wary serial disappointment deliver u recent years. europe obviously big question mark. nonetheless, u.s. economy appear back track show sign high investment spending, usually associate strong export canadian machinery equipment, package materials, industrial materials, business services. many sector also sensitive exchange rate fluctuations, low dollar provide additional boost foreign sales. certainly, expect see forecast come true right drummondville, always export-intensive part country. company invest diversify product line customer base position new growth. we see region’s traditional focus textile furniture give way broad range technical, value-added manufacture machinery equipment, build package materials, plastic rubber product – sector expect see lead export recovery. nevertheless, export sector struggle since well financial crisis. for them, restructure road prove long difficult, lose grind may make extend period time. we also expect see brand-new export activity newly create export firms. i’m sure i don’t remind audience many firm wipe crisis. normally, economy get back full capacity, overall population business pick firm enter export markets, create new products, new service and, importantly, new jobs. unfortunately, company population growth bi central bankers’ speech 5 sluggish since 2008, preliminary data indicate population increase 2013.the ingredient place, however, remain hopeful process resume 2014–15. all thing considered, then, cautiously optimistic export future. it take month establish trend, still long translate investment hire companies, look like natural sequence we’ve hop get way. conclusion let sum up. it simply possible fulsome discussion outlook canada’s inflation rate monetary policy without understand effect exchange rate economy. but try control loonie table, far concern bank canada. a float loon thing beauty, float loonie, least economist’s perspective. our job understand context, adjust short-term interest rate meet inflation target. that job tough enough. it job market watch economic data unfold grind implication financial markets, include exchange rate, daily basis. that, too, tough job, ours. the fact is, bank can’t job well unless market job well, vice versa. and bank work bring transparency various element uncertainty make job difficult, additional transparency help market good job. and talk – mean business people like good job, too. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: keynote speech eurofi financial forum keynote speech mr mario draghi, president european central bank, eurofi financial forum, milan, 11 september 2014. * * * summary we face set condition – low growth low inflation, high debt high unemployment – address concert action demand supply side economy. this require actor – national european level – play part line respective mandate lay eu treaties. no monetary fiscal stimulus successful accompany right structural policy – policy foster potential growth instil confidence. investment one great casualty crisis. from peak trough business investment euro area decrease around 20% since 2008, 15% 1992 recession. we see sustainable recovery unless changes. a decisive rise investment essential bring inflation would want see it,

company need access diversify source financing: launch capital market union could contribute achieve this. it idea ecb fully supports. the development market simple transparent asset back security deserve particular support. member state consider provision public guarantee support lend small medium size enterprises. there also need consistent credible application stability growth pact across

real economy. last week, govern council decide start purchase certain high-quality asset-backed security cover bond october. senior tranche ab prove high quality assets. alongside target long term refinance operations, expect measure enhance function monetary policy transmission, provide accommodation low bound, sizeable impact balance sheet. *** lady gentlemen, it pleasure tonight milan. in recent speech jackson hole, i speak need policy mix involve monetary, fiscal structural policy jump-start economic recovery euro area. we currently face set condition – low growth low inflation, high debt high unemployment – address concert action demand supply side economy. this require actor – national european level – play part line respective mandate lay eu treaties. 2 bi central bankers’ speech no monetary stimulus, indeed fiscal stimulus, successful unless accompany right structural policy – policy foster potential growth instil confidence. i would like illustrate argument focus investment, also discuss informal ecofin weekend. investment one great casualty crisis. the downturn business investment euro area since 2008 much severe early business cycles. from peak trough, business investment decrease around 20%, 15% 1992 recession. the level business investment euro area slightly improve since 2008, whereas u pre-crisis level. we see sustainable recovery unless changes. a decisive rise investment essential bring inflation close would want see it, stimulate economy, bring unemployment. so policy-makers revive investment? my main message today structural, fiscal monetary policy go hand hand euro area see investment return. let focus particular decisive contribution structural policy make. a policy mix revive investment i see two key area government action national european level help revive business investment. first, regulatory environment make favourable economic growth. second, company need access diversify source financing: launch capital market union could contribute achieve and, time, help overcome remain fragmentation financial markets. let briefly elaborate points. improve regulatory environment business activity would greatly benefit improvement regulatory environment, particular regard product labour markets. the difference member state quite strike respect wage differentiation (across worker sectors), employment adjustment rigidities, barrier entry product market ease open run businesses. for example, member state contractual dispute firm take average little year resolve, country take three years. start-ups latter country deal red tape counterpart elsewhere. another tell example relate regulate profession whose number vary considerably across euro area member state [from 45 estonia, 170 italy, 219 france 304 slovakia, accord european commission figures]. such barrier entry limit competition employment, create undue rent select detriment customers. these examples. in many cases, obstacle sap entrepreneurial spirits, especially young, innovative firm create new job highly sensitive change investment opportunities. these example show converge towards best practice euro area would mean radical improvement business environment. spain provide encourage example regard. among large euro area countries, investment spain project rebound strongly come two years, notably due combination business-friendly reform low personal corporate taxes. more recently, country also commit improve business environment. a forceful swift implementation necessary reform key order reap benefit quickly possible. bi central bankers’ speech 3 strengthen finance side a second area key relevance investment also direct interest eurofi community tonight need diversify source finance overcome financial fragmentation. until now, bank main source lend companies. the crisis show drawback over-reliance bank-centred lend model. so also need develop reliable source non-bank lending, equity bond markets, securitisation, lend insurance company asset managers, venture capital crowdfunding. this ecb fully support intention incoming president european commission create capital market union. such step would natural development single market would benefit eu member states. we believe one area deserve particular attention development well-functioning market simple, transparent real asset-backed security (abs). this would allow bank still originate loan – notably small medium-sized enterprise (smes) – preserve balance sheet capacity. in order achieve well-functioning ab market, important regulatory treatment securitisation proportional risk abs. in respect, ecb welcome effort differentiate regulatory treatment simple, transparent ab build real assets. moreover, provision public guarantee consider support lend smes, country do, us. a integration corporate bond equity market also essential overcome present fragmentation euro area ensure robust cross-border lend investment flows. to achieve this, streamline difference countries, instance, legal protection borrowers’ lenders’ right well national taxation insolvency procedures. to sum up, structural policy multifaceted often perceive political debate significant impact investment variety ways. growth-friendly fiscal policy yet area government make difference. they disposal second policy lever direct relevance investment, namely fiscal policy. company invest future confidence certainty future, medium-term fiscal path, ultimately taxes. we need consistent credible application stability growth pact across time across countries. within exist framework, government find space support productive investment, achieve growth-friendly composition fiscal policy low tax burden reduce unproductive current expenditures. in parallel, may useful discussion overall fiscal stance euro area view raise public investment fiscal space so. in regard, also complementary role play european level support rebound private investment. i therefore welcome €300 billion package announce incoming commission president two month ago. the role monetary policy let finally say word contribution monetary policy. we successfully fight confidence crisis euro raise interest rate abnormal levels. we provide euro area bank system unprecedented funding. we continuously low policy rates. now reach low bound. to ensure accommodative monetary policy stance transmit real economy across euro area equal manner, also deploy number non-standard tools. increasingly focus shift towards finance small medium-sized 4 bi central bankers’ speech enterprises, heavily rely bank finance many case struggle retain access credit. these company may small, face fund problem, big problem us, give employ around three-quarters euro area’s workforce. in june, decide launch series target longer-term refinance operation – tltros – ensure bank sufficient liquidity lend real economy. the tltros design encourage bank increase lend non-financial corporate sector. in addition, also take measure underpin specific market segment play key role finance economy. last week, govern council decide start buy high-quality asset-backed security cover bond october. we purchase exist newly issue abs, simple, transparent real sense underlie asset consist loan euro area non-financial private sector. let respond concern recently express risk pose integrity balance sheet. it worth recall senior tranche ab prove high-quality assets. accord association financial market europe, 0.12% european residential mortgage-backed security (rmbs) outstanding mid-2007 default since – compare 22.05% u rmbs. default rate consumer finance ab sme collateralised loan obligation also remain low, well 1%, throughout bad financial economic crisis experienced. a regard cover bonds, credit quality ensure double recourse (on underlie asset issuer), fact comparable double protection exist standard repo operations. overall, decision announce last week take view underpin firm anchor medium long-term inflation expectations, line aim maintain inflation rate below, close to, 2%. we expect two purchase programme effectively complement tltros enhance function monetary policy transmission provide monetary accommodation give reach low bound. the newly decide measures, together tltros, sizeable impact balance sheet, expect move towards dimension use begin 2012, govern council stand ready take action needed, compliance mandate maintain price stability. conclusion lady gentlemen, time conclude. my bottom line also start line. investment rightly say today’s demand tomorrow’s supply. yet investment europe fall short. if don’t manage get investment go again, weaken economy short run undermine prospect long run. our effort therefore focus jump-start investment. however, really crux argument, manage stimulate investment structural, fiscal monetary policy mutually reinforce other. bi central bankers’ speech 1 vítor constâncio: “we certainly almighty”– interview börsen-zeitung interview mr vítor constâncio, vice-president european central bank, börsen-zeitung, conduct mr mark schrös, publish 11 september 2014. * * * the ecb’s vice president talk power limit central bank, risk low inflation strong criticism germany bz: mr constâncio, many politician observer view power instrument ecb fight low inflation weak recovery almost unlimited, others say ecb already reach limits. do feel almighty powerless? constâncio: this indeed really interest question. but i would say neither one other: we certainly almighty, also powerless. what effect economy important. but expectation hope ecb might change tack alone overblown, yes? if one talk perspective growth true monetary policy cannot alone. it’s mostly governments, especially structural reforms. but one talk inflation different: it responsibility monetary policy reach inflation goal – fundamental creed monetary theory central banks. we cannot shift responsibility others, others help, even better. ecb president mario draghi say might difficult reach target close 2% without fiscal stimulus structural reforms. but would say inflation goal risk, ecb act, regardless others do? right, i see regard inflation. however, mr draghi also refer growth speech, i said, different. naturally, moment would help enormously politician would also deliver. if would generate growth would reduce slack economy. this would help dangerous situation low inflation. but increasingly frustrate ecb always deliver politician not, don’t you? yes, absolutely. but important acknowledge stress country do lot structural reforms, start grow again. but moment problem child france italy, refuse make reforms. of course country structural reform urgently needed. if look oecd 2013 report responsiveness recommendation structural reforms, stress country top euro area country euro average: france, netherlands, also germany. recently lot talk “grand bargain”, mean kind deal fiscal, structural monetary policy overcome crisis euro area. draghi say bargain. but would say something need moment – like japan? i think need three pillars. but time much concern independence central bank europe. so kind coordination would 2 bi central bankers’ speech appropriate. this decide decide part, president draghi mention others do. only three month historical package ecb loosen monetary policy significantly. doe mean increase worry stagnation even deflation? two thing happen since june: on one hand, decline inflation expectation across whole spectrum. it would extremely dangerous let inflation expectation de-anchor… … that mean let fall significantly target 2%... … right. not circumstance let happen. if happen would extremely difficult regain control inflation expectations. they main factor future inflation. on hand, final result second quarter disappointing. this increase slack economy downward pressure inflation. what really matter medium- longer-term inflation expectations. be still “anchored”? they start get de-anchored horizon 4 years. these figure decline significantly past two months. now also start attain inflation expectation five year follow five years. furthermore, influence short-term expectation longer-term expectation increasing. this bad signal big concern us. the risk longer-term expectation get de-anchored definitely increase enormously. and also mean risk deflation euro area increased? i don’t see risk actual deflation sense broad-based decline prices. but big problem moment prolong period low nominal growth, low inflation low growth. this create debt sustainability problem – private household governments. furthermore, increase real interest rate negative effect economic recovery. but new ecb projection growth inflation revise marginally. why govern council nevertheless decide take quite far-reaching decisions? these govern council’s projection –this important. these ecb’s staff projection sense one element govern council’s decision. the risk downside growth inflation see important govern council. so would fair say kind insurance policy downside risks? when deal risk management always preemptive possible. this particularly case risk inflation expectations. we simply right now. with recent decision govern council explicitly aim significant increase ecb’s balance sheet. this major shift ecb’s policy, bring even close central banks. with recent interest rate cut zero low bound. so believe need even expansionary monetary policy, find different channels. an increase balance sheet one option. on one hand, influence inflation expectation future, hand, trigger shift investors’ decisions. this spill asset market also impact exchange rate. bi central bankers’ speech 3 accord many observer effect could even big ecb would give precise figure two purchase program asset back security (abs) cover bonds. i understand argument. but perspective difficult would appropriate commit certain number. we decide so. so even get detail begin october get precise figure plan purchases? at moment intend give concrete number. but draghi signal – include new tltros – aim increase balance sheet €750 billion €1 trillion. many observer doubt possible, especially within short period time. we convince three component sizeable effect balance sheet – consequence i described. we expect significant effect come tltros. this also cut interest rates. there rumor bank might come first tltros speculate interest rate could cut later. this table. doe also mean small tltros uptake, big purchase program be? this necessarily case. but again: we believe new facility attractive. so bank well advise miss opportunity. and everything else fail ecb start buy government bonds? this option broad base quantitative ease (qe) already discuss govern council, happen already time. doe mean “comfortable majority” step – like others announce last week? there proposal qe meeting. qe discussed, table decision. so i don’t think could draw conclusion. so qe, include purchase government bonds, would next logical step govern council? we convince allow buy government bond secondary market, justify monetary policy considerations. but also know mean certainly something would prefer force do. we hope recent package enough. but view responsibility mandate, buy government bond certainly something cannot exclude. but would lead even dissent within govern council. last week’s decision unanimous – although always stress govern council unanimous commitment necessary risk low inflation. this phrase mean particular moment everybody agree concrete package. the significant thing phrase – decide upon unanimously – unconventional instrument priori excluded. but calibration time occasionally source discussion. but recent decision consensus decision-making ultimately history now? since 2010, decision take unanimously. in difficult times, different views. i would qualify surprise even negative 4 bi central bankers’ speech such. in future, also always try reach consensus. but sometimes take decisions. you mention impact ecb’s policy euro. your colleague ewald nowotny make even blunt comment say aim weaken currency. be ecb also respect become like central banks, implicitly use exchange rate instrument? don’t fear counter-measures others? i contradict you: we take single decision aim directly exchange rate. no one say that. our monetary policy target domestic objectives. we justify difficult situation low inflation in. of course everybody know unavoidably consequence exchange rate. the devaluation euro collateral consequence policy. but really matter domestic objective. not goal exchange rate. we change policy respect. this remind japan. in 2013 japanese leader also say ultra-expansionary monetary policy aim domestic target weaken yen. at time also european policymakers central banker doubt criticize that. if read imf g20 statements, japanese policy always consider acceptable direct towards understandable domestic targets. now apply euro area, although different scale: we deflation deflation. in germany ecb’s policy heavily criticized. this increase plan asset purchases. one concern ecb take risk balance sheet could end cause problem taxpayer again. isn’t big risk support germany ecb could get lose completely? this course concern us. we don’t live ivory tower. but mandate mandate 18 euro area country whole. but i also think lot misunderstand unjustified fear germany. just give one example: when start buy government bond first time 2010, everybody write germany forthcoming hyperinflation. this happen reason believe happen now. and also 2010 fear potential losses. if anything, eurosystem make significant profit acquisitions. but feel ecb deviate stability-oriented monetary policy bundesbank former days. this feel even increase bundesbank president jens weidmann oppose ecb decisions. i find difficult say ecb deviate stability-oriented policy inflation rate 0.3%. you could say inflation 3% 4%. our primary mandate price stability embark policy may create danger upside regard. another big fear new bubble financial system. our mandate price stability regard product services, level asset prices. this mandate politician give u treaty. if talk asset price need macroprudential instruments, use interest rates. some instrument give ecb ssm regulation – limit set. i would like instrument nature. bi central bankers’ speech 5 for example? in uk, government recently give bank england instrument loan-to-value- debt-to-income-ratios, especially prevent bubble house real estate market. in us, feed declare non-banks systematically important supervision them. these good ideas. in euro area situation bank still big concern. they still see undercapitalized. what think, especially ecb’s comprehensive assessment come close conclusion? first all: since last year bank already frontloaded lot decision anticipation comprehensive assessment. they raise new capital increase provisions. all since june 2013 128 bank ecb supervision future strengthen balance sheet €197 billion. this also mean ecb’s check already big success. so fear unjustified? such concern general base assumption asset banks’ balance sheet wrongly valued. this exactly asset quality review come play. we confident dispel concern all. the behavior stock price also show investor start put money european banks. a study adviser european systemic risk board (esrb) recently call european bank system bloat highly risky. do agree role play ecb new supervisor? while deny part europe “overbanked”, i would qualify statement little bit. the european bank sector look much big u one compare gdp, u mortgage banks’ balance sheets. that important difference. the shadow bank system also much big us. the bank union provide environment see concentration bank system. but leave market achieve directly policies. i also believe importance capital market finance become important also europe. bank go see role shrink. let’s get back monetary policy. there intense debate “new normal”, example sense unconventional instrument become normal interest rate go low past. do also see “new normal”? i think “new normal”. the first element introduction macroprudential policies. the financial crisis show price stability automatically lead financial stability financial crash risk price stability. therefore central bank need new instruments. it dangerous effective try prevent prick bubble via interest rates. another element necessity unconventional measures. it fact environment neutral real interest rate… …that mean interest real gdp grow trend rate inflation stable… … that rate negative moment low even negative quite while. this rate lot potential growth rate economy potential growth rate decrease many country time now, demographic also factors. on top that, plan save structurally ahead investment opportunities. this i’m convince unconventional monetary policy normal time come. 6 bi central bankers’ speech doe also mean fear “secular stagnation”, long period without growth? i’m sure i think nobody sure. certainly trend continuous decrease real interest rate visible advance economy past decades. in context, important increase potential growth. therefore lot different policy needed. we must hope period last long able increase potential growth economy again. bi central bankers’ speech 1 christopher kent: non-mining business investment – here? address mr christopher kent, assistant governor (economic) reserve bank australia, bloomberg economic summit, sydney, 16 september 2014. * * * i thank lara bui, natasha cassidy, bernadette donovan, stephen elias, craig evans, gianni la cava, kevin lane tom rosewall help prepare remarks. accompany graph find end speech. introduction i’d like thank bloomberg opportunity talk today. i discuss topic venue 18 month ago. the outlook non-mining business investment important element forecasts. it depend range force act economy, include stimulus currently provide low level interest rates. but, forecast economic activity hard. understand forecast business investment arguably hard still. when i april last year, i’d suggest that: • mine investment would likely peak 2013; • non-mining investment would likely pick up, gradually; • growth economy whole would little trend 2013 pick gradually 2014. it look like mine investment peak late 2012 (graph 1). despite substantial decline mine investment since then, growth economy overall pick pace around trend course past year. much improvement owe sharp rise resource exports. at time, also improvement growth rate economic activity non-mining sectors, even though non-mining business investment remain subdued. this good growth non-mining activity often get miss give focus resource boom. while improvement welcome, key question durable improvement be? it might even gather bite steam, thereby help drive overall growth above-trend pace point. such development possible mean certain. they depend part non-mining business investment, motivation talk today. recent past over recent years, non-mining business investment subdued. after recover decline follow global financial crisis, non-mining business investment real term little change past three year (graph 2). in nominal terms, non-mining business investment low level share gdp relative history.1 1 it worth note period weak non-mining investment 2012, non-mining activity generally, allow unprecedented mine investment boom without lead excess aggregate demand problem associate that. 2 bi central bankers’ speech non-mining business investment depend, large part, strength expect demand non-mining sector economy (over life investment). current demand conditions, however, may strong influence investment two reasons. first, firm tend draw recent experience assess prospect future demand. second, strong sale today boost current cash flows, assist firm face financial constraints. hence, gradual pick-up growth non-mining economic activity past year augur well investment. low interest rate robust population growth underpin strong demand house market, house price rise rapidly dwell investment pick strongly. low interest rate also support growth consumption time subdue condition labour market weigh growth incomes. these developments, well growth export industry tourism education, consistent pick-up business condition across range industries. despite gains, survey measure non-mining capacity utilisation improve much past year. a measure derive nab survey (based weight industry accord contribution investment) imply capacity utilisation remain bite average (graph 3). by itself, suggest demand non-mining sector need rise little business feel need undertake substantial investment new capacity. our forecast economy suggest occur time, extent time new investment remain uncertain. it’s output/demand matter in addition strength demand, range factor also influence investment decisions. in particular, investment depend whether expect return new capital outweigh cost instal it. in words, firm invest whenever market value exist capital great book value. this known, academic circles, tobin’s q theory investment, q ratio market value book value capital. it turn empirical support relationship investment q-ratio weak economy whole.2 however, possible show relationship exist level individual firm (graph 4). estimate tobin’s q type model base australian firm-level data indicate non-mining investment unusually weak historical standard recent years. this true control many factor typically include models, sale growth cash flows. for firm bank’s liaison program, also appear investment weak recent growth sale would suggest. with mind, let’s consider possible explanation weakness non-mining business investment, might imply outlook. 2 the poor performance tobin’s q model quite common literature. for discussion problems, see chirinko r (1993), “business fix investment spending: model strategies, empirical result policy implications”, journal economic literature, 31(4), pp 1875–1911. for recent discussion, see robert m t white (2013), “endogeneity empirical corporate finance”, chapter 7 handbook economics finance, 2a, pp 493–572. the result estimate type model aggregate australian data generally disappoint (for instance, see cockerell l s pen (2007), “private business investment australia”, rba research discussion paper no 2007–09). some study use firm-level data success model investment use q ratio, even result sensitive certain model choice (see, example, la cava g (2005), “financial constraints, user cost capital corporate investment australia”, rba research discussion paper no 2005–12). bi central bankers’ speech 3 the cost borrow remain high external finance difficult access? my discussion far ignore fact firm face finance constraint vary degree certain type finance costly obtain others. in particular, cost external equity finance typically great cost external debt which, turn, great cost internal funding. financial constraint certainly become pervasive many firm global financial crisis unfolded. however, constraint ease time. more recently, external finance become widely available favourable cost. primarily, reflect stance monetary policy (both australia abroad), deliver historically low level interest rates, ample liquidity help push equity prices. indeed, common refrain firm course business liaison neither cost availability external finance factor limit investment late. moreover, (non-financial) corporate balance sheet data indicate many australian company currently hold relatively high level cash, suggest access resource finance investment time comes. the exchange rate high? the exchange rate decline somewhat relative peak first half 2013. but remain high, especially give sizeable decline commodity price year. the implication vary across trade non-traded sectors. a decline exchange rate would provide additional support demand domestic firm produce tradable good services. at time, however, high exchange rate also mean import capital good currently relatively cheap. hence, still-high level exchange rate may net positive factor investment plan firm non-tradable industries. for firm tradable industries, hand, low cost import capital offset effect high exchange rate demand good service produce. in short, high exchange rate might play part restrain investment sector economy, it’s unlikely full story. animal spirit weak? what often refer “animal spirits” consist three key elements.3 first, uncertainty, describe range possible outcomes, let’s say demand, thing like cost matter too. second, expect likely outcome. together, describe distribution possible outcomes. but firms’ willingness invest also depend third element, appetite risk. i’ll consider element turn. the outlook uncertain? on surface, uncertainty seem like appeal explanation subdue investment. however, remember firm always make investment decision environment uncertainty, prospect macroeconomy also industry. rather, question need ask whether uncertainty recent year elevated? 3 for detail discussion difference concepts, see haddow a, c hare, j hooley t shakir (2013), “macroeconomic uncertainty: what it, how can we measure it why doe matter?”, bank england quarterly bulletin, 53(2), pp 100–109. 4 bi central bankers’ speech there number way might try measure extent uncertainty. one measure volatility firms’ share price (graph 5).4 another dispersion analysts’ forecast firms’ earn (per share). a third construct look proportion news story mention uncertainty.5 these measure increase time global financial crisis. all measure since decline around level see prior financial crisis, non-mining business investment grow strongly.6 expectation regard demand weak? even uncertainty range possible demand outcome different past, likely outcome – mean distribution – might still weak lead significant new investment projects. business survey ask firm expect condition like near future; result describe “business confidence”. the long-running nab survey suggest business confidence decline long-run average middle last year (graph 6). since then, pick noticeably. this improvement shortly follow broad-based pick-up survey’s measure actual business condition (that is, trade conditions, profit employment). accord nab survey, number business surveys, business confidence condition average. however, liaison program suggest business generally remain reluctant take significant new investment project confident sustain improvement demand conditions. how long condition need hold average level improvement consider sustainable? we don’t know answer this. in part, animal spirit mean mechanistic predictable. what matter investment plan think future, think competitor think future. in part, competitor le enthuse investing, pressure invest avoid leave behind lessened, vice versa. elevate risk aversion? even though measure uncertainty appear declined, firms’ confidence future business condition average, firms’ investment plan may sit idle risk averse past. (by firms, i mean manager shareholder alike.) it’s clear firm become risk averse onset global financial crisis. it seem remain affect experience. while direct effect crisis australian economy generally short-lived relatively minor compare experience many economies, event time lead many australian business household re-evaluate appetite risk. the household sector increase save rate noticeably time crisis remain around prudent level 4 the measure top panel graph 5 s&p-asx “vix index”, base option price data measure expect level near-term volatility australian equity market; include mine sector stocks. 5 for detail methodology, see baker s, n bloom s davis (2013), “measuring economic policy uncertainty”, unpublished manuscript, available <policyuncertainty.com>. 6 one thing business often cite concern uncertainty various policy affect different industries. it’s hard judge, though, extent source uncertainty great today, all, past. bi central bankers’ speech 5 norm early decades.7 also, business deleveraged build level cash holdings. one measure firms’ appetite risk “hurdle” rate return. these serve rule thumb firm evaluate whether proceed particular project. the high hurdle, le likely give project give go ahead. there evidence hurdle rate return increase recent years. but neither evidence decline even though average cost capital firm fallen.8 this large gap hurdle rate average cost capital imply reduction firms’ appetite risk. this result, consistent information liaison program, appear global phenomenon. our liaison provide evidence cautious approach investment recent years. in particular, many firm require investment project satisfy short payback period approve high level management typical past.9 other longer-term determinants? the current weakness non-mining business investment may reflect effect longer-run determinant investment. one candidate (multifactor) productivity growth. relatively weak growth productivity much past decade would weigh return capital reduce incentive add capital stock non-mining industry (graph 7). (in principle, effect already reflect level tobin’s q.) if productivity growth remain relatively low, would weigh overall growth economy. low growth investment would naturally follow low productivity growth, would cause weak growth overall economy. in case, it’s hard know exactly productivity growth likely future. more recently, multifactor productivity growth appear increase little. it currently far growth rate see prior mid 1990s, period especially rapid growth. in summary, explanation merit others. external finance generally readily available low cost, can’t explain weakness non-mining business investment. look available data, it’s hard argue heighten uncertainty play much, any, role. rather, combination relatively low growth domestic demand, effect high exchange rate, lack confidence low appetite risk (than past) appear plausible. there metric consistent this, align business say hold back. what data suggest future? the australian bureau statistic capital expenditure (“capex”) survey provide measure firms’ investment plan 18 month ahead.10 7 the save rate drift little past couple years, strong growth household credit late suggest pick-up appetite risk among households. 8 for discussion experience u firms, see sharpe a g suarez (2014), “the insensitivity investment interest rates: evidence survey cfos”, finance economics discussion series, work paper 2014–02. 9 in relate vein, evidence australian list company risk-related meet early 2000s. it’s possible response increase compliance burden, though change may reduce firms’ appetite risk nonetheless. (special thank gianni la cava suggest measure lara bui painstakingly construct it.) 10 the survey need adjust fact realise investment tend vary predictably initially expect firms. there various way this. for forecast purposes, reliable method adjust investment expectation average “realisation” ratio full history 6 bi central bankers’ speech the recent survey imply modest increase nominal non-mining business investment 2014/15, order 4½ per cent. the survey suggest investment likely rise number industries, including: rental hire real estate; information medium technology; retail; construction. this picture consistent ongoing recovery household expenditure, include dwell investment, non-residential build construction. investment expect decline manufacture sector utilities. give firm adapt plan event unfold, early read investment intention give year often turn wrong. we see extent compare early estimate give year final (seventh) estimate capex data. this show base third estimate, currently hand financial year (graph 8). we see even course quarters, business investment turn quite bite higher, quite bite lower, recent read survey suggests. for example, investment cover capex survey much weak expect initially 1990s recession early 2000s slowdown. but strong initially expect mid 2000s bite strong expect last financial year. in short, firm decide undertake investment early anticipated, investment come relatively quickly. conclusion in conclusion, non-mining business investment subdue measure capacity utilisation remain bite average levels. meanwhile, past year gradual increase pace growth economic activity outside mine sector, owe part low level interest rates. subdue investment (outside mine sector) consistent period great uncertainty below-average confidence. however, number indicator suggest uncertainty decline level see prior global financial crisis. also, measure business confidence pick course past year bite long-run average levels. while welcome development, may sufficient spur investment businesses’ appetite risk remain relatively low. moreover, still-high level exchange rate may weigh investment firm trade sector. nevertheless, tangible indication non-mining business investment grow modest pace financial year. and firms’ willingness take risk improves, investment could easily strong still. it’s always hard know change sentiment might occur. but likely fundamental determinant investment place. the ready availability internal external finance, low cost, one element that. the strong growth demand across non-mining part economy past year another. if history guide, eventually period elevate risk aversion likely give way concern among businesses, losses, lose opportunity loss market share. survey; details, see berkelmans l g spence (2013), “realisation ratio capital expenditure survey”, rba bulletin, december, pp 1–6. it also worth note capex survey provide partial read non-mining business investment exclude firm number key industries, include agriculture, health care education (which account 16 per cent private non-mining business investment 2012/13) exclude investment intangible asset (which account 15 per cent total private business investment). bi central bankers’ speech 7 graph 1 graph 2 8 bi central bankers’ speech graph 3 graph 4 bi central bankers’ speech 9 graph 5 graph 6 10 bi

dinner ecb’s money market contact group, frankfurt main, 9 september 2014. * * * accompany slide find here: http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2014/html/sp140909.en.pdf i would like thank florian heider contribution presentation. all opinion express remain mine. lady gentleman (slide 1), it pleasure tonight. the money market contact group play key role inform ecb’s decision make process. a tribute collective foresight, i would like recall meet 25 june 2012, among first discus operational consequence low ecb’s deposit facility rate (dfr) zero zero. this topic remark tonight.1 a month ago, 5 june, ecb low main refinance rate 0.15%, marginal lend rate 0.40%, – maybe noteworthy – deposit facility rate minus 0.10%. last week, 4 september, rate cut 0.05%, 0.30% –0.20% respectively, state low bind reached. the ecb also decide june remunerate current account balance excess minimum reserve requirement deposit facility rate oppose zero case previously. with measures, enter practically uncharted territory. when gregory mankiw 2009 state new york time “it may time […] go negative”, revive idea may seem odd first. if low interest rate stimulate economy policy rate already low even zero, keep cut rate negative interest rates? the idea negative rates, is, lend 100 get back say 95, may seem absurd “but remember this: early mathematician think idea negative number absurd [too]”.2 in fact, idea negative interest rates, “taxing money”, go back late nineteenth century, silvio gesell, german founder “freiwirtschaft”. the historic academic opinion gesell divided. irving fisher support john maynard keynes call “a strange, unduly neglect prophet”, others “typical monetary crank”.3 so stand euro area? i would like answer question today address follow points: • what mean one policy rates, deposit facility rate, zero? • why go negative? 1 ecb dg market operations, 2012, summary discussion money market contact group, 25 june 2012, available ecb website. for early

fisher, i., 1933. stamp script. new york: adelphi. 2 bi central bankers’ speech • what principle benefit cost move? • and, benefit hindsight since june, initial assessment? to begin with, important point deposit facility rate specific, narrow meaning: negative dfr, bank fund account ecb need fulfil reserve requirement lose money. suppose, instance, bank €100 million excess reserve continuously one year, interest rate –0.20% receive back € 99.8 million, cost deposit fund ecb full year € 200,000. why bank accept cost deposit excess reserve central bank? the answer alternative deposit excess reserve also costly. in fact, cost use alternative central bank deposit determine extent rate excess reserve go negative practice. bank always choose hold physical currency instead electronic money account ecb. since physical currency zero nominal rate return, i would call “economic low bound” rate excess reserves. it difficult identify zero effective rate return currency negative. one even need impose demurrage rate regular stamp banknotes, irving fischer propose base gesell’s ideas.4 there cost storing, holding, importantly, use physical currency.5 this involve cost renting, maintain secure storage facility vault well cost ship currency around safe timely manner. a recent ecb study estimate private cost cash payment 1.1% gdp average participate countries.6 the unit social cost estimate 2.3 cent per euro transaction. this substantially high unit social cost credit transfer non-cash mean payment per euro transaction. because overnight unsecured money market alone currently involve hundred bank aggregate transaction volume around € 40–50 billion every day, replicate scale transact physical money would formidable costly task, privately socially. i would go far kenneth rogoff conclude electronic money, push economic low bound, would recreate room manoeuvre central bank protractedly low inflation environment.7 the ecb commit bring euro area inflation back level close 2%, line mandate. but rationale negative rate deposit facility? why impose cost banks’ excess reserves? one view negative rate context ecb’s aim provide monetary policy accommodation inter alia low policy rate without impair market intermediation.8 there number reason desirable keep certain distance 4 stamp banknote famously try city wörgl, austria, 1932. bill introduce devaluation rate 1% per month unless holder would buy stamp extend nominal value. see champ, b., 2008. stamp script: money people pay use. economic commentary, federal reserve bank cleveland, april. 5 beyond direct opportunity

journal, 113, 723–746. bi central bankers’ speech 3 main refinance deposit rates. the relative difference cost borrow ecb benefit deposit ecb determine incentive lend interbank market. have active interbank market important obtain price signal transmission policy rate economy. it also important reduce bank excessive reliance central bank money, key factor resilience post-crisis environment. in word michael woodford, “the demand [overnight funds] function location overnight rate relative lend rate deposit rate, independent absolute level interest rates.”9 to see role relative difference, consider follow think experiment. for sake argument, let abstract credit risk overnight market assume enough eligible collateral borrow ecb. hence, would material difference short-term secure unsecured borrow lending. bank excess reserve would lend interbank market rate deposit rate. bank shortage reserve would borrow interbank market rate main refinance rate. suppose main refinance rate equal deposit rate. then rate trade possible. hence, important keep spread main refinance deposit rate order support market activity. another benefit low deposit rate together main refinance rate current situation excess liquidity, short-term interest rate eonia track deposit rate closely main refinance rate.10 the bank system whole excess liquidity, currently stand around € 130 billion. when excess liquidity increases, rate fall since le must borrow interbank market (the demand curve shift down). in order make sure monetary policy accommodation pass interbank market fixed-rate full allotment excess liquidity, therefore enough low main refinance rate. in fact, deposit rate may important policy rate central bank environment excess liquidity. the decision low rates, accompany number measure stimulate credit economy “targeted” long-term operation (to induce bank lend real sector) announcement purchase asset-backed security cover bond base claim euro area real economy, also fully line ecb’s forward guidance. forward guidance imply interest rate remain present low level extend period time conditional assessment economic outlook. follow june decision, low policy rate transmit well money market and, line forward guidance, market uncertainty expect path policy rate fell. eonia forward curve flatten shift (slide 2). in addition, volatility eonia rate well option-implied volatility short-term interest rate dropped. the low policy rate also transmit long maturity market segment unsecured money market. euribor rate rate imply euribor future fell june decision september decision (slide 3 4). unsecured money market interest rate negative maturity two weeks. besides, general collateral (gc) pool repo curve well yield euro area treasury bill note adjusted. 9 woodford, m., 2001, “monetary policy information economy”, paper present federal reserve bank kansa city economic symposium jackson hole (30 august–1 september). 10 for review impact non-standard monetary policy money market functioning, see monnet, c. m. bech, 2013, “the impact unconventional monetary policy overnight interbank market”, reserve bank australia 2013 annual conference volume “liquidity fund markets”. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the eonia regularly set negative territory since 28 august together stable trade volume (the average daily eonia volume january june 2014 € 26.1 billion € 28.9 billion since june) (slide 5) homogenous transmission closely substitutable market segments, gc pool repo, evidence large fraction unsecured money market transaction take place negative rate without hamper market functioning. this reflect effective well-coordinated preparation market participant since ecb first mention possibility bring dfr zero. the fact money market trade volume fall (they actually rose) remarkable give fear observer expressed, inform japanese experience 1990s, potential impact market function negative dfr low policy rate generally. will transmission low short-term rate low cost credit real economy smooth? while bank lend rate come past line low policy rates, limit cheap bank lend be. the mark-up bank add cost obtain fund central bank compensate credit risk, term premia cost originating, screen monitor loans. the need compensation necessarily fall policy rate lowered. if anything, central bank low rate economy need stimulus, precisely difficult bank find good loan make opportunities. it remain see whether extent recent monetary policy accommodation translate cheap bank lending.11 another concern low rate may contribute instability financial sector. while valid concern, practice, causal chain difficult establish. do low rate really lead instability (e.g., though excess search yield) rate low instability financial system economy need stimulus?12 that said, reduce excessive risk aversion financial market welcome (side) effect central bank policy crisis. the question whether risk-taking financial sector already go far, contribute grow financial imbalances, frothy asset price valuation loose credit standards. irrespective answer question, give low inflation environment, clear monetary policy cannot currently assume role address concern euro area. it therefore task macro-prudential policy deal potential financial imbalances. the supervisory set-up europe undergo significant improvement help ensure soundness financial system. a enter extend period low interest rates, must stand ready use full extent new macro-prudential instrument national competent authority ecb entrust with. an important aspect low policy rate also reaffirm forward guidance help clarify ecb’s commitment ensure monetary policy stance remain appropriate need euro area economy. this reflect eonia-ois curve flat negative territory maturity three years, reflect market expectation negative eonia fix well 2017 (slide 6), widen gap expect path u euro area interest rates. (slide 7). a negative deposit rate can, however, also adverse consequences. for start, impose cost bank excess reserve could therefore reduce profitability. 11 for recent review bank lend channel monetary policy transmission special focus crisis experience, see gambacorta, l. d. marques-ibanez, 2011, “the bank lend channel: lesson crisis”, bi work paper no. 345. 12 for causal evidence low interest rate lead risk-taking banks, see jimenez, g., peydro, j., ongena, s. j. saurina, 2012, “hazardous time monetary policy: what 23 million loan say impact monetary policy credit risk-taking?”, econometrica, forthcoming. bi central bankers’ speech 5 note, however, apply reduction deposit rate make rate negative. for sure, low bank profitability could hamper economic recovery, especially time bank deleverage own strict regulation enhance market scrutiny. but whether bank profitability really fall policy rate low depend generally slope yield curve (as banks’ fund cost may also fall), banks’ investment policy (as scope diversify cash investment along curve across credit universe) factor drive non-interest income.13 more fundamentally, bank profitable healthy economy household company strive finance projects, accommodative monetary policy aim achieve first place. in fact, ensure smooth transmission low policy rate cost credit economy support profitability bank ultimately depend whether economic policy euro area country level successful put euro area economy back path strong stable growth, mobilise supply-side and, available, demand-side instruments. a prudent, well-capitalised bank system need case, ecb’s comprehensive assessment together start single supervisory mechanism key respect. in order avoid cost excess reserves, bank may also, decide borrow le ecb. this would reduce excess liquidity bank system put upward pressure interest rate interbank bond market, could counteract reduction policy rates. but see far. despite discussion adverse consequence negative deposit rate, significant impact function money markets. i already mention smooth transmission rate stable trade volume eonia. similarly, level excess liquidity amount deposit ecb (slide 8) largely unaffected. however, one possible reason stable level money market function could declining, still exist fragmentation money markets. while lot achieved, example target2 imbalance fall nearly half since peak mid-2012 (at € 572bn 3 september, € 541bn peak level reach july 2012), market fragmentation euro area still present.14 if bank excess reserve predominately highly profitable bank locate non-stressed countries, potential adverse effect bank profitability may le concern financial stability perspective. similarly, bank good reason borrow ecb, instance source fund available, bank borrow necessarily deposit ecb, excess liquidity bank system may fall. what impact negative rate market fragmentation euro area? evidence actual money market transaction show fragmentation still significantly hamper smooth transmission low rate across euro area. bank locate non-stressed country borrow overnight unsecured market negative rates. rate borrower locate stress country mostly positive distribution rate wide, range slightly negative slightly main refinance rate. that said, evidence low rate reduce fragmentation secure markets. the search yield low rate environment increase demand 13 there evidence low interest rate environment unite state adversely affect money market funds, see kacperczyk, m. m di maggio, 2014, “the unintended consequence zero low bind policy”, work paper, columbia business school. this is, however, le concern europe money market fund central financial system. 14 for information, see ecb report “financial integration europe” (april 2014). 6 bi central bankers’ speech high yielding, still safe product repo sovereign bonds, include non-core countries.15 the high demand push thus compress interest rate secure markets. let conclude. give theoretical argument low policy rate negative territory, give practical experience far, verdict? or, come back opinion gesell: consider prophet monetary crank? while final verdict certainly still out, base present evidence far, seem fair say low policy rates, deposit rate move negative territory, provide appropriate monetary policy stimulus euro area economy, comfort forward guidance ecb, contribute reduction market fragmentation, without adverse impact function money markets. a money market settle negative territory, market segment start experience negative yields, make sure broad market community prepare cope new environment. thank attention. 15 accord late icma survey 4 september, repo market size increase 3.3% last 6 month eur 5,499 billion eur 5,782 billion. bi

entirely safeguard price stability, lautenschläger say speech annual conference verein für socialpolitik hamburg. the interaction three policy area central bank reduce risk financial dominance, strengthen transmission monetary policy improve management financial system. “both area strong interest sound bank viable business model provide credit real economy”, say lautenschläger. give bank already prepare recent month requirement apply follow imminent launch ssm strengthen capital bases, capacity provide credit economy increase even official start ssm. this strengthen transmission monetary policy. for central bank, provide finance commercial banks, important – particularly time crisis – make clear distinction sound bank solvent suffer liquidity shortage insolvent bank able survive long run. a strong european supervisor would able dispel uncertainty attach solvency assessments. this help ecb fulfil tasks, able provide liquidity support without fear exceed mandate, say lautenschläger. however, reliable solvency information would able help reduce financial dominance credible regime resolve banks. this require common regulatory framework resolution fund ample resources. in addition, strict rule regard grant emergency liquidity assistance commercial bank eurosystem national central bank could reduce potential conflict interest. particularly time economic growth, ecb’s new task could permit appropriate reaction potential excess asset markets, example. use interest rate counter development appropriate, warn lautenschläger, could jeopardise primary objective price stability. it thus important ecb’s govern council tool disposal counter imbalances. * * * my speech today devote relationship – precise, triangular relationship. it’s make complex, yet successful relationship justice common different goal interest three parties. start year, triangular relationship, particular workflow decision-making process within it, play specific role ecb, le two month single supervisory mechanism (ssm) officially begin operation – three policy area come umbrella ecb. monetary policy remain, course, main task. the ecb additionally take responsibility bank supervision euro area. and play important role calibrate implement macro-prudential supervision, even though national authority continue primarily responsible. 2 bi central bankers’ speech each policy area mandate, goal instruments. the task monetary policy ensure price stability. in respect, interest rate policy standard instrument (although quite number measure non-standard). the supervisory objective ensure safety stability bank system whole. the supervisory authority had, since crisis, veritable arsenal instrument mainly concern risk-bearing capacity individual banks. the objective macro-prudential policy stability financial system whole. even though ecb course exert influence financial stability via monetary policy, start november additionally use capital-based liquidity-based instrument – respect institution directly indirectly supervises. despite differences, three policy area monetary policy, bank supervision financial stability plus macro-prudential supervision closely linked. one could even argue triangular relationship: influence comparable variable (such consumption investment) operate via transmission channel (such bank lending). instrument use one three policy area inevitably affect two; make essential clearly specify objective activity clearly adjudicate conflict goals. a often case complex relationships, could spend whole day study side relationship. today i would like specifically address question new framework, two new bank supervision macro-prudential supervision tasks, help ecb abide price stability mandate, kind side effect. to come straight point, i’ll talk financial dominance, monetary policy transmission financial cycle. reduce financial dominance the classic function central bank provide liquidity solvent banks. and ecb unquestionably fulfil role even crisis. our lend bank rise €800 billion 2008 height crisis 2012. if ecb provide liquidity, would bailouts, abrupt debt reduction thus deepen recession – would make mandate ensure price stability much difficult. however, doubt lend entail risk central bank. it could fall trap financial dominance: central bank could finance bank suffer merely temporary liquidity crunch, permanently incapable surviving, insolvent. financial dominance accompany risk moral hazard market distortion – bad – risk monetary financing. but central bank become expose risks? no doubt, consequence information asymmetry non-supervisory central bank one hand bank national supervisor other. assess solvency bank often take equity ratio. have comprehensive knowledge capital situation risk profile bank real benefit assessment. this particularly true financial crises, course assessment solvency risk-bearing capacity bank depend many quantitative qualitative parameters; recall often difficult valuation asset come pressure crisis marketable. for ecb aspect important many central banks. our monetary policy work via bank transmission channel, bank-based. thus, open market operation almost 1,800 business partner currently registered. by way comparison, federal reserve 21 primary dealers. 72% business conduct via direct (and, course, secured) loan banks, type lend unknown fed. for kind monetary policy, information financial soundness monetary policy counterparties vital. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the creation ssm represent important complement monetary policy. a well-established european supervisory body capable act recognise emerge internal risk bank strengthen resilience risk-bearing capacity. in addition, event crisis ecb able resort sound judgement ssm. this especially true emergency liquidity assistance, national central bank responsible granting. in respect, govern council, decision, able rely, among things, ssm’s expertise judge whether want raise objection national emergency liquidity assistance.1 now i don’t want sing praise synergy effect without point problems. first, financial dominance may arise ecb, due lack sufficient information, provide liquidity non-viable banks. financial dominance may also arise public gain impression interest rate decision influence concern effect institutions, word fall prey conflict interests. our credibility would stake. that’s why, workflow decision-making processes, attach great importance separation monetary policy decision supervisory decisions. that’s functional separation govern council level strictly observe monetary policy decision document submit govern council without inflow supervisory analysis, vice versa. only govern council level draft decision meet one decision-making body. for example, supervisory measure take respect certain bank supervisory board forward draft final decision govern council implicit approval process – process ensure member govern council change decision, turn down. this principle clear separation different role also carefully monitor european parliament. to effectively counter possible impression fiscal dominance, systemically important bank must resolve without risk financial stability. currently, europe-wide framework bank resolution set up, single resolution mechanism resolution fund. we thus take big step towards solve too-big-to-fail problem. the resolution mechanism also serve protect central bank, make possible europe-wide, orderly winding-up systemically important institution, without govern council worry side effect financial stability short-term withdrawal liquidity. effective supervision orderly resolution bank thus also support ecb’s monetary policy mandate. it help central bank carry task, is, provide liquidity assistance, without worry overstep mandate. improve monetary policy transmission the eurosystem offer liquidity bank maintain financial intermediation money market improve transmission monetary policy. for transmission work optimally, stable financial sector needed. for bank important channel via monetary stimulus pass business households. and healthy bank perform role lenders. so monetary policy-makers bank supervisor 1 however, article 14.4 statute european system central bank european central bank (statute escb) assign govern council ecb responsibility restrict ela operation consider operation interfere objective task eurosystem. such decision take govern council majority two-thirds vote cast. for information, please see: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/201402_elaprocedures.de.pdf? e716d1d560392b10142724f50c6bf66a. 4 bi central bankers’ speech interest sound bank viable business model lend money real economy. but single supervisory mechanism support monetary policy transmission? first, comprehensive assessment, i.e. health check banks, play essential role. the assessment bank balance sheet aim uncover bad debt place bank solid capital base supervision ssm. and assessment catalytic effect. prior health check, bank accelerate deleveraging build equity. the sum bank balance sheet decline 2013 alone around 20 percentage point gdp. since july 2013, nearly 130 bank build capital amount approximately €140 billion.2 a result health check, one institution make provision raise capital. a lengthy period balance sheet restructure thus significantly shortened. in lending, already see first positive signals. the decline lend company household stabilised. and late bank lend survey suggest second quarter 2014 lend standard ease category loan net basis. the single supervisory mechanism make significant contribution support monetary policy; set properly, could, best, enhance effectiveness monetary policy next credit cycle. at point, interaction micro-prudential macro-prudential policy, second side triangular relationship, come play. a i say earlier, many bank euro area deleverage significantly crisis; resilient enough. some bank find difficult refinance equity ratio low. so increase capital ratio downturn, curb new lending. this cyclical behaviour cannot perhaps eliminate instrument micro- macro-prudential supervision, certainly attenuated. supervision europe take preventive, risk-based approach. we push compliance minimum capital liquidity ratio supervisory regulation. we check whether business model bank directly supervise sustainable, whether bank-internal control structure governance set appropriate way whether institution could survive crises. if upturn bank’s resilience increased, there’s le need raise capital downturn boost market confidence. under circumstances, possible use macro-prudential instrument support lending, release countercyclical capital buffers. this would help monetary policy achieve predictable effect throughout economic cycle. but interest bank supervisor responsible macro-prudential supervision always aligned. i easily imagine situation supervisor feel capital liquidity necessary increase margin requirement necessary, systemic perspective cyclical behaviour perceive crisis-intensifying. the link two area responsibility ecb may also prove helpful here, internally resolve potential conflicts. the advantage govern council decision-making body three policy area get 2 these figure base solely publicly available data; retain earn category take account calculations. the actual figure correspondingly higher. bi central bankers’ speech 5 comprehensive picture systemic risk thus weigh micro macro consideration find balance beneficial monetary policy. but advantage monetary policy. by combine function within ecb synergy may arise, best, choice instrument curb threat financial stability. for monetary policy instruments, adjustment haircut minimum requirement collateral, overlap macro-prudential measure aim liquidity margin requirements. the interplay micro- macro-prudence therefore support monetary policy cycle. it also ensure monetary policy deal problem may lie periphery mandate. at time, combination function within central bank also bring great advantage micro-prudential supervision. for monetary policy decisions, extensive economic analysis make supervisor may resort order obtain additional information environment condition bank conduct business. the ecb extensive knowledge market provides, among things, real-time insight general refinance situation banks. in short, exchange know-how information create synergy lead good inform supervisory decision outcomes. steer financial cycle so far i talk interaction area responsibility downturn phase cycle. but upturn? in recent year much discussion extent central bank play role steer financial cycle – whether “lean wind”. before crisis, many opinion leader believe that, give difficulty identify latent bubbles, task central bank make good damage bubble burst. a result crisis, however, long financial boom major impact price stability, many economist change mind demand central bank take account risk financial stability decisions. the ecb always include financial stability consideration monetary policy decisions. in two-pillar strategy financial imbalance important element decide measure necessary, even matter inflation low. in particular, monetary pillar capture relationship excessive credit liquidity creation, potential risk future price developments, include destabilise asset price boom. our action deliberate medium-term orientation. this give u sufficiently long horizon take account financial imbalance strategy. element “leaning-against-the-wind” approach therefore implicitly included. however, sign financial imbalance emerging, need carefully consider whether use standard monetary policy instrument appropriate response. there two reason this. first, could conflict mandate preserve price stability. the bi estimate financial cycle typically last around 16 years, compare eight year business cycle. this asynchrony lead period inflation make rate cut necessary, financial data favour opposite. if take financial cycle account, may forced, even medium-term orientation, make compromise term price stability objective. accord hierarchy goals, give priority monetary policy, would permissible. in addition, also question interest rate path follow counter excessive credit growth. some study conclude highly leverage boom 6 bi central bankers’ speech even small change interest rate strong impact.3 other study suggest, however, rather large interest rate movement would require counteract financial cycle, turn would cause collateral damage economy price stability.4 use monetary policy instrument strengthen financial stability seem crude approach view heterogeneity euro area. so, example, lend period 2008 ten percentage point high subsequent crisis country non-crisis countries. a rate hike ecb, always apply entire euro area, would great impact region affect excessive lending. but monetary policy instrument cannot always simultaneously satisfy financial stability aspects, one conclusion: must consistently apply tinbergen rule; need least many instrument goal achieve. a different goal require additional tool appropriate proportionate. this ssm come play – specifically, relationship macro-prudential policy monetary policy, third side triangle. in principle, easier, expand toolkit available ecb, ssm establish clear separation function two policy areas. monetary policy concentrate price stability, important variable throughout euro area. the focus macro-prudential policy financial stability. particular emphasis could put specific regional sectoral imbalances. however, may circumstance clear separation simple. this case financial cycle extend across sector country represent threat future price stability. a combination monetary macro-prudential measure could right answer. particularly macro-prudential measures, many different question uncertainty unintended spillover effect regionally limit measure country entire euro area. under conditions, fact ecb also responsible bank supervision benefit monetary policy. because issues, decision-making concentrate govern council. the council’s role ensure optimal policy mix. a macro-prudential policy, national authorities, i already said, still play important shape role. they extensive knowledge national economic financial systems. the governor national central bank involve national macro-prudential tasks. this make exchange view vote govern council respect national european macro-prudential policy considerably easier. should opinion diverge – example, relation systemic consequence specific measure – ecb authorise eu legislation improve exist macro-prudential measure implement national authority make recommendation new measures. summary lady gentlemen, allow summarise. 3 see adrian, t. und h.-y. shin (2010), “the change nature financial intermediation financial crisis 2007–09”, federal reserve bank new york staff report no 439, march 2010. 4 see, example, bean, c., m. paustian, a. penalver t. taylor, “monetary policy fall”, 28 august 2010. bi central bankers’ speech 7 my intention today give understand future task ecb, future triangular relationship. the single supervisory mechanism new role macro-prudential supervision not, properly set up, dilute objective central bank, instead may contribute, side effect, strengthen monetary policy mandate. and monetary policy focus task maintain price stability. bank supervision ensure bank become resilient; macro-prudential instrument dampen effect asset price bubble cyclical behaviours. the completion bank union also contribute significantly safeguard financial stability future. nevertheless, must succumb hubris – must succumb notion problem solve thank ssm. the health individual bank depend supervision, also overall economy structure bank system; ecb’s influence limited. and forget irrational exuberance, find ex post many “bubble”, simply part human nature. that’s another lesson crisis teach us. bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît coeuré: credit investment european recovery speech mr benoît coeuré, member executive board european central bank, imf/bank slovenia high-level seminar “reinvigorating credit growth central, eastern southern european economies”, portoroz, 26 september 2014. * * * summary to revive euro area economy recapitalisation bank sector also repair private sector balance sheet needed. the bank sector undergo necessary process structural reforms. with conclude comprehensive assessment potential ensure credit supply constraint diminish cycle turns. for strong rebound investment private non-financial sector need raise equity. one instrument especially small medium size enterprise allow eu investment fund distribute form equity form debt, european bank reconstruction development (ebrd) international finance corporation (ifc) already many countries. also fragmentation venture capital market reduced. for small firm need deleveraging debt-for-equity-swaps, possibly foster tax incentives, could facilitate private debt workouts. what also need raise productivity. an “upward shock” total factor productivity need possible highly competitive markets. *** introduction across europe credit growth weak. in central eastern european country credit either stagnant grow low rates. in many country euro area1 credit private sector even negative territory. the reason several, heart vicious circle low growth, low investment low credit. and challenge face policymakers today break it. the current policy debate largely focus credit dimension. and indeed, evidence creditless recoveries, rare sometimes contemplated, much le common high income, financially develop economy low income countries.2 a european economy heavily depend bank loans, stand reason recent weak credit performance europe contribute low economic growth rates. it nevertheless important reinvigorate credit growth see end itself. research base international evidence suggest fast-growing bank sector detrimental aggregate productivity growth.3 and see euro area 1 in q2 2014, annual growth rate mfi loan private sector negative cyprus, greece, ireland, latvia, malta, netherlands, portugal, slovenia, spain. 2 see example darvas, zsolt, (2013), “can europe recover without credit?” use data 135 countries, cover five decades, study suggest creditless recoveries, stock real credit return pre-crisis level three year gdp trough, rare characterise remarkable real gdp growth rates. however, study find implication historical episode current european situation limited, creditless recovery much le common high-income countries, recovery associate significant real exchange rate depreciation. 3 cecchetti, stephan g enisse kharroubi (2012), “reassessing impact finance growth”, bi work paper no 381. 2 bi central bankers’ speech credit growth lead wrong type investment create financial imbalance eventually lead crises, little support long-term economic performance. indeed, 1999–2007 period saw positive correlation initial level gdp per caput average total factor productivity (tfp) growth rates: high tfp growth rate find germany, austria, netherlands finland, “catching-up” economy (spain, greece, portugal, ireland) tfp actually declined. an important explanation capital latter economy flow disproportionately non-tradable/services sector, general low productivity growth. investment high construction real estate sectors, closely follow retail, transport leisure.4 this experience show u quality credit matter much quantity, imply policymakers focus broad question revive credit – namely, “how channel save towards productive investment?”. this focus investment warrant because, short run, key boost demand create self-sustaining recovery. and long run, ensure investment efficiently allocate help create virtuous circle productivity credit, thus avoid mistake past. achieve require policy agenda encompass credit supply demand factors. it require unclog diversify channel financial intermediation euro area; recapitalise economy reduce debt raise equity; policy mix make borrow invest worthwhile. in words, require comprehensive approach. and i would like afternoon sketch comprehensive approach could look like, draw lesson learn crisis post-crisis adjustment. fix credit channel the start point logically financial sector, confront change landscape: european bank sector undergo necessary largely unavoidable process structural change. bank adopt le risky business models, move deposit-based fund strategy strengthen equity capital. a result, clear trend towards overall small le leverage bank industry. while several benefit process5, also present important question, credit productive firms, le leverage banks. the medium-term solution bank capital market adapt new environment. for bank mean refocus business model take advantage information technology development improve risk management low operate costs. we always need strong bank euro area, play essential role situation information cannot standardise state verification costly, example lend small- medium-sized enterprise (smes).6 the main challenge capital market expand market access firm across euro area. this extent already happen organically, firm issue diversify fund sources, uneven: bond issuance strongly concentrate country 4 european commission, 2013, “catching-up process euro area”, quarterly report euro area, vol. 12, issue 1, march 2013. 5 see speech benoît cœuré, “on optimal size financial sector”, frankfurt, 2 september 2014. 6 see discussion levine, ross (1997). “financial development economic growth: view agenda”. journal economic literature 35, 688–726 recently jayaraman, sudarshan. anjan v. thakor, 2014, “who monitor monitor? bank capital structure borrower monitoring”, mimeo. bi central bankers’ speech 3 among firm bank lend constraint lowest. a ecb argue several occasions7, one reason need urgently focus create legal regulatory framework genuine single market capital europe. essentially, aim balance finance mix firm great ability substitute bank market finance, hence intermediation become contestable resilient. i would however emphasise balance key; view market finance cure-all. indeed, research suggest much substitution towards market finance may lead le total borrowing, firm replace bank loan bond issuance internalise fact type borrow hard restructure bad times.8 besides, europe set institution consistent fully market-based allocation savings, fund pension schemes. in event, diversify finance mix realistically project tomorrow. we see sign credit demand pick up, make imperative nascent demand choke credit supply constraints. our focus today therefore bank finance, namely ensure continue fund real economy even bank downsize restructure. and two current policy initiative come in. the first comprehensive assessment bank balance sheets, potential ensure supply constraint diminish cycle turn year. one purpose assessment steer deleveraging process towards “good” form – i.e. bank quickly carve non-performing asset raise equity – international experience suggest lead fast rebound credit viable firms. indeed, empirical research suggest oft-heard view high bank capital lead low loan supply accurate. long-run evidence germany, example, find high bank capital tend associate high business loan volume, evidence negative effect.9 while exercise conclude next month, already see sign affect speed quality deleveraging. whereas 2011 2012 asset deleveraging account 0.1 percentage point 1.3 percent increase banks’ core tier 1 ratios, 2012 2013 (i.e. assessment launched) account 1.0 percentage point overall increase 1.2 percent. capital increase account half increase 2 years.10 this acceleration process suggest that, final result know residual uncertainty removed, bank strong position resume new lending. the second on-going initiative full rollout ecb’s credit ease package, aim encourage bank use new balance sheet space lend real economy. the target long-term refinance operation (tltro) built-in incentive mechanism encourage loan firm households, expect strong take bank december operation six subsequent instalment june 2016. and programme purchase outright high quality asset-backed security (abs) cover bond complement provide market incentive bank originate saleable securities, thus loan collateralise them. 7 see speech benoît cœuré, “completing single market capital”, icma capital market lecture series 2014, paris, 19 may 2014. 8 crouzet, nicolas (2013), “corporate debt structure macroeconomy”, mimeo. 9 buch, claudia esteben prieto (2014), “do good capitalize bank lend less? long-run panel evidence germany”, international finance 17:1. 10 see ecb financial stability review, may 2014. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in short, combination two initiative result confluence factor – improve incentive high capital – allow loan supply expand elastically meet loan demand. and extent credit supply demand endogenous, instance effect supply constraint macroeconomic risk, could see begin self-sustaining credit recovery. i would nonetheless question whether credit recovery enough achieve investment recovery, hence sustain recovery economy. if look breakdown credit demand component survey data, fix investment mildly positive effect demand 11 quarter negative effects.11 and demand may well “backward-looking” – is, delay project come back online. from “forward-looking” perspective, reason cautious degree pent-up investment demand. principal among that, bank might deleveraged, customer have. in several euro area country firm still face debt overhang affect economics take new credit. real interest rate euro area expect decrease, nominal interest rate remain low long period inflation expect gradually rise back towards 2%. but issue over-indebted firm long-term real interest rate probably cannot go low enough make new investment attractive: profit generate absorb service exist debt. indeed, see clear negative correlation – coefficient –0.48 – corporate debt-to-gdp level different country begin crisis evolution non-residential investment since. repair private sector balance sheet if want see strong rebound investment across euro area, next step therefore repair non-financial private sector balance sheets. and process take place backdrop low inflation and, affect countries, limit fiscal space, involve reduction nominal debt. the reboot financial sector already take place put u good position achieve this. when comprehensive assessment concludes, bank acknowledge loss raise provision capital – disclosure results, capital shortfall expect cover within six month asset quality review baseline stress test scenario, within nine month adverse stress test scenario. thus, bank side, restructure loan distress borrower become feasible. what need go forward efficient debt restructure insolvency regime firms, present vary widely euro area countries. the effectiveness restructure regime often hamper sluggish creditor coordination, lack new finance viable company undergo restructure overburden judicial system. for example, accord world bank, resolve insolvency italy take 1.8 years, compare 0.4 year ireland. a number stress country already begin take initiative improve restructure insolvency proceedings. in greece, example, facilitate debt workout viable company make simple two new out-of-court debt restructure tools: one large enterprise include multi-creditor coordination mechanism inspire international standards; one smes employ standardise templates. in spain, substantial amendment insolvency law early year, among things, make facilitate out-of-court settlement easy also make in-court 11 see ecb bank lend survey, july 2014. bi central bankers’ speech 5 settlement effective. court approve refinance agreement low majority requirement permit extension maturity bank loans, negotiate haircut arrange debt-for-equity swaps. ireland portugal also introduce various measure target enterprises, smes households. in cases, however, restructure insolvency regime could make efficient still adopt best practice broadly. this would include, inter alia, strengthen measure facilitate out-of-court settlement viable firms; introduce centralise guideline voluntary debt workout couple independent intermediation large companies; establish standardise voluntary workout smes. the deleveraging european firm however reduce debt; first foremost raise equity. we fact already see significant decline debt-to-equity ratio large euro area corporates since end-2009 due valuation gain equity markets, support low interest rates.12 to extent new monetary policy measure affect relative supply financial asset initiate portfolio rebalancing, may see spillover equity market continue trend. for small firms, however, channel le powerful equity market largely underdeveloped. raise equity therefore proactive process. one way achieve use debt-for-equity swap (fostered possibly tax incentives) facilitate private debt workouts. another eu investment fund distribute form equity well debt, european bank reconstruction development (ebrd) international finance corporation (ifc) already many countries, i call recent article.13 a third, medium-term aim reduce fragmentation european venture capital market increase depth private equity markets. this last point another example advance towards single market capital would beneficial euro area – would help strengthen capital market relative banks, also help strengthen equity fund relative debt. this would also positive structural effect euro area: cross-country integration equity improve risk-sharing and, hard investor “cut run”, would likely provide resilience crisis integration interbank lend fix income investment. new research show vulnerability euro area “sudden stop” worsen crisis constrain fiscal reaction government downturn.14 while option increase equity fund developed, strategy improve debt dynamic firms’ raise “implied equity” – outlook future income. if firm expect high income, improve debt-to-income ratio debt service capacity, turn create space new investment.15 in sense, raise level trend potential growth integral part recapitalising european firms, indeed economy whole. 12 for information see article “deleveraging pattern euro area corporate sector”, ecb monthly bulletin, february 2014. 13 see opinion piece benoît cœuré jörg asmussen, “a three-pillar-strategy euro”, publish berliner zeitung le echos, 19 september 2014. 14 martin, philippe thomas philippon (2014), “inspecting mechanism: leverage great recession eurozone”, forthcoming. 15 the concept “implied equity” echo investment context holmstrom tirole call “inside liquidity”, i.e. future income stream private sector pledge react liquidity shock. raise imply equity therefore additional benefit make economic system resilient shocks, i.e. stabilise well allocative properties. see holmström, bengt jean tirole (2010), inside outside liquidity, mit press. 6 bi central bankers’ speech we face however circular problem euro area: need high potential growth work debt overhang firm invest again; investment necessary raise potential growth. and circle potentially vicious: low potential growth lead low investment, low potential growth. a policy mix lift investment demand this next part comprehensive approach come in: get policy mix right supply side economy lift investment demand. in basic solow growth model, investment grow growth rate productivity plus growth rate hour work along steady state path economy. a expect limit labour participation gain age society, raise investment demand therefore raise productivity. indeed, achieve upward shock tfp seem essential trigger, sustainable way, positive accelerator effect productivity, investment credit. but require environment characterise two things: competition certainty. competitive market necessary ensure investment productivity indeed mutually enhancing, i say early given: high investment several euro area country pre-crisis period lead convergence tfp. certainly, important reason much capital flow real estate. but misallocation also result low level competition non-tradable/services sector generally distort price signals. a firm could capture excess rents, fall marginal product capital counterbalance rise profit margins, mean total compensation invest sector remain high.16 so: flipside productive investment competitive market produce accurate price signals, thus draw resource efficiently employed. achieve require product labour market reform accelerate “churn” process within across sectors17, also reduce unnecessary regulation hind allocation reallocation resources. the world bank’s “doing business” report give example obstacles. if entrepreneur want start new business spain, go 10 separate procedures, slovenia require two. if firm want launch green field investment, would wait 200 calendar day ireland new warehouse get electricity; germany would wait 17 days.18 there reason optimistic effect reform process euro area. recent micro-level research eurosystem’s competitiveness network, instance, show large skew distribution least productive firm individual euro area countries. far normally distributed, highly productive firm many low productivity.19 this imply fast efficient reallocation across firm sector could quite powerful. 16 european commission (2013). 17 for effect “churning” productivity see foster, lucia, john haltiwanger, chad syverson (2008), “reallocation, firm turnover, efficiency: selection productivity profitability?”, american economic review, 98(1). 18 world bank (2013), do business 2014: understand regulation small medium-size enterprises. 19 compnet task force (2014), “micro-based evidence eu competitiveness: the compnet database”, ecb work paper series no. 1634. bi central bankers’ speech 7 where certainty complement process fix expectations: firm trust structural reform follow vigorously, incline invest basis. put differently, certainty allow positive medium-term effect structural reform bring forward present. the fact euro area corporates currently hold record amount cash, rather investing, suggest plan structural reform yet credible enough reap “certainty dividend”. certainty also extend tax policy. remember matter firm decide whether invest after-tax return investment. thus, firm expect burden future taxation rise, internal rate return give project lowered, effectively cancel stimulative effect low interest rate investment. and contrast, low expect tax burden increase effectiveness monetary policy measures. but certainty mean also stick commitments. indeed, stick commitment become hallmark euro area. the ecb continue provide nominal anchor euro area recovery deliver primary mandate bring inflation back growth rate close 2%. it essential parallel country follow rule outline stability growth pact (sgp) macroeconomic imbalance procedure (mip) rule stretch point would lose credibility. conclusion my main message today simple: need focus quality credit, quantity. to create environment credit flow productive investment require coherent comprehensive approach. it require manage bank deleveraging process euro area transition balance finance mix. it require find workable solution reduce debt overhang involve reduce debt raise equity. and require act basic determinant investment demand, namely productivity. fortunately, piece jigsaw place achieve approach. bank approach end deleveraging. this create good capitalise sector facilitate restructuring. and emerge consensus importance supply side policy boost growth potential. we simply need put piece together. bi central bankers’ speech 1 manuel sánchez: an economic outlook policy update mexico remark mr manuel sánchez, deputy governor bank mexico, unite states-mexico chamber commerce, new york city, 26 september 2014. * * * i honor invitation vibrant city new york. thank opportunity share think economic outlook policy challenge face mexico. a thing change since last time together, i hope bring date important developments. i would like talk first, current rebound mexican economy financial market performing; then, give perspective inflation monetary policy; finally, describe recent progress mexico’s structural reform agenda. a usual, comment entirely necessarily reflect bank mexico govern board. the current economic rebound at time last year, mexico’s economy deteriorating. today, incipient upswing underway. specifically, second quarter, mexico’s economy post vigorous growth, similar annualized term unite states. data third quarter, include gdp monthly proxy july, suggest momentum continues. improvement industrial sector include strong push manufacture products, transportation equipment particularly well. after six consecutive quarter contraction stagnation, construction see rebound. external demand play predominant role recovery due great manufacture exports, particularly unite states. within category, automobile export stand out. in addition, expansion service continued, especially associate external demand. on domestic side, consumption second quarter pick up, recent sale data suggest pace continues. formal employment expanding, case since 2010. however, total employment stagnant year. the previous two fact consistent slight decline informality. more formal-sector job may provide support high consumption. yet, consumer confidence remain relatively low, indicate fragility there. furthermore, investment second quarter keep revival, drive private sector, could strengthen even near term. indeed, suggest business community’s positive answer survey question whether right moment invest.1 the bank mexico estimate gdp grow 2 2.8 percent 2014 3.2 4.2 percent 2015. consensus analysts’ point forecast fall within intervals.2 the balance risk growth scenario upside. the possibility higher-than-anticipated economic expansion unite states, well constructive 1 see inegi banco de méxico (2014), encuesta mensual de opinión empresarial del sector manufacturero, september. 2 see banco de méxico (2014), quarterly report, april – june 2014, summary, august; blue chip economic indicators, september 2014. 2 bi central bankers’ speech investment sentiment stem progress implementation structural reforms, contribute assessment. financial market development since february, international financial market volatility decline considerably due expectation normalization u.s. monetary policy take place late previously thought, gradual way. a return search yield imply downward shift mexico’s yield curve, together long end u.s. curve. intermittent break calm since end july reflect swing market expectation start u.s. monetary tighten back toward early timeframe, heighten geopolitical pressures. in context, dollar appreciated, price emerging-market financial asset fall somewhat. in mexico, recent increase global risk aversion fuel high term premium government bond along it, steep yield curve. however, peso depreciate le currency many emerging-market economies. both market behave orderly manner, trade volume high bid-ask spread tight. go forward, great financial volatility downward pressure asset price cannot rule out. interest rate wide variety security advance countries, include high-yield bonds, remain close all-time low amid market uncertainty speculative conditions, suggest level sustainable. in monetary policy meet last july, u.s. federal reserve say within close reach medium-term targets. also, many fomc member note convergence target accelerates, would appropriate begin tighten phase sooner previously foreseen. in recent meet september, forecast fomc member feed fund rate seem suggest fast pace normalization previously expected. in similar way, bank england note near reach long-term objectives. future market predict u.s. british policy rate begin rise next year, although uncertainty still reign exact time pace tight policies. add mix unknown factor market must consider, eurozone japan likely poise loosen monetary stance face disappoint economic performance. although net effect world financial market still balance, market currently appear give weight probable tight police unite state unite kingdom. inflation, minimum wage monetary policy since last july, mexico’s annual headline inflation breach upper limit variability interval around central bank’s permanent target 3 percent. this development, surpass market expectations, reflect pressure core component, especially good prices, well noncore component, drive particularly livestock prices. the possible persistence adverse factor make likely inflation remain near 4 percent second half year. some condition contribute decrease inflation next year, base effect 2014 fiscal reform, low rise government-administered gasoline prices, possible drop telephony charge due new regulations. however, impact properly assessed. for example, new gasoline price policy mean absence annual pressure front year. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the balance inflation risk appear upside due following. first, proposal consider substantial rise minimum wages, could generate inertia inflation second-round effect price-formation process. second, possibility unforeseen additional pressure agricultural price persists. historically, component post high average volatile annual change energy government-administered prices. third, risk bout high financial volatility remains, could push price high exchange rate channel. the upside risk especially significant annual headline inflation probably surpass 4 percent year, analysts’ inflation expectation time frame remain permanent target. these challenge merit careful monitoring. i would like add comment possible minimum wage hike mexico. minimum wage feature common countries, mexico exception, level set national commission jurisdictions. what particular country notable deterioration indicator 1980s 1990s due high unstable inflation. this process yield low purchase power salary underscore vital necessity protect significant grind gain last decade battle control inflation, consolidate progress. what effect would minimum wage hike mexico? the economic literature competitive labor market suggest rise real minimum wage hurt employment training, especially young unskilled laborers, promote informality. also, may pass-through increase price final good services. the degree impact remain empirical issue.3 in case mexico, effect could material, least two reasons. first, negotiation private-sector contractual salary tend take account minimum-wage revision floor reference, although two automatically tied. the wage contagion could reflect partly substitution effect away less-skilled workers, phenomenon observe many countries.4 second, minimum wage serf index myriad legal purposes, include fines, tax exemptions, public pensions, government-sponsored mortgages, many private contracts. wage contagion indexation would broaden possible negative real effect economy. furthermore, significant minimum wage hike may contaminate process price formation. these adjustment could trigger chain reaction inflation expectations, complicate challenge bank mexico get inflation converge permanent target. to handle risk indexation, complicate legal change cumbersome contract revision would call for.5 3 for empirical evidence possible effect minimum wage increases, see, example, neumark, d. w. wascher (2008), minimum wages. cambridge, ma: the mit press; neumark, et al. (2013), “revisiting minimum wage-employment debate: throw out baby bathwater?” nber work paper 18681; meer, j. j. west (2013), “effects minimum wage employment dynamics.” nber work paper no. 19262. 4 see, example, maloney, w. j. mendez (2004), “measuring impact minimum wages: evidence latin america.” in heckman, j.j. c. pagés (2004), law employment: lesson latin american caribbean. chicago: university chicago press. 5 there evidence decline real minimum wage mexico increase employment less-skilled female workers. see feliciano, z.m. (1998), “does minimum wage affect employment mexico?” eastern economic journal, 24(2). 4 bi central bankers’ speech an update structural reform a know, mexico embark ambitious structural reform agenda, encompass many sector economy, include labor market, education, financial sector, telecommunications, energy. already year, law cement put finish touch reform finalized. but devil, indeed, details. the quality implementation utmost importance transformation yield expect benefits. reform currently implementation stage. some change come effect mere publication new laws, prohibition bundle sale product financial sector. others imply specific action already contemplated. for example, education, first generalize test place qualify teacher receive elementary school post, break long tradition new graduate teach school automatically hired. in financial sector, newly establish resolution scheme apply case small bank without incident. in telecommunications, arrival new competitors, draw change set rule condition marketplace, set stage possible shakeup. auction nationwide television license offing. much interest focus energy reform. geographical area oil gas exploration production already allocate pemex, first round auction private sector take place early next year. these opportunity generate enthusiasm private sector draw significant investment domestic foreign companies. great competition, turn, boost total factor productivity potential gdp growth medium term. to take full advantage situation, mexico need complement already enact reform change would improve environment conduct business. these measure include strengthen rule law, invest physical infrastructure, enhance public security. conclude remark mexico see incipient economic upturn year, drive strong external demand high domestic spending. the panorama favorable give consistent u.s. economic performance mexican structural reform first stage implementation. mexico’s economy benefit continuation portfolio capital inflow amid benign financial conditions, notwithstanding recent volatility. however, change market sentiment could trigger reversal relative financial bonanza moment. although mexico enjoy strong macroeconomic fundamentals, financial risk continue monitored. continuation recent upward trend inflation well factor may generate additional price pressure risk must carefully watch order make convergence permanent inflation target reality. current discussion recover real value minimum wage underscore need keep upper hand fight inflation. finally, progress structural reform encouraging, implementation time must adequate expect benefit fully materialize. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ardian fullani: overview albania’s late monetary economic development

host afi’s future headquarters; ministers; fellow governors; dr. alfred hannig; distinguish delegates; afi partners; lady gentlemen, good morning. it privilege speak open 2014 alliance financial inclusion (afi) global policy forum (gpf) – quickly evolve world’s major gather policymakers, regulators, prime mover advocate financial inclusion. today, record number 400 participants, 300 percent increase first gpf 2009. let thank central bank governor jwala rambarran host 2014 gpf. we say appropriate hold event paradisical trinidad & tobago, firmly commit member afi. moreover, trinidad tobago birthplace calypso music.1 after all, gpf quite upbeat, fun engage assembly afi member friends. hold gpf 50th anniversary country’s central bank, 100th member afi, lend add color gathering. brief overview afi independence a outgo chair steer committee, i privilege last opportunity open gpf come point afi’s history. the past two year crucial set motion transformational process drive afi journey independence. now cross proverbial rubicon – afi leaf “project” status become international organization. we embark fundamental change require solid resolve global network. afi’s transformation international organization juridical identity strengthen dna – member-driven, equitable, inclusive nature afi’s governance, membership, activities. this dna set afi apart policy-driving network. it effectively mobilize financial sector policymakers, regulator international organizations, proactively confront challenge financial exclusion. the c afi’s success the success afi attribute call three cs: (1) commitment, (2) collaboration, (3) concrete results. commitment important first step attainment goal. a one pioneer members, bangko sentral ng pilipinas (bsp) attest steadfast engagement afi member partner activity program toward financial inclusion. we benefit commitment visionary fund partner believe concept afi sustain u journey toward increase access financial service poor. the trust support bill melinda gate foundation, german 1 a kind west indian (originally trinidadian) music syncopate african rhythm, typically word improvise topical theme (oxford dictionary). 2 bi central bankers’ speech international cooperation (giz), federal ministry economic cooperation development (bmz) donor like australian agency international development (ausaid), facilitate exponential growth afi. within six short years, network 120 member institution 95 develop countries. future commitment like-minded donor surely fortify afi’s ability continuously undertake important mission. afi would without commitment member devote substantial time, resource expertise make afi activity fruitful successful. if count face-to-face meet seven afi work groups2, get total 57 meet 2010 2014. steer

accomplishment vary country country account domestic contexts, significant outcome maya declaration increase institutional accountability. by afi’s count, total 71 measurable policy improvement make maya countries. the second c blend collaboration cooperation, describe (1) afi member interact other, (2) afi network engage external stakeholders. collaboration cooperation inherent design afi’s signature platform – work group knowledge exchanges. the work groups, membership total least 194 individuals, function “communities practice”. a peer equal footing, share discus idea produce output relevant policymaking program development. these output include guideline notes, discussion papers, surveys, data indicators, case study peer review – collectively call knowledge products. these product constitute majority afi library, serve useful reference afi member external interest parties. like afi members, bsp benefit work groups, implement various aspect financial inclusion agenda. for example, national baseline survey financial inclusion enrich thru peer review cnbv mexico bank tanzania data work group. our regulatory perspective digital financial inclusion constantly deepen thru interaction mobile financial service work group. these examples, consider bsp active member work groups, save regional group pacific islands. on hand, knowledge exchange (kx) – one avail grant afi member – structured, purposive onsite study visit. a recipient one, host 20 afi knowledge exchange since 2010, bsp attest kx mutually 2 afi six work group thematic focus consumer empowerment market conduct; financial inclusion data; global standard proportionality (originally financial integrity); mobile financial services; small medium enterprises; financial inclusion strategy. the seventh work group focus financial inclusion pacific islands. bi central bankers’ speech 3 beneficial visitor host. it facilitate open, candid dialogue among regulator face similar issues, operate different domestic situations. many policy solution inform lesson learn knowledge exchanges. for example, consumer protection framework financial education program inspire learned, small measure, kx

collaboration cooperation likewise characterize afi’s engagement external stakeholders. this approach result reward partnership increase global attention financial inclusion. let cite examples: we initiated, continue deepen engagement standard set body (ssbs) thru structure peer learn program. global standard greatly affect level exclusion, well range, quality affordability financial product available client bottom pyramid. afi unique position contribute value ssb discussions; give wealth experience membership practice proportionality principle; manner conducive financial inclusion. presently, bsp chair basel consultative group workstream financial inclusion. this work group aim form overall risk picture financial inclusion would particular relevance bank supervisor around world. afi member provide invaluable input workstream thru participation range practice survey. a implement partner g20 global partnership financial inclusion (gpfi), afi gain stature voice develop world area financial inclusion. we significantly contribute development g20 principle innovative financial inclusion. finally, afi’s regular collaboration g24 conduct policy forums, continue deepen awareness financial inclusion issues, inspire action among g24 member countries. commitment, collaboration cooperation necessary, insufficient beget success. these factor must translate third c – concrete results. the results-oriented culture afi ensure policy solutions, regulatory enhancement program intervention always benefit ultimate stakeholder target serve: financially-excluded. to date, see policy solution result in: • 16.7 million mobile money account 15 percent adults, achieve within 2.5 year bangladesh • 7 million mobile money account 67 percent adults, achieve within 7 year kenya

potter, executive vice president market group federal reserve bank new york, japan center economic research, tokyo, 25 september 2014. * * * i would like thank deborah leonard matthew raskin excellent assistance preparation remark colleague federal reserve system numerous insightful comment suggestions. thank you, takeuchi-san. it pleasure reconnect tokyo honor opportunity speak distinguish audience. central bank respond aggressively financial crisis begin 2007 slow recovery that’s followed, take unprecedented step provide monetary policy accommodation pursuit macroeconomic policy objectives. in so, many adapt unconventional way framework tool use implement policy decisions. my remark today focus role play open market trade desk (the desk) federal reserve bank new york implementation monetary policy u.s., evolution operational tool recent years. i discus implication change federal reserve’s balance sheet eventual “normalization” monetary policy federal open market committee (fomc) belief appropriate remove extraordinary level monetary policy accommodation provided. finally, i discus consideration must take account normalize monetary policy. a always, view necessarily reflect new york feed federal reserve system. the desk’s role implement monetary policy the federal reserve (the fed) somewhat complex organizational governance structure central bank around world, discuss recent development implementation monetary policy, i’d like take moment describe role responsibility within federal reserve system desk fit in. the statutory basis u.s. monetary policy find federal reserve act, enact 100 year ago. modern language around monetary policy objective add 1977, board governor federal reserve system federal open market committee charge congress maintain “long run growth monetary credit aggregates…so promote effectively goal maximum employment, stable prices, moderate long-term interest rates.” the goal maximum employment price stability come know fed’s “dual mandate.” formulate policy pursuit dual mandate province two separate-but-related policymaking entity within federal reserve system (the system) – board governor federal reserve system (the board governors) fomc (which i also refer “the committee”) – responsibility certain policy tools. the fomc principal body monetary policymaking consist seven member board governor plus president twelve federal reserve bank (only five vote member give year). the fomc responsible use open market operation (omos), purchase sale security open market system open market account (soma), fed’s security 2 bi central bankers’ speech portfolio. omos traditionally primary tool monetary policy implemented. the board governor responsible several complementary policy tools. these tool pertain largely depository institution (dis “banks”) include discount rate – is, rate bank borrow discount window, fed’s lend facility administer twelve regional federal reserve bank – policy around reserve hold depository institution feed (including reserve requirements, recently, payment interest reserve balance term deposits).1 however, it’s important note tool merely mean end, use influence financial condition order achieve federal reserve’s dual mandate. since 1936, new york feed select year fomc bank within system responsible execution omos. within new york fed, desk, guidance manager soma select fomc – currently – responsible conduct open market operation authorization direction fomc.2 in practice, fomc’s operate objective omos – example, target rate overnight interest rate specify amount asset purchase – communicate desk policy “directive” committee vote conclusion meeting. this directive specifically instruct desk conduct transaction soma furtherance desire operate objective. the fed’s change operate framework in recent years, like many central bank around world face great recession prolong economic recovery followed, feed adopt unconventional measure provide monetary policy accommodation pursuit macroeconomic policy objectives. this reflect change fed’s operate framework fomc’s operate objective omos. for many decade prior crisis, operate objective omos express target federal fund rate – overnight, unsecured rate market reserve balances. the target rate achieve permanent temporary omos seek adjust supply reserve balance bank system level expect equal estimate level demand reserve balance fomc’s target rate. the desk’s permanent addition supply reserve balance design fall somewhat short total demand, create “structural deficiency” supply reserves. the desk conduct daily fine-tune operation temporarily add reserve balance get desire level. these daily operation represent marginal adjustment aggregate supply reserves, largely response exogenous impact transitory change feed liability currency circulation level u.s. treasury’s account balance fed. minor variation total level reserve supply could move equilibrium market rate individual depository institution deficiency reserve find trade depository institution surplus reserves. this system function relatively low level reserve balances.3 the desk able reliably achieve fomc’s 1 the board governor also responsible supervision regulation bank systemically important financial institutions, payment system infrastructure, overall oversight federal reserve system. it may also authorize federal reserve bank extend credit entity emergency lend authority. 2 the fomc’s authorization domestic open market operation authorization foreign currency operation outline activity select bank eligible undertake. the domestic policy directive foreign currency directive specifically instruct desk execute operation furtherance particular operate objective define fomc. 3 in five year prior crisis, total reserve balance average $20 billion excess reserve – balance excess require satisfy reserve balance requirement – average $1.5 billion. bi central bankers’ speech 3 policy directive implementation framework. the effective federal fund rate – average rate prevail broke federal fund market day – routinely hit fomc’s target rate, generate high degree confidence among market participant desk’s ability implement policy. this operate framework change financial crisis deepened. by december 2008, fomc low target federal fund rate point target 5¼ percent mid-2007 target range zero ¼ percent. with federal fund rate short-term interest rate effectively zero low bound, fomc’s operate objective omos expand include adjustment size composition federal reserve’s security portfolio. in particular, fomc initiate large-scale asset purchase (lsaps) agency mortgage-backed security (mbs), agency debt, late longer-term treasury securities, order put downward pressure longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, help make broad financial condition accommodative. the expansion domestic security portfolio result lsaps vastly increase supply reserve balance system (figure 1).4 importantly, october 2008, feed grant authority pay interest depository institutions’ reserve balances.5 in environment elevate reserve balance result fed’s asset purchases, payment interest excess reserve (ioer) – currently rate ¼ percent – keep overnight federal fund rate within target range (figure 2).6 although fomc continue direct desk undertake omos necessary maintain condition reserve market consistent federal fund trade range zero ¼ percent, desk need conduct omos manage supply reserve since december 2008. instead, omos focus directive adjust size composition soma portfolio. since late 2008, fomc direct desk carry three large-scale asset purchase program several portfolio-oriented initiatives, maturity extension program (mep) change reinvestment policy (figure 3). under mep, commonly refer market participant “operation twist,” fomc lengthen maturity profile soma’s portfolio treasury security offset purchase longer-term treasury security sale equal par amount shorter-term security redemption mature ones.7 additionally, since mid-2010, fomc direct desk reinvest roll payment principal security hold soma, 4 these asset purchase follow various program feed initiate crisis support liquidity financial institution foster improve condition financial markets. credit extension crisis-related program temporary nature, impact program reserve balance unwind loan repaid. in contrast, reserve expansion associate lsaps endure effect long asset remain soma portfolio, subject offset influence reserve change balance sheet items. 5 the authority federal reserve pay interest reserve balance hold depository institution grant congress prior crisis, financial service regulatory relief act 2006, plan effective date october 2011. however, implementation accelerate part response financial crisis. the statute authorize federal reserve bank pay interest balance maintain satisfy reserve balance requirement (required reserves) excess balance (excess reserves). 6 a note earlier, board governor responsible set rate interest reserves. since december 16, 2008, interest rate require reserve balance excess reserve balance ¼ percent, rate need same. although interest rate reserve represent overnight rate, calculate pay lag basis accord two-week reserve management maintenance periods. the payment base daily account balance weight average applicable overnight rate maintenance period. more information find regulation d. 7 the mep provide additional monetary policy accommodation increase duration soma portfolio, unlike lsap programs, net neutral effect level reserves. 4 bi central bankers’ speech maintain size portfolio adjust asset type maturity composition holdings.8 large-scale asset purchase policy tool execution of course, audience know well, federal reserve first major central bank use alternative tool monetary policy implementation zero low bound. the quantitative ease policy (qep) bank japan (boj) initiate combat deflation 2001, operate time policy zero interest rates, provide valuable precedent central banker elsewhere face similar challenge late decade. however, balance sheet expansion boj’s original quantitative ease differ significantly asset purchase program undertake advance economy central bank recent years, include boj’s current quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe). the early qep liability-driven program boj change operate objective overnight interest rate quantitative target level current account balance outstanding boj (the counterpart reserve balance hold depository institution fed). to achieve new target, boj provide ample liquidity range operations. although boj increase outright purchase long-term government bond part initiative, large share ease accomplish temporary open market operation purchase short-term securities. in contrast, fomc’s portfolio-oriented program drive desire expand lengthen maturity structure asset side fed’s balance sheet order put downward pressure longer-term interest rates. the accompany growth reserve balance byproduct purchases, specify objective. former feed chairman bernanke refer approach “credit easing,” contrast boj’s “quantitative easing.”9 the fomc’s different objective omos reflect primary transmission channel lsaps understand affect financial economic conditions. central bank purchase longer-term bond reduce stock security hold private investors. accordingly, purchase remove duration risk – case agency mbs, prepayment risk – private sector, drive term risk premium asset low would otherwise be.10 this re-pricing risk ultimately put downward pressure long-term interest rates, effect spread asset investor rebalance portfolios. the term premium effect fed’s purchase continue influence financial condition long asset remain soma portfolio, although size effect diminish time risk associate portfolio diminishes. some standard portfolio risk measure illustrate degree federal reserve absorb extra duration risk onto balance sheet. the soma treasury portfolio currently average duration 7.5 years, compare pre-crisis level 2.6 years. meanwhile, duration risk entire domestic security portfolio, include agency mb agency debt well treasury securities, equivalent $2.9 trillion 10-year treasury security (figure 4). purchase likely also work 8 from mid-august 2010 september 2011, principal payment hold agency debt agency mb reinvested longer-term treasury securities. since october 2011, reinvested agency mbs. 9 ben s. bernanke, “the crisis policy response,” stamp lecture, london school economics, london, england, january 13, 2009. 10 a security’s duration capture weight average term maturity security’s cash flow provide measure sensitivity security’s price change interest rates. duration (and therefore price risk) generally great longer-maturity lower-coupon securities. agency mb price additionally carry prepayment risk, risk associate uncertainty around time principal cash flow owe fact homeowner option prepay mortgage time. because embed option, agency mb cash flow vary interest rate change. bi central bankers’ speech 5 signal effect, extent perceive credible signal central bank’s intention regard future level short-term interest rates. and circumstance market function unusually strained, case prior fed’s first lsap program, asset purchase may enhance liquidity central bank’s consistent significant presence market. over past six years, fomc flexible use tools, adapt learn individual circumstance changed. in first two lsap program mep, example, fomc communicate expect total size completion date program. however, third (and current) lsap program outcome-based, fomc announce monthly pace composition purchase note purchase would continue substantial improvement outlook labor market context price stability. other central bank also use conditional asset purchase effectively. perhaps best example outright monetary transaction program announce european central bank (ecb) september 2012. this program credit help stabilize euro-area fix income market rule certain bad equilibria. this success achieve without purchase single asset. another example conditional asset purchase boj’s statement commitment continue qep inflation register stably zero. change fed’s balance sheet implication normalization so now? the current purchase program appear near completion. last week, fomc direct desk reduce purchase treasury security $10 billion per month purchase agency mb $5 billion per month start october. the committee also indicate end current purchase program next meet incoming information broadly support expectation ongoing improvement labor market condition inflation move back toward longer-run objective. it also direct desk maintain agency mb treasury security reinvestment policy – activity separately announce expect continue begin increase target range federal fund rate. should course come pass, domestic security portfolio peak par value $4.2 trillion – five-fold increase since start financial crisis august 2007. the composition portfolio also remain complex. formerly compose entirely treasury securities, domestic portfolio 60 percent treasury securities, remainder hold agency mb (and small amount agency debt securities). a i note earlier, weight average maturity treasury portfolio lengthen substantially, mep essentially eliminate portfolio’s hold treasury security mature prior february 2016. meanwhile, it’s hard predict exact pace soma portfolio’s agency mb hold pay time give prepayment uncertainty associate securities. at last week’s meeting, fomc also reaffirm view likely appropriate maintain current zero ¼ percent target range federal fund rate considerable time asset purchase program ends, especially project inflation continue run committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, provide longer-term inflation expectation remain well anchored. meanwhile, matter prudent planning, committee deliberate proceed remove policy accommodation (often call “normalization”), belief appropriate time comes. although specific time yet known, it’s certain level reserve balance bank system high. assume liability issued, would $2.9 trillion reserve – mostly excess reserve – committee end asset purchase next month continue reinvestments. in itself, elevate level reserve balance need impede fomc’s ability effectively raise level short-term interest rate ability pay interest excess reserves. 6 bi central bankers’ speech follow last week’s fomc meeting, committee release revise set normalization principle plan (taking account change soma portfolio enhancement available tool since originally issue principle june 2011) intend implement become appropriate begin normalize stance monetary policy. importantly, chair note post-meeting press conference, statement intend provide information public eventual normalization process; signal change current future stance monetary policy. accord principles, committee adjust level monetary accommodation primarily utilize policy tool influence level short-term interest rate – first instance, use tool rate directly administer fed. tool immobilize drain large level reserve tighten control federal fund rate also remain available. however, principle envision active adjustment soma portfolio play feature role. specifically, fomc indicate federal fund rate continue play central role fed’s operate framework communication normalization, raise target range federal fund rate economic condition warrant le accommodative monetary policy stance. adjustment interest rate feed pay depository institution excess reserve balance – is, ioer rate – primary tool move federal fund rate target range. raise ioer rate put upward pressure range market interest rate influence overall financial condition way foster federal reserve’s macroeconomic objectives. the committee also indicate overnight reverse repurchase agreement (on rrp) facility supplementary tool used, needed, help control level federal fund rate. an on rrp facility supplement primary role ioer control federal fund rate provide alternative safe, overnight asset money market investors. i describe role on rrp facility detail moment.11 the committee expect gradually return balance sheet normal size composition, primarily cease reinvest repayment principal. a halt reduction reinvestments expect occur fomc begin increase target range federal fund rate. the fomc plan use asset sale part normalization process, suggest limit sale might warrant long run reduce eliminate residual agency mb holdings. the federal reserve continue test tool gather additional information efficacy enhance operational readiness prior liftoff. for past year, desk conduct exercise on rrp operations. conduct on rrps same-day settlement broad range counterparties – include primary dealers, money funds, government-sponsored enterprises, bank – allow federal reserve provide safe, liquid investment wide range money market participant able earn ioer, thus expand universe counterparties generally unwilling lend rate available federal reserve. the increase competition availability instrument provide help firm floor level short-term interest rate – is, rate beneath market participant theoretically unwilling lend funds. indeed, on rrp exercise result first year suggest operation successful work ioer establish floor level key money market rate (figure 5). 11 a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo, rrp) type temporary omo desk sell security soma portfolio eligible counterparty agreement repurchase security specify price specific time future. it economically equivalent collateralize investment feed difference sale price repurchase price, adjust time transaction legs, imply rate interest pay feed cash invest counterparty. bi central bankers’ speech 7 all desk’s eligible counterparty type participate on rrps, money fund account large share take-up (figure 6). take-up operation generally increase spread market rate on rrp offer rate narrows. take-up also rise substantially around quarter- year-end financial report dates, money market participants’ access overnight secure investment limited. the increase take-up date especially large prime money market fund (figure 7). in addition pattern usage on rrps themselves, also analyze trade pattern interest rate dynamic secure unsecured fund markets. in so, use wide range data, include transaction data unsecured fund market obtain new federal reserve collection effort (fr 2420). while on rrps powerful tool policy implementation, fomc market participant note potential large regular usage alter pattern financial intermediation or, fixed-rate structure take-up limits, exacerbate liquidity pressure time stress. to examine on rrps might best structure supplement ioer control federal fund rate limit potential unintended effect financial markets, fomc direct desk test several change design on rrp operations. a monday, per-counterparty maximum bid limit raise $10 billion $30 billion, overall size limit $300 billion impose operation. if total amount bid receive operation le equal $300 billion size limit, award make fix offer rate. however, total amount bid receive exceed overall operation size limit, $300 billion on rrps allocate single-price auction use interest rate counterparties include bids. award make “stopout rate” – rate overall size limit achieve – bid rate award full bid rate award pro rata basis. the stopout rate determine evaluate bid ascend order submit rate point total quantity offer equal overall size limit.12 the federal reserve closely analyze result on rrp exercise conduct new test parameter order understand on rrp facility might best structure initial stage normalization process. in addition, federal reserve board test facility offer term deposit credentialed depository institutions. term deposit facility (tdf) transaction could use temporarily reduce quantity reserve balances. an eight-week series test summer explore demand term deposit respond variation maximum award limit rates. high offer rate attract great use, term number participant total dollar volume demanded. demand tdf may temper somewhat instruments’ lack early-withdrawal feature, thus inability consider high-quality liquid asset regulatory purposes. the next round tdf testing, commence october, incorporate early withdrawal feature, well gradually increase maximum award amount rate. a broad perspective normalization i’ve discuss fomc’s eventual approach remove monetary policy accommodation reflect development federal reserve’s balance sheet since onset financial crisis. a note earlier, relatively long maturity structure soma portfolio mean level reserve balance u.s. bank system decline slowly passive means, absent asset sales. other central bank undertake unconventional measure also face (or eventually face) similar challenge deem appropriate begin policy normalizations. 12 for detail on rrp operations, please see faq new york fed’s website. 8 bi central bankers’ speech the bank england (boe) bank japan two relevant example come immediately mind. the boe’s asset purchase facility, monetary policy committee (mpc) purchase £375 billion longer-term asset 2009 2012, quite comparable purpose design fed’s lsap programs. moreover, since march 2013, boe reinvested cash flow associate mature gild facility order maintain stock security steady level. in february 2014 inflation report, mpc provide guidance expect normalization framework, lay approach bank rate – deposit rate central bank reserve u.k. – active marginal instrument monetary policy portfolio-related tools, include reinvestments asset sales, receive le emphasis. specifically, mpc suggest intend maintain stock purchase assets, include reinvesting cash flow associate mature securities, least raise target short-term interest rate current level. meanwhile, boj still purchase asset qqe, launch april 2013. with goal increase japanese government bond (jgb) hold ¥50 trillion per year, yet initiate discussion eventual normalization. when time comes, however, boj hold large portfolio longer-term jgbs. the boj’s balance sheet therefore look markedly different qep end 2006, time boj allow short-term funds-supplying operation roll off. the portfolio size composition central bank eventually normalize will, course, depend eventually determine appropriate support implementation monetary policy long run. indeed, fomc indicate long run, hold security necessary implement monetary policy efficiently effectively, hold primarily treasury securities. the ecb also use unconventional measure provide accommodation, unlike federal reserve, boj, boe, primarily liquidity provide directly bank system via longer-term refinance operations, rather asset purchases. this liquidity provide fix term three years, thus allow size ecb’s balance sheet normalize automatically refinance agreement mature. by contrast, ecb’s upcoming purchase asset-backed security cover bond present longer-term portfolio considerations. finally, i note central bank – like financial market participant – need remain aware change financial market landscape operate. they may need adapt operation accordingly move away asset purchase back money market instrument implement monetary policy. for example, addition reflect development balance sheet since financial crisis, fomc’s approach normalize policy also reflect change u.s. money market dynamic influence various factors. these factor include extraordinary level liquidity that’s provided, access ioer limit depository institutions, number international domestic regulatory reforms. international regulatory reform include liquidity coverage ratio, leverage ratio, net stable fund ratio. in u.s., change deposit insurance premium calculations, rule govern money market mutual funds, potential capital surcharge base part short-term wholesale fund may also affect certain market participants. many change regulation – along change market structure, technology, factor – may affect market participants’ activity relationship money markets. on net, balance sheet cost may higher, may prompt money market participant require high return engage competition arbitrage wedge money market rate alter participation central bank operation facilities. this outcome may affect transmission monetary policy require central bank adapt operation accommodate realities. conclusion in conclusion, i’d like note framework implement monetary policy landscape operate see important change year since crisis, bi central bankers’ speech 9 continue evolve. the desk play important role process, carry open market operation direction fomc, pursuit operate objective fomc deem appropriate achieve dual mandate maximum employment price stability. the operate tool federal reserve develop allow u tighten monetary policy fomc determine appropriate so, i doubt continue learn tool interact normalize policy make adjustment time, do past. we also learn share experience central bank undergo similar transitions. thank you. 10 bi central bankers’ speech

central bank, euro conference – lithuania, vilnius, 25 september 2014. * * * summary the euro area benefit lithuania’s accession least two ways: first, lithuania show adjustment necessary, also possible – even without currency devaluation; second, lithuania’s decision join euro area demonstrate common currency attractive. lithuania – amongst others – benefit say monetary policy-making world’s second large economy. initial scepticism among lithuanian regard introduction euro already transform increase support people become inform new currency changeover modalities. join euro area follow economic considerations: bind commitment european values. *** dear prime minister butkevičius, dear vice president katainen, dear finance minister šadžius, dear chairman vasiliauskas, excellencies, lady gentlemen, you might aware timer door lietuvos bankas, lithuania’s central bank, count euro changeover – le 100 day [98 days] remain lithuania adopt euro. lietuvos bankas instal countdown clock two month ago, council european union give green light adoption euro, i sure many u anticipate day much longer. and probably ask ourselves: lithuania’s accession mean euro area euro changeover mean lithuania? in remark today i elaborate aspects. how euro area benefit lithuania’s membership? with lithuania introduce euro, three baltic country soon part currency union. this great asset euro area, least demonstrate euro area’s attractiveness. not long ago baltic country midst deep recession. in 2009 lithuania’s gdp decline roughly 15%. today, lithuania one fast grow country europe. last year gdp grow 3.3%, whereas euro area’s gdp shrink 0.4%. quite remarkably, lithuania manage reboot economy without external support. the baltic country demonstrate adjustment possible – even without currency devaluation. while lithuania’s government deficit stand 9.4% 2009, last year fall 2.1% expect decline further. 2 bi central bankers’ speech beyond economic aspects, baltic success story also show adjustment politically feasible. despite major fiscal consolidation, hardly public protest government measures. so possible? in view, draw important lesson baltic experience: government act boldly, also immediately. they use momentum crisis implement necessary consolidation thus manage convince public need measures. besides politically astute, swift bold action key strengthen investors’ trust. it enable baltic country recover quickly recession. the baltic case show – consolidation might weigh temporarily economic growth short term – basis sustainable growth long run. beyond show commitment make economy fit euro area, lithuania also contribute make currency union whole stable – even become part it: priority set last year eu presidency include step towards bank union deepen economic monetary union. to resume, euro area benefit lithuania’s accession least two ways: first, lithuania show adjustment necessary, also possible – even without currency devaluation; second, lithuania’s decision join euro area demonstrate common currency attractive, despite difficulty euro area member countries. how lithuania benefit become part euro area? but lithuanian public agree lithuania benefit membership euro area? or introduction euro project political elites? i aware lithuanian would rather stick litas. accord survey data, half population favour introduction euro. we certainly need take scepticism seriously. europe cannot simply project impose elite without back general public. recent experience shows, however, initial scepticism might well turn support, people become inform new currency changeover modalities. prior respective accessions, seem citizen baltic country really mood euro either. however, information campaign reality new currency result grow support – trend already observe lithuania. accord late survey data, support single currency increase 18 percentage point late last year mid-2014 lithuania. in latvia, even increase 30 percentage point (to 68%) period.1 and, even though public support european project decline across member state crisis, anything, citizen euro area country persistently demonstrate solid support common currency. in essence, sceptical new currency two concerns: first, worry changeover might lead price increases; second, afraid country might lose part identity. compare eu member state yet part euro area, concern especially high lithuania. three-quarters survey respondent lithuania believe introduce euro lead increase prices.2 i confident demonstrate worry unwarranted. first, ecb competent 1 http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_en.htm. 2 http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_400_en.pdf. bi central bankers’ speech 3 monetary policy authority lithuania part euro area. and i assure take price stability mandate seriously continue so. second, lithuanian authority draw experience 18 previous euro changeover design measure prevent unjustified price increases. i trust make sure new banknote coin purchase power litas. what main concern, loss national identity? design antanas žukauskas, new coin resemble litas coins, show vytis (“the chaser”), adaption country’s coat arms. but lithuania bring national symbol euro area. in join euro area, lithuania effectively re-gain part sovereignty give earlier. lithuania’s minister finance, rimantas šadžius, allegedly said, “we already euro, different name”. what refer fact litas peg euro since 2002. but even then, lithuania’s monetary policy constrain fix exchange rate: 1994 2002 litas peg u dollar. the chairman board lietuvos bankas, vitas vasiliauskas, already participate twice observer monetary policy meet ecb’s govern council. a january next year, participate actively monetary policy-making world’s second large economy. this show that, era nation state closely interlinked, share sovereignty mean gain sovereignty. if explain properly, i sure convince worry lose part national identity that, rather lose something, gain close integration. there are, course, many way lithuania benefit part euro area. to name one, international investor usually perceive baltic country belong economic area. with latvia estonia already use euro, lithuania would clear competitive disadvantage come attract investment abroad delay adopt euro. furthermore, belong common currency area may provide stability country current geopolitical environment. i appreciate lithuanian government approve public information communication strategy euro adoption. and i trust best implement strategy “laisvė, vienybė, gerovė” (freedom, unity, well-being) inscribe edge new two euro coins, become reality. conclusion the way lithuania strive become part euro area show common currency attractive – despite difficulty experience member countries. but join euro area follow economic considerations: bind commitment european values. i happy see lithuania ready make commitment – welcome lithuania! bi central

bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: introductory remark ep’s economic monetary affair committee speech mr mario draghi, president european central bank, european parliament’s economic monetary affair committee, brussels, 22 september 2014. * * * mr chairman, honourable member economic monetary affair committee, lady gentlemen, this hear today take place moment change ecb. on 4 november, ecb become bank supervisor euro area, include direct supervision 120 large banks. this mark big step european economic integration since inception euro. we well prepare step, also conscious important additional responsibility take on. additionally, course come months, majority ecb’s service move new ecb premise frankfurt ostend, ssm staff remain city centre. this also geographically underline separation ecb’s new supervisory function tasks. in context, i wish inform publish today decision implementation separation ecb’s monetary policy supervisory function require ssm regulation. i know 3 november, eve start single supervision, ample opportunity discus chair supervisory board. by then, result comprehensive assessment also known. against background, i today hear focus attention traditional task ecb – particular monetary policy. economic situation the economic recovery euro area lose momentum. follow moderate expansion recent quarters, growth euro area real gdp come halt second quarter year. the early information economic condition receive summer somewhat weak expected. while industrial production manufacture order july give reason optimism, recent survey indicator give indication sharp decline register august stopped. look ahead, continue expect euro area domestic demand support various factors. these include accommodative monetary policy stance, favourable finance conditions, structural reform sustain private consumption investment. at time, unacceptably high unemployment continue weak credit growth likely curb strength recovery. the risk surround expect expansion clearly downside. in particular, heighten geopolitical tension could dampen business consumer confidence. risk insufficient structural reform could weigh business environment. from high 3.0% toward end 2011, inflation euro area downward path considerable period time. in august, inflation estimate reach low 0.3% revise late 0.4%. we expect inflation remain low level come months, increase gradually 2015 2016. give prolong period low inflation already experienced, closely monitor risk price development look forward. we focus particular 2 bi central bankers’ speech possible repercussion dampen growth dynamics, geopolitical developments, exchange rate development pass-through monetary policy measures. tltros, september measures, transmission mechanism before turn late monetary policy decisions, let stress ecb do lot past three year safeguard price stability. we successfully fight confidence crisis euro raise interest rate abnormal levels. we provide euro area bank system unprecedented funding. we continuously low policy rates. yet, backdrop persistently weak inflation outlook, slow growth momentum, subdue monetary credit dynamics, decide early september adopt number additional monetary policy initiative complete complement measure already announce june. first, low key ecb interest rate 10 basis point effective low bound. the main refinance rate stand 0.05%, deposit facility rate –0.20%. second, announce measure enhance function monetary policy transmission, support lend real economy provide monetary accommodation give reach low bound. restore function transmission, notably bank lending, instrumental ensure monetary policy stimulus introduce reach final borrower thereby support real incomes, spend price formation. follow announcement, ab purchase programme (abspp) soon start purchase simple transparent security underlie asset consist claim euro area non-financial private sector. we also start purchase cover bond issue euro area mfis new cover bond purchase programme (cbpp3). these measure effectively complement strengthen target longer-term refinance operation (tltros) whose first allotment conduct day ago. in respect, let provide fresh detail outcome first tltro operation. last thursday, 255 bank participate first tltro amount 82.6 billion euros. this within range take-up value expect base banks’ reveal behaviour previous programmes. in december, bank another opportunity borrow fund form tltro initial allowance, entitle borrow cumulative amount – september december 2014 tender – equivalent 7% outstanding stock loan non-financial private sector exclude loan household house purchase. by design, september december operation assess combination. a next year, additional quarterly allotment bank able receive additional fund determine recent lend performance. while yet early ass impact tltros broad economy, announcement already noticeable positive impact financial market sentiment. overall, expect tltros act powerful tool strengthen transmission monetary policy facilitate new credit flow real economy, give predominantly bank-based finance structure euro area economy. impact channel additional measure the additional measure take september empower credit ease impact tltros three directions. first, expect purchase simple transparent ab bi central bankers’ speech 3 strengthen direct pass-through effect – i.e. extent fund cost relief bank pass along borrower – associate tltros measurable extent. this ab market remain severely impair – potential intervention change market dynamic high particular market – link spread ab trade secondary market lend rate bank apply primary market credit collateralise security direct tight. second, portfolio rebalancing channel, expansion liquidity result combine operation promote diversification investment pattern investor community, thereby ease finance condition broadly. third, believe overall monetary policy package underpin forward guidance determination accomplish expansionary stance extend horizon keep price stability mandate desire see inflation stabilise around level close 2% medium term. feature risk management new programme be market abs, particular, sufficiently ample allow sizeable purchases? our purchase include fairly wide range simple transparent ab collateralised loan real economy. the total stock eligible security currently outstanding – hold investors’ portfolio retain originate bank – already sizeable. we confident grow result presence market. over time, purchase contribute normalisation trade conditions, secondary market issuance activity expand segment currently inactive. a experience central bank engage outright purchase structure product demonstrate, market size purchase volume certain extent co-determined endogenous. will new initiative magnify eurosystem’s exposure risk? outright purchase increase size ecb’s balance sheet, additional risk exposure limited. under ab purchase programme purchase senior guarantee mezzanine tranches. regard senior securities, would buy asset eligible eurosystem operations. so, ample experience manage understand risk associate asset class. the asset purchase would satisfy high standard transparency simplicity also characterise low default risk. the large degree credit enhancement originator build structure financial transaction senior tranche attract high rat make eligible programme function protective layer losses. a guarantee mezzanine tranches, intrinsic credit risk would comparable guarantor, national supranational entity. cover bond share important feature abs, therefore obvious complement abs-centred programme. first, link establish issue bank’s balance sheet cover bond, one side, loan back cover bond, other, reasonably tight. a price cover bond bid up, expect bank respond market incentive originate saleable cover securities, thus loan collateralise them. second, outright intervention market complement ab purchase reinforce portfolio rebalancing channel transmission generate positive spill-overs market securities. this ease fund credit condition help transmission monetary policy. the govern council emphasise combination measure announce june september sizeable impact ecb balance sheet, expect move towards dimension use begin 2012. 4 bi central bankers’ speech with purchase programmes, start transition monetary policy framework predominantly found passive provision central bank credit active control management balance sheet. conclusion the govern council remain fully determine counter risk medium-term outlook inflation. therefore, stand ready use additional unconventional instrument within mandate, alter size / composition unconventional intervention become necessary address risk prolong period low inflation. let add however success measure critically depend number factor outside realm monetary policy. courageous structural reform improvement competitiveness corporate sector key improve business environment. this would foster urgently need investment create great demand credit. structural reform thus crucially complement ecb’s accommodative monetary policy stance empower effective transmission monetary policy. a i indicate several occasions, monetary – also fiscal – stimulus ever meaningful effect without structural reforms. the crisis full confidence return real economy particular capacity willingness firm take risks, invest, create jobs. this depend variety factors, include monetary policy also, even importantly, implementation structural reforms, uphold credibility fiscal framework, strengthen euro area governance. originally, also choose “inflation differential euro area” one topic today’s hearing. i hope understand give important decision take july september, i focus remark monetary policy measures. nevertheless, i course stand ready would interest discus matter persistent inflation differentials, especially give link structural reform agenda. i look forward discussion. bi central bankers’ speech 1 carolyn wilkins: monetary policy underwhelming recovery remark m carolyn wilkins, senior deputy governor bank canada, sfa society toronto, toronto, ontario, 22 september 2014. * * * introduction good afternoon. thank invite me. i’m delight today group accomplish investment professionals. what i speak today intertwine professional world mine. let start we’ve observed: recovery global financial crisis underwhelming, say least. it leave u debate kind growth reasonably expect much disappointment. it also leave u debate central bank conduct monetary policy without compromise financial stability. during crisis, central bank government take unprecedented action. they work together prevent failure systemically important financial institutions, provide exceptional monetary fiscal stimulus. these policy successful prevent worst. but even forceful policy response could prevent severe protract global recession. massive amount wealth destroyed. the value equity house plunged. the loss global output roughly $10 trillion end last year. all told, crisis leave global economy 62 million few jobs.1 the recovery repeat false start still face considerable headwinds. global growth average around 3 per cent past two years. that’s well average prior crisis, unlikely 2014 much better. financial market reflect low expectations. that’s part reason long-term interest rate major advance economies, include canada, low. today i’m go talk three important matter central banks. first, conduct monetary policy, need know much slow growth cyclical much structural. second, calibrate policy need know factors, take together, affect neutral rate interest. and third, make judgment impact factor exact science. a know, lot uncertainty. that take risk management approach achieve inflation target. disentangle cyclical structural factor so much slow growth cyclical much structural? history teach u balance-sheet recession world see typically follow growth much slow wake normal recession. the legacy financial crisis heavy burden country, pay debt impede normal economic growth long time.2 this make task disentangle cyclical structural difficult, need do order determine rate non-inflationary 1 this estimation job loss relative trend. see “global employment trend 2014: the risk jobless recovery,” international labour organization, geneva, 2014. 2 this pattern well document harvard professor carmen reinhart kenneth rogoff, among others. 2 bi central bankers’ speech growth. a inflation targeters, rate potential output growth matter lot us. it critical input appropriate path policy rates. lose potential crisis cyclical factor clearly play star role underwhelming recovery. during crisis, demand plummet output. a worker leave labour force firm cancel capital investment go business, potential output growth decline well. we still face headwind deleveraging households, fiscal consolidation uncertainty. we estimate potential output canada 3 per cent would without recession. that’s roughly $3,500 per household. in unite states, crisis hit harder, estimate lose potential range 5 per cent 13 per cent – that’s us$6,500 us$18,000 per household. demographic labour supply we also structural factor weigh potential. the population aging, risk working-age people leave labour market may return, concern technology go deliver leap productivity see past. let’s start demographic trends. globally, next two decades, number people age 65 rise 80 per cent, 600 million 1.1 billion. canada exception trend. the baby boomer start retire, proportion population work age shrinking. early retirement also take people labour force. for canada, subtract 0.45 percentage point potential gdp growth last five years. a new wrinkle working-age people also leave labour force. this discuss length last month central banker jackson hole. the decline participation rate young prime age worker reflect cyclical effect weak job market. but cyclical effect could become structural. after long search, don’t think go find job, point, become discourage stop looking. the long stay labour force, likely skill deteriorate attachment job market weakened. this economist mean talk hysteresis. productivity growth we know relatively small labour force, nation’s capacity growth depend productivity creativity worker businesses. trend productivity growth advance economy decline past decade half – canada lose grind compare unite state countries. pessimist argue high rate productivity growth see post-war era late-1990s history.3 optimist say technological progress area nanotechnology, compute genetic engineer generate strong productivity gains.4 at bank canada, take balance approach factor view productivity. we expect business investment pick up, lead labour productivity growth little high crisis. however, two-thirds peak around 2 per cent late 1990s. a similar decline also expect occur unite state euro area. 3 r. j. gordon, “the demise u.s. economic growth: restatement, rebuttal, reflections.” 4 j. mokyr, “secular stagnation? not life,” chapter 6 secular stagnation: facts, cause cures, voxeu.org book edit c. teulings r. baldwin (london, uk: cepr press, 2014). also joel mokyr’s comment “growth, innovation stagnation”. bi central bankers’ speech 3 bottom line potential the bottom line potential output growth canada industrialize economy low year lead crisis. our recent estimate canada average 2 per cent next two years. this percentage point low average potential growth decade prior crisis. we update estimate next monetary policy report late october. we believe potential lose crisis restore high business investment firm creation. but opinion vary this. you may read extreme hypothesis, idea “secular stagnation.” this theory chronically deficient demand global economy stem persistent headwind structural factor predate crisis. this bank canada’s baseline view. we expect cyclical factor restrain growth continue dissipate next years. we already see positive effect growth canada unite states. implication neutral rate let turn mean neutral rate interest.5 the gap policy rate neutral rate serf gauge degree monetary stimulus economy. it help u calibrate monetary policy. the neutral rate economist dark matter physicists. we convince exists, play central role model analysis, can’t directly observe it. so it’s important clear concept uncertainty around it. the neutral rate i talk real risk-free rate interest enable economy operate full capacity stable inflation cyclical force dissipated. it interest rate generate enough save finance investment long-run. since save flow across borders, neutral rate canada influence domestic foreign factors. we post website today background paper neutral rate lay clearly. let walk highlights. real interest rate fall worldwide last decades, include canada. give decline low interest rate today, reasonable think neutral rate low past. there number structural factor relate investment save explain why. currently, investment hold back weak confidence uncertainty demand. these cyclical factors, hardly surprise give duration crisis. the structural undercurrent here, though, speed limit global economy. with low expect growth potential output i discussed, expect low return investment. with low returns, investment weak otherwise would be. when firm invest less, reduce demand fund put downward pressure interest rates. the financial crisis also appear persistent effect capital-formation risk premium. a robert hall point out, help explain high profit low interest rate boost investment great extent.6 5 the notion natural neutral rate interest first use knut wicksell. see k. wicksell, interest prices: a study cause regulate value money (london: macmillan company royal economic society, 1936; original edition publish sweden 1898). 6 r. hall, “quantifying last harm u.s. economy financial crisis,” hoover institution department economics, stanford university, national bureau economic research macroeconomics annual, april 2014. 4 bi central bankers’ speech at time, effective business credit spread canada today around 15 45 basis point high crisis. wide spread likely persist tough financial regulation factors.7 the neutral rate also affect level global savings, rise significantly last decade half. there number factor play, expect persist. for example, many emerging-market economy (emes), especially asia, pursue policy contribute high save rates. at time, elevate oil price mean large current account surplus many country export oil. these save invest advance economy assets, especially denominate u.s. dollars. eme reserve increase tenfold us$8 trillion since 2000. new financial sector regulation also reinforce increase demand safe asset order meet high collateral requirement liquidity buffers.8 all told, think neutral rate interest low year lead crisis structural developments. we estimate real neutral policy rate currently range 1 2 per cent. this translate nominal neutral policy rate 3 4 per cent, range 4 1/2 5 1/2 per cent period prior crisis. the neutral rate serf anchor model analysis, fix beacon structural factor influence change time. relative longer-term concept neutral, policy rate canada stimulative.9 we need stimulus close output gap maintain

shorter-run concept neutral differ even influence cyclical factor vary substantially across country (for discussion alternative definition neutral rates, see box 1 mendes, 2014). for example, use shorter-run concept, carney (2013) conclude “the equilibrium real interest rate [in u.k.] been, continue be, negative.” shorter-run definition neutral useful normative measure currently warrant policy

interpretation event believe factor restrain demand large permanent feature global economic landscape. if turn right, real neutral rate could actually negative monetary policy could lot tight think is. while cannot completely discount possibility, believe canada real neutral rate still positive that, globally, monetary condition generally stimulative, although vary across countries.11 challenge monetary policy our estimate potential neutral rate, model used, critical input policy deliberations. they end story, though. we also ask various source uncertainty influence deliberations. and clearly articulate main upside downside risk base-case outlook inflation. that mean talk risk-management approach monetary policy. a economy recover get close full capacity, judgment potential output remain slack economy become important. so judgment neutral rate amount monetary policy stimulus. inflation could surprise upside le slack monetary stimulus think. we watch development inflation carefully distinguish temporary last effects. fortunately, central bank considerable experience deal inflation target act quickly rein in. in fact, give household debt levels, think interest rate increase could large impact past. if inflation surprise downside remain stubbornly target, could hard deal with. give policy rate today, would much conventional monetary policy could do. we great appreciation risk global recession, concern upside risk inflation. if actually situation secular stagnation, well, would need consider different policy framework. one option put forward would raise inflation target order deliver negative real interest rates, since nominal interest rate can’t go zero.12 not would face cost high inflation, would also risk stoke financial imbalances.13 we weigh

need judge much underwhelming recovery due cyclical factor much structural factors. the global economy continue face headwind associate balance-sheet recession. it also face demographic changes, hysteresis labour market, weak productivity growth. we aren’t buy pessimistic view hold proponent secular stagnation, although one really know long factor constrain demand go persist much damage they’ve do global potential. some country baggage others, long factor persist vary country country. but clear potential growth rate many economy low prior crisis. because this, give high level global savings, neutral rate interest also lower. our approach consider main source uncertainty deliberation best achieve inflation target. this help u avoid make big error difficult correct. when this,

central bank chile, monetary policy report honorable senate republic, santiago de chile, 3 september 2014. * * * the monetary policy report september 2014 find http://www.bcentral.cl. introduction mr. vice-president senate, senator eugenio tuma, honorable senators, ladies, gentlemen, thank invitation board central bank chile present monetary policy report. a norm september, report coincide annual report central bank board senate, share vision recent macroeconomic financial development chile abroad, well prospect implication monetary policy conduct. chile’s economic outlook see important change past months. in particular, slowdown output pronounce anticipate expect also persistent. a year ago, come senate present vision would economy 2014, project would expand 4 5 percent range. today, i detail moment, estimate growth 1.75 2.25 percent year 3 4 percent 2015, is, le estimate medium-term growth economy. this sharp deceleration certainly worry news, move u all, political economic venues, combine best effort restore dynamism chilean economy, especially consider that, conviction, chile necessary tool hand ensure high growth thus improve welfare inhabitants. in context, central bank use monetary policy decisively consistently mandate, always direct effort achieve price stability objective. we also aware monetary policy tools, however powerful, smooth, never flatten out, economy’s cyclical fluctuations. what element behind weak economic growth? our research identify factor degree expect – mention early report – unexpected ones, effect yet assess accuracy. the expect factor include external developments. chile small, open economy and, such, affect vagary world economy. in sense, beyond severe negative effect global financial crisis 2008–2009, must recognize past decade chilean economy bless benign international scenario, extraordinarily advantageous commodity price financial conditions. notwithstanding, lately high commodity price cycle come end, hit commodity-exporting country include chile. meanwhile, although international financial condition still good, process monetary policy normalization large develop economy expect begin soon. we must forget copper, main export, trade nearly 4 dollar per pound extend period, close 3 dollar may fall long term. moreover, last decade, coincidentally high price supply shortages, investment mine increase significantly around world. 2 bi central bankers’ speech chile exception. during 1990s early 2000s, mine investment average 2 3 point country’s gdp. between 2006 2013, figure rise 5 point gdp, peak 2012 6.5 percent gdp. this phenomenon allow country enlarge mine capacity, also create major productive linkage toward sectors, include construction, trade, manufacture industries. the north country, especially city iquique, antofagasta, la serena, see strong development growth thank positive impact phenomenon. however, investment cycle, note numerous occasions, enter mature stage, result decline number project way. this also true metal-exporting economy like australia peru, although differ intensity timing, symptomatic phenomenon. however, aforementioned maturation global cycle copper investment reason behind slowdown mine investment. delays, postponement cancellation also attribute industry participant domestic problem relate water shortage high energy costs, excessive delay definition project legal issue them, well problem community increase costs. among factor behind deceleration, also fact reconstruction work earthquake tsunami february 2010, include associate fiscal boost, tend recede process completed, explain also part economic slowdown. last, least, past years, factor push economic growth potential. this make necessary appropriate pursue slow pace growth, sustainable time. overall, output expenditure weaken beyond expectations, take u economic agent surprise intensity persistence slowdown. already last june’s report say part drop investment could attribute variable traditionally determine component domestic demand. the negative surprise output development envision month ago contribute le growth think then. for example, economic recovery main trade partner somewhat slow expected, especially latin america. downward correction mine energy investment project plan 2014 sharp estimated, reflect late survey capital good corporation. in addition, depreciation peso, although important incentive export sector, short term negatively affect import component domestic expenditure. along this, worth note decline economic expectation recent months, which, one hand, reflection scenario slow growth, other, may end negatively affect domestic demand. expectation investment consumption fall quite time already, sharply recent past. the economic perception index (ipec) monthly business confidence indicator (imce) post continuous decline year. a july, two neutral level (figure 1). besides, show significant deterioration specific items, notably relate convenience buy durable goods, perception employment appropriate level inventories. meanwhile, business perception report publish bank august reveal firm perceive increase uncertainty, influence customers’ investment spend decisions. increase uncertainty naturally result investment project push back (the “wait-and-see” option specialize jargon), could partly explain reduction investment. a i said, monetary policy respond strongly decisively worsen domestic scenario, generate significant monetary impulse. by mid-2013 express bi central bankers’ speech 3 need adopt expansionary monetary stance would ensure inflation would converge target. accordingly, since october last year low monetary policy rate (mpr) 150 basis points, keep expansionary bias monetary policy. this, together performance internal external macroeconomic scenarios, heavily affect structure market interest rates. in particular, long-term rate close all-time low (figure 2). i must stress long-term interest rate one influence investment. what remarkable today even rate prevail 2008–2009, is, even low height global financial crisis, mpr 0.5 percent unconventional monetary stimulus add economy. mortgage lend interest rate also time close historic lows. at time, low cost bank fund transmit lend rate face firm households. these rate fall much 140 basis point since october last year. however, adjust inflation, lend decelerated, particularly commercial consumer loans, influence cautious behavior supplier demander credit, apparent june bank lend survey (bls) august’s business perception report (ipn). the cut already make mpr help smooth business cycle, and, mention report i presenting, still strong monetary impulse likely necessary order ensure compliance inflation target. in particular, give present conditions, bar big change economic scenario, believe monetary policy adjustment market expects, implicit various expectation indicator close report – end august – , suffice achieve inflation target help revive economy. monetary policy important significant tool tone cyclical fluctuation economy. it countercyclical use privilege earn year policy conduct strengthen credibility central bank. but also important note powerful mean almighty. it allow mitigate, fully offset, natural fluctuation small, open economy like chile. more importantly, wish chilean economy attain high growth rate medium term, necessary implement measure encourage investment physical human capital promote productivity growth, element which, incidentally, beyond scope monetary policy. this monetary policy report contain revision board medium-term growth assumption chile come years. this assumption important point view monetary policy because, combine elements, allow estimate size capacity gap result inflationary pressures. after assess data hand, estimate chile’s medium-term growth 4 4.5 percent range, le previously thought. the slow growth foresee investment total factor productivity explain large part revision. medium-term growth decline natural process economy attain high per caput income levels. still, believe chile available measure could moderate phenomenon. a i said, part revision expect slowdown investment. one argument usually put forward explain low investment rise energy cost difficulty materialize investments, despite permit require relevant institutions. from central bank stress time important country’s development well-defined policy allow time cut cost important input. the government recently launch energy agenda certainly ambitious goals, hopefully see advance direction, translate development country. another way raise potential output invest infrastructure works. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in past years, economy show decline total factor productivity. the two policy i mention – energy infrastructure – , aside incidence investment, could also result high productivity. regard employment, recurrent topic country’s policy debate female participation workforce. despite increase recent years, still average oecd economy (figure 3). a population age grow slow pace, large female labor force participation significant ingredient boost medium-term growth. another ingredient could extend work life span individuals, trend gain importance many country fraction population 65 grow rapidly still able contribute bite economy. finally, challenge relate increase labor productivity everybody recognize mainly improve educational train systems. now, let describe macroeconomic scenario see likely come quarters, associate risks. macroeconomic scenario annual headline inflation remain 4 percent, moderate variation past months. this visible evolution cpiefe – cpi exclude food good energy price – reflecting, one hand, pass-through peso depreciation inflation significant development, decline intensity time pass and, other, weak performance economy already ease pressure prices. accordingly, continue estimate current high level inflation temporary, vision share market agents, inflation expectation one two year ahead remain around 3 percent (figure 4). a i say beginning, big news several month come domestic demand output, post quite weak performance forecasts. in second quarter gdp grow 1.9 percent domestic demand drop 0.9 percent annually (figure 5). expenditure’s poor performance permeate every component, worth note fast deterioration persistent ones, non-durable consumption investment construction engineer works. by sectors, trade, especially wholesale, fell annual terms, large number manufacture branch post meager results. only link export sector show marginally favorable figures. the evolution expenditure also drive reduction imports, cause sharp adjustment current account (figure 6). in fact, year ago annual deficit current account amount 4 percent gdp expect increase further, end second quarter 2.4 percent gdp expect end year 1.8 percent gdp. this level, plus peso depreciation effect exports, mean look variable’s future behavior ease. early third-quarter partial indicator show still weak economy, must overreact monthly data, tend volatile (figure 7). thus, must surprise growth figure remain low because, i said, experience process sharper, persistent economic slowdown. in sense, growth forecast revision year take account assume that, towards end year, see recovery, though small gradual. turn labor market, unemployment rate slightly high early year, still low historic standards. total employment continue rise annual terms, slow pace, salaried component stagnant months. other indicators, available job vacancies, drop unemployment insurance claim increase (figure 8). thus, natural expect rise unemployment rate come months. still, nominal wage continue grow, could delay bi central bankers’ speech 5 convergence inflation hind adjustment labor market current cyclical condition economy. a i mentioned, worsen domestic economy occur within context monetary impulse increase substantially. we cut 150 basis point mpr past year market interest rate structure diminish accordingly. the change macroeconomic scenario also reflect exchange rate movements, nominal real terms. the clp post 5.8 percent depreciation close report last, mostly past weeks. although part depreciation respond global strengthen dollar, rise clp/usd parity exceed emerge market currencies. this obey le favorable cyclical condition expansionary monetary policy country. it must note chile’s macroeconomic policy framework includes, among features, monetary policy base inflation target exchange rate flexibility. thus, slowdown periods, pressure price diminishes, policy become expansionary order achieve inflation target, is, inflation rate fall target range. this boost monetary policy result high exchange rate, permit economy faster, optimal adjustment via expansion tradable sectors. in words, exchange rate increase natural, desire response business cycle, lend help hand economic adjustment. we faithful predicament, reflect significant depreciation currency recent times. we view problem, despite unwanted effect short term – include high inflation – part solution economy reactivate rapidly efficiently. we stressed, also, chile’s interest rate adjust significantly downward scenario. this contrast sharply would occur time today emerge economies, exchange rate pressure would rapidly translate high interest rates. external credit conditions, aside temporary up downs, remain favorable historic perspective, although risk reversal still present. lately, chile’s sovereign corporate risk premium increase somewhat, still year-ago levels. the situation similar emerge economies. long-term interest rate recede develop world since june, unprecedented performance case u.s. give strong economy expectation benchmark rate begin rise middle next year. the term trade also favorable since june, even increase marginally respect june’s forecasts, mainly owe high copper price tight supply. the baseline scenario work copper price forecast 315 dollar cent per pound 2014 305 2015. the growth outlook trade partner lose strength since june, continue expect high growth 2015 2014. in develop economies, growth slightly revise downward year. the worsen figure japan combine slow recovery eurozone, germany included, consumer business confidence declined, partly geopolitical conflict region. the unite state regain strength second quarter, thank good performance private consumption investment, good expectations. in latin america, growth forecast low year next countries, although heterogeneity. in china, government policy manage stabilize growth. our baseline scenario assume trade partner grow average 3.6 percent 2014 2015, two tenth point le foresee june (table 1). the baseline scenario assume slowdown domestic economy persistent previously expected. thus, anticipated, gdp growth forecast 6 bi central bankers’ speech year adjust 1.75 2.25 percent, june estimate. in 2015, consistently low basis comparison limit economic dynamism, expect gdp grow 3.0 4.0 percent annually. the recovery, though moderate, base great monetary stimulus low market interest rates; strong fiscal stimulus; increase trade partners’ growth; real depreciation peso; improve private expectations. a already noted, projection, board assume medium-term growth chilean economy 4 4.5 percent. the domestic demand growth forecast 2014 also correct downward, particularly investment. this change respond actual second-quarter indicator fell short forecast, capital good corporation’s investment project revise downward last survey. in contrast, strong impulse public expenditure expected, particularly investment. on private consumption side, expect keep grow rest year slow pace forecast june (table 2). annual cpi inflation, still affect high monthly variation early year direct effect recent depreciation peso remain 4 percent throughout remainder 2014. by 2015, line low inflationary pressure infer cyclic evolution economy high basis comparison, annual inflation cpi cpiefe quick descent 3 percent. then hover around 3 percent end forecast horizon, time third quarter 2016 (figure 9). this inflation trajectory base assumption indirect effect nominal real depreciation currency offset state capacity gap projection horizon. the board’s assessment yield current level real exchange rate (rer) consistent cyclical state economy internal external financial conditions, although slightly range estimate long-term values. a methodological assumption, consider exchange rate slight appreciation real term long run, cyclical condition economy normalize. about mpr, change domestic macroeconomic scenario low expect level compare june. a work assumption, estimate mpr follow path comparable infer different expectation measure available close report. these measure suggest mpr see additional cut go forward, take vicinity 3 percent end year (figure 10). the baseline scenario reflect event estimate likely occur information hand close report. there risk scenarios, however, materialized, may reshape macroeconomic environment and, therefore, may modify course monetary policy. on opportunity, evaluate alternative scenarios, board estimate risk balance inflation unbiased, output unbiased 2014 downward bias 2015. abroad, risk foresee early report remain. although growth outlook china stabilize lately, future performance continue pose risk, particularly relate chinese financial system real estate sector. moreover, cannot rule vulnerability emerge economy may originate new episode volatility. in eurozone, macrofinancial situation continue create uncertainty, compound geopolitical tension continent aggravate risk slow recovery region. in unite states, taper unconventional monetary stimulus proceed expected, financial market could suffer significant stress episode event occur might anticipate time announce increase feed fund rate. in particular, present context low long-term interest rate limit sovereign premiums, could drastic reversal cause important tension. this could bi central bankers’ speech 7 effect external fund cost currency parities, heavy impact emerge economies. overall, likely scenario continue assume u economy bring new boost abroad favorable scenario medium term. at home, one risk domestic output demand grow le expected. a noted, two weaken beyond projections, coincide widespread worsen expectations. the baseline scenario estimate worsen reverse gradually, partly explain growth forecast consumption investment 2015. however, reversal occur, may sharp strong adjustment labor market, would negatively affect consumption output. furthermore, worsen business expectation could intensify investment adjustment. such set could also trigger intense rebalancing towards tradable sector, thus moderate domestic slowdown. meanwhile, although weak domestic economy could amplify capacity gap ease inflationary pressures, cannot rule effect exchange rate may offset price effects, least temporarily, thus delay convergence inflation. let share conclude thoughts. final think domestic output demand weaker, persistently so, expect month back. the sharp fall investment couple mark deceleration private consumption, low growth forecast year range project june. annual inflation, contrary, line expectation continue see present high level temporary. a june, bank cut monetary policy rate 50 basis points, take 3.5 percent, reiterate consider possibility make reduction mpr line evolution domestic external macroeconomic condition implication inflationary outlook. no doubt result projection present today show weak performance chilean economy. we make significant correction output forecast respond combination external internal factors, foreseen, unexpected. within latter, obvious widespread deterioration private sector expectation play major role. the true magnitude role difficult determine, certainly big, particularly come projections. monetary policy play part continue so, add momentum, cannot expect solve every problem economy itself. a i said, medium-term growth see today likely le think ago. factor like reduction investment projects, decline productivity, demographic issue convergence high per caput income behind change. and structural factor could potentiate order sustain high medium-term growth country. chile’s advance last thirty year huge. poverty index drop dramatically improve live condition remarkably. the key success solid base build combine effort every chilean citizen. but still lot done. alongside development three decade stand die-hard inequality fail resolve society. in way, one problem come success. the society – notably grow middle class – demand ever good services, along opportunities. a rule, legitimate demands, must meet policy prevent lose gain entangle u dead end situation. this call “middle-income trap” literature. 8 bi central bankers’ speech i optimist, i convince country right institution help u challenge times. over year combine effort make reforms, deep long-lasting. actually, country recognize around world, precisely strong institutions. the capacity leader reach agreement proof strength and, therefore, appreciate agreement lead finance minister, congress representative political leader around tax reform. the question must ask ourselves, put aside individual positions, move forward create good country. naturally, discrepancy arise reason slowdown. we believe, however, fruitful use time think way reactivate economy and, importantly, boost growth medium long term. beware also over-optimistic over-pessimistic. when thing go well see limit indulge we-are-so-good fantasy. but table turn become pessimistic see possible solution. it’s neither that. the country built, though perfect, example among emerge economies. there long way ahead, let u underestimate achieved. mistrust bring solution. the way work hand hand, bring u many good result society. aside cyclical factors, element beyond control, attain high stage development broad sense, depend upon us. among many challenge note numerous study reduce energy costs, improve infrastructure provide quality education. our objective boost growth; must also guarantee benefit felt every individual. we, central bank, reiterate commitment price stability, state take every step necessary inflation forecast policy horizon align 3 percent target. a say time again, main contribution monetary policy make country’s development welfare. without good macroeconomic framework, development area become elusive. of course, macroeconomic stability, central bank play essential role. thank much. bi central bankers’ speech 9 figure 1business consumer perception (*)(index, pivot=50)(*) value (below) 50 point indicate optimism (pessimism).sources: adimark icare/universidad adolfo

system, 2014 asset learn conference corporation enterprise development, washington dc, 18 september 2014. * * * thank opportunity show support work asset-building, say word vitally important topic. the financial crisis great recession demonstrated, dramatic unmistakable manner, extraordinarily vulnerable large share american family asset fall back on. we come far bad moment crisis, economy continue improve. but effect recession still felt many families, particularly little save asset beforehand. to help make point, i’d like cite number federal reserve’s 2013 survey consumer finances, publish early month. the survey conduct every three year new edition provide one first good look family different economic circumstance fare recovery. for lower-income families, find sobering. the median net worth report bottom fifth household income $6,400 2013. among group, represent 25 million american households, many family wealth negative net worth. the next fifth household income median net worth $27,900. these number represent decline 2010. one reason income continue fall families. another likely reason decline net worth linger effect house crisis. home equity account lion’s share wealth family many family yet recover wealth lose house crisis. the house market improve house remain important channel asset build low middle income families. but one lesson crisis, news many you, importance diversification especially possess save liquid financial asset fall back time economic distress. yet low middle income families, financial assets, include 401 (k) plan pensions, still small share assets. accord 2013 survey, bottom half family income hold 8 percent financial asset hold households. a large lesson financial crisis, course, important promote asset-building, include save rainy day, protection up down economy. i surely hope nation face another crisis anytime soon severe one recently experienced. but many lower-income family without assets, definition financial crisis month two without paycheck, advent sudden illness unexpected expense. family asset draw able deal development bump road. family without asset end up, suddenly, road. accord board’s recent survey household economics decisionmaking, unexpected expense $400 would prompt majority household borrow money, sell something, simply pay all. the federal reserve’s mission promote healthy economy strong

board european central bank, 2nd joint central bank seminar collateral liquidity, host ecb deutsche bundesbank, hamburg, 17 september 2014. * * * introduction lady gentlemen, it pleasure open second day second joint central bank seminar collateral liquidity, host european central bank (ecb) deutsche bundesbank. i reflect development see often refer “new collateral landscape” and, particular, consider role central bank play continue play order help shape new landscape. in regard i concentrate 1) eligibility, 2) availability 3) mobility collateral assets, element represent key subject unfold collateral landscape. look back development recent years, clear financial crisis accompany regulatory reform assign prominent role collateral place great emphasis high-quality asset general. we see clear shift away use unsecured fund favour secure fund money markets. this structural change alone create new issue challenge significant impact demand collateral asset way monetary policy implement transmitted. one key topic discussion two year ago first joint central bank seminar collateral liquidity, grow demand collateral. at time, concern emerge collateral become scarcer, expectation demand would substantially outpace supply. these concern mainly fuel upcoming regulatory changes, detail fully elaborate time. another prominent topic importance collateral central banks. in response crisis, many central bank broaden collateral framework support counterparties access central bank fund give problem availability market funding. take various element together, general agreement demand collateral asset would indeed increase forthcoming year hence collateral would become relatively scarcer, although absolute collateral scarcity unlikely. a subsequent study carry basel committee global financial system (the cgfs) publish 2013 reconfirm view, note increase demand could lead “temporary shortage countries”, concern absolute shortage high-quality collateral asset appear unjustified, give supply collateral asset rise significantly since end 2007. today, almost two year first joint central bank seminar, new set issue relate relative scarcity collateral come forefront. the regulatory framework become clearer, concern raise impact new post-crisis regulatory regime financial system. eligible collateral first, i would like focus aspect relate eligibility asset use collateral central bank credit operations. a well know, collateral eligibility criterion define central bank first foremost protect central banks, ultimately taxpayers, credit risk inherent credit operation commercial banks. the eurosystem clear aspect 2 bi central bankers’ speech “adequacy” asset use collateral stipulate condition lend article 18.1 statute european system central banks. the legal interpretation respect clear consistent. this concept adequacy focus “qualitative” aspect asset may use collateral eurosystem. the adequacy collateral respect ensure via follow pillars: (i) market valuation rule whenever possible, (ii) proper legal due diligence regard asset accept collateral also regard collateralisation technique use (iii) minimum credit quality requirement stringent rule performance monitor system use ass credit quality eligible asset (iv) risk control measures, normally form haircuts. another point i would like emphasise eurosystem work mitigate inherent pro-cyclicality collateral framework extend it, aim calibrate risk parameter medium-term horizon, avoid strong reaction temporary market movements, eliminate cliff effect broaden acceptance credit risk assessment systems. i would also highlight eurosystem’s collateral framework cater level play field euro area single list eligible assets, important factor promote standardisation harmonisation relevant law europe. the eurosystem often face fact different aspect security law europe yet properly harmonised. the eurosystem eligibility criterion often de facto shape national european rules. in discussion high-quality securitisation, eligibility criterion eurosystem could good start point future regulation. availability collateral move on, i would like speak proportion high quality asset effectively available market participants. with great reliance collateralised fund regulatory reform undertake response financial crisis, clear share banks’ asset encumber rising. this intensify need great visibility regard amount high-quality asset actually available use collateral regulatory purposes. in recently-published study, ecb compare data overall global supply high-quality asset share asset effectively available market. on basis exist data, study conclude overall global supply stand equivalent around €41 trillion. however, significant proportion overall supply, represent least 25%, identify block safe-keeping account investor central bank policy-related purpose – so-called “idle securities”. the availability asset also find constrain shortcoming relate settlement arrangements, bring total available high quality asset amount close equivalent €29 trillion – €11 trillion le figure i refer outset. overall still leaf sufficient buff high-quality asset available market participants. currently, collateral usage equivalent around €10 trillion expect increase demand due mandatory ccp clear regulatory reform would equivalent €2-4 trillion. nonetheless, need take account available asset may equally available market participant regions. it therefore important monitor trend development area. in respect, securitisation could appropriate relief. the recent joint paper ecb bank england (boe) need regulatory change treatment asset-backed security (abs) also consider here. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the ecb currently explore aspect relate collateral velocity – word rate use reuse collateral. some studies1 estimate collateral reuse around three time average, however, indication rate decline since onset financial crisis. a such, work could provide clear picture across wide range asset markets, triparty collateral management system serve good start point good grasp rate reuse secure finance markets. another important element affect availability collateral asset settlement arrangement and, again, eurosystem work market see enhancement settlement arrangement could overcome exist inefficiencies. give settlement arrangement influence availability mobility collateral, i move topic mobility address settlement arrangement parallel. mobility collateral an important function collateral financial market capacity “change hands” needed. thus, collateral mobile. inefficiency settlement arrangements, however, include level financial market infrastructures, reduce amount asset quickly mobilise and, therefore, overall availability collateral assets. the eurosystem, like central banks, therefore support foster initiative contribute improve availability mobility collateral, without overlook need preserve transparency legal certainty. let mention first initiative within eurosystem – target2-securities (t2s) notable. the launch t2s make security settlement – include collateral mobilisation – safe efficient market participant central bank alike. with migration t2s, number operational barrier currently exist cross-border settlement remove operational friction reduced, allow collateral move easily is, needed. t2s important piece “mosaic” post-trade settlement. t2s overcome technical difficulty encounter today quickly transfer collateral assets. the common extend settlement timetable across t2s market also support efficient mobilisation management collateral asset and, way, t2s crucial step good function financial market, least operational point view. the eurosystem also take initiative relation service mobilisation collateral credit operations. one significant development respect introduction support cross-border triparty collateral management service go-live towards end month. triparty collateral management services, many well know, allow institution manage asset via triparty agent ultimately target towards optimise use clients’ assets. with incorporation service eurosystem framework cross-border basis, become operationally accessible eurosystem counterparties, regardless location counterparty respective triparty service. this raise set issues, primarily relate legal implementation, also need addressed. once live, enhancement offer eurosystem counterparties ability manage overall collateral hold flexible efficient manner flexibly switch collateral central bank refinance interbank market financing. central bank course alone take initiative last years. on market, see huge progress range sophistication service offer clients. a new report basel cover development collateral management service 1 see, example, “velocity pledge collateral: analysis implications”, work paper no 11/256, imf, november 2011. 4 bi central bankers’ speech across g20 country take stock exist upcoming service field.2 the many benefit gain innovation service provider collaboration among welcome central banks, allow good information collateral, good access collateral good mobility available securities. indeed, doubtful whether market participant would cope temporary shortage collateral arise regulatory reform without innovation help distribution collateral. on hand, increase sophistication service also imply increase complexity, increase operational legal risk and, notably, increase interdependency stem new linkage service-providing firms. a shortage collateral inability transfer collateral promptly case early indicator liquidity problem even deep set issues. close cooperation competent supervisory oversight authority therefore warranted, legal heterogeneity still impede fully function internal market. conclusion let conclude. a i mention outset, already observe significant change collateral landscape last year landscape continue evolve. in particular, key regulatory reform yet make real impact market innovation post-trade arrangement pursue public private sector alike. although overall global supply high-quality asset appear substantial, exist regional imbalance mean cannot become complacent. we must also continue vigilant regard issue affect availability mobility, take action address factor hamper fluid transfer assets, without mistake liquidity solvency issue market inefficiencies. in europe, t2s project make significant progress and, implemented, significant step forward. t2s allow efficient cross-border collateral flow collateral one country easily accessible countries. this also offer possibility establish linkage t2s central security depository (csds) geographical areas, could ultimately lead creation global network mobilisation collateral assets. this type global reach make attractive connect europe. in view plan discussion bring right collateral right place right time, i leave suggestion reflection i look forward receive feedback deliberation due course. i would like end wish enjoyable second day seminar, lively fruitful discussion i look forward cooperation among central banker topic collateral form month year ahead. 2 see cpmi report

determine sacrosanct benchmark rate, use settle trillion dollar loan transaction worldwide, consistently deliberately wrongly report several bank (deutsche bank, societe generale, citigroup, royal

unsound practice well failure comply bank law govern activity us. a “cease desist” order require bank promptly address deficiency oversight, management, control govern compliance u.s. law also issued. v) more recently august 2014, standard charter bank penalise us$ 300 million department financial services, u failure remediate aml compliance problems, require 2012 settlement new york state department financial service (nydfs). the bank fail review high-risk transaction even two year 2012 settlement, agree reform practices. other sanction requirement enhance due diligence aml compliance

monitor high-risk transactions, fail till 2014. domestic incident 4. close home, instance non-compliance also trouble indian bank sector. let recount instances: i) a year ago, 2007–08, several bank find involve mis-selling complex derivative product unsophisticated naïve customers, blissfully unaware risk involve products. guidance customer suitability appropriateness provide 1 report jpmorgan chase & co. management task force regard 2012 cio loss (http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/one/2272984969x0x628656/4cb574a0-0bf5-4728–9582–625e4519b 5ab/task_force_report.pdf) bi central bankers’ speech 3 rbi’s comprehensive guideline derivative ignore bank pursuit business profits. penalty impose several banks. ii) in 2013, several indian bank penalise rbi non-adherence certain kyc/ aml requirement customer identification procedure, risk categorization, periodical review risk profile account holders, periodical kyc updation, kyc walk-in customers, etc. iii) non-compliance set rules, regulatory internal, also result rise number fraud banks. in july 2014, rbi impose penalty 12 bank non-compliance regulatory guideline conduct loan current account m/s deccan chronicle hold ltd. these lapse part bank facilitate company defraud banks. iv) more recent instance bank embroil fraud misappropriation relate fix deposit create come light. these fraud could attributable possible lack adequate due diligence non-adherence internal norm procedures. 5. the example compliance failure raise issue confidence business ethic cast negative reputational impact, also lead deleterious outcome form losses, fine penalties, stricture restrictions. the reputational risk emanate event non-compliance consequent imposition penalty need view seriously. increase significance compliance 6. post crisis, considerable progress make enhance refine regulatory/supervisory standards, gradual implementation achieve stage till 2019. an important aspect reform measure great focus ensure compliance standard across jurisdiction sustain basis. the compliance function come together – ensure applicable rules, regulation standard adhere implement coherently, consistently right spirit. 7. at global level, international standard setter basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) financial stability board (fsb) put place peer review mechanism ensure national jurisdiction comply international standard right measure spirit. these addition exist assessment compliance jurisdiction international standard do international monetary fund (imf)/world bank, financial sector assessment program (fsaps). within national jurisdictions, regulators/supervisors financial sector entity realize significance compliance function ensure good conduct business entity level facilitate safe sound bank system systemic level. consequently, assessment compliance increasingly focus supervisory oversight. be compliance specific risk area? 8. the basel committee bank supervision, guidance “compliance compliance function banks”, issue april 2005 state “the compliance function independent function identifies, assesses, advise on, monitor report bank’s compliance risk, is, risk legal regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, loss reputation bank may suffer result failure comply laws, regulations, rules, relate self-regulatory organization standards, code conduct applicable bank activities”. 9. what “compliance risk” refer above? be independent risk bank need manage manage credit risk, market risk operational risk? be subset another risk simply function need perform part bank 4 bi central bankers’ speech business? in era traditional bank business, simple products, intense regulation, compliance relatively simple. bank comply provision specific act regulation set regulators. compliance could identify simply function discharge part business. however, globalization, liberalization, increase adoption integration it business process along introduction new, innovative complex products, compliance function gain stature significance. while compliance may still consider independent “risk” function, last years, definitely evolve independent function bank impact risk/s. 10. compliance generally consider part operational risk. under basel ii, operational risk define “the risk loss result inadequate fail internal processes, people system external events. this definition include legal risk, exclude strategic reputational risk” (basel committee bank supervision 2006, p. 144). legal risk define “including, but…not limit to, exposure fines, penalty punitive damage result supervisory actions, well private settlements” (basel committee bank supervision 2006, p. 130). from definition legal risk one see compliance risk form part consequently also consider part operational risk basel ii/iii. what compliance entail? 11. let elaborate upon compliance function really entails. in present day context, compliance function encompass several dimensions. i discus detail: i) prudential regulatory compliance prudential regulatory compliance include compliance directive guidance regulator. for banks, include regulation emanate various department rbi, example, regulation relate income recognition, asset classification, provisioning, restructuring, capital adequacy, liquidity, disclosures, priority sector lending, exposure norms, etc. for bank whose activity transcend segment financial sector(whether carry departmentally subsidiaries) compliance applicable regulation domestic regulators, viz. security exchange board india (sebi), insurance regulation development authority (irda), pension fund regulation development authority (pfrda) also form part prudential regulatory compliance. for bank overseas operation form branches, subsidiary joint ventures, compliance prudential regulatory norm host country regulator also important. ii) integrity market conduct in order ensure integrity financial system guard misuse illegal purposes, compliance aml cft rule assume great significance globally. the aml/cft rule base upon financial action task force (fatf) recommendations. it incumbent upon bank diligently ensure compliance rules. aml/cft compliance bank assiduously assess regulators/supervisors ensure safety soundness institution whole financial sector compromise account non-compliance rules. market conduct guideline also issue various self-regulatory organization within financial sector. in india, bank code standard board india (bcsbi), indian bank association (iba), foreign exchange dealer association india (fedai), fix income money market derivative association india (fimmda), etc. provide guidelines/guidance various aspect relevant structure bank products. such guidance, base good market conduct, also need comply bi central bankers’ speech 5 with. i must also sound note caution here. the inability financial market player ensure fair treatment consumer indulgence unfair market practice force jurisdiction create separate market conduct regulator. this happen uk, france, australia south africa reason could replicate india, mend way quickly. a separate regulator would mean additional regulatory compliance burden banks. this give add incentive comply current regulations. iii) legal compliance compliance various applicable law rule relate set banks, tax law legal enactment form important part compliance. in india, example, compliance applicable provision bank regulation act 1949, reserve bank india act 1934, foreign exchange management act 1999, etc. mandatory. iv) internal compliance the prudential regulatory compliance requirements, market conduct integrity standards, legal compliance requirement couple bank specific issue culminate various internal rule policies. in recent times, grow trend towards encourage bank create internal control framework network policy procedure would best suit meet specific need organization. it crucial bank ensure internal compliance adhere commitment require ensure prudential, regulatory well legal compliance. no doubt, primary position relate internal compliance rest business area/unit within bank. however, pro-active role compliance function provide strong impetus internal compliance well. rbi guideline compliance function bank 12. in 2007, rbi issue guideline bank compliance function base basel committee guidance. the guideline articulate minimum requirement put place effective compliance function banks. the guideline also intend guide bank-led “financial conglomerates” manage “group wide compliance risk”. acknowledge significant difference among bank regard scale operations, risk profile organizational structures, guideline exhort bank organize compliance function set priority manage compliance risks. 13. the guideline stipulate compliance function necessarily integral part governance framework along internal control risk management process. further, function effective, necessary compliance merely view responsibility individual department, support healthy compliance culture within organization. the guideline clarify compliance function right direct access board director audit committee/other committee board. further, board audit committee special committee board could meet head compliance suitable interval ass extent bank manage compliance risk effectively. thus, equal emphasis ensure independence compliance function ensure pervade activity enterprise. 14. the guideline provide place board approve compliance policy, clear structure compliance department/unit, quality, tenure location compliance staff responsibility board senior management ensure effective compliance culture bank. bank need nominate chief compliance officer function nodal point contact bank regulator. 15. it hearten note bank india place dedicate compliance personnel, compliance unit full-fledged compliance department depend 6 bi central bankers’ speech upon size business. in many banks, compliance unit/department separate unit interaction/cooperation mechanism interaction risk management department direct report line board/committee. i urge proactive action compliance department personnel support bank management nurture thrive compliance culture within respective organizations. rbi assessment efficacy compliance process bank 16. a i mention earlier, compliance assessment integral part supervisory oversight. over last years, increase attention pay rbi extent, nature quality compliance bank various applicable rule regulations; annual financial inspection (afi) process well recently introduce risk-based supervision (rbs) process. in approaches, compliance assessment play important role final rat assign bank. i) compliance review afi under afi process, detail review compliance function, work status bank’s compliance extant statutory, legal, regulatory, market conduct applicable act undertaken. base key deficiencies, monitorable action plan (map) prepare bank consultation bank, lay action points, clear deliverable timelines. the progress make bank achieve compliance closely monitor rbi. ii) compliance review rb start 2013, supervision several bank undertake rb approach. one key assessment make rb extent bank’s compliance exist statutes, regulation norms. specific information relate bank’s compliance various laws, rule regulatory guideline call bank (tranche 3 information), assess off-site, supplement subsequent on-site review. base compliance risk identified, risk mitigation plan (rmp) prepare bank consultation bank, lay roadmap mitigate identify risk clear timelines. rmps rigorously monitor rbi. conclusion 17. let conclude underscore need sound compliance function bank. the compliance function center value creation bank, strengthen public confidence, preserve enhance reputation, maintain integrity business management. in effectively perform function, view, compliance need support unconditionally engagement top, include board senior management. the “tone top” would set pace sound compliance culture value honesty integrity. this would also entail strengthen edifice function, include well-rounded compliance structure appropriate it quality hr resource term number qualify staff, train skill development, independence, interaction area clear direct reporting. another crucial element success compliance function inculcation strong ethic within organization, override profit motive business target considerations. 18. finally, regulator’s perspective, compliance absolutely non-negotiable. full compliance applicable laws, rule regulation must. this belief find root top steadily percolate level bank. go forward, compliance function bank need play great proactive role business operation well risk management. let remind cost non-compliance steadily rise see instance i recount earlier. bi central bankers’ speech 7 before i close, i would like thank cafral shri gopalakrishna invite conference wish deliberation success. thank you! bi central bankers’ speech 1 norman t l chan: what take develop global offshore rmb hub? speech mr norman t l chan, chief executive hong kong monetary authority, treasury market summit 2014, hong kong, 15 september 2014. * * * 1. a warm welcome year’s treasury market summit. 2. the theme today’s summit is: “development hong kong offshore renminbi hub”. this indeed timely topic mark 5th anniversary launch pilot scheme use renminbi (rmb) cross-border trade transaction summer 2009. we course start rmb bank business back 2004, 2009 business restrict development personal account hong kong resident use credit cards. the major milestone clearly start offshore rmb trade settlement business corporates five year ago. 3. so accomplish last five years? it probably fair say u could envisage rapid progress achieve turn hong kong global offshore rmb business hub short time. in term deposits, include certificate deposit (cds), grow around rmb90 billion end-june 2010 nearly twelve time rmb1.1 trillion now, make u large offshore rmb liquidity pool world. in trade settlement, hong kong bank handle phenomenal amount rmb2.9 trillion first half 2014, compare total amount mainland’s external trade settle rmb rmb3.3 trillion period. hong kong also become large issuance hub offshore rmb bond dim sum bonds, total 93 issuance first six month year, amount rmb130 billion value. the total amount outstanding rmb bond issue hong kong amount rmb380 billion end-june year. in addition, forex financial derivative market rmb grow steadily years, which, accord swift, raise rmb 20th position use payment currency 7th position lately. most strikingly, value payment go rmb real time gross settlement system register phenomenal growth, reach average around rmb700 billion work day. 4. i won’t bore number i sure familiar them. surely useful u pause, look back, take stock try think way continue excel go forward are. so without ado, let quickly turn main theme remark morning: “what take build successful global hub offshore rmb businesses?” the key success, i may summarise it, lie acronym: “pips”. 5. “pips” stand “policy headroom, infrastructure people/products”. let cover three element reverse order. for people products, i say many time financial centre thrive out-compete centres, crucial build block would people products. it go without say world class financial centre must right people design distribute right product serve need financial consumers. this important core component soft power i talk last years. it key attribute differentiate global hub financial centres. people product fall area financial industry, include individual firms, practitioner industry body like tma, play dominant role. i sure agree 2 bi central bankers’ speech policy maker regulators, responsibility safeguard financial stability accord appropriate protection financial consumers, really well suit get involve gauge market demand design financial product would best meet requirement consumers. 6. have say that, policy maker regulator crucial role play respect policy headroom infrastructure, first two element “pips”. let elaborate further. 7. clearly could offshore rmb market mainland make move 2009 change policy allow use rmb cross-border trade transactions. but course, mainland authority still understandably want open capital account incremental basis, take one step time. when one look back last five years, scope breadth cross-border flow rmb progressively steadily expanded. while come long way 2009 many policy change period help offshore market move forward, i would like highlight four major milestone policy headroom expansion make possible incremental development rmb market offshore. the first one rmb trade settlement pilot scheme i mention beginning. then come relaxation use rmb foreign direct investment mainland outward direct investment mainland corporates start 2011. then channel rmb portfolio investment flow also created, rmb qualify foreign institutional investor (rqfii) scheme, offshore investor invest onshore bond equity markets. the fourth recent milestone shanghai-hong kong stock connect programme, enable hong kong overseas investor invest a-shares list shanghai hong kong, mainland investor invest hong kong share shanghai. this mark significant step liberalisation mainland’s capital account, increase flow rmb onshore offshore market propel development offshore rmb business hong kong new highs. a far hkma concerned, use best endeavour work people’s bank china (pboc) relevant mainland authority continually expand policy headroom would enable hong kong continue thrive global hub offshore rmb businesses. 8. lastly, let turn second element key success develop global offshore rmb hub, i.e. market infrastructure. i think four key components: (i) efficient clear settlement systems, (ii) robust yet market friendly regulatory regime, (iii) financial benchmark (such cnh fixings) (iv) liquidity. in interest time, i would skip first three component focus fourth. a appreciate, term financial market development, liquidity essential. we also know liquidity breed liquidity. without ample market liquidity, hard financial centre flourish maintain competitive edge. we course acutely aware importance promote market liquidity, especially early stage development cnh market. it background hkma along take proactive approach seek strengthen liquidity cnh market hong kong. in june 2012, hkma launch repo facility provide one-week fund bank hong kong backstop facilitate banks’ liquidity management. however, facility t+2 settlement fully address need banks. in order assist bank treasurer good manage liquidity, hkma shorten settlement repo t+1 january 2013 t+0 july 2013. 9. today, i please announce that, preparation imminent launch shanghai-hong kong stock connect, hkma implement two additional bi central bankers’ speech 3 measure backstop facility assist bank hong kong manage rmb liquidity: (a) in addition boc hk, rmb clear bank, provide participate bank intraday overdraft, hkma provide intraday repo facility rmb10 bn bank hong kong. the hkma charge fee, base actual time use day, use facility. the purpose hkma intraday liquidity facility promote efficient rmb payment flow banks; (b) the hkma also designate number bank active cnh market primary liquidity provider (plps). bank designate plps commit use develop hong kong global platform support offshore rmb businesses. they also commit expand market-making activity cnh market. in return, hkma offer repo line plps facilitate efficient liquidity management carry market-making business activity cnh market. this bilateral repo line use plps intraday overnight liquidity management purposes. the hkma finalise list plps necessary documentation. we hope able announce list plps shortly. 10. lady gentlemen, let conclude say competitive edge successful financial centre depend crucially soft powers, hard infrastructure. hong kong uniquely well position take advantage play pivotal role new era china’s growth story internationalisation rmb. hong kong enjoy first-mover advantage well many irreplaceable structural advantages, give hong kong’s close link mainland trade, investment finance “one country, two systems” principle. however, absolutely room complacency. a new era rmb internationalisation begun, still long, long way go offshore rmb market continue grow mature, capital account control mainland china gradually relax lifted. in early stage new era, primary task hong kong develop cnh market time work financial centre sydney, london paris grow pie, lead win-win outcomes. a move mature stage internationalisation rmb, available policy headroom quite ample market flourish. at time, 2nd 3rd element pips, i.e. infrastructure people/products, would matter great deal hong kong wish retain competitive edge others. it industry, financial firm market practitioner compete centre term product innovation distribution various financial product service best serve need clients. i sure tma, support member financial industry, continue play lead role develop professionalism practitioner facilitate product innovation. thank you. 4 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 5 6 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 yves mersch: for european capital market union – secure stability, overcome fragmentation close keynote speech mr yves mersch, member executive board european central bank, zeit konferenz “banken & wirtschaft”, chamber commerce industry, frankfurt main, 10 september 2014. * * * dr esser (managing director, zeit verlagsgruppe), dr raettig (vice-president, chamber commerce industry, frankfurt main), lady gentlemen, i would first like thank invite deliver close speech high-calibre conference. i would injustice participant previous two panel discussion i attempt sum day’s deliberations. instead, i’d like conclude link together financial market policy, already discuss length today, monetary policy overall function europe’s economic monetary union. a common currency union state european union work long term financial market policy, economic policy fiscal policy interact european level member state within framework common rules. in way, independent central bank give opportunity fulfil monetary policy mandate. unfortunately quite distance ideal condition. the crisis show u much various policy affect other. it show easily bad budgetary management, excess financial market steady loss competitiveness reinforce other. i convince europe understand this. but i’m sure ready draw necessary conclusions. without doubt, change good take place since begin crisis: member state particular programme country make significant effort put budget order improve competitiveness. with bank union take decisive step european level. it increase stability bank system euro area protect taxpayer future effectively expensive bank bailouts link risk liability closely. however, economic recovery still way off: last quarter, economy stagnate euro area. unemployment still 11.5%. price august rise 0.3%, inflation expectation anchored. all all, figure give u cause concern. they point europe still danger. the patient sense still poorly unfortunately relapse cannot rule out. financial market policy, fiscal policy economic policy still insufficiently harmonised, often political courage lack push necessary sometimes unpopular measure face resistance. i convince important reason current economic weakness. a result, ecb’s monetary policy cannot optimally fulfil mandate. to change this, need improve function economic monetary union. in words, need draw right conclusion crisis. all three policy mention – financial market policy, fiscal policy economic policy – essential process. ambitious structural reform important good 2 bi central bankers’ speech housekeeping. but talk financial market policy today, i want focus completion europe’s internal market capital. we stop bank union. it important step. but current situation euro area demand consider even seriously finance channels, especially small medium-sized enterprises, may open beyond bank system. this would also benefit implementation monetary policy. that’s today i wish speak favour develop bank union comprehensive capital market union. monetary policy time uncertainty fragmentation a capital market union would important step towards good allocation capital euro area thus towards high growth employment europe. to understand move could support recovery euro area, advisable, however, begin consider monetary policy. the current economic climate unquestionably make monetary policy action difficult. low growth, high unemployment low inflation rate call accommodative monetary policy order ensure price stability medium term. the ecb meet demand quite time. i understand investor country, mindful save accounts, view policy critically. but true saver well low inflation level long would hold back economic development euro area thus return savings. in addition, treaty require ecb maintain price stability euro area – apply directions: people euro area protect spurt inflation deflation. over ten year ago ecb define price stability annual inflation rate below, close to, 2% medium term. for year, however, expect price increase 0.6%, 2015 1.1% 2016 1.4%. this clearly show current accommodative monetary policy stance economically appropriate, also necessary measure fulfil treaty obligation. the govern council unanimous point. at heart accommodative strategy undoubtedly fact ecb steadily cut interest rate main refinance operation low possible point recent years. however, still exist functional deficit financial market hind optimal transmission monetary policy signal come low interest rate. small medium-sized enterprise particular still aren’t feel enough monetary policy accommodation. we call impair transmission mechanism. that’s govern council unanimously adopt june series measure improve transmission monetary policy: first, decide continue conduct main refinance operation fixed-rate tender procedure full allotment long necessary, least december 2016. bank therefore receive much liquidity need long offer adequate collateral. second, reduce interest rate deposit facility zero first time cut last week. by way, punish banks, i often read. rather, give incentive park liquidity central bank, pas productive way real economy. in environment already difficult business gain access capital investments, important bank also provide sufficient fund profitable projects. third, decided, within framework eight target longer-term refinance operations, make available long-term liquidity bank period 2018 – proportion credit volume relative real economy. thus, bank encourage bi central bankers’ speech 3 lend enterprise euro area. at time, uncertainty liquidity situation bank reduced, bank increasingly lend money again, even across border member states. the focus instrument real economy particularly illustrate fact first step exist loan portfolio crucial allocation liquidity, also second step trend period transaction considered. thus, bank require expand lend business household come month years. to reinforce measures, govern council decide last week start purchase asset-backed security (abs) well cover bonds, pfandbriefe, october. the detail two programme announce council meet early october. the decision start buy ab first result intensive preparation still ongoing. for clear measure aim monetary policy transmission channel. they equate broad programme quantitative ease (qe), overture it. moreover, economic logic anglo-saxon qe programme cannot apply one one bank-financed economic system like euro area. also, qe effectiveness would questionable light erode yield marketable securities. the surge market interest-bearing security would also strain soundness balance sheet, make large-scale purchase environment. and go almost without say purchase government bond would raise considerable institutional, instrumental legal issues. although apparently push direction, option would consider two conditions: 1. price stay current low level long, 2. strict compliance monetary policy mandate. but back market abs. we look closely time. we believe could important channel increase lend small medium-sized enterprises. because size, smes cannot generally issue bonds. if bank get chance securitise loan smes, sell investors, major obstacle long-term lend enterprise removed, namely risk non-payment low liquidity loan difficult times. a function ab market therefore make important contribution ensure monetary policy impact right across real economy. this bring back initial hypothesis – namely monetary policy euro area may work good policy area play part. because dynamic ab market significantly influence regulatory framework. and still work do here. let say quite clearly: one want complex, opaque product pre-crisis years. also, repackagings umpteenth tranche financial derivative thing past. no one want promote certain class product sake. and securitised sub-prime mortgage unite state certainly make inglorious contribution emergence financial crisis. but regulatory framework appropriate actual risk. and respect significant difference current previous securitisations experience u europe. 4 bi central bankers’ speech since start 2007–08 financial crisis, default rate european ab average 0.6% 1.5%. in u period, average 9.3% 18.4%. european sme ab even default rates, 0.1%. the current rule lump ab together much conservative. they effectively question existence. under current regulatory condition simple, transparent ab build real asset face almost many problem much complex financial products. the ecb therefore, cooperation bank england, make number proposal good function securitisation market european union. that approach welcome principle government member state show joint work paper finance ministry berlin paris. the proposal derive part quality transparency demand central bank place abs, deposit collateral monetary policy operations. and we, central bank, protect balance sheet, demand always high. the ab market therefore good example financial market policy benefit monetary policy also contribute recovery euro area. thus, two goal good financial market policy european context named: growth-friendly support successful implementation monetary policy. there is, course, third goal, go back financial crisis: maintain financial stability mitigate systemic risks. from bank union capital market union for bank sector, triad understand implement large extent, although work still remain done. the bank union single supervisory mechanism ecb milestone history european integration. our comprehensive balance sheet valuation stress test bring great transparency healthy bank system euro area. the single resolution mechanism (srm) play part too. it lessen risk taxpayer future foot bill rescue bank trouble. in addition, continue tackle fragmentation sustainably reduce interdependence bank governments. at time, single supervisory mechanism construction, it’s become clear bank union system close itself. rather, europe’s bank supervision also dependent standard area uniform transparent possible. some may aware discussion definition so-called “bad loans” context comprehensive assessment. bank supervision, work permanently 18 different national regulatory regime neither particularly efficient, achieve goal comparable cross-border bank balance sheet long run. thus, bank sector question arise far need think future beyond bank union order achieve function internal market financial services. to answer question, opinion three dimension play role. the first dimension open market itself. in regard, already achieve great deal within eu. the second dimension introduction common uniform regulatory standard internal financial market. the third dimension consist common institution enforce regulatory standards. how much integration need therefore beyond bank system? for example, isn’t one-sided approach tackle fragmentation respect bank system, handle shadow bank system context? if bank supervision become european, payment system continue monitor nationally? how manage give small medium-sized enterprise access capital market beyond banks, market fragment regulate non-uniform way? bi central bankers’ speech 5 all question call coherent response. in view, response could development bank union piecemeal regulation financial system real capital market union european union level. financial market complex capital market union would affect large number different areas. allow therefore, conclusion, draw attention three points. first, must certain stringent regulation bank system lead shift bad risk non-banking sectors, without ensure cannot cause systemic damage there. apart fact term “shadow banking” particularly unfortunate one, i regard transparency important here. at time, area regulate fact trigger systemic risk. innovation financial sector block per se. second, many financial instrument uniformly european sometimes insufficiently comparable lack standard lack transparency. i already mention problem abs. the lack proper information area problem smes’ access credit. here relation many financial instruments, regulatory action help support market. a i also mentioned, joint paper bank england ecb may provide good basis here. third, field payment system security settlement also challenge capital market union must address: despite much progress past decade payment systems, security settlement euro area remain fragmented, inefficient customer-friendly. this problem small businesses, adapt different condition member state often entail high costs, also integration function internal market whole. possible solution include harmonise european market infrastructure retail large-value payment system process security transactions, well coordinate harmonise monitor critical market infrastructures. in areas, eurosystem competent, relevant initiative launch several year ago already make significant progress. in retail payments, example, since august 2014 distinction national credit transfer direct debit business individuals, cross-border ones. this, fact iban become part daily lives, show far progress field retail payments. the single euro payment area, sepa, important european integration project business individual europe benefit directly. a comparable degree integration would also desirable card payments, discriminate virtual border post within europe. in long term, “roaming charges” european payments. progress made, many challenge remain euro area become “single euro payment settlement space”. these include barrier result difference market practice standard well tax, account legal system member states. the removal barrier lie outside competence eurosystem. other player must also take step make capital market union reality. these three examples, genuine capital market union could go much further, course. difference area nurture fragmentation could address within capital market union project. in addition, also question actor could play part. what function could performed, instance, european supervisory authority eba, esma eiopa, whose activity task currently check brussels? and least, must identify area eu take initiative member state active. i aware ambitious proposal cannot implement overnight. but fact future president european commission already take idea 6 bi central bankers’ speech make optimistic. the challenge come month create political awareness enormous economic importance highly technical area. lady gentlemen, late last year, helmut schmidt, publisher die zeit former german chancellor, say it’s write bible european union last end 21th century present form. it expression concern, hop would wrong. this logic also work way around: global environment operate change radically europe today face quite different challenge world’s market 20 30 year ago, union also steadily adapt. it good die zeit today bring u together here, spirit helmut schmidt, discus development financial market policy. and i convince capital market union could play important part make europe fit global challenge former chancellor analyse many years. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 salvatore rossi: finance growth speech mr salvatore rossi, senior deputy governor bank italy, banca popolare di sondrio, sondrio, 12 september 2014. * * * growth italy long stray path economic growth. common sense tell u data confirm it. in last six year recession double rate unemployment erode 11 percentage point per caput gdp. but problem go back much that: 2008, eve financial crisis, average amount good service produce italian worker basically unchanged 1995. in period countries, spur technological paradigm shift ict, see productivity rate soar. the strong growth employment nevertheless record italy pre-crisis years, favour introduction flexible work contracts, prove insufficient offset effect stagnation productivity households’ disposable income. at outbreak crisis, average household level mid-1990s progressive reduction save rate enable modest growth consumption. the diminish ability generate income herald decline live standards, respect country’s past world’s main players. this worry one consider forty years’ time ratio people work age (20–69) elderly retiree halved, 4 2. even maintain per caput live

however, credit rise €910 billion december 2011, reduction respect peak €80 billion. a share gdp (53 per cent), though, bank lend today still high than, say, germany france. lend households, instead, expand six years, €520 €600 billion. in meantime, wholesale funding, primarily foreign bank large international investors, fell dramatically, almost €800 €550 billion, mainly owe last three year loss confidence italy follow global markets’ reassessment sovereign debt. bank manage combat dry foreign fund increase domestic retail fund participate long-term refinance operation european central bank. without these, credit squeeze would much severe. this main cause deterioration, however. due persistence recession 2008 2013 total stock non-performing loan firm household increase €100 billion €320 billion 16 per cent total outstanding loans. a far possible understand comparison data reflect different national definitions, high average level europe. the outcome, partly owe increase reserve requirements, dramatic fall bank profits, riskiness firms’ new credit demand increase sharply. 3 criscuolo, gal menon (2014). 4 this section reprise develop line think elaborate recent month visco (2013, 2014), rossi (2013), panetta (2014). bi central bankers’ speech 3 furthermore, recent year bank strengthen capital bases. they prompt even regulation supervisors5 recession (in capital must proportional riskiness assets) markets, confidence bank expose risky sovereign faltering. over six year italian bank expand core tier one capital €50 billion, €134 billion €184 billion. this capitalization drive sustain raise equity market time retain earn – arduous combination, potential subscriber capital increase offer prospect good future returns. the banks’ shareholder call bear brunt problem debtor firms, loan write-down total nearly €140 billion. from banks’ standpoint, situation summarize follows: crisis bank credit abundant fund wholesale market (mostly abroad) easy give low borrower risk massive loan loss provision required. with crisis recession, condition vanished, rational course bank, interest first foremost saver entrust resource prudent investment, slow reduce lend firm perceive risky step investment other, le risky profitable assets, government securities. banks’ deleveraging intensify sharp decline credit demand le risky firms, many cut back suspend plan investments. this straightforward analysis exclude highly imaginative theory “malice aforethought”. let u consider second hypothesis, namely “negligence”, i.e. banks’ culpable incapacity sagacious, farsighted assessment individual borrowers’ creditworthiness. here, judgment must nuanced. the heterogeneity behaviour among bank make generic, summary judgment inadvisable. if nevertheless intend consider system whole, would seem italy grip perverse interaction structural characteristic corporate system financial system. in many case italian firm small financially fragile bank- dependent. their financial leverage rise prior crisis high international standard (44 per cent). two third debt bank debt. these feature pronounce among small firms, precisely severely affect tighten credit supply. for matter, typical feature italian small business – diminutive size, little commitment shareholder capital, lack transparency – make nearly impracticable access bond equity market directly, even want (which rarely do). for part, italian financial system notoriously bank-centred. at end last year bank loan account 40 per cent total financial liability household firm (financial debt plus corporate equity), compare 15 per cent unite states, 23 per cent france, 30 per cent unite kingdom. only germany, another “bank-centred” economy, share comparable italy’s. equity investment venture capital private equity funds, specialize start-ups stimulate growth small businesses, amount 0.2 per cent gdp italy, germany, half much france fifth much britain. for many year italian bank system favour family-based, fragment structure business customer give positional rents, shelter competition source funds, namely financial equity markets. now bank system become polarized: one hand, major player tend 5 many european bank bring forward adjustment new basel 3 regulatory framework readied comprehensive assessment exercise eurosystem’s single supervisory mechanism. 4 bi central bankers’ speech concentrate large customers, use quantitative risk measurement methods; other, vast array small banks, serve mainly small customer whose account often inadequate opaque, accordingly require direct knowledge business. such knowledge gain two way – personal relationship analytical tool assess firm’s technology market characteristics. both useful, specific drawback. personal relationship approximate riskier, analytical tool costlier; particular, latter variable well overhead costs, may prohibitive business loan small. add consideration event default inefficiency italian civil justice sometimes make uneconomic even initiate credit recovery action, bank write virtually entire amount small non-performing loan, even expect loss, measure objectively, limited. this practice impact banks’ lend decision interest rate charge. this situation would appear constitute “market failure”. the private sector parties, borrower lenders, incapable make credit mechanism work efficiently respond incentive disincentive clash general interest. small business want stay “opaque” possible; indeed, accustom understate actual earn tax reasons. and instance bank procure adequate facility method evaluate firms, convenient, short run le costly, rely personal relationships. the outcome adverse selection credit rationing.6 in pathological case outright bank failures. in short, hypothesis “negligence” well founded, apply side credit market. this vicious circle, ultimately everyone lose nobody gains, must broken. it life-or-death question many italian smes that, severely strain recession, still retain markets, innovative capacity technological assets, potential recover. half gdp produce small medium-sized firm few 250 employees. these smes must help grow, leave die fact terminally ill. first all, enable get iv support bank credit alone learn raise fund market well. this take time. in short term fraction bank credit readily replaced. so market failure must remedied, benefit all, public intervention. but form intervention take? in case, public intervention must respectful market compatible budget constraints. the main tool available government guarantees7 securitization. a substantial contribution could also come legislative regulatory intervention shorten credit recovery time make bankruptcy procedure simple efficient, security collateral system flexible.8 public guarantee offset information shortfall lender smes without take former’s place assess creditworthiness without burden budget immediate, bankruptcy announce within limit ratio insolvency total guarantee granted. a good example already provide central guarantee fund operate aegis ministry economic development, partially guarantee bank grant loan small firm participate latter’s screening. since 2009 fund grant guarantee loan amount €40 billion. the scale fund’s operation could increased. 6 see, among others, panetta (2014) classic stiglitz wei (1981) cite therein. 7 agenda possibile (2013), panetta (2014). 8 haselmann, pistor vig (2010). bi central bankers’ speech 5 securitizations serve essentially distribute risk inherent bank loan smes among large number bank non-bank institutional investors. in view small size loans, necessary create asset-backed securities, i.e. package loan form bonds, difficult ass quality, place various tranche different investor accord risk appetite. operation carry originator bank financial entities. these instrument could also back part public guarantees. notable among possible investor insurance companies, often hard put present phase cycle find desirable investment technical provision term risk/return maturity. to develop market regulatory problem must overcome, firstly international level. the global financial crisis discredit instrument abs, abuse push complexity opacity limit. but abuse forbid without eliminate instrument itself, retain rational basis. the ecb launch large programme purchase simple transparent ab order among objective facilitate finance smes. the bank italy iva follow matter closely. with great rapidity summer iva draft amendment regulation insurance companies’ investment consistent new legislative provision introduce recently increase competitiveness italian economy. the new prudential regulations, aim achieve great diversification risk, also allow insurance company grant credit directly subject well-defined limit conditions. the second public consultation, make necessary innovation introduce conversion competitiveness decree law, draw close; iva shortly issue new regulations. however, market able channel large volume financial resource non-bank investor smes cannot easily create one day next. even regulatory question settled, still problem information asymmetry borrower firm investors. those who, good others, know understand present prospective condition firms, first foremost bank originate loans, therefore essential role play. it must forgotten, however, italy, i mention earlier, main problem regard functionality system lie firms’ financial fragility. the important task public action therefore push firm towards equity finance rather additional borrowing, use every possible means, regulatory fiscal. but bank borrow make rational examine technical forms. for example, traditional overdraft widespread italy stand international standards. the fact establish time limit credit actually grant create problem calculation interest lessen eligibility collateral; order accept loan collateral, bank italy recently ask inclusion specific contractual clauses. use finance advantage growth the question determinant economic growth long term centre economic analysis since come separate science. more half century ago attention focus productivity technical progress decisive factor growth, demote accumulation physical capital, previously consider motor capitalist growth.9 today new conceptual leap attempted, move scale cause effects; searching, words, determine productivity technical progress, find ability firm, 9 schumpeter (1934), solow (1956, 1957). there follow numerous theoretical empirical refinement solow’s model, romer (1990), grossman helpman (1991) aghion howitt (1992). 6 bi central bankers’ speech economy, society “learn” continuously,10 dynamism, endogenous inventiveness, taste intellectual entrepreneurial challenges.11 such ability may find embed culture custom nation, result favourable historical confluence. or constructed, fed, reason political action, well entrepreneurs’ creative impulse. this complex task involve different aspect associative life, first foremost educational system; this, also legal system, condition competition efficiency public administration. and finance? the financial system engine prosperity cause backsliding. the history economies, old new, give u example one situation. the whole world still reel destructive potential finance reveal six year ago. it choose distribute resources: incentive orient choice influence economic growth.12 to able make choice correctly, financial system must “know” corporate system. but financial system mean? for anglo-american basically mean markets, whole world analysts, consultants, speculative investor institutional investor wheel them. for european, even italian, mean banks. market bank different way know firm require finance. market gather process data. banks, addition data, acquire direct knowledge firms. a mass study analysis last quarter century argue broad sophisticate financial system essential economic growth. it literature considerably influence anglo-american model, see market heart system. after “big chill” bring global crisis, basic assumption – importance finance growth – eroded, increase qualification rethinkings, example recognition important role intermediation, especially get credit smes.13 in italy, seen, share source fund bank credit particularly small certainly encourage grow. our traditional bank activity find new life, however, virtuous rediscovery mission get know firms, particular small ones. all mechanism gather analyse data firm need strengthened, include way formation publicize shared. bank must increase level technical knowledge, include expertise products, production methods, markets, firm apply loans, particularly recession, loan application tend generic purpose le tie investment plans, easy evaluate objectively.14 we move towards different financial system one use to. policies, law practice must gear allow firm – especially innovative one – capital, pay owner specialize funds, also raise capital market.15 for reason italian smes must take decisive step towards ensure 10 a stiglitz greenwald say (2014), start arrow’s lesson (1962), “learn learn, learning”. 11 phelps (2013). 12 levine (2014). 13 see, example, beck (2013) cbi (2012). 14 bain & company iif (2013). 15 accord calculations, today italy 500 enterprise meet criterion would benefit list stock exchange. bi central bankers’ speech 7 information status reliable widely available. the level bank debt reduced. bank turn must accelerate change already begin them. they enter new phase essential well capitalize risk well aware: must therefore satisfy general condition profitability, transparency good governance allow obtain fund competitive rate (to pas lend rates, reduce them) and, necessary, raise new capital rapidly sufficient quantity. besides improve capacity understand company lend money to, must also add financial consultancy traditional lend activities, thus help firm decide best level composition financial liability support entry markets. these new service could build income stream would least offset loss part traditional bank activities. conclusion we italian tell outset blame global financial crisis, true: eve flare-up, financial bank system largely immune problem famously discover anglo-american systems. our fault another: precede decade allow economy lose strength stop growing, without take step counter trend whose deep long-term nature ignore despite warn quarters. the outcome eyes: one economy bad hit recessive effect financial crisis. we worry time strength recovery, country fare ten years’ time, employment prospect future well-being generation threshold adulthood. a prosperous society know ensure constant improvement quality life

iwata, deputy governor bank japan, meet business leaders, ishikawa, 10 september 2014. * * * accompany slide find end speech. introduction it pleasure opportunity today exchange view administrative, financial, business leader ishikawa prefecture. i would like take opportunity express sincere gratitude cooperation activity bank japan’s kanazawa branch. the bank japan decide price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) january last year. the bank april introduce aggressive monetary ease call quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) achieve price stability target. the bank pursue qqe since then. one year five month pass since bank introduce qqe, policy intend effect far. the impact qqe expect become strong go forward, make particularly important bank ensure public fully understand policy. today, exchange view you, i would like explain current situation outlook japan’s economy. i talk background behind qqe. i. current situation outlook japan’s economy a. economic activity let start explain current situation outlook japan’s economic activity. japan’s economy continue recover moderately trend, although decline demand follow front-loaded increase prior consumption tax hike observed. the gdp statistic release week show grow strongly rate 1.5 percent quarter-on-quarter january–march quarter, real gdp fell substantially, 1.8 percent, april–june quarter (chart 1). because large decline april–june quarter, appear skepticism whether economic recovery remain intact. however, since increase demand january–march quarter large consumer bring purchase forward, expect subsequent decline demand hence real gdp april–june quarter would also large. what matter mechanism underlie economic recovery temporary factors, bank judge virtuous cycle economic activity remain firmly intact household corporate sectors. let first touch virtuous cycle household sector move virtuous cycle corporate sector. household sector look environment face household sector, labor market continue improve steadily. the unemployment rate july register 3.8 percent, active job openings-to-applicants ratio 1.10, thus return level prior global financial crisis (chart 2). the employment condition di june tankan survey – short-term economic survey enterprise japan – show firms, particularly non-manufacturing sector, feel labor shortage. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the year-on-year rate increase number regular employee around 1.5 percent (chart 3). with labor market become tighter, hourly cash earn part-time employee increase year-on-year basis. moreover, schedule cash earn increase slightly, indicate impact base pay raise annual wage negotiation spring start appear data, non-scheduled cash earn summer bonus increased. against background, year-on-year rate change monthly cash earn full-time employee positive. a result, annual rate increase nominal wage per employee gradually accelerated. finally, employee income – is, nominal wage multiply number employee – grow around 2 percent year-on-year months, rate growth accelerate july. with employment income situation improve steadily, private consumption remain resilient trend, effect decline demand follow consumption tax hike gradually begin wane. in interviews, firm express view since front-loading purchase – especially durable good automobile – large, subsequent decline also likely prolonged. however, many department store food supermarkets, example, report margin decline demand narrow gradually. look ahead, labor market likely continue tighten economy continue recover and, i discus later, corporate profit expect improve inflation expectation likely increase. therefore, year-on-year rate increase nominal wage expect gradually show clear uptrend. against backdrop employment income developments, virtuous cycle economic activity household sector expect remain place. nevertheless, bank continue carefully examine decline real income consumption tax hike bring affect households’ spend behavior. corporate sector next, i explain virtuous cycle corporate sector. export show weakness recovery export delayed. that said, i explain late detail, export expect head moderate increase. despite sluggishness exports, virtuous cycle corporate sector remain place. in fact, corporate profit continue improve. look list companies’ result april–june quarter year, consolidate profit continue rise, mainly due good performance overseas sales, generally favorable levels. business sentiment also remain favorable whole, although temporarily deteriorate – particularly non-manufacturing sector – due effect decline demand follow consumption tax hike. business sentiment among large manufacture firm remain upward trend despite weakness exports, reflect fact profitability continue favorable. with corporate profit continue improve business sentiment generally favorable, business fix investment, particularly non-manufacturing sector, increase moderately. moreover, even manufacture sector, lagging, clear recovery business fix investment observe (chart 4). with corporate profit continue improve trend, business fix investment project follow moderate increase trend effect monetary ease grow strong decline expect real interest rates. the june tankan survey show aggregate investment fiscal 2014 schedule increase. therefore, virtuous cycle economic activity corporate sector expect remain intact backdrop improvement corporate profit favorable business sentiment. bi central bankers’ speech 3 outlook concern economic activity japan’s economy expect continue moderate recovery trend, since virtuous cycle economic activity household corporate sector likely remain place, i mentioned. at july monetary policy meet (mpm), bank conduct interim assessment april 2014 outlook economic activity price (outlook report) fiscal 2016. look median policy board members’ forecasts, real gdp project grow 1.0 percent fiscal 2014, 1.5 percent fiscal 2015, 1.3 percent fiscal 2016 (chart 5). regard outlook economic activity, potential concern development exports. a i mentioned, japan’s export show weakness. the recent weakness export essentially due cyclical factors, mainly sluggishness emerge economies. at time, unexpectedly large slowdown u.s. economy january–march quarter year due unusually severe winter weather seem affect export lag, put downward pressure early spring. in addition, possible structural factor recovery japan’s export lag behind recovery overseas economy may play certain role accelerate relocation production overseas japanese manufacture firms. look ahead, structural problem fiscal current account deficit persist emerge economies, economic growth emerge economies, particularly growth domestic demand, expect remain subdue time being. on hand, growth advance economy u.s. european economy expect accelerate, chinese economy expect continue register stable growth. growth economy likely spread emerge economies, growth rate overseas economy overall expect accelerate gradually. this also confirm world economic outlook update publish july international monetary fund: global economic growth, slow 3.2 percent 2013, project accelerate gradually 3.4 percent 2014 4.0 percent 2015 (chart 6). therefore, cyclical factor responsible weakness export far likely gradually disappear export expect head moderate increase. in addition, somewhat longer-term perspective, correction excessive appreciation yen past mitigate downward pressure export decelerate pace relocation production overseas. b. price development let turn price developments. the year-on-year rate increase cpi (excluding fresh food) exclude direct effect consumption tax hike plus 1.3 percent july. thus, japan’s economy course achieve inflation rate 2 percent – price stability target – expect (chart 7). when assess price developments, important bear mind monthly figure cpi tend fluctuate trend inflationary pressure determine two factors: improvement output gap rise inflation expectations. to ass trend inflation, necessary bank carefully examine two factors. a i mentioned, japan’s labor market tightened, firms’ excess capacity almost disappear capacity utilization increased. a result, output gap improve moderately recently reach around 0 percent (chart 8). moreover, i explain later, medium- long-term inflation expectation appear rise whole. the year-on-year rate increase cpi expect accelerate moderately, along increase wages, backdrop rise inflation expectation well improvement output gap, give japan’s economy expect continue grow pace potential. specifically, inflation rate expect around 1¼ percent time, since upward pressure energy-related goods, particularly petroleum products, likely wane. subsequently, output gap remain positive 4 bi central bankers’ speech medium- long-term inflation expectation rising, year-on-year rate change cpi expect follow uptrend reach 2 percent around middle current projection period fiscal 2014 2016, is, around fiscal 2015. look median policy board members’ forecast interim assessment outlook report july mpm, projection year-on-year growth rate cpi (excluding fresh food) plus 1.3 percent fiscal 2014, plus 1.9 percent fiscal 2015, plus 2.1 percent fiscal 2016, exclude direct effect consumption tax hike (chart 5). ii. conduct monetary policy a. what qqe? for remainder speech i would like focus several point concern bank’s conduct monetary policy. the qqe policy bank pursue since april last year two major pillar (chart 9). the first pillar commitment achieve 2 percent price stability target swiftly possible. specifically, bank clearly pledge would achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time, time horizon two years. the second pillar consist underpin first pillar – commitment – specific actions. a word quantitative qualitative indicates, action involve expansion quantity change quality asset balance sheet bank. the quantitative aspect refer substantial increase amount money provide bank financial system, is, increase monetary base, purchase various assets, particular japanese government bond (jgbs). the qualitative aspect refer purchase risky assets. the bank start include purchase government bond long remain maturities. in order affect risk premium assets, bank also increase amount purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits). b. transmission channel qqe many may interest channel qqe two pillar affect real economy extent effect qqe spread economy. let explain transmission channel monetary easing. a key transmission channel low expect real interest rate (chart 10). expect real interest rate nominal interest rate actually observe financial market counter le rate inflation people expect. while nominal interest rate observed, expect real interest rate rate economic entity anticipate take account price changes. qqe aim put downward pressure nominal interest rate large-scale purchase long-term government bond purchase asset raise expect rate inflation. the aim therefore low expect real interest rates, is, nominal interest rate le expect rate inflation. if economic entities’ expect real interest rate fall, stimulate demand real economy number way (chart 11). for example, real interest rate decline, people shift portfolio cash, deposits, fixed-income security – become relatively le attractive – equity tangible asset land housing, foreign currency-denominated asset high returns. the result rise equity price appreciation foreign currency stimulate private consumption wealth effects. bi central bankers’ speech 5 in addition decline expect real interest rates, factor increase consumption, rise stock prices, depreciation yen, encourage firm proactive business fix investment. the depreciation yen also expect give rise increase exports. with increase demand channels, shortage demand economy eliminated, price rise, overcome deflation sight. further increase production due grow demand lead increase labor income improve labor market condition and, turn, raise private consumption. the result increase corporate profit lead increase firms’ business fix investment. this chain development lead virtuous cycle economy. c. effect qqe in economy, monetary policy far intend effect transmission channel i explained. on one hand, nominal interest rates, include long-term government bond yields, stable, while, hand, economic entities’ inflation expectation rise whole, i explain moment. therefore, expect real interest rate – is, nominal interest rate minus expect rate inflation – declining. this, turn, boost private demand, consumption investment, raise aggregate demand economy whole. economic growth fiscal 2013 jump 2.3 percent follow slow growth 0 1 percent two precede years. against background, year-on-year rate change consumer price increase trend toward around 2 percent – price stability target. corporate sector output increase response rise aggregate demand, labor demand increase accordingly. since nominal wage uptrend along increase number workers, employee income whole rising, underpin domestic demand. therefore, qqe intend effects, effect monetary ease expect strengthen virtuous cycle among production, income, spend sustained. when talk development previous occasions, i sometimes hear concern real wage may actually declining, since nominal wage cannot keep increase inflation. in response, i say necessary patient watch policy effect period time, since effect unfold certain order. from firms’ perspective, easy reduce number regular worker increase difficult reduce wage raised. therefore, general, increase employment tend start form additional non-regular worker hired, wage increase tend take form increase special cash earn bonus non-scheduled cash earnings. while year-on-year rate change schedule cash earn downtrend reflect increase share part-time worker total employment, schedule cash earn stop decline may year start increase june. real wage decline recently. however, exclude direct effect april consumption tax hike, year-on-year rate change real wage turn positive full-time worker june part-time worker july (chart 12). once future economic prospect outlook firms’ profit become favorable virtuous cycle among production, income, spend continues, likely wage rise steadily line rate inflation. for happen, important 6 bi central bankers’ speech continue appropriate conduct monetary policy measure achieve price stability target stable manner. d. inflation expectation price a mention earlier, order put downward pressure expect real interest rate necessary work people’s inflation expectations. under 15 year protract deflation, grow share young people never experience inflation, view price rise become entrench people’s mindset. dispel deflationary mindset change people’s expectation expect moderate inflation quite difficult challenge. that current large-scale monetary ease become necessary. various survey market indicator point general uptrend people’s inflation expectation (charts 13 14). this attribute fact impact qqe inflation expectation spreading. in addition, uptrend also reflect increase number people reluctant believe japan would experience inflation saw adjust expectations. such skeptic adjust expectation due rise actual inflation reflect improvement output gap. this tendency likely become strong go forward. the rise inflation expectations, moreover, effect directly raise actual inflation additional channel distinct boost aggregate demand low expect real interest rates. specifically, people expect future inflation, price wage set base expectations, thus add inflationary pressure. in context, useful refer concept phillips curve, illustrate relationship economic activity inflation. recently, inflation clearly level suggest phillips curve derive data period deflation (chart 15). in addition move along phillips curve due improvement economic activity, may reflect upward shift phillips curve due upward pressure curve stem rise inflation expectations. e. the depreciation yen inflation on basis, bank belief price stability target 2 percent achieved, i mention earlier. of course, skeptical voices. for example, argue current rise inflation result rise price imports, especially energy, due depreciation yen, exchange rate effect dissipate, pace inflation slow down. however, statistical analysis period prior introduction qqe show significant relationship change exchange rate yen inflation japan (chart 16). that is, depreciation yen necessarily lead inflation. let briefly explain case. assume else remain equal, rise price import due depreciation yen factor indeed create upward pressure prices. at time, however, result negative income effect reduce demand import good services, which, turn, exert downward pressure price import good services. for example, gasoline price rise, may try drive le reduce purchase products. a clear relationship yen-dollar exchange rate year-on-year rate change consumer price observe short period introduction qqe (chart 17). this suggest current inflation bring merely depreciation yen. instead, appear qqe trigger certain mechanism result price increase see episode monetary ease past. bi central bankers’ speech 7 how rise price specific good service reflecting, example, depreciation yen ultimately affect aggregate demand aggregate price depend interaction various mechanisms. thus, one-to-one relationship change price specific good service price level overall. in words, one cannot forecast macro-level change simply add micro-level changes. in end, forecast price development macro level, analysis macro perspective necessary. specifically, essential examine output gap, is, much demand relative supply capacity economy whole. the main factor underlie current level inflation grow demand economy whole, effect monetary policy play certain role growth demand. because demand pressure, firm able smoothly pas increase cost well consumption tax hike high sale prices. f. qqe strategy raise growth potential with monetary policy intend effect output gap improving, firm gradually start face supply constraint shortage labor capital stock surface deflation. japan’s unemployment rate increase 3–4 percent mid-1990s 5–6 percent 2000s, despite fact work age population shrink since 1996. on hand, recently, economy face labor shortage, which, give decline number workers, one would expect normal circumstances. thus, one could say japan’s economy gradually return much normal situation, unemployment rate fall number worker shrinks. due decline work age population, well slowdown productivity growth sluggish business fix investment, japan’s potential growth rate estimate decline around 0.5 percent. now improvement output gap bring challenge supply-side fore, good time make effort raise growth potential increase capital stock pursue growth strategy measure respond decline work age population promote innovation regulatory institutional reforms. the reason i refer importance strengthen growth potential necessary condition achieve price stability target. the price stability target 2 percent achieve appropriate conduct monetary policy, regardless level potential growth rate. if aggregate demand grow due monetary easing, worker work efficiently, improvement business sentiment lead firm take risk invest capital stock promote technological innovation. this, turn, likely raise growth potential extent. however, monetary ease alone sufficient achieve government’s target “real economic growth 2 percent average 10 years” provide supplementary boost japan’s growth potential. to achieve government’s target, necessary raise japan’s growth potential push ahead drastic structural reform growth strategy. in deflationary recession, difficult push ahead structural reforms, since bind strong resistance policy measure that, example, seek increase competition deregulation, due severe economic pain measure would bring about. therefore, monetary policy overcome deflation maintain inflation 2 percent medium long term necessary condition promote structural reform order raise potential growth rate. this view even since i become deputy governor bank. 8 bi central bankers’ speech base considerations, bank continue strive pursue appropriate monetary policy measure accord achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time. conclude remark in concluding, let touch

inflation. be anything else pipeline measure adopt far fail? a: new measure adopt thursday i cannot speculate do future. the ecb staff projection 2014 2015 revise downwards, respect growth inflation, govern council also see risk growth downside. growth lose momentum second quarter want prevent weakness feed fall investment create vicious circle. furthermore, recently see change inflation expectations, move away 2%. q: isn’t little late realise that, year inflation 1%? a: we decide basis data. and summer, growth euro area expect accelerate. then come other, worry data show risk lose momentum. q: however, measure adopt unanimously 24 member council. who vote against? a: we don’t comment that. you know january onwards begin publish account meetings. but even decide give detail voting. q: to avoid vote interpret term country origin council member? a: personally, i would favour publish details, since governor independent vote interest euro area, i realise also good reason so. q. might resignation council like 2010 2011 programme purchase public debt approved? a: at time euro area great pressure due severity crisis. there risk euro break-up ecb face difficult decision respect. we comparable situation today. we low growth, low inflation little credit. they represent major challenges, part normal monetary policy debate. i see big difference among governor come analyse situation. the discussion thursday focus whether advisable wait data reacting. but i don’t see substantive difference point time. q: draghi call government go fiscal expansion reform – sound almost like desperate plea. a: mario draghi’s speech jackson hole august conclusion govern council last thursday reflect seriousness situation. the euro area face risk economic growth scale it’s necessary use available tool support economy. and mean use instrument demand side supply side. on demand side, monetary policy. and ecb announce show commit take step instrument ready use. you also fiscal policy, country space expand it. but matter 2 bi central bankers’ speech structural reforms, without supply demand measure effect. q: be message aim france italy? a: we ask anything anyone particular. there nothing give take here. the ecb independent enter kind bargaining. we think expect others job. we highlight condition effective. for example, view, country want flexibility apply stability pact announce reform beforehand, flexibility useless isn’t back reforms. fiscal policy use support aggregate demand – within framework stability pact, that’s important “but”. the pact create confidence. and stretch infringe long credible would undermine confidence and, end, counterproductive growth. in words, flexibility without damage credibility rules. q: germany seem share need fiscal stimulus. a: our measure much effective see structural reform fiscal position appropriate euro area. this discuss evaluate euro area level. it normal ecb say monitor situation across euro area interest stability growth. q: it measure flood market liquidity. but difficult demand credit job employment wage level 1980s. a: people end get work company manufacture good product provide good service customer buy them. monetary policy help provide sufficient liquidity steer liquidity needed. this target longer-term refinance operation adopt june measure announce last thursday, namely programme purchase asset-backed security private sector, aim at. we want sufficiently ample liquidity ecb’s balance sheet move back towards previous level [note editor: go €3,000 billion current €2,000 billion]. and want way meaningful economy. that quantitative increase liquidity (quantitative ease qe), target aim facilitate flow credit. in way, i would describe qualitative increase rather quantitative one. however, get debate terminology. at ecb, believe magic words, qe otherwise. what want devise monetary policy effective current economic situation fit europe’s economic framework. thus, inevitably, ecb’s monetary expansion unlike conduct unite state unite kingdom. we different juncture economy structure differently. in fact, cannot draw many lesson central bank done, situation different. q: ha actual target set expansion ecb’s balance sheet? a: no, set particular target, whatever useful facilitate flow credit economy. we announce programme purchase asset-backed security cover bonds. depend impact growth inflation, programme expanded. the govern council monitor developments, discus them, take decision appropriate. q: you accuse instigate bubble, particularly public debt. a: it true currently enormous amount liquidity global level general euro area particular. and low risk premia across asset classes, public debt. this necessitate great vigilance part investor authority order avoid encourage excessive risk-taking. and also important exercise macroeconomic vigilance, go abundant bi central bankers’ speech 3 liquidity next years. to achieve this, macro prudential instrument use full extend. q: spain issue bond historically low interest rates, debt stand around 100% gdp within ten year face enormous payouts upon maturity. what go happen then? a: it mystery: debt sustainability depend sound fiscal policy, spain way achieve this. it take time, spain already make good progress reduce deficit. this work yet do continue equilibrium reached. debt sustainability require significant increase nominal gdp growth. the ecb’s contribution bring inflation back level close 2% euro area whole, set mandate. however, long term important thing real growth achieve increase productivity. so, way ensure debt sustainability raise productivity, invest increase employment rate, imply structural reforms. q: none factor present. there hardly growth, investment jobs. a: i aware situation still difficult spain spanish people suffer lot process reduce imbalance implement reforms. however, rest assure spain turn corner, outlook improving. this encourage firm invest start recruit again, spanish firm also foreign ones. in way, spain stand example country hit crisis, large country europe’s core, active reform economies. spain example how, reforms, possible redress imbalance get doldrums. q: which reform urgent? a: it depend country. the european commission already issue so-called “country specific recommendations”. the worry thing, commission acknowledges, recommendation rarely followed. it would preferable country take seriously felt collectively committed. in case spain, personal view much remain do support young people help find jobs. they future. q: would favour bind agreement propose angela merkel? a: bind agreement one way achieve this. however, view, good stay within community framework. it multilateral discussion bilateral one commission member state. there share sovereignty far structural reform concerned, common interest. q: the stress test near completion. can expect many failure likely surprises? a: we check results, available second half october, i cannot make comment present. q: will test credible happen portugal’s banco espirito santo (bes)? it collapse despite fact ecb rest troika supervise lisbon past three years. a: in be case, appear information keep supervisor, banco de portugal ecb. the ecb, european commission imf lisbon analyse financial stability macroeconomic outcomes. the ecb neither instrument mandate supervise banks, role national supervisor. i accept, however, be case serve reminder risk beneath surface european bank sector, i convince 4 bi central bankers’ speech single supervisory mechanism able examine financial health institution depth. q: could something similar be case happen countries? a: this always possibility. risk inherent bank activities. the solution robust management framework within bank european level, couple instrument single supervisory mechanism single resolution mechanism, available case crisis. q: some analyst compare situation euro area japan. a: i would imagine refer situation japan 1990s, rather present-day japan. at time, japan anywhere near expansive policy definition price stability anchor inflation. it approach financial sector also different, bank union, resolution rules, stress tests, etc. to put plainly, european supervisors, particular ecb, go allow european bank turn zombie bank lend zombie businesses, say case japan 1990s. q: i understand meet syriza, aspirant party government greece. how view alternative? a: i would prefer make comment political situation greece. i believe, however, appearance protest country subject financial assistance programme [implemented troika] reflection huge demand place population. be democracy mean people right voice complaints. yet also warn leader economy undergo reform, share responsibility effort key. it key economic efficiency political sustainability reforms. social protest remind u cannot reform economy place demand worker fragile part society. q: can euro survive without debt mutualisation? a: the debate future euro centre instrument mutualisation. this view tail wag dog. the question consider extent share risk sovereignty order make monetary union sustainable. since begin crisis make lot progress create various instrument establish effective solidarity within euro area, well governance establish responsibility national level. the process yet completed. for euro sustainable, need strong framework, particularly relation structural reform, need strong share decision-making mechanism. fiscal union part debate, implement sufficient degree homogeneity country mechanism political responsibility become available. fiscal union without democratic control possible incompatible democracy. this subject come up, line. bi central bankers’ speech 1 raghuram rajan: make india, largely india talk dr raghuram rajan, governor reserve bank india, bharat ram memorial lecture, new delhi, 2 december 2014. * * * the global economy still weak, despite strengthen recovery unite states. the euro area veer close recession, japan already experience two quarter negative growth tax hike, many emerge market rethink export-led growth model industrial world stagnates. in last couple years, imf repeatedly reduce growth forecasts. after 6 year tepid post-crisis recovery, imf title recent world economic outlook “legacies, clouds, uncertainties”. the conventional diagnosis remedy why world find hard resume pre-great recession growth rates, let alone restore level gdp would attain great recession happened? the obvious answer legacy financial boom precede great recession debt, overhang debt, whether governments, households, banks, hold back growth. in colourful word imf’s manage director, experience “the new mediocre”. the implication growth unacceptably low relative potential, do lift it, especially give number economy flirt deflation. hence conventional policy advice urge yet innovative monetary intervention ever expand set acronyms, even government urge spend “obvious” need infrastructure. while need structural reform acknowledged, typically deem painful, possibly growth-reducing short run. hence accent monetary fiscal stimulus, much possible give deaden effect debt overhang. the efficacy policy advice remain seen. but japanese check box last two decades, include interest rate hold low long, quantitative easing, massive debt-financed spend infrastructure. few would argue japan shed seem malaise. a different diagnosis a different narrative pre-crisis period emerge may explain effort stimulate economy back pre-crisis growth path successful, even six year crisis.1 the term “secular stagnation” use larry summer describe current persistent economic malaise, echo alvin hansen’s speech 1938 midst great depression, catch on.2 but different economist focus different aspect cause stagnation. summer emphasize inadequacy aggregate demand, fact zero low bind well potential financial instability prevent monetary policy active. the reason weak aggregate demand include age population want consume le increase income share rich, whose marginal propensity consume small. 1 see, example, “the crisis democratic capitalism”, wolfgang streeck, new leave review 71, sept/oct 2011 “the true lesson recession: the west can’t borrow spend way recovery”, raghuram rajan, foreign affairs, volume 91, 3, may/june 2012. 2 summers, l. (2014), “u.s. economic prospects: secular stagnation, hysterisis zero low bound”, speech deliver national association business economics, economic policy conference, february 24, 2014. 2 bi central bankers’ speech tyler cowen robert gordon hand, emphasize weak supply potential.3 they argue post-world war ii year aberration growth help industrial country reconstruction, spread technology electricity, telephones, automobiles, rise educational attainment, high labour participation rate woman enter work force, restoration global trade, increase investment capital. however, post-war total factor productivity growth – part growth stem new idea method production – fell 1920–50 high. more recently, productivity growth fall further, growth hold back headwind plateauing education level labour participation rates, well shrink labour force country population ageing. it obvious list factor hard disentangle effect weak aggregate demand slow growth potential supply. population age contribute both. indeed, one may cause other. for example, anticipate slowdown growth potential, households, worry impend retirement face promise social security entitlement unlikely deliver upon, may try build savings. this depress demand further. conversely, anticipate weak demand may reduce incentive corporation invest, cause supply potential grow slowly. whatever reason slow underlie growth start 1970s, traditional adverse consequence grow unemployment system’s outsider immigrant youth compound grow realization economy could also deliver social security promise without growth. these promises, sociologist wolfgang streeck writes, make wide public growth year 1960s vision “great society” seem attainable.4 promise augment since increase pension old age healthcare commitment public sector workers. these make avert budget-breaking wage increases, create huge liability future, approach fast. growth therefore become imperative, underlie growth slow 1970s on, government begin spend stimulate economy. with supply potential also stagnant, spend translate inflation, spiral upwards. streeck argue industrial country success curb inflation 1980s mean something else take place inflation tax finance spending. and debt, first public debt, government narrow fiscal deficits, encouragement private sector take debt. grow leverage kinds, whether banks, corporates, households, governments, lead financial crisis 2008–11. some private debt morph government liabilities, overall level debt industrial country fraction gdp still growing.5 government force market pressure undertake productivity-enhancing reform prefer delay them. a result, overall debt still grow policy “reaching growth” monetary fiscal stimulus abated. further complicate grow sense amongst middle class need quality high education train slip back rank poor, poor quality early education received, well prohibitive cost quality high education, put good livelihood reach. populist middle class movements, epitomize tea party unite state ukip unite kingdom, reflect worries. the possibility backlash technology, global finance, foreign 3 tyler cowen (2013), the great stagnation, ebook, gordon, r. (2012), “is u economic growth over? falter innovation confront six headwinds”, nber work paper 18315. 4 cite footnote 1. 5 luigi buttiglione, philip lane, lucrezia reichlin vincent reinhart, deleveraging? what deleveraging?, 2014, geneva report world economy. bi central bankers’ speech 3 immigration trade, middle class lead believe responsible plight, real. the mediocre economic outlook might change. strong u growth could pull world funk, low oil price could also give substantial boost aggregate demand. the industrial world may well muddle figure harness monetize (as well measure) new technologies. new well-paying middle class job cannot imagine today may emerge again, always have. but overall, palpable sense gloom industrial world, belief growth unlikely strong enough satisfy foreseeable future. if secular stagnation persists, industrial country figure restructure promises, whether debt, social security, low taxes, distribute burden. after file bankruptcy, city detroit unite state already make tough choices, service pensioner debt, keep museum open police force intact. more difficult decision made. what emerge markets? slow industrial country growth make difficult traditional development path emerge market – export-led growth. indeed, last decade, even china develop back export industrial countries, emerge market flourish export china. emerge market rely domestic demand, always difficult task temptation overstimulate. that task become difficult abundance liquidity slosh around world result ultra-accommodative monetary policy industrial countries. any sign growth attract foreign capital, properly managed, flow precipitate credit asset price boom exchange rate overvaluation. when industrial country monetary policy eventually tightened, capital likely depart emerge market shores. emerge market take extreme care ensure vulnerable point. what implication emerge economy like india, weather initial squall “taper tantrums” summer 2013, take away policy medium term? i would focus four: 1) make india; 2) make india; 3) ensure transparency stability economy; 4) work towards open fair global system. lesson india 1) make india the government commendable aim make india. this mean improve efficiency produce india, whether agricultural commodities, mining, manufacturing, services. to achieve goal, implement ambitious plan build infrastructure. this include • physically link every corner country domestic international market roads, railways, port airports. the kind economic activity generate pukka all-weather road build village – explosion horticulture, poultry, dairy farming, open clothe assort good shops, increase use power vehicle – extraordinary, kind activity emerge around national highways. • ensure availability input power, minerals, water competitive prices. 4 bi central bankers’ speech • link everyone electronically financially broad system mobiles, broadband, intermediary business correspondents. • encourage development public institution markets, warehouses, regulators, information aggregator disseminators, etc. • make possible affordable safe home workplaces. a second necessity increase productivity india improve human capital. this require enhance quality spread health care, nutrition, sanitation start people healthy able. people also need good appropriate education, skill value labour markets, job firm incentive invest learning. the government examine cost business india view bring down. the woe small entrepreneur, confront myriad mysterious regulation govern her, numerous inspector power close down, well known. the petty bureaucrat, empower regulations, become tyrant. it appropriate government intend make help business rather hind it. a regulators, continuously examine cost benefit regulation impose. finally, need make access finance easier. i speak contexts, dwell here. before i move on, let add caveats. there danger discus “make india” assume mean focus manufacturing, attempt follow export-led growth path china followed. i don’t think specific focus intended. first, i argued, slow grow industrial country much le likely able absorb substantial additional amount import foreseeable future. other emerge market certainly could absorb more, regional focus export pay off. but world whole unlikely able accommodate another export-led china. second, industrial country improve capital-intensive flexible manufacturing, much manufacture activity “re-shored”. any emerge market want export manufacture good contend new phenomenon. third, india push manufacture exports, china, still surplus agricultural labour draw on, contend with. export-led growth easy asian economy take path us. i advocate export pessimism – india extremely successful carve area comparative advantage, continue so. instead, i counsel export lead strategy involve subsidize exporter cheap input well undervalue exchange rate, simply unlikely effective juncture. i also caution pick particular sector manufacture encouragement, simply work well china. india different, develop different time, agnostic work. more broadly, agnosticism mean create environment sort enterprise flourish, leave entrepreneurs, plenty, choose want do. instead subsidize input specific industry deem important labour intensive, strategy really pay u years, let u figure public good sector needs, strive provide them. for instance, smes might benefit much agency certify product quality, platform help sell receivables, state portal create market web site them, subsidize credit. the tourist industry probably benefit visa arrival strong transportation network tax sop usually demand. bi central bankers’ speech 5 a second possible misunderstand see “make india” strategy import substitution tariff barriers. this strategy try work end reduce domestic competition, make producer inefficient, increase cost consumers. instead, “make india” typically mean openness, create environment make firm able compete rest world, encourage foreign producer come take advantage environment create job india. 2) make india if external demand growth likely muted, produce internal market. this mean work create strong sustainable unify market can, require reduction transaction cost buy sell throughout country. improvement physical transportation network i discuss early help, fewer, efficient competitive intermediary supply chain producer consumer. a well design gst bill, reduce state border taxes, important consequence create truly national market good services, critical growth year come. domestic demand finance responsibly, far possible domestic savings. our bank system undergo stress. our bank learn past mistake project evaluation structure finance immense need economy. they also improve efficiency compete new player recently license universal bank well soon-to-be license payment bank small finance banks. at time, make task hard create impediment process turn around, recovering, stress assets. the rbi, government, well court considerable work here. we also work spread financial service excluded, learn manage finance save rely borrow responsibly. new institution new product seek financial save every corner country also help halt erosion household save rates, low stable inflation rate. the income tax benefit individual save largely fix nominal term till recent budget, mean real value benefit eroded. some budgetary incentive household save could help ensure country’s investment largely finance domestic savings. 3) ensure transparency stability economy a i argue early speech, even develop country like portugal spain singularly unable manage domestic demand. country tend overstimulate, large fiscal deficits, large current account deficits, high credit asset price growth, see growth collapse money get tight. the country avoid boom bust typically do sound policy frameworks. a country belong power blocks, ever want position need multilateral support. it important get policy framework right. clearly, sound fiscal framework around clear fiscal consolidation path critical. the dr bimal jalan committee’s report provide game plan former, government clearly indicate intent stick fiscal consolidation path lay out. whether need institution ensure deficit stay within control quality budget high, something worth debating. a number country independent budget offices/committees opine budgets. these office especially important score budgetary estimates, include unfunded long term liability industrial country show easy contract time growth hard actually deliver. 6 bi central bankers’ speech on monetary side, central bank focus primarily keep inflation low stable ensure best condition growth. in react developments, however, central bank recognize emerge market resilient industrial economies. so path disinflation cannot steep industrial economy emerge market fragile, people’s buff safety net thinner. a “volker” like disinflation never card india, urjit patel glide path fit u well, ensure moderate growth even disinflate. go forward, discus appropriate timeline government economy move centre medium term inflation band 2–6%. in addition inflation, however, central bank pay attention financial stability. this secondary objective, may become central economy enter low-inflation credit asset price boom. financial stability sometimes mean regulators, include central bank, go popular sentiment. the role regulator boost sensex ensure underlie fundamental economy financial system sound enough sustainable growth. any positive consequence sensex welcome collateral benefit, objective. finally, india will, foreseeable future, run current account deficit, mean need net foreign financing. the best form finance long term equity, is, foreign direct investment (fdi), additional benefit bring new technology methods. while railroad compromise india’s interest attract fdi – example, requirement patent medicine india perfectly reasonable, matter international drug company say – ensure policy transparent redress quick. if make easy young indian company business, also make easy foreign company invest, outsider system. this mean transparent quick legal process deal contractual disputes, proper system bankruptcy deal distress. both issue government take on. let turn finally international framework. 4) work towards open fair global system a country belong power block, export vital natural resource dependent substantial commodity imports, india need open, competitive vibrant system international trade finance. our energy security, example, lie own oil asset remote fragile country ensure global oil market work well disrupted. we need strong independent multilateral institution play role impartial arbiter facilitate international economic transactions. unfortunately, international monetary system still dominate framework put place past industrial countries, governance still dominate citizens. to fair, changing, albeit slowly. but immediate reason fast change. with slow growth, well need finance large debt loads, interest industrial country open global system cannot take granted. for instance, regulation appearance shore safety soundness industrial country financial system may collateral effect discourage investment emerge market assets. we recognize slow growth may direct industrial economy policymakers’ attention inwards, even politics turn protectionist. the multilateral governance system, still dominate industrial countries, may provide sufficient defence openness. emerge market may therefore responsibility keep global economy open. for this, emerge market work quota management reform multilateral institutions, also work inject new agendas, new ideas, new think global arena. no long suffice india simply object industrial country proposals, put table. and bi central bankers’ speech 7 mean research departments, universities, think tank develop idea fee india’s representative international meetings. conclusion let conclude. we dependent global economy think. that grow slowly, inward looking, past mean look regional domestic demand growth – make india primarily india. domestic-demand-led growth notoriously difficult manage, typically lead excess. this need strengthen domestic macroeconomic institutions, foster sustainable stable growth. at time, cannot let foreign market shrink further, take fight open global system. rather reactive, active set agenda. that require investment idea-producing institution – research department official bodies, think tanks, well universities. in sum, diminish expectation world large reason u low sights. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-pierre danthine: swiss bank financial stability perspective introductory remark mr jean-pierre danthine, vice chairman govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 1 december 2014. * * * in remarks, i would like look situation swiss bank financial stability perspective, take big bank first move discussion domestically focus banks. strengthen resilience big bank since last medium news conference, swiss big bank improve capital situation again. the swiss national bank recognise considerable progress make area regard risk-weighted capital ratio leverage ratios. it also opinion strengthen big banks’ resilience must continue, follow reasons. first, risk economic financial environment remain high. in several adverse scenario consider snb, estimate loss potential big bank continue substantial relative capitalisation. this also case view historical perspective, evidence recent financial crisis. second, big banks’ risk-weighted capital ratio average large globally active banks, still cannot say leverage ratios. in context, snb support recommendation group expert head professor brunetti evaluation “too big fail” regulatory framework. the report advocate recalibration capital requirement order ensure switzerland lead position internationally term requirement risk-weighted capital ratio leverage ratios. in particular, report stress leverage ratio requirement systemically important bank increase several country compare minimum propose basel committee. in snb’s view, possible recalibration capital requirement must reflect size concentration bank sector. in fact, imperative last solution find “too big fail” issue switzerland. increase credibility model-based risk-weighted asset beyond recalibrating capital requirements, increase credibility model-based risk-weighted asset (rwa) essential. this important rwa remain key element bank regulation. the brunetti group experts, too, consider prime objective issue also recognise international level. the basel committee therefore announce release set measure consultation. these measure mainly provide revision standardise approach rwa calculation, introduction rwa floor base standardise approaches, well great transparency. the floor aim ensure requirement bank use model-based approach remain sufficiently prudent. in regard, let u also recall finma – together big bank support snb – conduct comparison rwa calculate model-based approach standardise approach. the snb suggest bank consider possibility publish result analysis appropriate form. in case, snb remain convince bank use model-based approach calculate rwa must continue improve transparency regard risks. considerable 2 bi central bankers’ speech progress make already, especially term disclose change rwa break cause. publish parallel calculation rwa base standardise approach would greatly contribute build trust market discipline. enhance transparency likely key component measure basel committee put consultation. domestically focus commercial bank i would like turn situation domestically focus banks. risk face bank still primarily connect mortgage real estate markets. these risk largely remain unchanged high level past six months. in last half year, momentum mortgage market slowed, annual growth mortgage lend slightly le high previous quarters. the mortgage volume continue rise steeply gdp, difference two growth rate become smaller. furthermore, real estate price continue rise but, 2013, momentum remain level observe 2012. development still vary widely one region other. whereas real estate price region hardly increase even decreased, region continue register significant price rises. however, still early all-clear. first, imbalance build since begin low-interest-rate phase remain high level. second, mortgage interest rate drop historically low level past months. and third, broad-based indication change banks’ risk appetite. mortgage lend growth domestically focus bank also decreased, still markedly high overall market growth. moreover, affordability risk (loan-to-income ratio) mortgage lend continue rise, interest rate risk remain historically high level, interest rate margin fall even further, level already low. in exceptional circumstances, bank ensure resilience high enough able bear risk taken, even event mark real estate price correction combine interest rate shock. the countercyclical capital buff play significant role context ensure bank hold additional capital buff current situation. add that, many bank surplus capital respect regulatory requirements. such surplus capital especially important current circumstances. bank therefore maintain surplus future, establish increase line risk profile. a before, snb regularly ass whether countercyclical capital buff need adjust due mortgage real estate market developments. if momentum market pick again, additional measure limit affordability risk mortgage lend take consideration. bi central bankers’ speech 1 fritz zurbrügg: review financial market developments, various interest rate foreign exchange benchmark reform introductory remark mr fritz zurbrügg, member govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 1 december 2014. * * * in remarks, i begin talk development financial market since middle year. then i speak various reform effort area interest rate foreign exchange benchmarks. development financial market after lengthy period calm, volatility increase slightly financial market since middle year. in addition, investors’ appetite risk dip times, risk market suffer temporary setbacks. thus observe two wave sell stock market past month (cf. chart 1). at end july, european stock markets, particular, affected, u emerge economy prove resilient. the second, serious wave sell set end september, make significant impact major non-european market well. the main trigger wave unexpectedly weak economic data core economy euro area japan. to extent, negative effect aggravate geopolitical tensions. however, chart 1 also show wave sell relatively short-lived. a number share indices, include s&p 500 u spi switzerland, rapidly make good loss fact attain new high meantime. important share index within euro area, euro stoxx 50, also able recoup losses, recent level roughly match mid-year. apart continue recovery economy u predominantly sound corporate profit side atlantic, fact central bank euro area, japan china ease monetary policy likely play important role regard. look interest rates, yield government bond continue decline. this partly reflection low inflation decline inflation expectation major advance economies. the fall yield particularly mark euro area, investor expect monetary policy ease measures. accordingly, yield ten-year german government bond come 50 basis point since end june, yield comparable u government bond decline 30 basis points. in period, yield ten-year swiss confederation bond decrease around 35 basis points, recently hit historical low 0.3%. foreign exchange market significantly affect relative strength economic development u correspondingly high interest rate expectations. since end june, trade-weighted u dollar rise nearly 10%. by contrast, trade-weighted euro lose 3.5%, yen lose almost 12% value. chart 2 show that, since middle year, strength u dollar also make felt respect swiss franc. however, chart also show swiss franc become strong euro past months. it likely mainly due two factors. on one hand, disappoint path euro area economy, ease monetary policy associate this, responsible weaken euro. on other, pressure swiss franc reflect strong demand safe investments, particularly period increase geopolitical tension. since 2 bi central bankers’ speech mid-year, trade-weighted swiss franc exchange rate barely change overall. thus, swiss franc still high. reform effort area interest rate foreign exchange benchmark this bring progress make reform interest rate foreign exchange benchmarks. in recent years, revelation manipulation undermine credibility benchmarks. at international level, financial stability board (fsb) coordinate reform efforts. at time, country-specific reform implement national level. in switzerland, responsibility benchmark lies, principle, private sector benchmark regulated. nevertheless, snb particularly interest benchmark interest rate exchange rate credible, since important well-functioning financial market implementation monetary policy. that snb support reform effort area benchmark take part various national international work groups. i report effort several occasions. the fsb publish two final report since last medium news conference, provide good opportunity draw initial conclusions. benchmark interest rate a regard benchmark interest rates, final report recommend pursue two main approach future. first, exist interest rate benchmark improved. second, effort make develop alternative benchmark interest rates. thus two-pronged approach future envisages, alongside improve libor interest rate would still base unsecured money market transactions, emergence benchmark interest rate relate repo transaction near risk-free transactions. the fsb’s final report state significant progress already achieve libor rates. however, requirement set security regulator (iosco standards)1 far met. in particular, still remain unclear whether market upon interest rate base sufficiently liquid. a certain level liquidity need ensure robust benchmark rates, i.e. rate base sufficiently large number transactions. the libor administrator, ice benchmark administration (iba), react fsb report announce improvement ensure libor rate would become good establish use actual transactions. such actual transaction use either directly, calculate libor rates, indirectly, underpin contributions. in context, inclusion short-term loan large customer money market instruments, addition interbank market transactions, examine future possibility. in order ass fsb proposals, survey conduct collect data currency area concerned. the snb conduct survey begin summer switzerland, collect data bank transaction interbank market large customers, well trade money market instruments. more 50 domestic foreign bank take part survey. the result confirm small number actual transaction money market currently constitute problem creation robust benchmark interest rates. consequently, seem improbable pure transactions-based approach could implement swiss franc. this also case transaction type additional instrument take account. for reason, swiss franc libor continue base mainly contribution participate banks. 1 iosco international organization security commissions. bi central bankers’ speech 3 a i mention before, addition improvement exist libor interest rates, fsb also propose alternative benchmark interest rate developed. in switzerland, alternative interest rate short-term swiss franc transaction already exist. an example secure money market saron,2 basis interest rate curve swiss franc repo market. on unsecured market tois3 fixing, relate transaction area call money use interest rate derivatives. however, reform also necessary tois fixing. consequently, new

release financial system review open statement mr stephen s poloz, governor bank canada, press conference follow release financial system review, ottawa, ontario, 10 december 2014. * * * good morning. senior deputy governor carolyn wilkins i please today discus december issue biannual financial system review (fsr), publish morning. the purpose fsr predict likely outcome financial system. instead, use highlight key financial vulnerability catalyst could turn vulnerability risk financial system. the fsr essential complement monetary policy report. together, two stream analysis provide basis fulsome discussion monetary policy, within risk-management framework. although view risk financial system separately risk growth inflation, think carefully interplay them. in fsr, discus three important financial system vulnerabilities: high household indebtedness; imbalance house market; increase investor risk taking. to extent, three normal side effect stimulative monetary policy. however, post-crisis recovery frustratingly slow – call serial disappointment – bond yield policy interest rate unusually low long time. in context, financial vulnerability build time. fortunately, canada’s economy show first sign broaden recovery. non-energy export respond strong u.s. growth exchange rate depreciation, investment spend appear pick up, see pocket new job creation. this natural rebuild sequence key reduce financial vulnerability time. in particular, expectation soft land house hinge strong growth, employment incomes. the recent weakness oil commodity price raise important risk economic outlook, however. this shock especially complex: likely boost global growth moderate growth inflation canada, even though effect temper exchange rate depreciation strong non-energy exports. the potential consequence financial system monitor carefully month ahead. meanwhile, global financial system strong resilient, thank continue progress implement g-20 regulatory framework effort policy-makers market participant around world, include canada. in light continue progress, take account early sign strong exports, investment employment canada, judge probability adverse shock ease since june fsr. this mitigate observation financial vulnerability appear edge higher, leave overall assessment financial stability risk roughly june. that continue believe overall balance risk remain within zone current stance monetary policy appropriate. let add comment specific important risk discuss fsr: difficulty highly indebted household would service debt face sharp decline income sharp rise interest rates. this situation raise risk shock economy could trigger correction house prices. the probability risk materialize low, occur, effect economy would severe. 2 bi central bankers’ speech this risk would great house price judge overvalue relative fundamentals. bank economist do new research risk, highlight box fsr, research paper release today website. although considerable uncertainty around question, various approach – include – suggest risk house market overvalued, estimate fall 10 30 per cent range. we experience house correction early 1980s early 1990s, period price become overvalue similar extent. but episode precede much fast run-up price amid rise inflation expectations. in cases, interest rate rise monetary policy lean inflation, recession ensued. none condition present today. the rise house price much gradual and, context broaden recovery, unwind household imbalance gradual well. that continue expect soft land house market, conditional continue strengthen economy. let reiterate bottom line financial system review: after careful analysis late economic, financial regulatory development home abroad, assessment vulnerability associate household indebtedness house market edge higher, overall risk financial stability canada roughly time june fsr. with that, carolyn i happy take questions. stephen s poloz: speculate future finance remark mr stephen s poloz, governor bank canada, economic club new york, new york city, 11 december 2014. * * * introduction thank invitation speak today. it always pleasure new york, special treat address distinguish audience. i’d like talk future finance. now, i know i don’t convince anyone room importance financial intermediation. just can’t light without power lines, can’t economic growth without financial intermediation. but also know well, financial regulator spend last five year put financial reform place wake 2008 financial crisis. there absolutely doubt reform affect future finance, none u really know how. financial intermediation already evolve response reforms, i think worth speculate trend might develop future. the assumption i make one: amount regulation snuff force competition – competition force nature, go manifest way, lot money stake. regulatory response crisis: much little? at g-20 summit brisbane, leader acknowledge deliver core commitment make response financial crisis. yes, still important issue address, particularly respect consistent implementation reforms. but part core world’s financial system far safe today. depend perspective, reform either overly harsh, lax. a systemically important bank see steep cost reform, unemployed worker still feel steep cost crisis. my perspective central banker macro one, i tell end last year, cumulative loss global output owe crisis roughly us$10 trillion, close 15 per cent global gdp. over 60 million job destroyed. we rightly make strong commitment address serious fault line expose crisis, reduce significantly probability severity future ones. in short, would like ensure never happen again. no doubt, sweep scope complexity reform think new regulatory architecture excessively tight, least first glance. of course, optimize scope intensity regulation never go easy. the new regulatory architecture outcome political process many trade-off significant difference across financial systems. accordingly, principle behind reform matter rule – principles, complement high level supervisory vigilance. fact is, financial world dynamic place, competition inherent it, regardless market structure. principles-based financial regulation set high bar competitive force still foster financial innovation, innovation likely socially improve simply evasive. bi central bankers’ speech 1 in canada, active vigilant supervision go hand hand principles-based approach regulation. to help monitor potential emerge risks, comprehensive radar system include surveillance, guidance enforcement. canadian find complementary approach regulation supervision conducive responsible financial innovation. an important objective g-20 financial reform consistent implementation across jurisdictions, manner avoid unduly impede financial innovation. i see innovation financial intermediation essential foster regulatory balance maintain financial stability one hand facilitate competitive market force hand. a people financial industry create new way business – call regulatory arbitrage, course sound like bad thing – innovation help re-set balance, prompt regulation adapt positive progress financial intermediation. there natural incentive behind financial innovation, since lot money stake innovate successfully. there lot stake macroeconomy, too, return sustainable economic growth around world require continue financial innovation. regulation must allow natural force manifest themselves, albeit safe way. where creative force might take u give context, let’s speculate future financial intermediation: how force competition manifest year ahead? let’s start banks. some may choose shed business line relatively low risk-adjusted returns. in particular, capital market activity could shrink risk weight associate increase. this already started: since 2007 global bank already sell us$700 billion asset operations, foreign operation account almost half. furthermore, response new resolution requirements, large bank may simplify organizational structures. i’m suggest large universal bank disappear. they likely persist, least significant economy scale associate payment foreign exchange. large bank also remain ongoing need serve global clients. for part, small less-complex bank probably increase focus traditional banking. we can’t definitive predictions, simply know competitive force operate new environment. but would surprise net effect reduce availability credit. if financial market imperfection before, imperfection likely even evident new regulatory environment. this straight first economics textbook. it go without say reduce availability credit would headwind economic growth. and, fund gap system best times, turn little big new regulatory umbrella, fund gap probably find usual places: lend young businesses, small- medium-sized companies, trade finance infrastructure, name few. these area retreat bank could look like good opportunity financial intermediaries. we imagine several different channel force competition might emerge, could occur simultaneously. 2 bi central bankers’ speech first, market-based finance. a bank rein risk-taking, expect market-based finance play large role currently does. we see happen already. for starters, market company increasingly fund issue bond market. in u.s., bank dealer significantly reduce inventory corporate bonds, non-bank lender increase hold corporate bonds. whether structure asset managers, insurers, non-bank financial firm retail investors, group opportunistically fill void traditional banker created. securitization another market-based channel could really expand new world. although word securitization taint crisis, i imagine new class high-quality, low-risk securitization product could differentiate mistake past. such innovation welcomed, provide create manner pose new grow risk financial system, liquidity shortfall time stress. importantly, market-based finance even source economic stability, intermediary react differently market turbulence banks. in effect, country diversify finance source may good place weather shock economy. however, market-based finance unlikely erase imperfection future financial system. in particular, market-based finance effective reduce information asymmetries, probably fill fund gap young, small- medium-sized businesses. no doubt, mother nature plan fill gap time, one probable source private lend equity, second channel competitive force likely emerge. there significant advance technology sure influence future provision private capital. one notable example peer-to-peer (p2p) finance, directly connect private lender borrower via internet. an important element model middleman, liquidity maturity transformation traditional bank market-based finance. while p2p finance still infancy, already transform private capital provision grow fast pocket u.k., u.s. china. although originally focus pool fund small investors, p2p finance increasingly dominate big institution hedge fund two-thirds fund loan come institutional investors. this already change face p2p finance important ways. p2p finance impressive cost advantage traditional bank since lot money stake, usual, competitive force certain manifest themselves. with automate credit check “no skin game,” operate expense p2p lending, example, run one-third traditional banks. with advantage, p2p lend provide opportunity saver borrower get “better” deal. however, thing free lunch. the cost good deal significant risk participant take on. despite risks, easily imagine world p2p finance thrives. it already begin spread wide variety new sectors, student loans, real estate, hedging, auto loans, equipment finance, medical loans, business-to-business lending, on. over time, could see p2p finance become global, could also see development deep secondary market securitized p2p loans. if i right le credit available traditional banks, it’s stretch think young, small medium, risky companies, begin tap p2p finance channel meet credit needs. bi central bankers’ speech 3 this evolution could key eventual return sustainable economic growth, i convince return natural growth – oppose policy-induced growth – require resumption new firm creation, sustain innovative financial intermediation. will surge p2p finance mean new risk financial system? perhaps. will risk systemic nature? we don’t clear answer yet, increase participation institutional investor space increase market share p2p finance, could financial stability implications. and mother nature fix imperfection financial system market-based private finance? the third channel might expect play enhance role credit-constrained world public finance. public financial intermediary active area lend small medium-sized enterprise trade finance, demand could rise year ahead. but big need public sector solution likely area infrastructure investment. so-called “green infrastructure” particularly susceptible market failure, suffer basic free-rider problem societal mispricing – double market failure, will. public-private partnership (or p3s) prove increasingly effective tool fund investments, panacea. the p3 space exempt call financial innovation. innovative way risk-sharing investment project – example, government offer innovative guarantee structure take contingent fiscal risk oppose lay large expenditure front – clearly worth experiment with. private sector intermediaries, pension funds, sovereign wealth fund actively encourage develop propose innovations. once again, lot money stake. it clear i big fan market forces. the return successful financial innovation market-based finance p2p finance likely large, perspective innovator macroeconomist. allow competitive force flourish, within principles-based regulation aim protect financial system, essential future economic growth. tweak public financial intermediation take care rest market imperfections. but market structure exist already, speculate future much stretch. that make wonder miss something big. how blue-sky want get? doe anybody besides wonder bank system look like background star trek? or, corporatist model finance, lie background margaret atwood’s novel, the year flood? now that’s blue-sky thinking: people work massive corporation, live corporate compound, go corporate restaurant events, bank financial intermediary wholly-owned employer, turn invest fund growth corporation. i suppose model far-fetched, i present illustration sky really limit space. i offer range possibility today, many possible future finance. financial stability share responsibility a bright future one financial system safe efficient – innovative. financial regulation need design allow competitive force work, allow innovation happen. 4 bi central bankers’ speech i say early difficult strike perfect balance regulation innovation. indeed, public authority can’t strike perfect balance alone. that balance product regulation underlie force competition i talk about. the simple fact financial intermediation is, part, scale business. operate scale create risk market failure, market imperfections, well know. accordingly, operate scale demand financial intermediary social license which, course, go hand hand regulation. in short, contract. all contract function best two party live letter, spirit underlie agreement. i’ve ask imagine possible financial futures; now, imagine one regulate financial player uphold letter, spirit new global regulatory framework? what i suggest industry vanguard positive change, voluntarily embrace spirit financial regulation. use positive response brand rebuild trust street, especially main street. and, process, demonstrate effectiveness principles-based financial regulation allow competition innovation facilitate economic growth. conclusion let wrap up. financial regulation costly, cost pale compare fallout financial crisis. we still pay that. global regulatory reform absolutely essential. so let’s work together make better. thankfully, balance regulation innovation dynamic, static – competitive force ensure this. we critical juncture global economy. we destructive business cycle, policy need remain stimulative legacy headwind subside rebuild phase truly get underway. that rebuild phase require substantial pickup new firm creation young firm survival, particular, foster new job creation. creative financial intermediation necessary ingredient rebuild process. in canada, le difficult cycle countries, part resilience financial system. even so, saw significant destruction export sector, backbone economy. we wait resumption export growth, follow rekindle animal spirits, investment new capacity new firm new job creation, look like natural sequence may finally begun. we plenty room grow, however, take another couple year economy enjoy steady, natural growth inflation sustainably target. it return natural growth want see. but simply happen without vigorous innovative financial intermediation. we need embrace new regulatory architecture get job. bi central bankers’ speech 5 bi central bankers’ speech 1 peter praet: current issue monetary policy speech mr peter praet, member executive board european central bank, peterson institute international economics, washington dc, 9 december 2014. * * * i would like thank tobias blattner contribution speech. summary the ecb respond forcefully counter grow risk prolong period low inflation. the current set measure enhance monetary policy stance, incentivise bank lending, overcome remain impairment transmission mechanism underpin firm anchor medium- longer-term inflation expectations. tentative evidence suggest credit ease package deliver tangible first benefits. but need remain vigilant whether force monetary stimulus already pipeline remain sufficient reach objective. if needed, one option ecb ease monetary policy stance would extend asset purchase towards asset classes. purchase different asset class affect private sector finance condition vary degree activate different transmission channel affect different spread components. * * * lady gentlemen, let thank organiser invite today. konrad adenauer – germany’s first post-war chancellor – famously said, (and freely translated): “why i care remark i make past?” he say know speed event unfold may – time –outpace comprehension give moment. and i go back remark i give spring last year, impression pace event past year indeed dramatic. in may last year i discuss two things. i discuss challenge monetary policy face bank engage rapid leverage deleveraging. i note “the central bank may vigilant pace asset reduction bank commensurate evolution income, activity, employment create downside risk price stability”. and i discuss long-term strategy ecb. here i highlight two main attribute strategy, namely “it must sufficiently flexible adjust policy conduct specific challenge hand. and must sufficiently bind anchor expectation build central bank credibility market participant general public”. when read notes, i ask myself: indeed steady eye state bank sector? and apply two principle strategy – flexible bind – turn challenge year monetary policy euro area? i think answer question qualify yes. a flexible policy response let start spring year. our diagnosis time borrow rate become unreactive policy changes. we saw policy impulse – combine cut 50bps key policy rate 2 bi central bankers’ speech precede year – long transmit private borrow cost way use to. a result – despite accommodative stance – bank lend rate remain elevate level large part euro area. this mean weak credit dynamic increasingly become source downside pressure regard medium-term inflation outlook. in words, dysfunctional bank lend channel full display: excessively restrictive borrow condition suppress demand country applied, indirectly – intra-euro area trade linkage – contribute economic weakness rest euro area. so, close eye bank sector see. how respond diagnosis? in face risks, precisely central bank would done: act restore transmission bring average borrow cost pay household firm level consistent intend stance policy. this philosophy underlie credit ease package adopt june october year. the transmission mechanism want activate – bank lend channel – quite simple and, i would add, orthodox underlie logic. our target long-term refinance operation (tltros) provide significant term fund relief banks: low fix rate period four years. they design maximise chance bank pas fund relief borrowers. bank repay loan advance fail meet agree lend benchmark. and lend beyond benchmark, allow borrow. this positive incentive amplify use multiplier. this show clearly put incentive first, employ counteract exist impairment bank lend channel. the ab purchase programme (abspp), first announce june become operational november, help lubricate transmission process. it activate scarcity channel find critical ingredient success fed’s large scale asset purchase programme. this channel work follows: ab purchase push market spread pay senior tranches, currently main focus purchases. they subtract volume potential private investor tranches, thus encourage bank relieve result scarcity originate abs. ultimately, create loans. the result increase loan supply. and supply loan shift right along give demand credit, lend rate adjust downward create necessary demand. in september add additional leg june package: purchase euro area cover bond (cbpp3), view make credit abundant le expensive. cover bond share characteristic abs: notably, loan-backed security scarcity channel put work. importantly, cbpp3 also strengthen quantitative dimension policy. by increase pool purchasable asset – communicate intention combine measure help bring ecb’s balance sheet back level early 2012 – provide guidance overall scale interventions; scale consider necessary deliver intend support inflation recovery euro area economy. bi central bankers’ speech 3 and scale volume measures, also broaden scope transmission. the tltros abspp primarily work call direct price pass-through effect. that is, measure design ensure unimpeded transmission action ultimate borrow cost private sector. purchase cover bond market similar effect, size liquidity market, transmission channel may become important relative terms. in particular, cover bond purchase also activate two prime transmission channel large-scale asset purchases: portfolio rebalancing signal channels, dependent size monetary stimulus. so, i think fair say response far flexible. the diagnosis lead credit ease package identify dysfunctional bank lend channel prime threat achieve ultimate objective price stability. our measure tailor-made objective offer powerful response address root cause impair bank lending, thus facilitate new credit flow economy. be working? tentative evidence suggest yes: credit ease package indeed deliver tangible first benefits. broad measure nominal financial condition ease spread senior ab cover bond fallen. consistent expectations, price adjustment particularly pronounce segment intervene directly. the case ab market stand out: spread fell impressive 70bps since may although purchase start week ago. by way comparison: fed’s qe-1 announcements, involve combine purchase nearly $2tn mbs, treasury gses, estimate low 30-year mb yield 100bps. at time, broad-based nature ease across market suggest signal effect – operate flatten ois curve – also powerful element response. lend rate fall too. since may composite indicator nominal cost bank borrow euro area nfcs fell 40bps 2.6% october. in italy indicator fell nearly 60bps. in words, premium italian firm pay bank borrow relative average euro area firm fall recent month – sign transmission policy gain traction. lend volume seem respond too. evidence grow turn point loan dynamic might reached. a result, downward pressure output gap stem impair credit supply level off. at time, bank also report increase loan demand, mean measure come right time: bank would borrow tltro unless demand loan strengthens. a bind policy response but flexibility aside, also adhere element strategy i mention last year: measure bind enough? here need cautious assessment. the fact – despite broad-based measure associate fall private borrow cost – inflation stop trend down. in november inflation euro area fell back cyclical low 0.3%. when last meet may 2013 still 1.4%. the sharp fall oil price since summer – 30% euro term since early june – explain significant portion fall. but measure underlie inflation – strip volatile item energy food – also continue trend down. fall core inflation point weakness broad aggregate demand – consistent loss economic momentum observe recent 4 bi central bankers’ speech months. and late staff projection foresee material downgrade macroeconomic outlook. these development also affect inflation expectations. short-term inflation expectation almost move tandem fall headline inflation. but recently – basically since summer – also observe fall medium- long-term inflation expectations. in principle, reactive short-term commodity price gyrations. doe mean action bind enough? not necessarily. first, notwithstanding recent decline, market- survey-based measure medium-term inflation expectation remain close vicinity aim keep inflation close to, 2%. second, fall market-based measure limit euro area. break-even rate medium-term inflation swap also fell jurisdictions, us. this course mean ignore developments. well-anchored inflation expectation indispensable medium-term price stability. they provide nominal anchor economy. and even current environment: give potency current oil price shock, risk inflation may temporarily fall negative territory come months. normally, central bank would prefer look positive supply shock. after all, low oil price boost real income may lead high output future. but may luxury present. the reason shock change: certain circumstance supply shock morph demand shock via second-round effects. in condition monetary policy need react initially appear supply shock, prevent destabilisation inflation expectations. remember: bind element strategy. in light this, govern council last week reiterate monetary stimulus fall short intention move balance sheet towards dimension begin 2012, become necessary address risk prolong period low inflation, remain unanimous commitment use additional unconventional instrument within mandate. this would imply alter early next year size, pace composition measures. ecb staff relevant eurosystem committee therefore step technical preparation measure view implement timely manner, needed. indeed, monetary policy measure gear towards underpin firm anchor medium long-term inflation expectations, line aim achieve inflation rate below, close to, 2%, contribute return inflation rate towards level. extend policy response extend outright asset purchase towards asset class could one option judge economy need stimulus. it important though constantly keep mind intention, purpose adopt measures. asset purchase end themselves. they target monetary policy. they instrument policy. to see this, let u conduct think experiment: face circumstance now, would react normal time – is, positive policy rate impairment transmission? in view would low rate now. this reaction would consistent guide wealth evidence gather time transmission change key interest rate borrow rate economic activity inflation. bi central bankers’ speech 5 so, say measure intend bring balance sheet back level see early 2012, really say – give current composition unconventional monetary policy put place – amount need bring inflation medium term back level close 2%. and bank-based economy euro area, pin amount rest crucially effectiveness measure reduce borrow cost household firms. it follow important criterion choice additional measure – need – degree influence broad finance condition private economy, scale amount ease judge sufficient achieve price stability mandate. this might give rise trade-off: asset might ex ante effective others reduce private borrow costs, might short supply. others might abundant supply, le effective priori plague institutional complications. understand effectiveness – hence transmission – purchase therefore key calibrate size composition response case need act further. purchase different asset class affect private sector finance condition vary degree activate different transmission channel affect different spread components. for example, purchase bond issue euro area non-financial corporation (nfcs) would probably direct pass-through effect finance cost firm stand ability tap credit market directly. and could indirectly – sort “trickling down” effect – make credit abundant le expensive small firm increase scope bank redirect credit provision large small enterprises. also, low market-based fund cost might incentivise medium-sized firm replace expensive bank lend issue bonds. but compare asset classes, market nfc bond relatively thin quite heterogeneous across euro area. this could imply potential portfolio rebalancing signal effect would contained. furthermore, large issuer active market likelihood average financially constrained, may limit propagation easy fund condition decision expand capacity. the transmission would work differently decide buy bond issue euro area sovereigns. this would market size would generally issue. intervention market would therefore likely entail strong signal ecb – consistent forward guidance – commit maintain accommodative stance extend period time. this signal compress risk-free curve further, also spill-over inflation expectations, thereby help low real expect rate interest. we would also expect broad portfolio effect materialise seller government bond will reduce excess hold cash bid price – hence low yield – alternative financial instrument purchase central bank. for banks, broad portfolio effect might entail shift government bond – fixed-income instrument – loan creation. this essentially work banks’ opportunity cost lending. our analysis show sovereign spread member state still prevent lend rate fall further. remember existence large spread sovereign bond market probably one main reason 3-year ltros limit effect term stimulate credit supply banks. 6 bi central bankers’ speech although spread narrow sharply, remain considerable difference real – is, inflation adjust – yield across countries. therefore, purchase government bond reduce banks’ opportunity cost lend low return alternative investments, might create incentive bank extend credit private sector, particular bank regain confidence start reappraise macroeconomic outlook result central bank action. in addition, presence buyer ab cover bond market eas potential balance sheet capacity liquidity concern go along increase credit supply. a precondition channel unleash full effect healthy bank system. the high banks’ capital ratios, low bad loan exposure transparent balance sheets, large chance quantitative impulse central bank get transmit wide economy. in sense, completion comprehensive assessment start ssm provide important support current potential future effort revitalise sluggish lend euro area. in particular, increase clarity transparency banks’ balance sheets, together good capitalise bank sector, create supportive lend environment. of course, effectiveness criterion ass potential new measures. in euro area, deliberation also need build factor institutional specificity euro area, include boundary set treaty, notably respect monetary finance prohibition bail-out clause. that is, cannot simply import experience central banks. we carefully design measure tailor institutional set-up euro area. unlike central banks, deal single fiscal authority multitude national fiscal authorities. conclusion let conclude. since june ecb respond forcefully counter grow risk prolong period low inflation. take together, measure sizeable impact balance sheet, intend move towards dimension begin 2012. in come months, measure ease monetary policy stance broadly, support forward guidance key ecb interest rate reinforce fact significant increase difference monetary policy cycle major advance economies. but late euro area macroeconomic projection indicate low inflation, accompany weak real gdp growth subdue monetary dynamics. in context, early next year govern council reassess monetary stimulus achieved, expansion balance sheet outlook price developments. we also evaluate broad impact recent oil price development medium-term inflation trend euro area. should become necessary address risk prolong period low inflation, govern council remain unanimous commitment use additional unconventional instrument within mandate. this would imply alter early next year size, pace composition measures. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 erdem başçi: recent economic financial development turkey speech mr erdem başçi, governor central bank republic

development present medium-term inflation forecasts, revise view development last quarter, along monetary policy stance. in addition main text, report include six box entail interest up-to-date analysis various topics. for example, report present box analyze determinant bond flow emerge economy change time sensitivity inflation output gap loans. moreover, study elaborate current account fluctuation current account deficit corrections, non-core liabilities, correlation capital flow loan growth across wide range economy role macroprudential measure elasticity loan capital flows. title box show slide. all analysis shed light noteworthy issue turkish economy. i strongly recommend read boxes, soon publish website. distinguish guests, i would like commence speech review global economic outlook give undeniable influence policies. in third quarter year, uncertainty advance country monetary policy lead partial volatility increase global financial markets. while u federal reserve (fed) end quantitative ease program, uncertainty regard time size policy rate hike continued. in period, european central bank (ecb) cut policy rate risk economic slowdown deflation announce kind quantitative ease program buy cover bond asset-backed securities. in second third quarter 2014, indicator global economic activity perform low expected, cause growth forecast year revise down. financial market volatility fall global growth rate lead fluctuation capital flow emerge economy (chart 1). follow weaken global growth outlook, commodity price drop markedly well. 2 bi central bankers’ speech regard development turkish economy, recent global financial volatility appear affect turkey way similar emerge economies. in third quarter, turkey’s risk premium indicator fluctuate par emerge economy (chart 2). economic activity lose momentum first quarter. the slow eu growth geopolitical tension restrain external demand. despite wan external demand, export continue support balance growth. the macroprudential measure tight monetary stance positive implication core inflation trend. a sizable amount significant first-half increase core inflation indicator reverse third quarter. annual core good inflation continue slow negative effect exchange rate change diminish. moreover, fall oil price restrict inflationary pressure energy items. however, elevate food price cause inflation hover significantly target. we expect significant disinflation bi central bankers’ speech 3 upcoming year. the continue decline cumulative exchange rate effects, return food inflation average level previous year fall commodity prices, especially oil, main factor contribute disinflation. moreover, believe tight fiscal stance set medium term program (mtp) support decline inflation. 1. monetary policy monetary condition distinguish guests, the central bank implement front-loaded strong monetary tighten first quarter 2014 low policy rate gradually amid reduce domestic external uncertainty second quarter. during third quarter, firstly cut one-week repo auction rate 8.75 8.25 percent, overnight borrow rate 8 7.5 percent july. in august, operate within symmetric interest rate corridor, low overnight lend rate 12 11.25 percent, rate borrow facility primary dealer via repo transaction 11.5 10.75 percent (chart 3). in period, provide cbrt fund primarily one-week repo auction (chart 4). thus, average fund rate come close one-week repo rate. yet, take account geopolitical tension financial market volatility, fortify tight monetary stance tight liquidity policy since september. accordingly, bist overnight repo rates, near one-week repo auction rate july august, lately follow course close upper end interest rate corridor. while measure rate cuts, maintain tight monetary policy stance keep yield curve nearly flat quarter well. the spread 5-year market rate bist interbank overnight repo rate negative level october (chart 5). in addition, tighten liquidity policy recently, short-term rate rise substantially. thus, able keep yield curve nearly flat course. on hand, spread long short-term rate continue hover historical level (chart 6). we closely monitor inflation expectations, price behavior factor affect inflation upcoming period maintain tight 4 bi central bankers’ speech monetary policy stance keep flat yield curve significant improvement inflation outlook. we aim support continuity balance growth capital inflow turkey global monetary policy normalization. to end, change foreign exchange deposit rate bank pay borrow cbrt within limit foreign exchange deposit market. a 9 october 2014, rate apply banks' one-week maturity borrow cbrt last resort facility reduce 10 percent 7.5 percent usd 10 percent 6.5 percent eur. moreover, consider increase size banks’ balance sheet cbrt’s international reserves, announce revise banks’ usd 10.8 billion transaction limit foreign exchange banknote market press meet “monetary exchange rate policy

domestic savings. a incentive, decide remunerate turkish lira component require reserve financial institutions. additionally, arrangement, aim reduce sensitivity cost hold turkish lira require reserve cbrt’s policy rate thus strengthen automatic stabilization feature reserve option mechanism. distinguish guests, a loans, see macroprudential measure tight monetary stance help keep pace loan growth reasonable levels. the annual rate total loan growth 16 percent, 2007-2013 average 23 percent, october 2014. in term loan trends, annualized growth rate consumer loan continue hover low level commercial loan remain relatively robust (charts 7 8). i would like emphasize loan outlook restrain medium-term inflationary pressure support improvement current account balance. bi central bankers’ speech 5 2. macroeconomic development assumption distinguish guests, now, i talk macroeconomic outlook assumption forecast based. first, i summarize recent inflation developments, continue domestic foreign demand outlook. annual consumer inflation fell 0.3 point quarter-on-quarter 8.86 percent third quarter 2014, inflation exclude unprocessed food tobacco 8.37 percent mostly consistent july inflation report forecast (charts 9 10). due adverse weather condition cumulative effect exchange rate changes, food price remain subcategory make great contribution inflation. however, main driver third-quarter fall inflation energy core goods. annual inflation continue decline across core good category thank decrease negative effect exchange rate developments. regard underlie inflation trends, significant improvement core good category. meanwhile, service category produce relatively negative outlook. in third quarter, core inflation trend record decline 6 bi central bankers’ speech follow favorable impact macroprudential measure tight monetary stance (chart 11). accordingly, mark first-half inflation increase core indicator reverse third quarter. yet, i would like note underlie trend indicator still target-consistent levels. in period, international commodity prices, especially oil, fell line weak global growth outlook usd-denominated import price dropped. in addition favorable outlook import costs, aggregate demand condition relatively slow pace growth consumer loan alleviate pressure inflation. in fact, exclude food product associate service subcategories, see annual consumer inflation decline considerably third quarter (chart 12). in sum, negative effect cumulative exchange rate development continue wane third quarter, yet food price remain relatively unfavorable track. the prolong high level consumer inflation ongoing deterioration inflation expectation adversely affect price behavior certain categories, particularly services. we expect fall commodity prices, drive weak global demand, bring consumer inflation down, await moderate pace domestic demand restrain upside risks. thus, believe underlie inflation move downward forthcoming period. distinguish guests, now, i would like give brief account development economic activity short-term outlook inflation forecast based. accord gdp data second quarter 2014, economic activity relatively weak compare outlook present july inflation report. in second quarter, saw industrial production remain virtually unchanged quarter-on-quarter, national income post decline eight quarter seasonally adjust term (chart 13). this decline mostly attribute agricultural sector, make 0.3 point negative contribution quarterly growth. therefore, national income growth lag behind industrial production growth (chart 14). bi central bankers’ speech 7 industrial production, grow 1.1 percent july-august period 2014 compare precede quarter, contribute growth third quarter. on hand, may see decline agricultural value added. thus, signal gdp growth may fall short industrial production growth period well. factor like slowdown european economic growth geopolitical development lead external demand decelerate, induce mark slowdown growth export exclude gold (chart 15). a result, although expect slowdown external demand third quarter partially offset rebound domestic demand, i would like emphasize third-quarter growth accommodate downside risk stem agricultural sector. 8 bi central bankers’ speech a steady recovery consumer investor confidence yet appear, suggest downside risk domestic demand still persist. we believe deceleration trend external demand curb rise export while. however, expect fall commodity price contribute positively current account balance reduce import cost (chart 16). distinguish guests, a know, food, energy import price also play great role inflation forecasts. therefore, move forecasts, i briefly talk assumption regard variables. in third quarter year, oil import price remain path envisage july inflation report (chart 17). accordingly, revise assumption average oil import price 2014 2015 downwards. give current outlook, due external prices, year-end inflation forecast 2014 2015 revise downwards 0.3 0.2 percentage points, respectively. consider also high course food inflation third quarter, revise year-end inflation assumption food price upwards 12.5 percent 2014 9 percent 2015. these revision food price drive year-end inflation forecast 2014 2015 high 0.8 0.3 percentage points, respectively. our medium-term projection base assumption tax adjustment administer price consistent inflation target automatic price mechanisms. price increase electricity natural gas 9 percent, release early october, slightly exceed assumption july inflation report. thus, end-2014 inflation forecast revise upwards 0.2 percentage points. we base assumption medium-term fiscal policy stance mtp projection cover 2015-2017 period. accordingly, assume tight fiscal stance implement primary expenditure gdp ratio taper off. 3. inflation monetary policy outlook distinguish guests, now, i would like present inflation output gap forecast base outlook i describe far. bi central bankers’ speech 9 our medium-term forecast base assumption tight monetary policy stance maintain keep flat yield curve. a assumption annual loan growth rate reach nearly 15 percent end 2014 stabilize around reasonable level back macroprudential measures. accordingly, expect inflation be, 70 percent probability, 8.4 percent 9.4 percent (with mid-point 8.9 percent) end-2014 4.6 percent 7.6 percent (with mid-point 6.1 percent) end-2015. we expect inflation stabilize around 5 percent medium term (chart 18). we expect inflation considerably exceed 5-percent target year-end, decrease significantly start 2015 fall 6.1 percent end-2015. this noticeable decline forecast inflation drive projection cumulative exchange rate effect continue taper off, food inflation recede past year average commodity prices, chiefly oil, stay expect low levels. moreover, believe demand condition announce tight fiscal policy stance support decline inflation period. the fluctuate course 2015 inflation forecast see slide stem base effect (chart 18). distinguish guests, in addition forecasts, alternative scenario inflation outlook global economy discuss risk section inflation report. you examine report details. while conclude remarks, i would like thank colleague contribute report, primarily research monetary policy department well member monetary policy committee, thank every one participation. bi central bankers’ speech 1 joachim nagel: how bank union transform banks’ it requirement keynote speech dr joachim nagel, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, 20th handelsblatt annual conference bank technology, frankfurt main, 3 december 2014. * * * 1. open remark professor bott lady gentleman it give great pleasure address handelsblatt annual conference today. “all digital – all mobile – all compliant”, motto year’s annual conference bank technology, point major challenge face it department financial institutions. in capacity member bundesbank’s executive board, i responsible market information technology departments. so i familiar problem difficulty associate bank’s it infrastructure. on one hand, yardstick bank’s chief information officer (cio) measure way support institution’s core business area deliver high-quality it service products, ideally standardise streamlined. it security come increasingly play here. on hand, also expect demonstrate high level agility innovative ability face stiff competition, include enterprise outside traditional bank sector. together business units, then, important banks’ it reap great business benefit implement joint project employ innovative information technology. it crucial recognise harness business relevance trend field information technology – trend mobility, refer conference’s motto. big data, “datability”, social medium cloud compute undoubtedly open additional major opportunity banks. yet time pose new challenges, especially respect it security. today, i would like shed light third facet event’s motto – “all compliant” – regard european bank union. the german corporate governance code define “compliance” adherence legal provision corporate guidelines, fall within responsibility senior management.1 compliance therefore mean adhere satisfy legal regulatory requirements. the financial community confront many new revise requirement conditions, particularly result regulation adopt course financial sovereign debt crisis. bank need demonstrate “regulatory compliance” these, also direct impact it. 2. the bank union – response financial market crisis the current financial sovereign debt crisis also expose flaw architecture bank supervision. i would therefore like highlight four weak point either eliminate work towards eliminate road european bank union. 1 german corporate governance code approve code’s government commission 24 june 2014. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 1. consistent european bank supervision bank supervision national level replace 4 november 2014 direct, ecb-led supervision large european banks. under single supervisory mechanism (ssm), prudential report data significant bank collect central authority, information assess manner allow cross-border comparison drawn. 2. harmonisation bank supervision the establishment uniform prudential framework bring great harmonisation bank oversight member states, regulatory arbitrage prevent shift responsibility bank supervision resolution european level. 3. liability cascade event resolution one lesson crisis teach u bank “too big fail”: bad come worst, must able fail. the single resolution mechanism (srm) define usually self-evident liability cascade, accord shareholder creditor first second line absorb losses. taxpayer last link chain liability. 4. capital back government bond on hand, high level sovereign debt also destabilise domestic bank sector – i refer specifically zero risk weight government bonds. in future, vicious circle sovereign bank risk could break implement appropriate measures. after all, see government bond risk-free. that preferential regulatory treatment afford government bond exposure public sector, particular, need bring end. the idea behind bank union common financial regulatory framework, know single rulebook, rest two main pillars. the first pillar central, joint responsibility bank supervision aegis ecb. this already put place shape ssm. the second pillar srm, responsible recovery resolution insolvent bank time crisis. the srm necessary complement ssm and, together, represent two side coin: aim facilitate orderly recovery resolution institution event insolvency. there also talk third pillar form single deposit guarantee scheme. but would entail joint, cross-border fiscal responsibility, step policymakers yet prepare take. the recently revise eu directive deposit guarantee scheme did, however, bring great harmonisation european deposit guarantee schemes. it le exactly one month since ssm come force. on 4 november, ecb take far-reaching supervisory responsibility assign credit institution euro area. in ssm, ecb euro-area national competent authority work together. the division task european national institution base distinction significant le significant institutions. specifically, follow institution define significant:  bank total asset €30 billion 20% national gdp total asset also latter case amount least €5 billion;  bank receive direct indirect assistance efsf esm; bi central bankers’ speech 3  three significant credit institution ssm member state. these “either/or” criteria. this mean one criterion alone sufficient classify institution “significant”. for significant institution – present, 120 roughly 85% aggregate total asset across bank – ecb take complete supervision. for 3,600 “less significant” institution across europe task perform national supervisory authorities. so, 1,700 german institution still subject ongoing supervision bundesbank potential measure bafin. nevertheless, ecb exercise oversight system whole. the ecb ensure consistent high-quality supervisory practice ssm set standard issue instructions. the european bank authority (eba) responsible development regulatory standard european banks; compliance matter ecb national competent authorities. european supervision make major contribution  integration financial market mean uniform standard  separation bank sovereign risk  stability financial market. from it perspective, ssm introduce new work process well change exchange information report channels. via national competent authority (ncas) – germany, bundesbank – ecb receive report data bank ssm area, irrespective significance give institution. for significant banks, bundesbank become supplier data ecb. the data report ncas analyse ecb serve basis regulatory decision significant institutions. for non-significant institutions, national application continue exist, adapt future harmonise european specifications. supervision significant bank undertake joint supervisory team (jsts). a jst establish institutions. these team head coordinator member staff ecb. the team largely make staff national competent authorities. in future, supervisor access ecb bank supervisory application via ssm information management system (imas). imas provide infrastructure ensure harmonise process consistency supervision bank institutions. it key element safeguard application common methodology standard jsts. the system offer ecb decision-makers bank supervisor efficient access operational analytical data via stable user-friendly interface. the first harmonise application european regulatory framework design receive analyse institutions’ solvency financial data ssm country base xbrl format2 conformity eba’s technical implement standards. 3. new requirement bank infrastructure the implementation new supervisory standard become great challenge financial industry since lehman insolvency accord recent forrester study. it 2 xbrl (extensible business report language) language base xml use preparation electronic documentation field financial reporting. 4 bi central bankers’ speech find that, corporate viewpoint, compliance regulatory requirement high priority, 60% agreement. this follow improve customer service operational efficiency, low ranking.3 the direct cost associate bank industry germany result regulation period 2010 2015 also represent challenge, however. accord study kpmg, project total around €9 billion.4 report press recently make frequent mention “wave regulation” inundate banks’ it. there even talk “excessive regulation” “regulatory tsunami”. with sympathy great challenge bank facing, forget demand arose. they due sometimes glare error development lack meaningful possibility analyse data exist bank – crisis day. what observe inspection bank it bank suffer data collect maintain accordance uniform standard limit automate facility analyse data thus utilise forward-looking risk management. risk silo exist. the outcome management often find situation decision make insufficient knowledge facts. this chiefly concern bank international focus, admittedly find difficult coordinate it spread large number locations. more others, however, absolutely essential order hold volatile economic environment. the whole thing problem german banks; accord study basel committee, concern le international banks. it go without say “data graveyards” created. i think that, together financial institutions, strike healthy and, all, viable balance future well. furthermore, many regulation newly invented; already national bank supervision reality. in germany, example, implementation section 25 bank act (kreditwesengesetz, kwg) minimum requirement risk management (mindestanforderungen da risikomanagement, marisk) mean many mention requirement already common practice among supervisors. warren buffett quote say “someone sit shade today someone plant tree long time ago.” a i see it, it department consistently promptly implement requirement early inspection practice well equip future demand it. the new “principles effective risk data aggregation risk reporting” (bcbs 239) adopt basel committee begin 2013 apply initially 2016 global systemically important bank (g-sibs). a bank deem systemically important global term insolvency would severely impede function global financial system significant part thereof, would also negative effect real economy. the financial stability board (fsb) classify 30 institution worldwide systemically important, include deutsche bank sole german institution. it already envisage extend domestic systemically important banks. risk information complete, correct, consistent current make available form appropriate addressees. this always demand supervisory authorities. however, basel standard set out, first time, globally coordinated, specific regulatory requirement architecture risk data management. 3 forrester: preliminary result 2014 global financial service architecture online survey, august 2014. 4 kpmg: impact regulatory requirements, december 2013. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the implementation provision make possible improve management information across legal entities, improve quality strategic plan option complete assessment risk exposure high consolidate level. responsibility lie senior management. the regulatory provision lead harmonisation it infrastructures, flexible consistent process risk management enhance analytical capabilities. the challenge implement principle highly ambitious require considerable input term human resource technology. this apply particular risk management, finance information technology. in medium long term, however, also bring many opportunities. even early stage, possible ass risk quickly reliably; also crucial improvement quality basic element management. these change therefore also interest enterprise themselves. 4. result challenge institution the requirement place institution ssm catalyst major change relevant business area it departments, particularly regard report data. the expansion report content lead mark increase volume data submitted. for example, tenfold rise volume expect harmonise solvency financial data. another new aspect large institutions’ report large exposure exceed €300 million could contain 200 mb data per submission. and i must confess european harmonisation credit report still infancy requirement cards. give sheer scale affect data, “big data” innovative analytical, visualisation report tool well in-memory technology5 gain great importance banks’ it, haven’t do already. up now, many data already aggregate institution part report process total figure submit supervisory authority. it increasingly case individual data required, aggregate bank supervisors. the information data report bank considerably granular serve basis extend analysis field bank supervision. institution need get use idea regulatory requirement implement much short space time. time pressure associate plan uncertainty likely pose main problem respect. up now, time lag one year publication new requirement bundesbank first-time submission data line new requirements. in wake launch ssm, eba reduce timeframe 2–3 months. the apply completely new area previously systematic collection data. the advantage xbrl lingua franca exchange financial information obvious. data structure base defined, uniform procedure allow information transmit efficient manner le prone errors, subsequently process evaluated. the complexity taxonomy report format result increase volume data disadvantage compare previous, simple formats. these directly impact it, place great demand it infrastructures, processor performance storage requirements. bank therefore need upgrade capabilities. 5 in-memory database permanently store entire data pool main memory, thereby enable much fast read-only access traditional database systems. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the previous interface commercial bank supervisory authority changed. up now, incoming report subject syntactic checks, technical verification take place downstream process. at bundesbank, example, bundesbank staff report inconsistency respective institutions. the correction could make institution consultation member staff. gradually – process start back 1 april 2014 corep (common solvency ratio reporting) – submission correction process automate far possible, ssm continue take shape.6 the report data machine-checked technical correctness well subject initial specialist entry checks. at end process, erroneous report automatically rejected. each individual submission subject several thousand automate checks. institution must expect error message able deal yet standardise content formats. overarch examination economic, financial large exposure data mean institution need cross-check figure last detail, even stem different systems. the timeframe correction institution reduced. this means, inter alia, banks’ internal correction process need make efficient consistent, might require resources. i think challenge i present summarise follow area action banks’ it financial architecture:  data governance data architecture need optimise order enhance quality, accuracy integrity data.  analytical report process need facilitate fast decision-making direct availability relevant information.  process database area finance, control risk need harmonised.  increase automation data exchange process supervisory authority required.  fast flexible implementation supervisory requirement business unit it necessitate modular flexible architecture appropriate project management methods. bank must ensure it equip this. further development framework condition pipeline:  the ssm gradually harmonise bank supervision report system european level. thus, new framework continually develop european context.  the ecb eba set requirement liaison national competent authorities. corep large exposure report already report first time line european requirements.  the requirement concern scope content report increase significantly, response time new requirement slashed. this trend look set continue future.  new standard bcbs 239 require relevant institution integrate automate data process place. 6 the europe-wide standardise corep provide bind solvency report system. bi central bankers’ speech 7  european harmonisation credit report presently discuss (analytical credit dataset – anacredit). it fundamentally different current report system. we expect regulation lead increase number metrics, additionally fine granularity. furthermore, low report threshold increase report frequency cards. in opinion, two key messages: 1. bank need invest information technology. the implementation supervisory requirement tie considerable resource entail costs. 2. regulatory project reduce operational risk, permit good fast assessment risk possible course action. this can, turn, diminish operate cost offer crucial competitive edge. 5. conclusion lady gentleman to achieve common goal make financial market stable, various bank governance function – particular, risk management, report finance – need much good integrate now. overarch data methodological governance, integration process it system need oust exist silo monolithic systems. furthermore, institution need capable safeguard flexible timely report different target groups. thus modernisation it system one big challenge face banks. institution want keep cost fulfil new – regulatory – requirement minimum. to this, modernise it architecture. the senior supervisor group7 emphasise importance strong it governance, bring together business unit it, 2010 report8 this also key point me: it strategy need embed business strategy. the necessary transformation must end it perspective, need strategically anchor found business policy. many regulatory requirement necessary precisely banks’ system integrated. only holistic cross-business approach take it financial architecture next strategic level. lady gentleman thank much attention. 7 this body comprise representative

career study work fomc – include use power chair nature consensus build dissent within committee. interestingly, work coauthored former colleague mine philadelphia fed, todd vermilyea, work board governors. today, i plan talk importance take longer-term view set monetary policy. we live 24-hour news cycle focus lot time energy analyze tea leaf daily onslaught new economic data disposal. yet, i believe mistake policymakers focus intently recent number justify policy decision. our data always noisy often subject substantial revision, witness last week’s gdp revision see regularly monthly employment report. instead, must focus attention underlie trend likely path economy intermediate longer-term horizon. 2 bi central bankers’ speech one reason policymakers must think long term effect monetary policy action inflation employment may felt many quarter maybe year future. thus, near term path economy unlikely alter significant way today’s policy choices. we must look ahead assess appropriate stance monetary policy. of course, great deal uncertainty future implication approach policy. i begin brief overview economy one policymaker see near end 2014. economic condition over past year, see encourage sign economy. the recent estimate annualized real gdp growth third quarter 3.9 percent, follow strong growth second quarter 4.6 percent. take long view, growth third quarter last year year 2.4 percent. but include negative 2.1 percent growth rate first quarter 2014 consequence severe winter largely transitory nature. we see continue strength personal consumption, especially durable goods, well business fix investment, mark strong two quarter growth investment business nearly three years. gdp growth average 2.3 percent 21 quarter recovery since mid-2009. that half point 5-year growth rate measure 2000s recession, is, part, recovery often see moderate modest historical perspective. nonetheless, see sustain improvement manufacture sector. the november read philadelphia fed’s manufacture business outlook survey indicate strong growth manufacture activity. even encourage sustain increase witness sector. after mediocre performance mid-2011 mid-2013, index positive nearly 18 consecutive months, aberration february 2014 depth severe winter weather. our index often view useful indicator national manufacture activity, indeed national ism manufacture index also show solid performance past 18 months. the labor market also strengthen year. employer add job average rate 229,000 per month first 10 month year, 18 percent high rate 2013, it’s high see point recovery. this acceleration job growth help bring unemployment rate 5.8 percent october, compare 7.2 percent year ago. over course recovery, unemployment rate fall peak 10 percent october 2009 5.8 percent today. other measure unemployment also declined. for example, measure call u6, include marginally attach worker work part time economic reasons, fall peak 17.2 percent 11.5 percent. inflation, moment, remain well contained. the personal consumption expenditures, pce, price index, measure inflation prefer fomc, register 1.4 percent increase 12 month october. it run somewhat fomc’s state longer-term target 2 percent, remain level stoke concern sustain deflation. fall energy price generally good news consumer favorable development economy go forward. in short term, decline relative price energy show low headline inflation, energy price stabilize, headline inflation increase. policymakers tend look volatile transitory price change ass underlie trend inflation. the core pce index, exclude food bi central bankers’ speech 3 energy, bite high overall measure, increase 1.6 percent 12 month october. other measure inflation, include attempt reduce weight give large outlier give month, tend suggest inflation run 1.5 percent 2 percent. give precision measure things, i find outcome satisfactory. nevertheless, i anticipate fomc conduct policy time manner inflation gradually move toward fed’s 2 percent target. private sector forecaster seem share view philadelphia fed’s recent survey professional forecaster show long-term inflation expectation remain stable 2 percent. monetary policy in discussion economy, i emphasize longer-run path recovery rather month-to-month fluctuations. view context, clear economy come long way since recovery begin june 2009. to me, mean long conduct monetary policy still midst financial crisis depth recession. the financial crisis extraordinary event, much commentary monetary policy focus action central bank response financial crisis. that appropriate understandable. yet, another lesson learn past six year i think important recognize. and difficult monetary policy fine-tune real growth economy. despite fomc’s state desire aggressive action accelerate pace recovery, growth proceed moderate pace since end crisis. monetary policy simply prove panacea many hoped. a i argue number occasions, i believe come expect much monetary policy. we would good serve great humility low expectation potential monetary policy manage real economic growth employment. ten year ago, i suspect commentator would tell six year near-zero federal fund rate target $3.5 trillion long-term asset purchase feed would likely produce economic boom near term would risk inflation long term. well, although experience modest growth, experience boom, jury remain whether inflation materialize consequence. some argue absence boom feed didn’t enough – need offset constraint zero low bind nominal interest rates. of course, alternative hypothesis: monetary policy capable offset mitigate sort real challenge economy facing. distinguish two hypothesis undoubtedly subject intense research come decades. after all, economist still study policy choice effect great depression eight decade ago. but let turn attention monetary policy evolve go forward. i begin remark note monetary policy focus intermediate long term le sensitive reactive short-run transitory movement data. to end, i see economy continue improve real growth average 3 percent 2015 come back long-term trend growth rate 2.4 percent. employment continue expand, inflation move close 2 percent target. while people disagree extent labor market healed, clear labor market much good shape 2009 unemployment reach peak 10 percent. the economy come long way, monetary policy reflect progress. this progress suggest monetary policy begin normalize. keep fund rate target near zero inflation close goal economy near full employment unprecedented risky view. wait long begin 4 bi central bankers’ speech process raise policy rate risk face possibility rate may increase rapidly time come could prove unnecessarily disruptive. and wait could also risk rapid pickup inflation. of course, policymakers face many uncertainties, must prepare adjust policy underlie trend inflation real economy evolve. so, central bank best inform public uncertainty prospective path policy? the appropriate way communicate future policy describe general way reaction function. that describe key economic variable influence set policy give sense policy change response change variables. over past several years, i criticize policy message suggest calendar time relevant metric determine policy action. we must avoid date-based forward guidance, whether us specific calendar date vague reference allude “considerable period” time. a policymakers, know future holds, forward guidance form cannot credible. unfortunately, unlikely policymakers adopt specific reaction function near term. yet, numerous example systematic approach reaction function help u gauge stance policy. some reaction function show robust variety circumstance useful describe past monetary policy behaviors. they can, i believe, provide useful guideline assess stance likely path monetary policy. they also useful communicate policy public. i frequently consider reaction function i think policy. these typically taylor-like rule name stanford university economist john taylor first propose early 1990s. these policy rule typically call target fund rate respond deviation inflation desire target deviation output measure potential – sometimes refer economic “slack” “gap.” sometimes gap translate deviation full employment. these policy rule offer useful guidepost policymakers public assess stance monetary policy, communicate guidepost would enhance transparency help make policy systematic. thus, need mechanically follow particular rule, judgment always required. yet, policymakers public cautious call policy rate deviate important significant way guideposts. make judgment require careful analysis, justification deviate guideline clearly communicate market public. a monetary policy strategy i describe could communicate regular monetary policy report, perhaps publish quarterly. the report would offer opportunity reinforce underlie policy framework committee relate current expect economic conditions. publish monetary policy report assessment likely near-term path policy rates, conjunction economic forecast, would also provide add discipline policymakers stick systematic, rule-like approach. communication path, turn, give public much deep understand analytical approach guide monetary policy, thus make policy transparent predictable. in current environment, assessment variety robust rule suggest fund rate target long constrain zero low bound. these rule indicate liftoff fund rate target zero already occur occur near future. it important point rule recognize take account fact inflation rate remain somewhat fomc’s target 2 percent. nevertheless, call maintain fund rate target near zero. bi central bankers’ speech 5 these rule helpful suggest liftoff occur, offer guidance future path rate changes, give likely direction economy – is, forecast inflation employment “gaps.” even important forecast future change, guidepost highlight entire policy path likely evolve. a such, capable good align public’s expectation policy fomc, make conduct monetary policy accountable efficient. conclusion in conclusion, u.s. economy continue recover moderate pace. although witness strong bounce back depth recession anticipated, recovery somewhat remarkable steadiness progressed. labor market continue heal, stronger-than-expected recovery serve underpin continue economic expansion. consumer balance sheet much improved, individual regain significant fraction wealth lose crisis. that give additional confidence economy operate fairly normally policy reflect normalization. policy also make transparent effective specify completely variable guide policy general way one expect policymakers react variables. to end, i believe fomc move forward describe qualitative way reaction function communicate action decision term reaction function. a detail monetary policy report could useful vehicle enhance communication discuss range robust policy rules. place policy choice context lead

gentlemen, i wish fruitful deliberation worthwhile seminar. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 manuel sánchez: the change tide financial market remark mr manuel sánchez, deputy governor bank mexico, latin america & caribbean government fund roundtable, mexico city, 5 december 2014. * * * it honor speak close government fund roundtable, bring many important international investor together. this seminar provide u insightful idea progress make challenge confront government fund community protect expand capital. i would like organize comment follows, speak first trade-off investor may face monetary policy normalization advance country evolves. second, i would like examine financial scenario point view authority emerge markets. finally, i would like touch briefly mexican economy. a usual, remark entirely necessarily reflect view bank mexico govern board. investor amid u.s. monetary normalization it hardly exaggeration say today’s investment environment unusually complex. fund manager must factor low interest rates, many sovereign corporate bond spread historically minimum level relative u.s. treasuries, possibly stretch stock market valuations. generate continue profit context nature difficult potential upside fixed-income equity market could limited. muddy waters, u.s. federal reserve likely begin reduce stimulus near future. indeed, monetary policy normalization unite state draw nearer, volatility international financial market increased. uncertainty pace normalization still looms. give recent forecast certain statement make member federal open market committee, eventual u.s. rate hike could come early many market participant anticipate. furthermore, exactly market react policy news arrive cannot predicted. in last years, central bank institutional investor diversify portfolio enhance expect return improve risk-return profiles. many invest unconventional currency le liquid lower-rated fixed-income assets, mortgage, corporate, emerge market bonds, among type assets. some sovereign wealth fund pursue aggressive strategies, engage real-sector asset purchases, infrastructure, commodities, real estate equity. the overall result acceptable. but could change global interest-rate scenario develops. in context, difficult investment decision need made. how adjust asset allocation evolve monetary normalization key question. should investor prefer risk-off, conservative stance, hold tight take long view, tolerate great volatility? how become agile way incorporate new information, modify expectations, make decisions? relate question investment time horizon definition optimal portfolio. in general, asset manager attempt use target optimization model base historical data. but history necessarily good predictor future. 2 bi central bankers’ speech a complicate issue period stress, asset correlation greater. indeed, recently, asset appear likely offer benefit diversification perform way similar instruments.1 these challenge present economies. long position fixed-income asset anywhere world bind result loss investor yield advance economy normalize. alternative strategy equity real-sector asset could also suffer finance cost increase worldwide. finally, currency risk also likely rise many countries. emerge economy may face particular difficulty give high weight asset international portfolios. currently, much discussion whether make sense participate country risk-return perspective. in general, fear eventual monetary normalization unite state affect emerge economy asset class, nation prepare scenario others, always.2 the situation emerge economy may become even complicate face possibly slow recovery eurozone low growth china, might drag commodity price even further. this would particularly daunt many commodity-exporting countries. the challenge financial authority emerge market what monetary financial authority emerge market prepare economy rapidly complicate environment, give likely near-term gradual monetary normalization advance nations? they least two complementary policy avenues. one pre-emptively make economy resilient shock strengthen macroeconomic financial fundamentals. possible measure include improve fiscal position, control inflation, perform delicate balance act bolster financial regulatory supervisory framework without limit market development innovation. open, liquid, transparent financial market beneficial aim. structural reform healthy prospect economic growth also important. a second strategy, go hand-in-hand first, monitor manage risk aim preserve financial stability. by financial stability, i mean absence interruption alteration could impair financial system’s intermediation capacity.3 risk watch encompass significant overheat overall economy crucial sectors, substantial misalignment asset price long-term trend property market, excessive risk-taking increase corporate household leverage, extraordinary credit expansion, especially nontraditional vehicles, include shadow banking. timely corrective action detection systemic problem essential. corrective action open debate instrument use tackle specific complications. in addition traditional measure fiscal, monetary, bank 1 see, instance, scholes, m.s.

interference wake big financial crisis invoke rubric macroprudential policies. some country opt active fx intervention direct management capital flows. although measure may result short-term benefits, especially emergency situations, cost term market distortion disincentive sustainable long-term flow may high. emerge economy suffer high inflation, excessive fiscal disequilibria, large current account deficit hit severe volatility end last year begin year, underscore importance task prepare financial turmoil. in short, authority take advantage potential fortify fundamental manage risk order waterproof financial storms. the mexican economy mexico’s economy weather volatility relatively well last two years. for example, currency depreciation low observe many emerge economies. orderly market condition prevailed, bid-ask spread remain tight operate volume high. this strength likely reflect set sound economic policies, include moderate relatively stable public debt ratios, low inflation well-capitalized liquid bank system. furthermore, mexico’s flexible exchange rate regime serve buff turbulence, become mechanism self-discipline authority market participants, result le pass-through inflation. the mexican peso see trade many advanced-nation currencies, trade among emerge economies.4 additionally, local debt market become attractive foreign holders, begin case foreign issuer well. foreign hold local‐currency government bonds, percentage total domestic public debt outstanding, run around 37 percent. this share remain relatively stable wake brusque market reaction talk eventual taper federal reserve asset purchase last year far continue so. a high concentration hold long tranche yield curve provide basis believe many investor see position long-term bet. in words, perhaps stay. however, unchartered waters, cannot rule possibility significant downward adjustment holdings, amid change market sentiment shrink carry-trade opportunity u.s. monetary normalization proceeds, among possible causes. after year half weakness, mexico’s economy start rebound 2014, notwithstanding low growth third quarter reflecting, part, temporary factors. the main impulse come consolidation u.s. economic activity associate high demand mexican exports. domestic spend also gain steam, mainly private investment and, less extent, consumption. consumer confidence somewhat low level appear mend accord evidence november data. the growth outlook one gradual improvement. a close economic relationship unite state positive factor mexico. before u.s. recovery take off, 4 see bank international settlement (2013), triennial central bank survey foreign exchange derivative market activity 2013, april. 4 bi central bankers’ speech disadvantage vis-à-vis many commodity-exporting countries, enjoy benefit high ascend commodity prices. the tables, however, appear turned.5 monetary policy last two year become accommodative context low economic growth. rate cut march 2013 june 2014 total 150 basis points, policy interest rate currently 3 percent. since july 2014, annual inflation surpass upper limit variability interval around permanent 3 percent target, due mainly transitory factors. pressure effect year tax hikes, noncore component national consumer price index, especially livestock prices, make felt. inflation expect low 2015, path convergence permanent target. this development would extremely timely would contribute increase economy’s resilience possibly difficult international financial environment. but convergence imply achieve also maintain target level. upside inflation risk carefully monitored. one may come substantial hike minimum wages. others prolong weak currency due part financial market stress, renew pressure noncore inflation. analysts’ inflation expectation periods, although stable, remain bank mexico’s permanent target. conclude remark approach monetary normalization advance country make life complicate fund managers, especially light low global interest rates, historical minimum bond spreads, record high many stock markets. beset heighten uncertainty, emerge market see add challenges. portfolio weight already heavy assets, stumble eurozone recovery could derail them, low growth china could dent demand commodities, many emerge economy depend exporters. financial authority need work hard underpin macroeconomic fundamental focus strengthen fiscal monetary policies, well regulatory supervisory framework financial system. they also remain fully alert financial risk keep stability fore concerns. after fragility, mexico’s economy appear upturn, pull strong recovery unite states, well momentum domestic demand. the expect approach inflation permanent target welcome development, particularly give need shield economy could rocky time ahead global marketplace. especially light possibility, warn sign financial market would indicate serious future systemic instability must heed timely decisive manner. 5 analyst estimate gdp mexico grow 2.2 percent 2014, 3.5 percent 2015 4.0 percent 2016. see banco de méxico (2014), encuesta sobre la expectativas de los especialistas en economía del sector

governor south african reserve bank, bank america merrill lynch fix income conference, johannesburg, 28 november 2014. * * * introduction good morning lady gentlemen. thank bank america merrill lynch invite address issue monetary policy normalisation uncertain world. this must single-most important issue central bank around world grapple quite now. we sixth year post global financial crisis (gfc). six year seem rather instructive, approximately amount time reinhart rogoff originally suggest would take recover financial crisis.1 there fairly strong consensus view among economist across world u pay due set period economic growth subsequent monetary policy normalisation. in case us, normalisation generally take mean federal reserve (fed) stabilise size balance sheet, raise federal fund rate allow yield u treasury bond move freely. a consequence us’s favourable interest rate growth differential vis-a-vis rest world, u dollar likely continue strengthen capital flow back high yield opportunity states. although normalisation consequent move high policy bond rate probably one expect anticipate consensus trade collective market ever anticipated, two thing remain uncertain – namely time degree adjustment, u elsewhere. in normalise yield environment us, investor expect emerge market (em) currency come pressure – particularly em run large (twin) deficit vulnerable capital flow reversals. south africa unfortunately part latter group countries. if challenge enough, also face stagflation – i.e. low growth high inflation. on one hand u policy normalization suggest need tighten policy, hand raise rate carry risk weaken already weak recovery. consequently, combination uncomfortably high current account fiscal deficit require pragmatic balance policy response contribute sustainable growth path economy. in effort justice topic i ask address today, i try ass get unpleasant juncture, policy it. but let first say word monetary policy major advance economy effect south africa, give important swing factor policy considerations. 1 carmen m. reinhart kenneth s. rogoff examine evolution real per caput gdp around 100 systemic bank crises. they find average, take eight year reach pre-crisis level income; median 6½ years. see american economic review paper proceedings, may 2014; recovery financial crises: evidence 100 episodes* http://www.nber.org/papers/w19823. 2 bi central bankers’ speech diverge policy global monetary policy we know onset global financial crisis saw synchronise response central bank across world. there coordinate effort loosen monetary policy cushion world economy would probably devastate collapse. these accommodative policy indeed succeed help protect protract global recession, also underpin global economic recovery. however, pace extent recovery uneven, result diverge policy across major develop economies. after disappoint start year, u economic performance good expect recent quarters. the weather-related contraction first quarter follow strong rebound growth second quarter, strong momentum maintain third quarter. the economy estimate grow better-than expect 3,9 per cent third quarter, lead indicator pmi point strong growth final quarter year. the job market also improve considerably, unemployment rate decline 5,8 per cent september, low level since june 2008. in line strong expect performance economy, feed conclude quantitative ease programme october raise expectation policy rate hike mid-2015. the pace time normalisation policy rates, repeatedly state fed, largely depend economic inflationary development fed’s interpretation thereof. with lot slack still remain u labour market, one would expect feed cautious impede recovery move soon aggressively. inflationary pressure also expect remain largely contain strong dollar low energy costs. the feed therefore face le difficult trade-off above-target inflation consolidate growth. a such, base case appear one gradual normalisation fed’s policy rate. the uk recovery also appear track, economy grow 2,8 per cent third quarter unemployment rate fall fast expected, reach 6 per cent end third quarter. although bank england maintain asset purchase £375 billion interest rate 0.5 per cent, sentiment slowly shift policymakers start vote policy rate hike. however, decline inflation rate 2 per cent target, falter growth europe, sour trade financial relation russia, delay policy normalisation appear likely. in contrast positive development u uk, growth euro area japan stalled, policymakers country indicate willingness take strong remedial action mitigate protract recession extremely low inflation. the outlook euro area deteriorate year, growth forecast european commission revise downwards november, 1,2 1,7 percent 0,8 1,1 per cent 2014 2015 respectively. more worry shift weakness periphery core, notably france germany. the euro zone also battle extremely low inflation, cpi grow meagre 0,4 per cent october, uncomfortably close deflation far ecb’s target close-to-but-below 2 per cent. the ecb respond challenge cut policy rate september introduce new stimulus plan2 involve purchase investment-grade asset back security issue non-financial private sector well cover bond financial sector. and strong indication policy maker week measure prove insufficient, 2 the ecb expect purchase asset-back security cover bond new programme, together target longer-term refinance operation (announced june 2014), would increase size balance sheet roughly 1 trillion euro 3 trillion euros, level last see early 2012. bi central bankers’ speech 3 govern council consider first quarter 2015 whether embark sovereign bond purchase programme. japan’s economic performance also disappointed, hike value-added tax (vat) partly blame. pre-emptive buy ahead vat increase first quarter year result positive performance, follow contraction second third quarters, push japanese economy back recession. furthermore, although inflation 2 percent target, largely due vat increase inflation expect fall early month 2015. in response recessionary condition still mute inflation, bank japan (boj) respond raise monetary expansion programme october additional ¥10–20 trillion ¥80 trillion (an equivalent us$700 billion) per year. clearly, see divergence policy major advance economies. this suggest central bank need weigh spill-over effect tighten policy u accommodative policy europe japan determine monetary policy trajectories. our sense impact u tighten dominate, would temper somewhat ecb boj stimulus plans. however, clear global financial condition become le hospitable country large external finance requirements. this process already deliver bumpy ride south africa, countries. impact normalisation south africa like emerge markets, south africa benefit massive liquidity injection global financial market follow great recession. inflow capital mean current account deficit comfortably financed, also result significant appreciation rand. this turn help contain inflation, allow room accommodative monetary policy fairly extend period. however, trend start reverse may 2013 anticipation u monetary policy normalisation, follow indication effect fed. this saw widespread depreciation emerge market currencies, intensify actual implementation u federal reserve’s asset purchase taper programme start january 2014. the rand depreciate quite sharply line emerge market currencies, weakness exacerbate widen current account deficit. the rand weakness contribute rise inflationary pressures, inflation breach 6 per cent target april reach 6,6 per cent may june retreat 5,9 per cent september october. the moderation food petrol price contribute low inflation outcome recent months. in particular, abrupt significant decline international oil price us$80 per barrel november positive impact medium term inflation outlook. the bank’s late inflation forecast reflect improve outlook, headline inflation expect average 6,1 per cent 5,3 per cent 2014 2015 respectively, compare previous forecast 6,2 per cent 5,7 percent. however, lot uncertainty around sustainability decline oil prices, exchange rate also continue pose upside risk inflation outlook, still remain vulnerable change perception global monetary policy normalisation, large current account deficit. a indicate previously, wage settlement de-linked inflation underlie productivity trend also pose upside risk inflation outlook. furthermore, bank remain concern elevate level core inflation remain close upper target level. domestic growth outlook also remain weak. the economy contract 1,6 per cent first quarter grow marginal 0,5 per cent second, much weakness due prolong strike mine manufacture sector amid already weak global conditions. growth improve 1,4 per cent third quarter, however low base. the bank revise growth outlook 2014 downwards 1,4 per cent, 4 bi central bankers’ speech announce recent mpc meet last week, compare 1,5 per cent previously. the 2015 2016 projection also downgrade 2,8 per cent 3,1 per cent respectively 2,5 per cent 2,9 per cent. domestic growth prospect remain constrain short-term long-term structural supply factor strike activity, rise input cost electricity shortages, well slow consumer demand. fall commodity price weak economic condition country’s major trade partner also add subdue outlook. the combination uncomfortably high current account fiscal deficit (in face global monetary policy normalisation), high inflationary pressures, weak domestic growth pose challenge monetary fiscal policy. these require balance policy response effort ensure sustainable growth path economy. so south africa doing? let quote paragraph last week’s economist magazine: “it great lasted. in golden period 2003 2010 …. economy grow annual average rate close 5%, wage rise unemployment fell, … people lift poverty middle class swelled…. but growth spurt over. what worry would ‘new normal’ expansion 3% year turn far worse. the …economy average grow around 1.3% year.”3 no, case economist refer south africa – quote actually latin american region. but much also story. indeed, ongoing emerge market slowdown serf remind u protract nature previous crisis episodes, include 1997–1998 asian crisis 2008–09 world financial crisis. however, limit similarity among ems, may lead differentiation assess countries. for example, south africa’s export performance relative number peer remain poor – irrespective whether commodity exporter (australia), also experience significant exchange rate depreciation (india, turkey), (brazil chile). the fact south africa grow export le peers, imply domestic economy suffer something weak global demand decline commodity prices. south africa’s weak performance also visible country’s decline share world exports, decline around 0.7% world merchandise export 0.55% last 10 years. perplexingly, sa’s portion global export remain roughly stable since 2011, level last attain height great recession, despite pronounce currency depreciation entire period. with global growth – particularly eu, large trade partner – severe pressure, increasingly rely domestic non-tradeables sector prop domestic growth would difficult ramp exports. unfortunately growth equal. the quality growth matter least much quantity growth, reason believe sa’s non-tradeable growth post-crisis year inferior quality. it drive consumption, investment, finance debt, mean reduce future consumption investment 3 the economist, “the great deceleration: the region’s economy slow far abruptly anyone expected” 22 november 2014. see http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21633940-regions-economies-have-slowed-far-more-abruptly-anyone-expected-great-deceleration. bi central bankers’ speech 5 capacity. furthermore, growth base large quantity import inputs, result unsustainable current account deficit. credit growth private sector appear sustainable consistent macroeconomic fundamentals. since first quarter 2011, credit extend household increase 22.3 per cent (or 4.9 percent deflate headline cpi), slightly le 6% increase gdp period. household credit weaken quite significantly recent months, growth slow annual rate 3,7 percent september compare 7,5 percent month last year. however, moderate overall increase credit could mask several unwelcome developments. for instance, “good credit” extend mortgage increase much le categories, notably instalment sale credit (mostly use vehicle financing) unsecured credit. with credit extend household shift relatively low interest (and low margin) mortgage profitable (higher margin) categories, surprise real value add financial sector also increase cumulative 9.5 percent since 2011q1 – par real growth record retail sector. in fact retail finance sector together contribute almost 60 percent gdp growth since 2011q1 – significantly large 37 percent share gdp. the grow size non-tradeables sector may also explain weaken economy-wide response weak real exchange rate. potential growth slow another reason south africa far experience relatively weak recovery 2008–09 recession, relate falter potential growth. accord oecd, “estimating potential growth rate always imprecise exercise, country (such sa) high rate inactivity responsiveness wage price inflation change unemployment low. in addition, recent year task complicate uncertainty extent electricity supply limitation constrain potential output growth south africa”.4 replicate work borio, disyatat, juselius (2013, 2014) bank international settlement (bis), incorporate financial cycle characteristic estimation, estimate suggest south africa’s potential growth rate decline 4 per cent 2007 around 2½ per cent 2013, compare early estimate suggest current potential growth rate around 3 3½ percent5. this development unique south africa several study show potential growth may over-estimated many emerge market economies. monetary policy response the operate environment south africa’s monetary policy become increasingly complex, growth inflation dynamic influence range global domestic factors, call delicate trade-off term policy settings. recent development suggest period relatively low volatility come end. market participant policy maker grapple possibility risk lift-off rate u may occur sooner anticipate, japan eurozone ease seem way, risk assign geo-political risks, 4 oecd (2013), oecd economic surveys: south africa 2013, oecd publishing. see

experience show u sensitive domestic market international backdrop. against background south africa’s elevate current account deficit, expect correct slowly, risk abrupt swing capital flow cannot under-estimated. this environment call continue vigilance policy makers, preparedness respond fast-changing economic financial market environment, readiness act change one’s monetary policy stance

central bankers’ speech 1 maja kadievska-vojnovik: rule regulation update speech m maja kadievska-vojnovik, vice-governor national bank republic macedonia, erste group bank workshop “rules regulation update”, skopje, 1 december 2014. * * * dear governor bogov, dear guest speaker erste group bank, dear representative financial regulatory agencies, dear colleagues, please, let thank governor bogov support idea organize event summarize financial regulatory reform six year global financial crisis also i would like give appreciation guest lecturer erste group bank quick response help u good understand it. this workshop distinctive, opinion, point numerous regulatory change aim support vision financial system would globally integrate adequately regulate medium-to-long-term. why today? probably, already ask question. why? the subject presentation today’s workshop great importance, mind that, we, central bank unique foreign reserve management function, institutional investor (banks, pension funds, insurance companies) supervise regulator participate workshop, us, investor european global financial markets. in regard, understand regulation change financial market landscape great significance market participant. the second question raise today is: what reason undertake step financial sector reform? the recent financial crisis serve reminder impair financial system significant impact function overall economy. moreover, 2007–08 financial crisis was, great extent, result failure public authority unite state europe adequately monitor address systemic risk. by comparison, asia part world memory systemic financial crisis still fresh, adopt prudent policy practices, le impact subprime-triggered financial shockwaves. in order make global finance stable, 2009 g20 summit london pittsburg list commitment financial regulatory reform, push financial regulation forefront global economic cooperation agenda level political principles, then, mainly focus trade macroeconomic policy. the item regulation divide two subgroups. on one hand, g20 decide tighten strengthen regulatory framework apply entity activity already regulate crisis. example include: • a demand framework capital, leverage, liquidity banks, prepare basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) know basel iii accord since initial exposition 2010; 2 bi central bankers’ speech • special regulatory treatment systemically important financial institution (sifis), additional capital (or basel jargon, “loss absorbency”) requirements; • additional disclosure obligation banks. on hand, entity activity 2008 mostly outside scope regulator make subject comprehensive regulatory framework: • over-the-counter (otc) derivatives, • executive compensation, • credit rat agencies, • hedge funds, “shadow banking” (i.e. entity activity regulate banks, present bank-like systemic risk profiles) and, recently, • financial benchmark (following detect fraud set libor, london interbank offer rate, similar reference rates). all initiative envisage g20 translate regulatory change u europe. in us, dodd–frank wall street reform consumer protection act (or know dodd-frank act) implement change that, among things, affect oversight supervision financial institutions. the dodd-frank act create financial stability oversight council oversee financial institutions. additionally, provide new resolution procedure large financial companies, creation new agency responsible implement enforce compliance consumer financial laws, introduce rigorous regulatory capital requirements, affect significant change regulation otc derivatives, include reform regulation credit rat agencies, implement change corporate governance executive compensation practices, incorporate volcker rule, require registration adviser certain private funds, affect significant change securitization market. in eu, market financial instrument directive mifid important step big overhaul financial market regulation eu decade. however, new regulatory framework consist directive (mifid 2) regulation market financial instrument (mifir). it integral part eu’s strategy address effect financial crisis, time aim bring great transparency market strengthen investor protection. these change key restore trust eu financial markets. in reaction global financial crisis, eu also introduce european market infrastructure regulation (emir) initiate report obligation otc derivatives, clear obligation eligible otc derivatives, measure reduce counterparty credit risk operational risk bilaterally clear otc derivatives, common rule central counterparties (ccps) trade repository (trs), rule establishment interoperability ccps. mifid 2 emir cause many change financial market infrastructure, change also happen result regulation central

much impressive array speakers. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 martin flodén: measure mitigate risk high increase household debt speech mr martin flodén, deputy governor sverige riksbank, bnp paribas, stockholm, 20 november 2014. * * * the high level household debt subject much discussion connection monetary policy decision recent years. the discussion partly relate extent debt entail risk partly measure would effective counteract risks. today, i would like briefly present view issues, i link think discussion last week’s meet financial stability council. in order understand risks, necessary broaden perspective somewhat examine entire house mortgage market sweden. such examination reveal swedish market special several respects, comparison previous situation sweden situation countries. the household debt ratio, debt relation disposable incomes, almost double last 20 years. the tax system encourage indebtedness offer tax deduction interest payments, household amortise slow rate. at time, house prices, especially tenant-owned apartments, increase rapidly. the fact house construction low despite rise price indicate supply side house market work well. the strict regulation rental market also means, instance, household may feel force buy home even stage life ownership mortgage may entail take major risk. although mortgage long-term undertake borrower lender, household mainly choose variable-rate mortgages; around one percent choose fix rate maturity long five years. in addition, bank largely fund lend use mortgage bond maturity significantly short maturity loans.1 i see specific aspect i list risk factors, even though argument easily find aspect explain particular one actually constitute risk. for example, one point high level household debt offset high level household save household asset substantially large debts, low level construction several decade limit scope fall house prices.2 1 in many countries, mortgage amortise period 20 40 years. this also case sweden decade ago, subsequently become increasingly common interest-only loans. over past years, large proportion new mortgage borrower choose amortise loans, still slow rate. the proposal strict amortisation regulation present finansinspektionen (the swedish financial supervisory authority) last week correspond amortisation rate 78 year first decade mortgage. swedish house investment average approximately 3 per cent gdp last ten year compare almost 6 per cent euro area (european commission 2014a). accord european commission (2014b) sweden strictly regulate rental market eu moreover, low property tax generous interest-rate deductibility, strong tax incentive owner-occupied housing. in recent years, 70 per cent new mortgage borrower choose variable interest rate per cent fix interest rate five years. in many countries, usual fix interest rate 10 30 years. much describe detail riksbank (2014a). 2 an important explanation high level save collective pension saving, see nilsson et al. (2014). 2 bi central bankers’ speech large debt variable interest rate make household vulnerable however, despite mitigate arguments, i think clear risk associate swedish house mortgage markets. that household bloat balance sheets, large debt large assets, make vulnerable shocks. this partly debt asset unevenly distribute households, unequally liquid different risk profiles, thus affect shock way. vulnerability necessarily question household become insolvent, rather react shock way lead fall consumption, thus fall growth employment.3 the high debt combination mainly variable mortgage rate imply course household sensitive change interest rates.4 to extent see advantage mean monetary policy great direct impact economy. however, may also problematic several reasons. the riksbank’s repo rate preferably blunt instrument affect entire economy, households, company financial markets. it desirable monetary policy disproportionally large impact limit part economy, case indebted households. one expect monetary policy always design well balance particular part economy. this exemplify monetary policy recent year repo rate set low justify development mortgage market. in future, may well end opposite situation repo rate set high justify particular part economy. long fixed-rate period desirable it difficult determine large proportion variable interest rate desirable economy, i suspect go far direction sweden. and i mean point view systemic risk. for individual household may good reason choose variable interest rate, economy whole would probably good could limit proportion variable rates. this achieve different ways. in countries, regulation use either limit large proportion mortgage may variable interest rate much variable interest rate may increase maturity mortgage. in countries, long fixed-rate period become norm without need regulations. the fact happen sweden indicate financial market work well enough reason. this may, example, due lack market mortgage bond really long maturities, regulation concern mortgage long fixed-rate period pay prematurely. limit build-up debt despite need stimulate economy i would also like say something interplay current monetary policy measure mitigate risk factor i mentioned. be really justify introduce measure may dampen household consumption activity house market riksbank time try stimulate economy order increase 3 several study base household data financial crisis recent year show highly-indebted household reduce consumption household low debt (see example dynan 2012, mian et al. 2013, andersen et al. 2014). study compare development different country also indicate high grow indebtedness household sector entail high risk real economy, even household also substantial asset (see example imf 2012, jorda et al. 2013, flodén 2014). 4 see riksbank (2014b). bi central bankers’ speech 3 inflation? this question particularly relevant give repo rate zero cannot cut much more. i think question, least principle, nevertheless answer affirmative. it must possible meet financial risk target measure even make difficult monetary policy attain inflation target. at time, course desirable measure target household indebtedness house market lead economic downturn unnecessarily obstruct monetary policy. the primary aim policy area must ensure build-up household debt slow down, household gradually become resilient shock various kind house mortgage market become effective. this thus question long-term adjustment process must take place suitably-large steps. the amortisation proposal – step right direction i see last week’s amortisation proposal one suitably-large step right direction. a new mortgage covered, increase amortisation phase long period time. in combination many new mortgage borrower already amortising, proposal entail moderate increase amortisation rates, mean macroeconomic consequence probably small first years. accord riksbank’s estimate, amortisation proposal reduce household debt ratio 0.6 percentage point five year compare base scenario. this mean proposal increase amortisation payment le 0.1 per cent gdp per year period.5 the amortisation proposal thus appear well balance moment, work long-term adjustment process must continue. there many factor take account consider measures. one factor new measure conform current state economy interplay monetary policy. the suitably-large step preferably take right order. from point view i note two propose measures, long fixed-rate period reduce tax deduction interest payments, opposite effect repo rate affect household finances. long fixed-rate period would weaken impact repo rate reduce deduction would strengthen impact. if one worry household myopic plan find difficult manage return normal interest-rate levels, probably appropriate try enforce long fixed-rate period interest rate still low. if, hand, one worry household easy access inexpensive credit near term wish see great gap household corporate interest rates, probably appropriate reduce tax deductions. how take suitably-large step right order thus self-evident, assessment appropriate strive long fixed-rate period phasing-out right make tax deduction large interest payments. however, welcome monetary-policy perspective would measure lead effective house market, particular increase house construction. such measure stimulate economy short term time structurally justified. 5 see riksbank (2014c). this calculation build household disposable income approximately 50 per cent gdp. the additional amortisation payment percentage gdp (50% × 0.6%)/5 = 0.06%. the effect household consumption may small greater, depend part household adjust behaviour affect house prices. 4 bi central bankers’ speech reference andersen, asger lau, charlotte duus thai

address professor njuguna ndung’u, governor central bank kenya, 2nd annual research seminar kenya school monetary study research centre, kenya school monetary studies, nairobi, 18 november 2014. * * * invite guests; chairman central bank kenya board directors; member monetary policy committee; researchers; distinguish guests; lady gentlemen: good morning. it give great pleasure morning official open research seminar “public debt, fiscal policy forward look monetary policy ” organize research centre ksms. a aware second time gather discus research find researchers. a look paper today’s program show result collaborative effort researcher bank esteem institutions. collaborative comprehensive research key good policy advice work. lady gentlemen, title research seminar touch important current topic. look globally, number country go time hardship. public debt real economy problem sustainable. when public debt unsustainable, create debt overhang problem effect private sector belief government raise tax future pay public debt. the effect private investment since private sector acquire wait option finally, effect slow growth. thus, important challenge debt sustainability restore growth trajectory dislodge market wait option. to achieve objective many difficult far-reaching decision taken. against backdrop, forum one essential share ideas. after all, scientific research central pillar good decision-making. therefore, i would like thank kenya school monetary study organise event. why public debt, fiscal policy forward look monetary policy? my start point draw attention principal objective macroeconomic policy, achieve sustainable economic growth context macro stability. to achieve this, monetary fiscal policy play role success largely dependent anchor public expectations. lady gentlemen, interest study fiscal policy economy grow debt; monetary policy fiscal dominance. they come interest conclusions, important policy coordination. why policy coordination important? • monetary policy short-run decision direction prices, affect nominal variables; fiscal policy affect real variables. • it make easy policy maker achieve state policy objective coherent efficient manner. 2 bi central bankers’ speech • ensure commitment mutually agree upon objectives, thus help eliminate problem time inconsistency design policy. • it enhance credibility, anchor public expectations, ensure sustainability fiscal monetary policies, thus promote macroeconomic stability. lady gentlemen, ensure success policy coordination need either following: • a continuous interaction fiscal monetary authority decide jointly aspect relate policy design implementation, or; • a set rule procedure minimize need frequent interaction. but know these, eu zone successful? a note sargent wallace famous article “some unpleasant monetarist arithmetic”, “tighter money today lead high inflation eventually start today”. the paradox tight monetary policy heavy debt expansion lead economic stagnation, eddie buffie demonstrate number country region. moreover, lady gentlemen, lack credibility overall policy framework cause long-term inconsistency mix signal diminish effectiveness monetary policy. our experience fight inflation kenya suggest inflation may occasion demand side well supply side factors. monetary policy us interest rate instrument fight inflation anchor inflationary expectations. fiscal policy hand raise debt domestically use mix debt instrument drive domestic interest rate structure. how policy maker coordinate consolidate effort affect expectation concern future policy outcome also affect outcome economic activity. lady gentlemen, several paper link fiscal policy, monetary policy inflation line presentation today. a listen presentation discussions, important filter conclusion first reach frontier subject matter provide renew think policy arena. the recommendation paper fit policy dialogue policy make process support growth employment envisage vision 2030 kenya. a i conclude, i would like thank participant present. i hope issue address today’s contribution provide basis reward discussion. once – welcome! it pleasure declare workshop officially open. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jens weidmann: strengthen force growth – reform gear towards boost prosperity speech dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank, economic summit süddeutsche zeitung, berlin, 28 november 2014. * * * 1. introduction dear mr kister, lady gentlemen, thank invite event. it give great pleasure today. i wonder hear will rogers. the man i refer well-known figure usa back twenty thirties. begin career lassoo artist, go become one first big name hollywood. he also renowned documentary maker newspaper columnist. in short: he true all-rounder. what more, humourist whose aphorism still popular quotation today many remain topical. for example, comment mankind’s three great invention first fire, second wheel third central banks. he make assertion 1920, word seven year federal reserve established. however, message surprisingly relevant today’s world many people appear believe central bank hold key resolve economic woes. nowadays, central bank view font wisdom fight financial sovereign debt crisis economic deficit general. indeed, observer deem capable actor grace stage. people’s expectation monetary policy, especially european monetary policy, correspondingly high. but let make one thing clear: central bank magicians. and wand make wish come true. in particular, fanciful believe monetary policy tool sustainably lift growth potential economy permanently create new jobs. these goal achieve structural reform growth employment generate innovative enterprise offer competitive product combine well-trained highly motivate workforce. in opinion, japan good illustration fact, although undoubtedly still early make final assessment country’s economic policy strategy, know abenomics. this approach, characterise expansionary monetary policy couple short-term stimulative fiscal policy growth-inducing structural reforms, design inter alia shift japanese economy onto high growth path last basis. however, preliminary effect japan’s expansionary monetary policy stimulative fiscal policy danger dissipate economic upturn partly attributable clear anticipatory effect prior vat hike. what important, however, announce structural reforms, notably measure liberalise service market expand labour force participation, actually implement yet. monetary policy cannot solve structural problems. such problem remedied political means, growth-friendly reforms. and i would like talk today actually raise growth potential economy. please note observation i make exhaustive. for example, i broach subject energy policy particularly relevant german enterprise term affect competitiveness. nor i comment consequence demographic change, i already address speech yesterday. 2 bi central bankers’ speech return will rogers’ aphorism, today i intend much focus central bank per se force fire wheel. for invention galvanise productivity. without fire would energy without wheel would mobility. it american nobel prize-winning economist, robert solow first show inventions, technological progress would probably say today, economic growth connected, end use model. the acclaim solow growth model may 50 year old lose none effectiveness give crucial insight growth, investment technological progress interact. 2. investment growth one key insight provide solow model early stage economy’s development, growth drive accumulation capital, whereas progress stage development, chief determinant growth rate technological progress. but another decisive factor play: long run, make little sense invest mature economy unless technologically advance abundant supply labour disposal. for two factor key induce high income expectation part enterprises. which bring u crux debate growth-friendly economic policy germany euro area. this debate often prompt call increase investment best way foster growth, argument investment would raise productive capital stock, thus stoke long-term growth potential. at time, would also push demand machinery equipment stimulate economy, home abroad. thank globalise economy, great investment germany, example, would also benefit rest euro area. without doubt, import content private investment least high rather modest content constitute government expenditure, another reason i call government stimulus package germany aim boost economy euro area. that said, take close look solow model see that, often not, quite reverse true. in market economy, demand investment cannot simply conjure decree view boost growth potential. conversely, also true increase growth therefore high income expectation enhance enterprises’ willingness invest. hence, expectation pertain growth income pivotal importance. in case germany, however, demographic change tend exert dampen influence, shrink labour force paramount factor hind economic growth. for example, enterprise find increasingly difficult recruit specialist require. this prompt many german enterprise invest abroad, reflect germany’s high current account surpluses. regard low level investment germany, many commentator point public investment, scale directly influence state. but here, too, nexus identify solow model applies. rate investment lie growth potential develop economy unlikely increase prosperity, fact apply public investment also private investment. since public net investment negative time now, would nevertheless actually seem room improvement area well. no le important question much spend public investment question bi central bankers’ speech 3 money spent. because, every private investor aware, every investment ultimately worth money, hold true public sector. in case, public investment represent relatively small share total investment. and i already indicated: investment cannot steer arbitrarily instead reflect demographic trend productivity gains. this bring all-important question: economy’s productivity maximised? here, i would like cite another economist deliver major input regard growth theory: i refer joseph schumpeter, describe growth process one “creative destruction” entrepreneur develop new product cheap method production enable steal market competitors. a result, le productive business disappear market. overall, serf boost economic output. view perspective, competitive force unleash innovative enterprise engine growth – ample evidence support assessment. for example, rule, prosperity-boosting effect european union arise high trade volumes, one might perhaps assume. rather, studies1 show upturn growth mainly due fact expand single market intensify competition. and increase competition turn lead innovative therefore productive enterprises. 3. common market service this insight lead u directly several possible way increase growth potential germany europe. the single market prove extremely successful simplify trade goods. a result, competition intense. enterprises’ market power enable charge large mark-ups top costs; level similar usa, example. create transatlantic market – ttip keyword – could thus provide even stimulus regard. the usa eu’s large export market third important import partner trade goods. a far trade service concerned, two region share even close connections. and precisely area service eu still catch term intensify competition. mark-ups cost service average high usa. one could say european commission’s service directive live expectations. create single market service thus promise considerable economic benefits. the original intention behind service directive anchor law “home country principle”, already apply trade good within eu. this principle state service provider shall long hind regulation import country comply national regulation home country. however, principle make final version directive. yet implement home country principle services, too, would great potential – all, service account two-thirds value add europe. another way leverage growth potential single market fully enter digital age. fragmentation still part parcel digital economy, particular legal aspect protect privacy personal data, content copyright, liability 1 h badinger (2005), “growth effect economic integration: evidence eu member states”, review world economics 141, pp 50–78. 4 bi central bankers’ speech online intermediaries, electronic payment electronic contracts. the eu yet consist one digital single market 28 individual digital markets. studies2 show create harmonise well regulate digital single market potential implement single market original form, say upturn growth much 4%. in germany alone, many 420,000 new job could create 2015 2020. 4. barrier market entry however, service sector barrier european level. in germany, also exist business start-ups form red tape – thing like mandatory administrative formalities, approval period fee incurred. in world bank’s do business table, germany rank 114th “ease start business” category. in words, plenty room improvement. even though enterprise’s direct cost may appear manageable first glance, economic cost difficulty enter market and, result, weak competition underestimated. studies3 indicate relatively small difference cost enter market usa eu could still account 10% 20% eu’s productivity shortfall. the cost remove red tape comparatively low could strengthen growth. 5. venture capital market new, innovative enterprise key economy’s productivity highly competitive position. it thus important enterprise sufficient funding. a comparison usa europe show still way go here. new, innovative enterprise often small bank frequently struggle ass them, regularly raise capital form equity. venture capital essential role play connection. the business model venture capital fund base gain expertise particular business area invest several start-ups area. although high percentage start-ups fail, profit high succeed. for business model work, though, market large enough enable venture capitalist adequately diversify investment. furthermore, measure must place ensure lenders’ right sufficiently protected. this way ensure reap benefit successful investment. there room improvement venture capital market europe accounts. on one hand, highly fragment reduce opportunity diversification. on hand, vary level protection lenders’ rights. the unite kingdom, far large venture capital market eu, also high level protection. by contrast, germany offer minority investor medium level protection. however, decision regard protection different group investor always weigh carefully. overall, venture capital market usa five time big eu. this could also innovative enterprise usa, measure term number patent granted, much easy access capital. 2 copenhagen economics (2010), the economic impact european digital single market, final report. 3 markus poschke, “the regulation entry aggregate productivity”, economic journal, royal economic society, vol 120(549), pp 1175–1200, december 2010. bi central bankers’ speech 5 and regard willingness raise capital, fact business tax law germany provide different tax treatment debt equity – highlight german council economic experts’ late report – helpful either. 6. capital market union however, term growth great integration european capital market promising. it also help make monetary union whole resilient. another comparison usa show equity hold disperse much widely throughout entire country. if negative shock hit industry specific region, loss spread widely beyond region. the apply positive developments, reflect high dividends. equity investor participate directly economic risk gain losses. creditors, hand, expose loss – except case insolvency. in usa, integrate market capital cushion around 40% total cyclical fluctuation u federal states. if regional economic downturn occur, enterprises’ loss earn one state would distribute shareholder states, would also benefit increase profit boom. only 25% cyclical fluctuation smooth via credit markets, loss share event insolvency. fiscal mechanism cushion 20% economic shocks.4 study german federal state come similar conclusions. deep integration european capital market could thus make key contribution improve absorption macroeconomic shock impact heterogeneous economic development euro area. the capital market exercise buff function, le fiscal policy responsible stabilise economy, knock-on impact government debt. after all, experience show upturn often possible repay debt incur downturn stabilise economy. in turn, le pressure monetary policymakers support expansionary fiscal policy ease monetary policy. monetary policy thus become stable. 7. close remark lady gentlemen, monetary policy able short-term impact demand term safeguard monetary stability thus support economy, cannot solve central challenge face euro area, namely weak growth prospects. there sustain rise growth wealth monetary union cut exist red tape promote competition. to conclude, i would like quote will rogers. “there good place world find shortcoming conference.” if i understand correctly, i believe next minutes, mr kister. i look forward discussion! 4 m hoffmann b sorensen, don’t expect much ez fiscal union – complete unfinished integration european capital markets! voxeu, 9 november 2012. bi central bankers’ speech 1 lars rohde: the international domestic factor impact denmark’s economy speech mr lars rohde, governor national bank denmark, annual meet danish banker association, copenhagen, 1 december 2014. * * * thank invite speak today. i would like start describe international developments. after that, i comment danish economy capitalisation firm agricultural sector. and finally, i talk issue danish membership bank union. the world economy continue grow modest pace, euro area still wait upswing. this situation attributable to, inter alia, conflict ukraine middle east, reduce consumer business confidence, possibly could expected. the slowdown since summer lead downward adjustment growth forecast germany countries. on hand, usa and, extent, uk see robust growth economic activity. euro area consumer price curb fall energy prices. at fundamental level, wage growth low. inflation currently well european central bank’s target 2 per cent. combine weak growth, early september lead ecb announce two new purchase programme security issue private sector. however, small share production limit shortage credit. the override issue lack demand and, somewhat less extent, lack access labour. so high expectation credit lead surge investment employment. at end october, federal reserve decide discontinue purchase government mortgage-backed bonds. it important avoid turmoil connection. and indeed, decision expect market reflect continue improvement u economy. it also underline divergence u euro area economies. in major economies, monetary policy support growth reduce market interest rate risk premia low levels. on flip side, prolong period low interest rate low volatility could result underestimation risk excessive risk exposure among credit institution customers. a sudden reversal international hunt yield could cause price plummet, trend may intensify sale spiral queue exit, may knock-on effect across asset classes. a shortage liquidity market could accelerate process. there currently indication major systemic risk build danish financial system. all same, reason guard. credit institution ensure able withstand direct loss due price adjustment financial asset derive effect potential market turmoil trigger adjustment – e.g. market access become difficult. turn real economy, danish economy grow since end 2012 adjust fall output north sea oil gas years. growth drive mainly domestic demand. development labour market positive last year. employment rise sharply, unemployment fallen. accord danmark nationalbank’s estimate, current unemployment gap around 10,000, recovery continues, 2 bi central bankers’ speech soon close. the potential increase labour force greater, also difficult. inflation also low denmark due factor fall oil prices. in come months, price inflation remain low, look ahead expect inflation pick effect fall energy price fade away. interest rate denmark continue fall, historical lows, low level interest rate set continue time yet. in spite this, investment activity low corporate save high. this case denmark advance economy no-one really say circle restrain private consumption low investment appetite broken. it purely bad corporate save high. other thing equal, firm robust economic shock high equity relative total assets. that reduce risk firm fail. it also reduce probability firm’s banker suffer loss lend firm. hence, high solvency ratio positive impact financial stability. a high solvency ratio also give individual firm great flexibility choose alternative source fund great certainty obtain desire funding. an analysis danmark nationalbank show since financial crisis erupted, loan capital danish bank system large extent flow soundest, profitable productive firms. this healthy bank system induce firm small buff consider whether might good idea increase capitalisation. this apply limit liability companies, also sole proprietor – include farms, example. in pre-crisis years, danish agricultural sector experience land price bubble inflate price per hectare unrealistic levels. the high land price large extent use pledge land collateral raise debt. since 2008, average price per hectare almost halved. this leave many farmer high debt low equity base. this make vulnerable fluctuation price agricultural produce, show considerable volatility time. the shaky foundation danish agriculture partly mask favourable condition sector period 2010–13, good price rise term trade. at time, farm could finance historically low rate interest. nevertheless, return equity unsatisfactory many farms. this point fundamental structural problem within agricultural sector. the price grain, pig milk fall since spring, partly account russia’s boycott western agricultural produce. however, price fall sharply see many previous occasions, current price level relatively normal long-term perspective. production sale highly volatile good agricultural produce require well-consolidated production unit resilient repeat price fluctuations. the current situation highlight weak capital base many farms. capitalisation must strengthened. now i turn attention bank union. on tuesday, 4 november 2014, eu’s single supervisory mechanism enter force. responsibility major supervisory task participate member state transfer ecb. this mark important step implementation bank union. see outside – denmark – difficult spot change. but must mistaken. 4 november 2014 red-letter day europe. the member state participate bank union set future course supervision crisis management banks. bi central bankers’ speech 3 they choose one strong authority supervise bank future. and choose transfer responsibility crisis management single resolution board january 2016. this resolution board guarantee credible consistent application bail- rule relation distress banks. the claim unsecured creditor convert equity write down. tax payer long help clear mess leave irresponsible banks. in debate bank union argue – participate – danish bank risk pay problem experience bank member states. in view, point departure wrong. after all, come distress banks, key element bank union bail-in, bail-out. the bank union create basis gradual strengthen single market financial good come years. common rule uniform implementation lead le bureaucracy good thing competitive banks, good opportunity compete across national borders. this expect lead increase price product competition, benefit household firm participate member states. the danish banker association publish report deliberation danish participation bank union. i agree large part analysis. for example, i agree come competition financial stability aspects. a i said, bank union expect create potential competition. and strengthen financial stability single authority expect good preventing, predict manage financial crises. those sound observations. therefore i little surprise see overall conclusion danish banker association denmark wait see decide whether join bank union. the danish banker association list number outstanding issue clarify make minds. for example, report mention uncertainty bank union handle distress banks. and mention uncertainty market ass union. a i see it, wait-and-see conclusion leaf one central question unanswered: what, exactly, wait for? both handle distress bank market players’ assessment bank union dynamic processes. it may sensible wait result asset quality review stress test conclude ecb october. but wait now? what take enough information make decision? wait see – without clearly indicate wait – de facto “no”. a “wait see” decision precisely – decision. if participating, de facto outside cooperation participate member state begun. i find unwise. in fairness, i say would disaster wait choose opt out. there life outside bank union. but non-participation implication bring challenge take account come years, path choose. the implication may seem small today, long run could considerable. go forward, denmark cannot expect compare member bank union international player try ass risk danish bank sector. instead, relevant benchmark sweden switzerland. a denmark, asset large bank country amount approximately 1.5 time gdp. in countries, join bank union, authority already impose strict 4 bi central bankers’ speech requirement large bank do. people invariably begin ask whether danish requirement sufficiently high. and danmark nationalbank. in addition, become relatively costly international investor invest danish credit institutions. inside bank union, investor study one single rulebook ecb’s implementation rulebook assess many bank within union invest in. we small country outside bank union. investor understand unique national setup – deviate bank union – assess danish bank might want invest in. that require lot term communication bank authorities. but matter good communication is, international investor need compensate extra resource spend understand particularities. when discus bank union, one issue always crop denmark – without reasons. that danish mortgage credit system. and, indeed, mortgage credit system one uncertainty make danish banker association say “wait see”. again, i quite follow argument. in recent years, denmark apply considerable political muscle ensure mortgage credit system place new single european regulation. we negotiate 27 member states, separate national interest safeguard. and negotiation go well. this mean current regulation end road. rather, game changer introduced. decision take member bank union. they will, matter course, negotiate reach conclusion among – stand together one large group cooperate closely come banking. the outsiders, hand, small, diverse group. in situation may ask best protect danish mortgage credit system. by participate future negotiation within group cooperate member states? or opt together member state particular interest support mortgage credit model? a know, danish banker association danmark nationalbank decide whether denmark participate bank union. it political issue. the politician determine time right make decision – make decision. but u play role sector obligation frank honest view opinions. danmark nationalbank firmly belief credit institution denmark dane general interest participate bank union. together danish mortgage credit sector knock front door union. the bank union aim provide security citizens. no element union make expensive homeowner bank customer. on contrary – increase competition could make le expensive. the bank union huge impact denmark – whether choose participate. therefore need broad debate pro con become crystal clear. in connection i already reveal danmark nationalbank’s assessment elaborate upcoming monetary review. bi central bankers’ speech 5 finally, i would like take opportunity thank good cooperation relation establishment straksclearing express clear system. it large project us. but upgrade danish payment infrastructure possible transfer money instantly account different banks. today i think see advantage implement project bring denmark right date field payments. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 amando m tetangco, jr:

stournaras, governor bank greece, 2014 multinational finance society winter conference “global financial economic crisis: challenge prospects”, co-organized centre plan economic research multinational finance society, athens, 14 december 2014. * * * lady gentlemen, it pleasure address distinguish audience, topic unfortunately yet history. government central bank certainly manage safeguard financial stability turbulent times. however, certain repercussion crisis yet fully deal vulnerability may reappear. in sense, look back critical view may help u understand factor put risk global economic recovery. the global financial economic crisis trigger distortion u.s. sub-prime mortgage market, highlight serious weakness financial regulatory framework globalize broadly interrelate national markets. a result, validity theory self-correcting market mechanism strongly contested. global financial crisis • the root global financial crisis trace back macroeconomic microeconomic factors. on macro level, global imbalance decade crisis result ample liquidity world financial market low interest rates, facilitate high level leverage, excessive dependence unsustainable short-term finance weak risk management. • at time, micro level, financial innovation investors’ “search yield” lead creation complex financial instrument obscure credit risk distribution. the originate-to-distribute model, accord loan trade investors, become widespread practice. this led, effect, loosen lend criterion facilitate creation aforementioned complex credit instruments. • over time, excessive credit risk liquidity accumulate so-called “investment vehicles.” the placement credit institution vehicle record balance sheets, result, associate risk slip crack internal control mechanisms. moreover, opacity uncertain dispersion risk instrument exacerbate rapid growth derivative market, particular derivative trade outside regulate market (“over counter”). • a reveal retrospect, many cases, bank investor fail realistically ass nature extent risks. the high degree correlation credit risk, market risk refinance risk also fail properly assessed. a result, risk associate certain credit instrument properly reflect price. when make evident u market sub-prime mortgage 2007, lead market-wide reassessment financial risk collapse market value credit instruments. this, turn, affect negatively net worth profitability bank hold asset portfolios. the believe “too big fail” institution rapidly become illiquid insolvent. 2 bi central bankers’ speech • in order rebalance portfolios, affect bank perform widespread liquidation asset attempt raise capital attempt strengthen capital base. through subsequent fall asset price via banks’ balance sheet cross-exposures, crisis quickly spread financial system globally. the euro-area similarly affected. • uncertainty banks’ exposure “toxic assets”, especially europe, lead mutual distrust banks. a result, interbank market severely impair cause liquidity problems, require necessary intervention monetary policy authorities. • the crisis financial markets, aggravate pro-cyclicality banks, time economic downturn tighten risk criterion decrease lending, thus amplify contraction economy, quickly spread real economy, economic condition deteriorate globally. euro-area crisis • the international financial crisis bring crisis euro area. however, also, root crisis trace creation serious imbalances. • accord theory monetary integration, develop time inception euro 1999, think nominal convergence along single monetary policy would gradually promote real convergence. bank special role transmit financial market shock real economy produce spillover effect across union members. • however, monetary union go hand-in-hand financial integration. indeed, financial integration proceed apace increase capital flow among member-states euro area, lead increase interdependence financial institution markets. • such interdependence necessary smooth operation

outbreak global financial crisis 2008 re-pricing risk, ample capital inflow eu periphery suddenly reversed. • this sudden reversal lead negative feedback loop bank public finances, exacerbate effect financial instability real economy. • in countries, spain, sudden reversal lead collapse demand, collapse asset price bank distress. the bank distress feed back fiscal and, ultimately, sovereign crisis. a similar narrative tell ireland. in member-states, greece, sudden reversal initially affect refinance debt subsequently inflict damage bank system follow haircut greek government debt. • a result, crisis reveal important weakness eu architecture inadequacy implementation structure put place. bi central bankers’ speech 3 • first, exist framework economic governance sufficient prevent creation imbalances. the stability growth pact properly enforce mechanism place monitor external imbalances. • second, increase interdependence financial institution markets, result monetary union ensue financial integration, accompany unify regulatory framework. • third link financial stability financial cycle largely ignored. the architect monetary union choose keep financial sector supervision regulation largely level nation state, insufficient coordination macro micro-prudential supervision. policy response crisis • in unprecedented global crisis, governments, central bank

regulatory authority worldwide, well continuous, timely accurate exchange information supervisory authorities. it make clear new architecture financial supervision require strengthen micro-prudential macro-prudential supervision. regulatory supervisory effort focus financial stability try limit build-up systemic risk. monetary policy response • more specifically, first response global financial crisis, central bank quick put place measure ensure adequate liquidity financial system facilitate access central bank financing. • moreover, central bank largely adjust respective monetary policy

by intervene secondary market public private debt securities, ecb could ensure depth liquidity dysfunctional market segment restore proper function monetary policy transmission mechanism. • finally, september 2012, ecb announce outright monetary transaction (omt) initiative, essentially intention purchase, necessary, security euro area member-states economic adjustment programme secondary market. although activated, announcement initiative contribute significantly improvement financial market conditions, decline sovereign bond spread gradual reversal financial fragmentation. change eu

where stand • since outbreak euro area crisis, policy maker manage correct considerably internal external imbalance past. significant structural reform fiscal consolidation effort take place national level. a result, since 2010, euro area fiscal deficit improve 6.1 per cent gdp 2.9 per cent gdp 2013. • substantial fiscal adjustment take place particularly member-states economic adjustment programmes. in greece, fiscal deficit reduce 13 percentage point gdp 2009 2013, large fiscal consolidation record history short period. the primary budget deficit [10.2 per cent gdp 2009] turn surplus

achievement especially impressive take place contract economy. • member-states economic adjustment programme also make substantial progress towards eliminate external imbalance improve competitiveness. between 2008 2013, current account balance bi central bankers’ speech 7 percentage gdp ireland, portugal greece improve 10 16 percentage points. relative unit labour cost also fall significantly, since 2008 (in greece 20%). • a result, current account deficit country turn surplus recent years. • substantial structural reform product labour market public administration also

characteristic euro area economic recovery continue decline loan private sector. the recovery far “creditless” euro area whole and, many cases, individual countries. • because euro area economy bank-based, bank lend especially important company and, particular, smes, produce bulk good service account large share employment. • consequently, on-going credit contraction raise question: can recovery sustain presence negative loan growth? 8 bi central bankers’ speech • throughout crisis, eurosystem adopt standard non-standard monetary policy measure objective increase confidence restore

potential output. lady gentlemen, today witness containment systemic stress, despite intermittent financial market turbulence. and result aforementioned coordinate actions. however, make u complacent. the search yield low interest rate environment, grow use leverage non-bank financial sector, persistent pressure bank profitability weak uneven macroeconomic recovery, re-emergence sovereign debt sustainability concern amid low nominal growth, waver policy determination reforms, sign investor may underestimate potential loss volatility go forward, issue major concern. the probability systemic threat currently low increase vigilance required. in environment, macro-prudential policy need ensure financial intermediary withstand potential reversal risk premia, time initiative bi central bankers’ speech 9 need monitor ass vulnerability shadow bank sector. i believe lesson learn far prove valuable address potential risk safeguard financial stability. finally, reference eurozone, forget one pronounce characteristics: almost fully integrate monetary side, le financial side despite recent progress, much le fiscal economic sides. until asymmetry eliminate overall economic performance tend remain potential. bi central bankers’ speech 1 thomas jordan: swiss national bank’s monetary policy decision assessment swiss economic situation introductory remark mr thomas jordan, chairman govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 1 december 2014. * * * lady gentleman welcome swiss national bank’s six-monthly news conference. i begin explain govern board’s monetary policy decision outline assessment economic situation. i hand colleagues, jean-pierre danthine fritz zurbrügg, comment current development financial stability financial markets. thereafter, happy take questions. monetary policy decision i begin monetary policy decision. the swiss national bank (snb) decide maintain minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro. the target range three-month libor remain 0.0–0.25%. deflation risk increase recent months, swiss franc still high. we therefore continue enforce minimum exchange rate utmost determination. if necessary, prepare buy foreign currency unlimited quantity purpose. with interest rate zero, minimum exchange rate key instrument avoid undesirable tighten monetary conditions. this especially important moment, upward pressure swiss franc intensify again. furthermore, hesitate take measures, prove necessary. our new conditional inflation forecast revise downwards again. above all, appreciably low oil price push inflation negative territory next four quarters. moreover, economic outlook euro area deteriorate more. together persistently low inflation across globe, dampen medium long-term inflation outlook switzerland. for current year, revise forecast downwards 0.1 percentage point 0.0%. for 2015, even anticipate negative inflation rate –0.1%, inflation turn positive 2016, 0.3%. this constitute downward adjustment 0.3 percentage point 2015, 0.2 percentage point 2016. these forecast assume three-month libor remain zero entire forecast horizon, swiss franc weaken. the revision inflation forecast clear sign deflation risk increase more. global economic outlook the snb’s inflation forecast embed global economic scenario. let discus assessment global economy. global economic development continue mixed. the us, uk china saw robust growth third quarter. in euro area japan, contrast, weak expected. in addition, inflation advance economy central bank target – case considerable margin. in euro area, positive territory. the decline commodity prices, crude oil, curb inflation short term. we continue assume global economic growth gradually firm course next year. the considerable fall oil price contributory factor. however, 2 bi central bankers’ speech prospect individual country vary widely. for us, expect growth remain robust next quarters, lead good utilisation economic capacity. for euro area, contrast, revise growth forecast downwards more, outlook region remain subdued. the picture emerge economy mixed. china continue driver global economy, although likely see gradual weaken growth. for india, growth prospect pick again. the outlook brazil russia, contrast, remain muted. overall, global economic outlook still uncertain dominate downside risk – important continue difficult condition euro area possible escalation geopolitical tensions. swiss economic outlook i look economic development switzerland. follow weak second quarter, real gdp growth unexpectedly favourable third. on demand side, increase support predominantly good exports, manufacture main beneficiary strong export demand. however, private public consumption also pick up, register lacklustre growth first half year. momentum equipment investment, contrast, remain weak. in part, growth also boost special factors, include unusually large increase value add healthcare industry. despite positive development third quarter, utilisation economic capacity remain unsatisfactory. we assume growth markedly low fourth quarter. in particular, export demand value add manufacture likely contribute significantly le growth previous quarter. a result comprehensive revision national accounts, report figure previous quarter higher, therefore gdp growth current year also somewhat high assume september, 1.5–2%. however, underlie economic momentum changed. for next year expect see gdp growth 2%. under assumption, underutilisation economic capacity decline gradually. we also expect modest recovery labour market. monetary financial condition i turn monetary financial conditions. after long period negative territory, inflation hover around zero year. the minimum exchange rate prevent deflationary developments, inflation still lie towards bottom range equate price stability. moreover, accord available surveys, medium-term inflation expectation fall steadily recent years. yet, around 1%, still close long-term average inflation rate. interest rates, too, remain low across maturity past quarters. mortgage rate decline further, reach new low october. government bond rate also fall new lows. my colleague, fritz zurbrügg, discus development financial market detail. despite fall mortgage rates, mortgage lend growth slow again. at time, real estate price continue rise. however, 2013, price momentum weak previous years. this suggest measure contain development mortgage real estate market start impact. yet imbalance build market recent year remain same. it still early all-clear. the snb continue monitor situation closely. my colleague jean-pierre danthine discus topic detail presentation. bi central bankers’ speech 3 since last monetary policy assessment, swiss franc move close minimum exchange rate, thus strengthen euro again. at time, euro depreciate u dollar. overall, export-weighted real external value swiss franc virtually unchanged compare last year, thus continue lie considerably long-term average. the swiss franc still high. in view elevate deflation risks, minimum exchange rate remain key instrument ensure appropriate monetary conditions. a appreciation swiss franc would major impact wage prices, would push inflation well negative territory. company switzerland would force drastic price cuts, order remain competitive. in scenario, price stability would seriously compromised. the minimum exchange rate help reduce deflation risks. snb monetary policy let close additional explanation snb monetary policy. on 30 november, swiss voter reject gold initiative. the initiative demand snb hold least 20% asset gold, sell gold store gold switzerland. we relieve gold initiative rejected. a point several occasions, initiative accept would seriously impair implementation stability-oriented monetary policy. let take opportunity reiterate that, international comparison, snb’s gold hold high. gold always been, remain, important component currency reserve intention sell gold. in prevail international environment, monetary policy challenge face snb remain considerable. the situation still particularly difficult euro area. in order snb able fulfil mandate – ensure price stability take due account economic development – best possible way, must make full use room manoeuvre monetary policy. for reason, snb hesitate take measure fulfil mandate, prove necessary. lady gentlemen, thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 pentti hakkarainen: bank union – “game-changer” european financial market speech mr pentti hakkarainen, deputy governor bank finland, ambassador representative eu-countries helsinki, helsinki, 11 december 2014. * * * accompany slide find bank finland’s website. your excellences, great pleasure tell today bank union give short overview today. the bank union create comprehensive legal institutional framework provide authority power tool deal ail banks. major step take already, still work ahead. the key lesson learn economic dislocation without proper arrangement tackle trouble bank devastate effect real economy, taxpayer whole society. and regain growth prof painfully slow long-lasting. the bank union game-changer bring new culture financial markets. the bank union the bank union comprise three different, although integrated, parts. the single rulebook provide foundation bank union. it base idea harmonise regulatory requirements, capital adequacy rule banks. these achieve european legislation lower-level technical standards. the second main pillar bank union single supervisory mechanism start practical operation month ago begin november. the third important pillar single resolution mechanism. the srm gradually start practical operation begin 2015. the bank union help u prevent bank problems. i would argue fundamental cultural change supervisory crisis management regulatory framework bank also bank industry. in future avoid use taxpayers’ money rule bail-out would rare exception. this turn mean also correct incentive bank hence stable financial system. the single supervisory mechanism after successful comprehensive assessment process, ssm running. the ssm establish ensure strong supervisory standard apply consistent manner across euro area. and fundamental goal strengthen confidence resilience bank sector. to achieve goals, ssm, ecb centre, entrust extensive set micro- macro-prudential powers, cover key task relate prudential supervision credit institutions. the ssm posse also early intervention power accordance bank recovery resolution directive. the early intervention power significant make possible take action respect bank approach point non-viability i.e. bank deeply trouble save ordinary supervisory measures. 2 bi central bankers’ speech governance ssm the governance structure ssm design separate ecb’s monetary policy supervisory roles, also make position different participate country fair possible. the supervisory board responsible supervisory function ssm. while decision formally finally adopt govern council ecb, supervisory board is, de facto, main decision-making body supervisory matters. the govern council cannot alter decision supervisory board, prevent entry force. such veto power could exercise decision see conflict monetary policy. new macroprudential role the crisis show micro-prudential supervision individual bank level sufficient, macro micro risk actually mutually reinforcing. this call close cooperation macro- micro-prudential functions. the ecb power also macro-prudential area, share competence national macro-prudential authorities. the ecb consult national measure possibility tighten national measure deem inadequate. macro-prudential instrument could also apply euro-area financial system whole. this complete support work another macro-stability authority, european systemic risk board (esrb). while esrb doesn’t directly impact tools, cover eu member state whole financial system rather bank sector. bank resolution the single resolution mechanism (srm) begin operation 1 january 2015. the srm create single authority alike ssm. it consist consist single resolution board national resolution authorities. the srm responsible swift orderly resolution bank euro area participate member states. the srm include also single resolution fund bank union level. the srm end era bail-out move u culture bail-in. bail-in rule, bail-out rare exception. a begin 2016, country even earlier, brrd require bail-in shareholder creditor equal least 8% total liability bank. the new power bail-in bank debt holder crucial, element future resolution mechanism, limit use bail-outs significantly. the srm supranational decision make body resolution powers, ensure efficient decision make procedures, adequate resolution finance arrangement equal treatment. it institutional geographical scope ssm. single resolution board the regulation provide single resolution board broad powers. upon notification european central bank bank fail likely fail, initiative, board would adopt resolution scheme place bank resolution. the board consist chair, vice-chair, four full-time appoint executive member representative national resolution authority participate countries. it exercise task either plenary executive format. it determine application resolution tool use single resolution fund. decision board enter force within 24 hour adoption, unless bi central bankers’ speech 3 commission council, act simple majority proposal commission, object call changes. the national resolution authority responsible practical implementation resolution schemes. however, board ensure national bias identical case treat identically. single resolution fund the srm include special resolution fund provide resource implement resolution tools. the single resolution fund finance via levy bank sector itself. the fund ensure availability medium-term fund enable bank continue operate restructured. it target level €55 billion borrow market decide single resolution board. it reach target level eight years, start 2016. during transitional period, national compartment progressively merged. the fund make bank le likely fail also safe fail – mean resolve without cost taxpayer without significant disruption financial market economy large. the fund capitalize bank ensure ability implement restructure resolution tools. conclusion the bank union correct flaw internationally integrate financial markets. and that, national interests, i argue banks’ interest well, take care match regulatory supervisory institution reality bank business. a structure first time history european union allow bank supervision resolution mechanism base truly european mandate. by give small part national sovereignty, country belong bank union gain access european level decision make key area supervision, crisis prevention management well regulation european banks. the bank union, ssm srm broad power give tool handle problem also powerful preventive effect. it enhance responsibility bank reduce moral hazard. i foresee change financial market take place generation. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ivan iskrov: review 2014 start point reflection challenge ahead bulgaria speech mr ivan iskrov, governor bulgarian national bank, association bank bulgaria occasion banker’s day, sofia, 4 december 2014. * * * lady gentlemen, i’m happy together professional holiday – celebration banker’s day, saint nicholas day. keep tradition, year again, bnb govern council member mark occasion – management representative bank bulgaria. please accept presence expression acknowledgement work professional attitude run entrust institutions. also, today would like underscore appreciation effort contribution many safekeeping financial stability country. the bank deserve congratulation positive result sector achieve amid unfavourable market, medium political backdrop 2014. at time, let u use recapitulation year start point reflection challenge may lie ahead. the pass year prove one tough bank system bulgaria since time big crisis 1996–1997. the reason several i would conditionally divide two groups. within first group fall challenge 2014 unexpected. we comment challenge previous years. thus, instance, forecast year also economic growth would accelerate, materialised. that hold back quality bank asset improve tangibly. accordingly, loan demand enterprise household stay weak. a result, yet another year, banks’ profitability subdue possibility income lending, i.e. core activity, remain limited. also expect task relate transposition bulgarian legislation capital requirement directive capital requirement regulation adopt 2013 european parliament council eu. this time last year statement i qualify kind “supervisory revolution” large one-off change occur supervisory framework last 15 years. early year, amendment adopt law credit institution regulatory framework, include drop key bnb ordinances, ordinance no 9 one govern specific provision credit risk. in place specific provision allocate then, bank make additional account provision international financial report standard (ifrs), thus reduce book value loan past-due 90 days. the second group challenges, 2014 undoubtedly remembered, include event put resilience bank system test. a point even reach question raise public space bnb effectiveness, particular bank supervision thus far exercised. the event question start severe liquidity attack several bank middle year. 2014 go history also huge misappropriation depositors’ money, malpractice governance breach regulation reveal second half year fourth large bank country – “corporate commercial bank” ad (ktb). 2 bi central bankers’ speech the ktb case finally resolve effective application statutory guarantee deposits. by coincidence, exactly today, 4 december 2014, long-awaited payment guarantee deposit ktb started. the depositor bank access deposit long time. the central bank truly wish see ktb issue resolve short time possible. unfortunately, well known, large part documentation miss absence legal mean quick restructure ktb, voluminous action need restore credit file ktb. gather information necessary condition independent auditor perform complete analysis assessment ktb assets. without analysis assessment, actual status ktb’s capital position could determine and, respectively, bnb govern council could legal grind adopt necessary decisions. on 12 december, cb victoria also open business depositor access deposit there. the scale power manifestation problem 2014 unprecedented unpredictable. the bank sector bulgaria, however, huge advantage meet critical time prepare excellent condition – cop meet global crisis several year before. our bank manage accumulate high liquidity capital buff owe sound governance bnb’s focus conservative policy years. the available buff plus measure take since june bnb government, well banks, help safeguard bank overall financial stability country. this way, ktb crisis remain isolate case affect operation rest bank sector. a proof depositors’ behaviour continue entrust save bank despite occasionally irresponsible public speak bank sector incessant public attack bnb. only household deposit pick bgn 2.8 billion (7.8%) annually october, exceed stock deposit may (the last month place ktb cb victoria special supervision). this clearly indicate restore confidence system. besides, bank system end year excellent capital adequacy liquidity indicators. i say bank system, mean banks, exclude ktb cb victoria. a september, total capital adequacy ratio stand 22.16%, tier 1 capital ratio 19.91% (just remind eu provision new basel capital accord, also know “basel iii”, require 8% total capital adequacy 6% tier 1 capital ratio, respectively). the liquid assets-to-liabilities ratio bank system october reach 29.75%. in 2014 share non-performing exposure past-due 90 day continue stabilise. at end october year, system level, book value 10.62% system’s loan portfolio book value (i.e. practically end 2013 share 10.28%). the balance-sheet share non-performing exposure reflect already provision risk impairment already made. the provision level high, total bgn 5–6 billion provision form impairment allocate bank sector ifrs october. the bank system continue generate profit, source additional capitalisation thus reserve maintain stability. we expect sector end 2014 positive financial result circa bgn 700 million (i.e. last year’s result). this performance apply whole system without bank whose license revoke cb victoria still special supervision. all indicator result especially reward achieve harsh year! at time, however, nobody entertain illusion hardship trial bank country over. because likely 2015 well bank community bi central bankers’ speech 3 work test business environment, i rule possibility new attempt deliver blow sector, motivate intertwine economic, political medium interests, saw bulgarian bank system right ktb cb victoria place special supervision. the pass 2014 year show dangerous society, well useless authors, attack actually be. remember how, right you, year ago i call attention fact could expect political tension rise topic bank turn object pre-election campaign party bickering. regrettably, unpleasant prediction come true. throughout past year spar statement party representative administer negative public judgment pronounce gloomy prediction bank country. the air political insecurity breed sort populist acts, include irrational legislative proposal regard bank bnb. could be, however, 2015 would witness radical change think action political representative medium circle towards prudence good awareness key role bank sector financial stability, economic growth welfare society? i don’t know. but i hope much would so. dear colleagues, outside issue relate national specific environment bank operate in, i would take opportunity note forthcoming amendment regulatory framework 2015 relate introduction new uniform european norm practice direct impact work credit institution bulgaria. in 2015 bank recovery resolution directive eu come effect, aim introduce eu-wide rule tool member state deal bank trouble take timely adequate measure rescue viable institutions. this directive go transpose bulgarian law mean new legal provision amendment exist legal framework (e.g. law credit institutions, law bank bankruptcy, law bnb). strategic decision need make establish relevant competent authority task responsibility resolve bank investment firms, set resolution funds, draw supervise entity adequate plan recovery control restoration viability restructuring. in connection new eu capital framework crd4, 2014 bnb begin implement new report framework supervisory purpose (the so-called finrep corep), consist 100 separate report forms. the additional supervisory report meet accumulate information need bank supervision department tackle sensitive source risk banks’ portfolios. in 2015 expect eu-wide bank supervision rule become common bank practices. numerous technical standards, develop european bank authority (eba) adopt european commission, go put place. in supervise subsidiary euro area banks, bnb go cooperate actively single supervisory mechanism (ssm) start november 2014. last least bnb’s intention initiate asset quality review entire bank system, cover bank operate bulgaria. this also key requirement government decide, point, start talk ecb join ssm. the methodology review base high standard already develop apply ecb recently complete asset quality review euro area large bank prior transition ssm. this review carry help independent external consultant. it start late end next year, depend implementation new bank recovery resolution directive advances, include creation respective resolution fund. i assure 4 bi central bankers’ speech bnb go get commercial bank familiar, early enough stage, main element methodology forthcoming asset quality review, bank could budget relevant cost (by analogy euro area bank bear cost asset quality review). dear friends, the pass 2014 regrettably remember vicious public pressure bnb. the central bank systematic orchestrate attack behind one could see narrow corporate interest political dependencies. such focused, fierce continuous attack central bank unheard today’s advance societies, certainly far european norms. information pay attack whose money spend already become public knowledge. even interest detail may continue come month ahead. then, i hope, become quite clear even public large fact defend public interest act it. this multi-month campaign central bank (which way still go on) consume impressively large financial, medium political resources. all also observe bias attempt nationally representative organisation misrepresent bnb’s action and, ostensibly accident, divert attention bulgarian public abuse people’s trust deposits. but along solve case ktb cb victoria, bnb allow mislead deviate letter spirit law. if somebody believe use jimmy hoffa’s1 method would force strong institution like bnb, earn reputation nationally internationally, circumvent law obey personal group interests, obviously mistaken. in regard please let share general observation relate topic fraud ktb, responsibility bank supervision, role central bank. the ktb case compare series case countries. over last year alone eu usa dozen fail bank bank fraud billion euro discovered. however, note case central bank pressurise take full responsibility scapegoated, unlike continual public attack bnb. in country responsible institution politician always hold understand central bank’s authority paramount importance calm depositor stability bank system whole. all across world authority, independence central bank, consider long-term asset country. consequently, central banks’ action compromise pressure temporary economic political emotions. all say far mean bnb intention draw conclusion improve efficiency bank supervision. quite opposite, bnb already undertake serious step direction. back summer publicly announce number measure action review supervisory framework practices. i wish remind early july send official letter eba invite carry independent review quality, capacity, practice procedure bnb’s bank supervision department. in august send another letter international monetary fund (imf) request organise mission imf world bank bulgaria financial sector assessment program (fsap). on recommendation imf, world bank eba, 1 jam riddle (“jimmy”) hoffa (1913–1975), famous american labour union leader 1960s charge convict tie organise crime, corruption financial fraud. bi central bankers’ speech 5 bank supervision department already work ass compliance supervisory practice bulgaria “basel core principles”2 effective bank supervision first stage fsap. in addition, bnb already draw propose member parliament draft amendment law bnb law credit institutions, design rectify weakness legal framework allow bnb govern council control bank supervision functions. because well aware facts, cunningly ignore avoid attack bnb. since june 1997 law bnb govern council body adopt bank regulation (i.e. ordinance define norm requirement banks’ activities). however, supervision exclusively entrust deputy governor charge bank supervision department (no matter name is), act separately independently. the crisis ktb, one, clearly demonstrate immense concentration power responsibility one official mistake legislation. and want change this. because bear responsibility possible without relevant powers. whatever happen ahead, event 2014 rewrite bnb’s history prove success recent years. it fact that, thank consistent efficient work central bank, include bank supervision, global financial crisis single bank go bankrupt bulgaria. in countries, even eu, problem bank lead public cost run hundred billion euros. the bulgarian citizen taxpayer save that. the long-standing achievement bnb, bnb’s bank supervision particular, forget erase easily – even turn omission may make ktb case. it also fact since june date bnb, government commercial bank (under strong leadership bnb) successfully confine negative effect rest bank sector place ktb cb victoria special supervision. make huge efforts, continue safeguard financial stability bulgaria. in extremely unfavourable situation unprecedented public pressure, ferocious criticism direct attack central bank, bnb manage best. the good news year bnb practically stand real heavy stress test. we pass exceptionally serious stress test independence. we prove country, business society strong institution rely pillar stability protect long-term public interest, institution give pressure opportunistic interests. on day like this, normally weigh past events, think could go back time, long worry pass year. some event often wisely judge look long historical perspective. if take look back 135-year history bnb, would see many example demonstrate strength central bank insusceptibility coteries’ intrigue shallow trivial debate (which absorb energy public creative resource, vanish time). but history witness obscurantist episode too, bnb suppress obey political temporary interests. the implication intervention always tragic country. here one brief example. on famed date 9 september 1944 bnb govern council set “buying” rate soviet rouble (15 lev 1 rouble) instruct telephone minister finance. two day later, 11 september 1944, government order bnb stop buy 2 basel core principle effective bank supervision 14 september 2012. 6 bi central bankers’ speech roubles, instead bnb oblige pay soviet arm force pass country “the amount need request” amount account debt country.3 we hope time would never return bulgaria. bolshevik enthusiasm decision make street pressure dangerous approach come public policy regard monetary regime, bank supervision financial stability. today, call stand professionalism independence central bank – responsibility concrete actions. the public interest require reputation central bank respect institutional independence continuity work safeguarded. the strength institution country pre-condition stability economic growth, weakness institution first sign forthcoming economic financial failure country. it coincidence country usually serve u example democracy prosperity, strong public institution rule outlive individual political party too. dear colleagues, finally, please allow convey best wish behalf bnb govern council success bank run professional personal achievement come year 2015. happy banker’s day, dear colleagues! thank attention! 3 see “archives speaking”, bulgarian national bank; compendium documents, volume іv, 1930–1947,

open address mr luis m linde, governor bank spain, 10th bank industry/iese (escuela de negocios de la universidad de navarra) meeting, madrid, 10 december 2014. * * * i much appreciate professor juan josé toribio’s kind invitation participate 10th bank industry meeting. in address i shall review situation challenge face european spanish bank industry follow start-up single supervisory mechanism (ssm). since height tension mid-2012, position spanish bank industry improve notably. this improvement due series factors, range far-reaching change european institutional arrangement common monetary policy measure and, doubt, reform spain. clearly, however, improvement cannot explain without recall change make bank system. recapitalisation, restructuring, downsize reform save bank sector spearhead spanish bank industry reform contribute correct imbalance build up. the improvement spanish bank substantiate interim assessment make european (the ecb european commission) international (imf) authority european union’s financial assistance programme recapitalisation spanish bank successfully conclude january year. these assessment recently uphold comprehensive assessment exercise european bank system carry ecb, collaboration national supervisors, prior step start-up ssm. the spanish bank industry claim today healthy balance sheet considerably resilient potentially adverse macroeconomic scenario limit probability occurrence. the european bank industry follow comprehensive assessment exercise from european standpoint, exercise identify certain bank whose solvency improve, matter doubt among priority ssm, i late refer. broadly, exercise highlight fact european bank evidence ample solvency asset quality review detect significant valuation fail substantial provision shortfalls. in short, ecb’s comprehensive assessment contribute allay doubt vulnerability european bank balance sheet resilience, identify factor risk financial stability. that said, european bank industry face series additional challenge stem change way regulation supervision, arise response financial crisis. i shall turn challenges, begin link current macroeconomic financial situation. 2 bi central bankers’ speech first, concern market segment investors, search yield, may take excessive risks. financial condition might adversely affect sudden reversal process, particular reversal bring sharp price corrections, especially le liquid market segments. second, also worry low profitability. the comprehensive assessment deem solvency comfortably acceptable, profitability bank industry remain prone downside pressures, particularly macroeconomic set bad expect month back. low return hamper organic capital accumulation raise doubt medium-term sustainability bank activities. bank adapt strategy business model enhance profitability sustain fashion. finally, i would highlight risk concern re-emerge sustainability sovereign debt, especially background low nominal growth. this risk fully abate might rear event substantial macroeconomic downturn. these three risk mutually exclusive. indeed, common denominator share current weakness euro area economic growth. but, irrespective transmission channel sluggish economic growth may translate financial instability, precisely weakness nominal growth european economy main risk area present. the spanish bank industry the spanish bank industry immune risks. to date 2014, rate decline lend resident private sector show sign easing, term bank lend household non-financial corporations, especially pursue real estate construction-related activities. in event, performance lend aggregate level affect need continue redress high private-sector debt. the npl ratio spanish bank industry continue post high level observe year ago. however, improve slightly 2014. this correction come despite fact lending, denominator ratio, continue post negative rate change. hence, comparatively large fall npl 2014 main determinant reduction. in first half year, spanish bank industry post somewhat low consolidate profit first half 2013, although far remove heavy loss 2012. in set still mark low volume activity, low interest rate still-high level non-earning assets, banks’ ability generate interest income remain subject downside pressure. these factor offset decline operate expense low loss attributable asset impairment. a industry’s solvency, spanish bank whole cet1 ratio june 2014 comfortably exceed require minimum. the firm intensification trend largely depend development spanish economy recovery take root. the outlook economy remain favourable; far, prove resilient external environment growth forecast global economy revise downwards, recovery european country – important economy – lose momentum. thus, domestic front least, would necessary embed reform way, thereby enhance capacity recovery. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the start-up single supervisory mechanism among challenge pose ssm attain quality bank supervision, apply strengthen uniform standard make use possible acquire knowledge various national authorities, set place common supervisory culture. in light work undertake date intense collaboration ecb national authorities, goal realistic. the banco de españa strive ensure successful process, cooperate ecb ssm participants. we adapt organisational arrangement work method smooth interaction ssm ecb. a key challenge maintain level play field member countries, apply uniform supervisory principles. that major challenge, give europe wide diversity bank model legal systems. further, heterogeneity regulatory framework recently lessen follow entry force capital requirement directive regulation (crd iv crr), difference persist must discussed. such difference include notably so-called national discretion options. on one hand, new framework provide gradual transition new capital requirements, line basel iii accord. the regulation give country discretion set pace convergence towards new requirements, may give rise temporary difference treatment specific aspects. for instance, country may decide bring forward application new capital conservation buffer, initially envisage 2016, deduction certain capital components. moreover, regulation provide series national option might give rise permanent difference treatment specific aspects. it logical ssm work achieve degree harmonisation, seek restrict national option permanent nature. it perhaps le logical take step case temporary discretionary arrangements, nature must disappear within years. different account practices, especially regard provisioning, also significantly affect uniformity capital figure supervisory concern. it thus reasonable expect ssm contribute convergence interpretation international account standards. and essential ssm strive equally revise calculation risk- weight assets. that call detail review risk model use bank adoption corrective measure unjustifiable deviation detected. macroprudential policy macroprudential policy, insofar seek identify systemic risks, prevent increase industry’s resilience, important role play. the nature risk global dimension, mean coordination various authority responsibility field needed. at time, bear mind risk may consider common euro area whole, impact intensity vary country country. this heterogeneity depend characteristic country, also particular juncture financial cycle. for example, present certain euro area country evidence risk associate excessive real estate market prices, others risk discernible. macroprudential policy thus require coordinate approach various institutions, time attention must pay consideration national nature. in monetary 4 bi central bankers’ speech union like euro area, heterogeneity member countries’ financial cycle may important issue come design policies. the european systemic risk board set late 2010 authority responsible macroprudential oversight european union, empower issue warn recommendation connection “act explain” principle. further institutional development since followed. thus, without go detail organisation macroprudential regulation supervision euro area, member country move ahead creation national macroprudential authorities, ecb assign responsibility european regulation. the institutional form national macroprudential authority depend specific characteristic country, although, recommendation european systemic risk board, common feature major role play one way another central banks. challenge bank sector pose change international regulation supervision let conclude look challenge bank sector derive major change bank regulation supervision international sphere. i shall briefly describe basic matter discuss financial stability board, or, call it, fsb. in november 2008, g20 agree ambitious “action plan” ask fsb overhaul international financial regulation, reform go root crisis pave way sound safe financial system allow sustainable finance economic growth. the task extensive intensive. a substantial portion reform need fulfil mandate g20 already agreed, particularly regard bank industry. apart reform basel framework bank (commonly know basel iii), basic pillar regulatory reform undertake fsb new treatment so- call “systemic institutions”. or, words, problem pose institution big complex fail, mean authority recapitalise public fund distress. identify institution “systemic” consequences. they subject large capital charge strict supervisory regime aim reduce likelihood get difficulties. that said, fact key differentiate factor reduce impact potential failure systemic institution, unquestionably new resolution framework. this new framework encompass (a) legislative reforms; (b) requirement institution resolution plan place; (c) assessment effective resolution ability authority respective crisis management groups; (d) need institution loss-absorbing capacity fund ensure that, situation resolution, carry “from within”, i.e. without need capital injection relevant authority without destabilise financial system whole. allow take moment talk loss-absorbing capacity resolution, total loss-absorbing capacity (tlac). on 10 november fsb publish proposal tlac requirement meet systemically important banks, final design schedule end 2015. the consultative process tlac proposal conduct parallel impact study include (i) analysis tlac need institution may resolved; (ii) survey ass depth market jurisdiction bi central bankers’ speech 5 involved; (iii) analysis historical loss incur global systemic bank height crisis; (iv) assessment economic impact proposal, institution level affect supply credit. the difference basel requirement lie instrument eligible meet new requirement. thus, addition equity instrument envisage basel, proposal permits, fact requires, inclusion debt instruments, generally subordinate debt instruments. experience show capital may disappear crisis, quickly so. the authority must, therefore, debt equity instrument (through debt reduction and/or conversion equity instruments) allow resolve recapitalise institution within, without need bail-out public authorities. will end reforms? i think not, least far financial sector concerned. the considerably high prudential requirement bank naturally cause credit intermediation shift financial sectors, phenomenon commonly know “shadow banking”. the fsb set train two course action prevent excessive concentration bank risk balance sheet banks: first, monitor size, activity risk characteristics; second, work introduction measure institution (particularly closed-end money market funds) activity (particularly certain form alternative funding, securitisation fund obtain repo market security lending). lastly, increase emphasis place monitor implementation reforms. one lesson learn crisis international standard must appropriate, also effectively uniformly implement across jurisdiction avoid situation lack competitiveness, regulatory arbitrage creation systemic risk. i sure that, previous years, meet extremely interest informative. there shortage issue problems. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jwala rambarran: monetary policy presentation november 2014 speech mr jwala rambarran, governor central bank trinidad tobago, chaguanas chamber industry commerce, port-of-spain, 1 december 2014. * * * lady gentlemen, i thank chaguanas chamber industry commerce graciously agree host third monetary policy forum. event monetary policy forum important central bank’s communication strategies, communication new monetary policy tool central bank around world. from debe tobago chaguanas, forum provide platform explain think behind monetary policy actions, interact stakeholder account national community, serve. a enter final month 2014, global economic prospect mute compare optimistic sentiment prevail start year. recovery global crisis take long anyone expected. more half decade onwards many country still struggle painful legacy crisis, include extraordinarily high debt soar unemployment it’s yet over. the manage director international monetary fund, christine lagarde, recent annual meet imf world bank, talk “new mediocre” descriptor low economic growth new reality. in advance economies, unite state grow fast pace decade unite kingdom show encourage sign steady growth. recovery eurozone remain fragile. japan’s economy slip back fourth recession since 2008. emerge markets, fuel great deal global activity recent past, likely heavy lift slow pace before. output growth china, world’s second-largest economy, slow five- year low. the indian economy rallying, two member bric bloc, russia brazil, face significant headwind growth. still international front, dark cloud gathering. these cloud come unite state bring murky condition associate normalization u monetary policy. these condition potential powerful impact emerge market economy trinidad tobago, reach us. a expected, u federal reserve end era quantitative ease october 2014 meeting. next year, first time eight years, likely see hike feed fund rate, probably summer 2015. there considerable uncertainty global financial market pace magnitude expect increase u interest rates. for trinidad tobago, uncertainty could result weaken capital inflow acceleration capital outflows. central bank trinidad tobago already put measure place, available monetary policy tools, increase policy interest rate, insulate economy, much possible, shock expect feel rise u interest rates. apart dark cloud hover unite states, geopolitical risk mount various part world. we start 2014 possible escalation conflict russia ukraine. we end year ebola outbreak africa upsurge isi middle east. so, realize i go trouble first raise murky international matter early warn sign global financial markets. development 2 bi central bankers’ speech battlefield across world impact small island state. this i raise set tone thing likely unfold. recent economic development i’ll begin brief overview domestic economic conditions. follow growth 2010 2011, economy recover approximately 1 ½ percent 2012 grow 1.7 percent 2013. in early 2014, central bank expect trinidad tobago economy continue recovery, growth project 2½ percent. for number reasons, materialize. central bank’s late economic review year indicate economic growth likely modest ½ percent 2014. this, course, well forecast economic growth, make begin year, 2 ½ percent. so account deviation? how could experts, well agency imf, s&p cso, get wrong? the unexpected slowdown economy cause dismal performance energy sector, decline pronounce natural gas lng production. energy company indicated, october 2013, plan supply shutdown stoppage take place past two year would energy production would normalize 2014. however, supply disruption mainly two large energy company continue throughout 2014 stifle recovery process. in january may 2014, bptt take company’s large production platform, savonette, facilitate drill activities. bgtt plan shutdown dolphin platform five day june 2014 facilitate installation equipment require starfish development programme. bg also take opportunity undertake parallel maintenance exercise. these instance shutdown country’s two large natural gas producers. routine maintenance atlantic lng train 2 facility petrotrin’s oil refinery worsen situation energy sector. energy output, therefore, contract estimate 1 ½ percent first nine month 2014. energy production rebound extent – within last two month strong enough compensate prolong sharp drop output. ngc’s gas pipeline leak last days, lead shutdown country’s main power provider, expect resolve soon significant impact production. central bank expect growth energy sector decline little 2 percent 2014. this harsh reality tie energy- base economy. the bright spot news midst dreary development come non-energy sector, steady performance prevent economy veer completely growth trajectory. output non-energy sector increase 2 percent first nine month 2014 indication non-energy performance remain encourage final quarter 2014. overall growth non-energy sector expect around 3 percent 2014, surpass central bank’s project growth rate 2 percent. much growth non-energy sector concentrate three area – construction, distribution finance. in construction sector, local sale cement expand strongly, reach almost 8 ½ percent first nine month 2014. high construction activity reflect several on-going, large public sector project point fortin highway, children’s hospital, national aquatic centre port galeota. further impetus come private sector project break ground, “c3” movie shop complex corinth, south trinidad. new car sale – main indicator distribution activity – still hit double-digit rates. dealer sell 14,000 new car first nine month 2014. at end bi central bankers’ speech 3 november, already reach near 4,500 marker pde series. for first time five years, new car sale surpass 18,000 unit annual basis. low interest rates, high liquidity cautiously optimistic sentiment business community support expansion private sector lending. the recovery business lend emerge first quarter 2014 strengthen year progressed. over nine month lead september 2014, business lend increase average 4 ½ percent compare average decline nearly 4 percent period 2013. consumer loan continue accelerate 2014. the expansion consumer loan average 7 ½ percent period january september 2014, average increase 5.0 percent first nine month 2013. a disaggregation consumer credit show strong growth loan purchase vehicles, home renovation debt consolidation. record low mortgage rate continue spur demand real estate mortgage financing. i turn matter grab headline generate intense interest country past month – fall international crude oil price impact budget. price west texas intermediate (wti) fell 30 percent since start fiscal year october 1st four-year low us$66 per barrel, last friday, follow opec’s decision cut output. this low 2014/2015 budget estimate us$80 per barrel. the weakness oil price due abundant global supply opec unite state combine slow growth world demand especially europe china. the general expectation low crude oil price could persist time. there several reason concern fall oil price i hasten add, suffer panic attack hyperventilate yet. first, become accustom use oil price psychological barometer economic forecast sunny sky murky weather. oil price rise…we feel euphoric; oil price fall…we feel “doom gloom” reach paper bag breathe into. this see-saw sentiment neglect fact another even important, apparently well known, barometer economic outlook. i refer natural gas price. this break news, lady gentlemen, member media. trinidad tobago become gas-based economy 18 year ago 1996. last year, produce nine time natural gas crude oil energy equivalent basis. a large portion energy production export natural gas-based. at central bank, estimate natural gas contribute roughly 70 percent government revenue oil remain 30 percent. the second reason panic plummet oil price budget revenue estimate base henry hub natural gas price unite states, even though le 10 percent lng export go unite states. we vary lng export market consist south america, europe, middle east asia. this mean lng sell different price various markets. government’s natural gas revenue base net back price lng point fortin, average price tally various market lng exports. the henry hub natural gas price currently trade us$4.00 per million british thermal units, is, 45 percent budget natural gas price. the netback price lng point fortin currently around us$5.50 per million british thermal units, double budget natural gas price. however, regions, asia europe, natural gas price index oil move tandem movement oil prices. even so, central bank estimate netback price lng point fortin would fall 50 percent extend period time significantly compress energy revenues. therefore, bottom line this: fall oil price immediate impact budget, 70 percent revenue come sale natural gas-based export currently trade double budget natural gas price. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the third reason avoid hysteria fall oil price minister finance economy several fiscal option exercise adjust shortfall energy revenues. last friday, minister howai, indicate plan action would slash $1.3 billion expenditure across ministries. the minister also option access heritage stabilization fund partly finance budgetary shortfalls. however, i’ve advise government, current situation warrant withdrawal hsf, expenditure cut make shortfall energy revenue persist extend period time. we live oil price volatility 100 years. trinidad tobago survive collapse oil price mid1980s and, recently, 2008 oil price drop 30 percent. what important, i advise minister finance economy, need exercise prudence make choice stabilize fiscal position. i would like turn another murky matter grab headline year – foreign exchange, foreign exchange, everyone’s need precious u currency unfulfilled, vacationer want us$500, you, business community unable pay goods, see credit stand affected. foreign exchange turn murky matter agenda others pretend ignorant system works. i’m sure business reporter write 2014 year review, probably say called, “foreign exchange shortage” business story year perhaps – always three side story… yours, mine truth… may year more, see truth today. let’s start beginning. a banker government, receive country’s revenue energy sector tax energy company require pay every quarter u dollars. that money form country’s “official reserves”. central bank invest reserve use interest income make investment fund operation bank itself. central bank fund taxpayer, receive fund government. in fact, way around. at end fiscal year, send surplus government. we also use reserve service government’s external debt payment sell foreign exchange bank system meet shortfall supply. through sale u financial system foster orderly condition foreign exchange market, thereby maintain exchange rate stability. a well aware, demand foreign exchange business community public perennially high, supply come market discrete intervals, usually energy sector company convert foreign exchange bank system pay local bills. so foreign exchange supply country come two ways: 1. directly central bank energy company pay quarterly tax u dollar and; 2. when energy company convert u dollar bank system year-round meet local commitments. however, demand always high supply gap result shortfall system point central bank step meet shortfall sell foreign exchange stock official reserves. therefore, central bank enter system meet shortfall foreign exchange supply, provide entire supply financial system. right account 25 percent total foreign exchange supply money come directly energy company account rest. what then, base structure, create noise past year? there time shortfall would occur seasonally, close christmas hectic august travel period. over last two decades, demand foreign exchange expand composition also change reflect new pattern consumer spending, example, bi central bankers’ speech 5 use credit card make online payments. today know “cyber-monday” unite state many local flood u retailers’ website comfort warmth home trinidad tobago thank internet, credit card u delivery addresses. foreign credit card purchase devour us$570 million year far. that exclude today’s cyber-monday sale upcoming christmas purchases. last year, foreign credit card payment consume us$530 million. that us$1 billion spend foreign credit card purchase two years. commercial bank must meet credit card payment meet foreign exchange demand. that’s one source demand, there’s double-digit growth sale new cars, many higher-end luxury vehicles. for year far, we’ve spend us$205 million purchase new cars; last year figure us$340 million. that nearly us$750 million purchase new car two years. foreign currency deposit another source foreign exchange demand. currently, us$ 3.3 billion dollar foreign currency deposit bank system. here’s get interesting, foreign exchange story get bite murkier. there many business leader often give opinion freely foreign exchange, many go medium extremely vocal matter. many business legitimate request foreign exchange acknowledge request always meet time, reason central bank take us$1.7 billion dollar reserve year far help meet unsatisfied demand. however, we’ve notice trend, business make noise foreign exchange pay bill trade-related purpose actively lobby authorize dealer central bank u dollars. when money provided, fund promptly deposit foreign currency account leave unused noise able get money business continues. i one tip business try get foreign exchange; help don’t conduct business company terrorist link strict law anti-money launder combat finance terrorism. a i indicate before, central bank step market meet shortfall foreign exchange supply presently account 25 percent total supply. so can’t supply 50 percent 80 percent, even all? why must ensure enough official reserve put aside? well...let ask this...what global financial crisis go another five years? what feed raise interest rate fast expect next year cause tremendous volatility global currency, stock bond markets? what ebola virus spread caribbean region? when factor chance external event happening, ensure enough official reserve insurance case something happen. the plan ensure don’t deplete reserves, late 1980s, take u 30 year finally reach today’s us$11 billion. and yes, us$11 billion include us$1.175 billion proceed sale mhtl. in benchmarking, one year’s worth official reserves. this mean i take official reserve give business community, would actually able buy everything need year. be enough? should i keep use country’s official reserve ensure every commercial activity demand foreign exchange get central bank? i governor run country’s reserve make everyone happy. i prefer continue governor, armchair economist say disrupt foreign exchange market, improvement i know benefit entire country long run, one try get everyone like make friend play loose fast country’s foreign exchange reserves. 6 bi central bankers’ speech central bank’s monetary policy action i turn central bank’s monetary policy actions. at november 2014 meeting, monetary policy committee (mpc) central bank resolve increase “repo” rate another 25 basis point 3 ¼ percent. this second hike two months, hold repo rate historical low nearly two years. the mpc send signal belief high interest rate necessary financial system mitigate disruptive effect high portfolio capital outflow pre- empt potential rise inflationary pressures. the mpc base decision start gradual withdrawal accommodative monetary stance past four year three main factors. first, forward guidance u feed alter market expectation time frame end quantitative ease start increase feed fund rate. a indicate before, u feed end quantitative ease programme october 2014 expect gradually increase policy interest rate around summer 2015. at current interest rates, u dollar asset attractive tt dollar assets, prompt movement portfolio capital search high yields. we need stay well ahead curve enhance appeal tt dollar assets. second, headline inflation accelerating, reach shy 10 percent double-digit territory october 2014, 3 percent start year. this high headline inflation rate since july 2012, i assume office governor. the pick-up headline inflation mainly due escalation food price inflation, currently hit almost 20 percent. rise food price reflect low domestic agricultural output partly due cessation plant caroni green limit consequence prolong organizational restructuring. with recent heavy rainfall flood part trinidad, expect increase food crop prices. look ahead, high public spend expansionary 2014/2015 budget already add elevate liquidity level (currently nearly $8 billion) may push core inflationary pressures. third, non-energy sector deliver fairly respectable growth 14 consecutive quarter september 2014 near-term outlook continue steady performance non-energy output. this suggest non- energy sector develop enough resilience withstand gradual increase interest rates. in addition, growth strengthen unite states, augur caricom country major market non- energy exports. apart increase repo rate, central bank active past year manage excess liquidity. the main source liquidity arise finance government’s net domestic budget deficit. for year-to-date, net domestic fiscal injection add $11 billion system, maturity two central government bond previously issue liquidity absorption purposes, also return approximately $1.5 billion system. in order effectively manage liquidity levels, bank utilize several tool disposal. give increase limit treasury bill note acts, period january – october 2014 central bank intensify use open market operation withdraw $10.7 billion bank system. of amount, $7 ½ billion open market security issue sterilize lock away liquidity arise extraordinary, one-off purchase us$1.175 billion foreign exchange bank. in addition, central bank roll three commercial banks’ fix deposit total $4.5 billion facilitate issue $1 billion liquidity sterilization treasury bond june 2014. further, central bank sale foreign exchange authorize dealer indirectly remove $9.1 billion system review period. bi central bankers’ speech 7 the bank plan re-open un-issued portion ($440 million) $1 billion liquidity treasury bond issue august 2013 well use liquidity absorption measure rein excess liquidity come months. short-term prospect i would like turn outlook 2015. we face weak global growth prospect significant downside risks. perhaps immediate downside risk trinidad tobago stem market volatility future path u monetary policy. against backdrop, central bank’s outlook circumspect 2015. several factor support central bank’s 2015 outlook: • first, expect energy production return reasonable level next year, provide firm boost economic growth. this, course, dependent many factors. so far, bptt bgtt, two main gas producers, give indication major plan supply disruptions. we expect resolution on-going negotiation gas supply contracts. in addition, oil production appear stabilize drive petrotrin smaller, independent producers. • second, expect non-energy sector maintain respectable growth performance. with general election due 2015, construction activity likely remain strong even government slow heavy capital expenditure programme play critical path provide fiscal stimulus economy. this, combine project undertake private sector, expect boost non-energy activity. • third, guard 2015 outlook, result third business confidence survey, conduct central bank arthur lok jack graduate school business, point cautious optimism among local business community. just half respondent anticipate improvement local economy come year, 65 percent expect financial outlook improve next 12 months. business central trinidad tobago remain confident business economic outlook short-term. conclusion a i conclude, i know many leave today ½ percent growth economy number mind, project growth didn’t happen. what need contemplate walk this: big threat economy’s

governors, 50th seacen governors’ conference, port moresby, papua new guinea, 20 november 2014. * * * 1. asia fast grow economic region world engine global economic growth. but growth still dependent (i) external demand advance economy (ii) external capital direct investment. the region high save rate keep fund fiscal deficit many economy advance world. at time, region lack sufficient long term fund promote investment high economic growth. sustain high economic growth asian region require huge investment public private sectors. big infrastructure project likely demand high amount capital even capacity domestic market; resort international market always practical. this development regional capital market asia call for. 2. a regional capital market imply barrier movement capital provision investment service within geographic region. this imply domestic saver find suitable instrument save region investors/issuers invest raise capital country along domestic markets, know encounter broadly similar regulations, information, trade systems, settlement systems, account standard governance standard throughout region. while development regional capital market necessary promote investment economic growth asia, also instrumental strengthen domestic capital market provide liquidity, scale, capacity ultimately put asia position integrate global market. however, development capital market asia keep pace economic growth region relative region world. this lead asian investors’ continue dependence market advance economy mobilize long term capital. 3. develop regional capital market lead convergence risk adjust return financial asset similar maturity across region. further, help deepen domestic capital markets, increase competition, widen range instrument available save investments. these changes, turn, lead efficiency innovation provision service savers, investors, issuers. more innovation financial service extend range product attract wide range participants, lead great financial inclusion, big policy challenge current state financial development. 4. there substantial benefit derive regional integration capital markets. a regional capital market bring great portfolio risk diversification provide domestic individual institutional investor saver wide range investment opportunities. a saver diversify risk choose vary instruments, investor optional mix debt equity. besides, retail investor benefit cost reduce innovative provider compete business. cross border collective investment scheme able reach wide investor base, lead economy scale. increase competition bring innovation ensure investment product closely reflect need retail investors. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 5. individual country benefit efficient, liquid, broader, cheap capital markets. easier, cheap capital raise encourage company raise money investment public issues. more public issuance reduce reliance bank borrowing. more equity issuance develop corporate profile company diversify issuance. overall, integrate capital market mean good allocation capital, enhance portfolio diversification, efficient share risk low cost capital. 6. a regional capital market also bring substantial risks, ignored. with market integration, institution individual invest new market instrument across different countries. this increase possibility fast multiple contagion systemic risk. a evidence asian financial crisis 1997 global financial crisis 2008, integrate regional capital market, shock arise one economy could easily quickly transmit economy. capital market integration lead crisis even country sound fundamental even absence imperfection capital markets. if country become dependent foreign capital, sudden shift foreign capital flow create finance difficulty economic downturns. 7. the development regional capital markets- debt equity- contingent upon many factors. the depth debt market determine presence level transaction convertible currency denominate long term loan bond market level equity market determine nature volume issue secondary market convertible equity instruments. while low level asian financial market development contingent foreign exchange regulations, low regional market integration reflect poor cross border presence bank financial institutions. 8. along infrastructure development investment banks, cross border presence commercial bank also instrumental deepen regional capital market. cross border bank is, course, determine trade investment flows. trade foreign direct investment (fdi) asia – intra-regional international – grow 10 per cent, almost twice growth g-7 countries. but growth financial integration still limit home country bank business three fourth services. give intra-regional trade flow, trade finance imply great transaction bank opportunity, financial institution yet grab opportunity. a such, cross border presence transaction bank depend upon size capital volume transaction. further, regulatory supervisory issue along grow compliance requirement anti-money laundering, know customer (kyc) level home host authority coordination important determinant cross border bank presence particularly case branch banking. 9. asian region high saver world thus potential source capital market development supply side. the volume growth sovereign wealth fund public sector, provident pension funds, insurance corporate profit allocation funds, high save household level indicate flush fund available asian market investment long term instrument –both debt equity related. in demand side, asia require huge investment infrastructure project attain sustain high economic growth. such infrastructure project suffer equity debt finance challenges. equity finance link risk take saver want invest debt finance relate limitation bank financial institution invest long term. the bank flush fund also often reluctant perform term transformation role – convert short term save long term loans. cross border finance become even difficult restriction capital account transactions; reason domestic bank sometimes bi central bankers’ speech 3 flush investible fund time local project look long term debt finance services. a bank worry two aspect financial dealings: (i) currency mismatch transaction (ii) maturity mismatch balance sheet – short term deposit versus long term loans. address first issue relate currency convertibility cross border transaction second relate regulatory macroprudential norm along risk take capacity banks. policy maker think develop strong asian regional capital market ass situation depth. 10. various potential barriers, may relate regulations, taxation, monopoly, pose serious challenge towards capital market integration. regulatory barrier like exchange control restriction foreign list restrict movement capital towards efficient use. taxation barrier alter economic comparison different activity participant lead narrow market high costs. monopolistic structure like limitation total number stock exchange member prevent access particular part market, reduce competition, increase cost users. 11. also important fairness barrier information barriers. fairness barrier explicit discrimination foreigner perception discrimination exist deter enter market. likewise information barrier could exist significant difference account standard disclosure requirements, lack transparency trading, prevent nonlocals see state market. a multidimensional approach strong regional cooperation require overcome potential barrier move towards regional integration. effort direct towards harmonize rule practice address major difference laws, regulations, tax treatment prevent investor build regional portfolios. emphasis give convergence globally accept standard best practices, also facilitate easy global integration later. 12. a major challenge face asian nation towards develop regional capital market build necessary market infrastructures. establish link national clear payment systems, creation regional credit rat agency benchmark emphasize enhance depth liquidity capital markets. 13. one challenge asian capital market limitation bond market. currently, 80 per cent asian bond market contribute government bonds. corporate bond issue still limit company often incline bank loan finance resort issuance bonds. in future course time, government bond market expect saturate reason (i) public debt rise debt level allow government incur high deficit issue bond finance deficit, (ii) past fiscal profligacy subsequent macroeconomic imbalance asian country teach strong lesson incur high fiscal deficits. therefore, development asian capital market term bond concerned, need look corporate bond market also cross border level. again provision currency convertibility capital account would instrumental regard. 14. so far equity market concerned, many large economy asian region already able raise capital international market. further liberalization foreign exchange regime develop regional market would instrumental see capital could mobilize regional level. 4 bi central bankers’ speech 15. while develop regional capital market, asian region would help global financial stability three ways: (i) promote economic growth region support financial sector growth eventually avoid financial crisis recent past, (ii) retain save region within region avoid big vulnerability relate global capital outflows, inflow reversals, (iii) reduce load excess financial flow european american market prevent bank financial institution economy over-leveraging availability easy funds. 16. overall, development regional capital market asia remain slow compare pace economic growth. this also limit cross border presence bank financial institutions. a such, bank also play critical role capital market development term equity trade long term credit flow limit cross border presence. financial integration cross-border equity investment within asian region grow modest degree domestic bond market grow considerably country dominate government bonds. improve macroeconomic conditions, proper credit ratings, stable exchange rates, gradual capital account liberalization help attract foreign capital asian region’s domestic bond markets. however, limit secondary market opportunity bonds, investment bond distraction liquidity management perspective. on hand, volatile global market condition lead sudden withdrawal capital period heighten global uncertainty financial stress witness 2008 onwards, region’s policymakers require disposal broad array policy instrument maintain financial stability, domestic regional levels. 17. a global financial crisis 2008 shown, great financial integration – great risk cross-border contagion financial distress. a strong framework prudential regulation supervision thus necessary ensure risk arise integration assess manage well. move towards risk-based supervision, change prudential regulation supervisory oversight address cross-border activity would important step regard. 18. for successful integration, economic fundamental need remain strong. local market need properly regulate supervised. if market fundamental deteriorate, speculative attack occur capital outflow generate domestic foreign investors. the benefit integration would equally spread among country region. opportunity challenge exist type countries. it likely innovative efficient country successful new environment. the likely impacts, beneficial le beneficial, affect different country different ways. 19. finally, talk regional capital market, presence regional financial institution must. the recent initiative establishment asian infrastructure investment bank welcome step regard. equally important initiative high level capital account convertibility currency large economies. besides, financial liberalization arrangement cross border oversight supervisory function equally important. harmonization regulation regard aml/cft, kyc, taxation, use it system, statistical report prerequisite development integrate regional capital market. we, south east asian central bank (seacen) governors, collectively take initiative platform seacen. let u work together towards evolution regional financial market cater finance need asia’s vibrant economic growth. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 salvatore rossi: monetary policy independence central bank – experience european central bank global crisis speech mr salvatore rossi, senior deputy governor bank italy, university verona, university complex vicenza, vicenza, 19 november 2014. * * * 1. the independence central bank theory history1 we talk independence central bank almost time inception. in essay 1824 david ricardo accuse bank england, found century earlier, submit power executive.2 ricardo identify three pillar central bank independence: institutional separation power create money power spend it; ban monetary fund state budget; central bank’s obligation give account monetary policy. ricardo’s suggestion take brussels conference 1920, hold aegis league nation aim identify best policy counter economic financial crisis follow first world war. price stability indicate primary objective monetary policy – final report conference maintain – achieved, entrust central bank independent governments.3 these principle forget many year second world war. the conviction certain degree inflation necessary support employment growth come fore economic think mind policy makers. in many country monetary policy dominate budgetary requirement (fiscal dominance) central bank act buyer last resort government security come onto primary market.4 the independence central bank enjoy little institutional protection. the stagflation 1970s suddenly bring light farsighted economists, edmund phelps, already foresee previous decade:5 short term may trade-off inflation unemployment, long term. this radical rethink theory accompany profound change organization behaviour central banks. economic literature look price stability supreme value point two prerequisites: independence institution call guarantee it, i.e. central banks, adoption part explicit objectives. 1 this section base part salvatore rossi (2013), “post-crisis challenge central bank independence”, speech give lbma/lppm

speech the need central bank declare explicit objective, thus make difficult political authority change it, already mention article milton friedman 1962 entitled, significantly, “should independent monetary authority?”6 friedman ask “how else establish monetary system stable, free irresponsible governmental tinker incapable use source power threaten economic political freedom.” he count independent experts, although rule entrust wide power discretion, prefer fix rule assign precise task objective monetary policy. in 1970s robert lucas, thomas sargent others complicate picture: think sufficient assign task maintain price stability central bank; private agent rational expectations, therefore monetary policy must time consistent credible.7 a government always tempt exploit short-term trade-off growth inflation, without worry long-term costs. to avoid risk central bank really independent.8 numerous empirical check support theoretical assumptions.9 2. the european system central bank the maastricht treaty, sign 1992, draw new paradigm. article 127 current version treaty function european union, incorporate principle enshrine treaty maastricht, establish “the primary objective european system central bank (escb) … shall maintain price stability”.10 the govern council european central bank (ecb) late explain price stability understand inflation rate below, close to, 2 per cent medium term. instead independence affirm article 130, state “…neither european central bank, national central bank, member decision-making body shall seek take instruction union institutions, bodies, office agencies, government member state body. the union institutions, bodies, office agency government member state undertake respect principle seek influence member decision-making body european central bank national central bank performance tasks.” the treaty thus establish obligation monetary policy authorities, cannot bend political pressure, governments, cannot exercise it. 6 milton friedman (1962), “should there be independent monetary authority?”, leland b. yeager (ed.) in search monetary constitution, harvard university press, cambridge,

annali iv, giuffrè editore, milan. bi central bankers’ speech 3 it interest note treaty endorse proposal ricardo formulate almost two century earlier, provide legal basis three principle developed. the institutional separation public power create spend money establish article 128, state “the european central bank shall exclusive right authorize issue euro banknote within union.” monetary fund state prohibit article 123: “overdraft facility type credit facility … favour union institutions, bodies, office agencies, central governments, regional, local public authorities, body govern public law, public undertake member state shall prohibited, shall purchase directly … debt instruments.” lastly, article 284 oblige ecb send annual report european parliament, council commission.11 this report requirement, link clear mandate, mean monetary policy authority evaluate ex-post therefore accountable. so far look regulations. what substance? a questionnaire send end 1990s large number central banks, ask independence mean them. some 80 per cent reply question mention freedom central bank choose suitable instrument objectives;12 short, real operational independence. we surprised: say practice central bank art science.13 in field natural sciences, specific operational instrument follow quantitative analysis. monetary policy also make use models, cannot without qualitative evaluations. paul samuelson said, “i would rather bob solow econometric model, i’d rather bob solow econometric model bob solow without one.” the statute escb ecb permit use wide range instrument choose method monetary control consider appropriate.14 we know however real functional independence evaluate basis past experience: need check instrument available central bank, albeit numerous, fact insufficient address unexpected problem sure moment need emerge new instrument constraint operational autonomy. 3. the eurosystem global financial crisis the long period know great moderation, last

downward pressure price exerted. the crisis change everything. the exceptional monetary expansion require central banks, still haunt spectre error commit great depression 1930s, require unconventional policy measures: unlimited provision liquidity, purchase government private-sector security secondary market, currency swaps, forward guidance, much more. the effective functional independence

16 september 2002. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the sovereign debt crisis watershed. it make glaringly clear incompleteness european integration could compromise monetary policy, hind transmission country undermine central bank’s functional independence. this three principal reasons. first, sovereign debt crisis stir fear euro could break up. an eventuality judge probability zero now, international eyes, enter sphere possibility. the consequence, materialize mostly 2011, investors’ demand high premium government bond country southern europe. the lack fiscal union thus come fore, policy limp could see destabilize potential. second, result accentuate segmentation european financial market along national lines, mark brusque regression laborious process integration advance decade-and-a-half. the flow capital north south single currency area interrupted.19 third, engender correspond segmentation bank market. the bank whose balance sheet abound government security fire marketplace subject fear “sovereigns”.20 everyone know bank everywhere tend large portion asset home country’s government securities. at origin risk investor suddenly perceive also, country pressure, serious disequilibria build well global financial crisis. these weaknesses, vary extent country country, comprise excessive public private debt, poor competitiveness, dubious prospect economic growth, external imbalances. the single currency shroud markets’ judgment veil uniformity pierce sovereign debt crisis, reveal dissimilarity debtor countries. but must allow hide essentially systemic nature problem strike entire area. 4. what could ecb do? the ecb reacted. in may 2010 activate security market programme purchase public- private-sector security secondary market; purchase extend italian spanish security summer 2011. in december year two longer-term refinance operation announced, aim counter effect strain government security capital outflow wholesale fund bank several euro-area countries. in august 2012, amidst resurgent fear euro reversibility, ecb announce stand ready carry outright monetary transactions: secondary-market purchase government security issue country agree abide european programme financial assistance. to date, purchase made, relate act formally adopted, pending rule european court justice german constitutional court’s referral. but announcement alone enough calm markets. the effectiveness measure must underestimated. they lessen tension money capital market avert sharp contraction credit, thereby brake deterioration monetary policy transmission

principle, monetary measure macroeconomic stabilization produce loss profit central bank adopt them.22 but central bank make losses, reputation would endangered23 ability pursue objective could put

divide rather strengthen unite them. the second, far important, risk consist precisely incompleteness european construction. some call amendment treaty order expand ecb’s mandate.24 in particular, american example, urge objective price stability flank explicit objective equal status term unemployment employment levels; ecb allow purchase government security directly issue. naturally it’s me,

speech 5. point convergence divergence europe today when euro created, economy adopt mark difference divergences. on one hand group le advanced, rapidly growing, country high rate inflation, other, core economies, slow growth high level per caput income basically stable prices. italy already anomalous situation low growth combine high inflation. in first decade existence euro create condition virtuous, upward, convergence. the last six year crisis reverse trend, direction “bad equilibrium”. the euro area brink deflation. in october consumer price 0.4 per cent high average year earlier. low inflation widespread phenomenon: 2 country 18 inflation rate 1 per cent. the slowdown price raise real interest rates, discourage investment firm dampen demand credit; also increase burden debt service.31 a fall rate inflation verge deflation particularly serious repercussion euro area today: hind deleveraging country high public private debt; slow readjustment relative price various economies, accordingly recovery competitiveness elimination external imbalance necessary. these price trend partly unexpected. they determine volatile component (energy food) great extent weakness demand. they risk disanchoring long-term inflation expectations. already today expectation one two year ahead, measure swap contracts, 1 per cent; approach 2 per cent well past 2020. expectation five

meet business leaders, kochi, 4 december 2014. * * * introduction thank give opportunity exchange view people represent political, economic, financial arena kochi prefecture. i would like take opportunity express sincere gratitude cooperation activity bank japan’s kochi branch. in today’s speech, i begin focus economic financial development japan abroad, well bank’s recent monetary policy. i touch briefly economy kochi prefecture. follow speech, i would like hear view actual condition local economy bank’s conduct monetary policy. i. recent economic financial development japan abroad a. development world economy a see downward revision global growth projection international monetary fund october 2014 world economic outlook (weo), outlook economy generally cautious recently europe emerge economy (chart 1). international commodity prices, include crude oil prices, weak, mainly due concern global economic slowdown. a decline international commodity price tailwind consumer – i.e., advance economy – increase purchase power, could exert downward pressure commodity-exporting countries, mostly emerge economies. i monitor carefully fluctuation international commodity price affect formation distribution income around world, uncertain whether growth world economy strengthen, project october 2014 weo, consider much emerge economy contribute recent world economic growth. examine situation country region, u.s. economy continue recover steadily, lead mainly private demand, due expansion household spend reflect steady recovery employment. it expect gradually accelerate pace growth support virtuous cycle. a recent decline gasoline price also tailwind consumption. with economic outlook widely share public, market focus time monetary tighten – expect sometime 2015 – pace (chart 2). in europe, contrast, adjustment pressure mainly associate debt problem remain downtrend inflation rate observed. household business sentiment become cautious, manufacture germany – core country region – saw temporary drop summer, partly due economic deceleration russia. the german economy trend expect continue moderate recovery, support steady service industry, production manufacture sector le flat recently. however, uncertainty remain france italy, lag behind structural reforms: consequence debt problem development toward ensure soundness financial system warrant continue attention. it also seem necessary consider risk prolongation low inflation materialization deflation european economy (chart 3). to address risks, european central bank (ecb) implement additional monetary ease – include 2 bi central bankers’ speech introduction negative interest rate – june september 2014, also show commitment implement monetary ease measures, needed, govern council november. however, inflation rate euro area stop decline clearly since time. the ecb aggressive take measure address future risks, i would like keep close eye policy action effects. some emerge economies, russia brazil, experience stagflation drive decline international commodity price effect depreciation currency monetary tightening. difference remain condition among emerge economies. let touch china. in proceed structural reforms, authority seem value quality economic growth accept marginal decline growth rate. while downside risk economy, due partly weakness real estate prices, policy stance change continue address slowdown growth uphold economic activity implement small-scale economic packages. i understand monetary ease measure announce november 21 underline authorities’ commitment policy stance. from medium- long-term perspective, potential growth rate expect fall relatively sharply, reflect demographic situation, enough room rise; short-term perspective, least, economy generally follow stable growth path, albeit downside risk (chart 4). to sum up, world economy lead unite states, relatively steady recovery trend, risk slowdown observe europe emerge economies. however, interaction among economy worldwide strengthens, high possibility currently steady u.s. economy affect slowdown european emerge economy (chart 5). in part world, geopolitical risk mount recently, spread virus infection west africa consider new risk factor. b. development global financial market global financial market tie goldilocks situation summer 2014, investor search yield low volatility conditions. a outlook world economy become cautious, however, temporary heighten investors’ risk aversion overall increase market volatility observe early autumn. international commodity price declined, mention earlier, long-term interest rate fell reflection flight quality. such risk aversion wan recently, stock price firm globally, international commodity price remain weak. it difficult judge whether market movement simply reaction overheat see summer else imply spread cautious views, recent argument regard secular stagnation. interaction market movement also hard explain. however, one factor behind seem temporary unwind excessive optimism, light monetary tighten schedule conduct federal reserve, continue effect unwind international commodity markets. another factor seem market participants, particularly international commodity markets, aware risk slowdown european emerge economy could spread u.s. economy, lead world economic growth present. let add thing unwind i mentioned. market volatility rise, seem progress international financial regulatory reform effect (chart 6): implementation reforms, likely major market makers’ risk-taking activity restricted, lead decline market’s risk-absorbing capacity overall liquidity. such issue generally keep surface, central bank major country supply ample liquidity support market. however, market participant become aware bi central bankers’ speech 3 issue federal reserve begin convey information exit strategy public – is, specific measure regard raise policy interest rate reduce liquidity supply. a outlook, phase monetary tightening, effect market bring regulation might much stronger. indeed, regulation necessary order prevent large-scale financial crisis lehman shock happen again. at time, however, desirable maintain balance implement regulation excessively hind market participants’ risk-taking activity function market’s price formation mechanism. c. development japan’s economy with regard japan’s economy, weakness remain consumption durable good – include automobile – house investment, due mainly effect decline demand follow front-loaded increase prior consumption tax hike, weakness consumption, automobiles, impact production side recently. however, somewhat weak development export come halt, spread mini-scale inventory adjustment – mainly automobile – relate sector likely continue short term. furthermore, corporate profit favorable firm employment income situation continuing, mechanism economic recovery operate steadily; therefore, economy likely follow moderate recovery path effect include decline demand follow front-loaded increase dissipate gradually (chart 7). the economic outlook i mention may sound optimistic situation first preliminary estimate real gdp growth rate july-september quarter 2014 negative second consecutive quarter, coincident index within index business condition suggest possible change underlie trend. i admit current firm employment situation necessarily suggest future firmness economy, indicator employment lag indicators. in fact, number new job open ratio new job offer applicant – lead indicator employment – temporarily show sign peak toward summer firms’ stance employment seem become cautious, reflect somewhat prolong production adjustment manufacturing. nevertheless, past tankan survey (short-term economic survey enterprise japan) indicate sense labor shortage among firm around level observe since bubble period early stage 1990s, manufacturers’ business sentiment remain resilient, although japan’s production unfavorable (chart 8). the resilience business sentiment attribute part firms’ high consolidate profits, reflect favorable business performance overseas subsidiaries. firms’ favorable performance consolidate basis seem play complementary role recent weakness exports. this may mean new pattern generate income strengthening, repatriation japanese firm overseas subsidiaries’ profit form dividend (chart 9). although weakness certainly remain japan’s economic indicators, i feel necessary make comprehensive assessment, take account current globalization firms. risk factor outlook japan’s economy also warrant attention. the first factor development exports. japanese manufacturer likely continue shift production site overseas – although pace slow – amid uncertainty whether overseas economy steadily increase pace growth. therefore, uncertain whether recent depreciation yen support recovery exports. the second factor effect yen’s depreciation. while decline energy price raise real purchase power household firms, clearly exert positive effect japan’s economy, depreciation yen become downside factor term trade nonmanufacturing industry, account large share gdp drive force 4 bi central bankers’ speech current economic recovery. the third factor development household business sentiment. sentiment indicator – especially manufacture – resilient, despite weakness japan’s economic indicators; however, sentiment seem weakened, evidence fact development diffusion index (dis) late economy watcher survey become sluggish recently. development dis warrant attention index lead indicator economy short term. look comment make survey’s respondents, regard second round consumption tax hikes, irregular weather, depreciation yen stand out. the effect factor sentiment warrant attention. d. development price the year-on-year rate increase consumer price index (cpi, item exclude fresh food exclude direct effect consumption tax hike) around 1¼ percent almost year, since end-2013, despite depreciation yen, around 1 percent recently due effect decline international commodity prices, include crude oil prices. these development may partly attributable fact firms’ price-setting behavior affect prolong decline demand follow front-loaded increase prior consumption tax hike (chart 10). a outlook around first half 2015, assumption crude oil price foreign exchange rate le unchanged current level, year-on-year rate increase cpi could remain sluggish give reversal price rise occur first half 2014. i believe decline international commodity price imply decrease income transfer japan commodity-exporting countries, clearly positive factor japan’s economy also price longer-term perspective. a far supply-side statistic concerned, effect decline demand follow front-loaded increase almost dissipated, development likely positive influence firms’ price-setting behavior, become somewhat cautious decline demand. regard mechanism price rise longer-term perspective, bank focus production resource – namely, utilization labor capital – describe recently release outlook economic activity prices. in particular, recent labor shortage – tight labor resource – seem exert upward pressure wage whole, seem affect price considerable degree. on point, expect immediate future consumption pick reflection winter bonuses, likely firm, eventually positive effect prices. what important sustainable economic recovery price stability wage increase line growth labor productivity; furthermore, longer-term perspective, increase rely firms’ stance toward business fix investment. it consider japan’s economy continue critical point term whether (1) improve labor productivity leverage tight labor market condition drive force stimulate investment aim labor saving, (2) fail significantly improve labor productivity due firms’ passive stance toward fix investment, thereby make wage increase unsustainable. a firms’ stance toward fix investment, i would like add that, although investment continue make mainly replacement maintenance, encourage positive action observe investment promote rationalization labor saving, product upgrade (chart 11). reflect recent development foreign exchange market, firm begin review balance domestic overseas production. firms’ decision production network strategy directly affect short-term factor exchange rate movements, base longer-term outlook. it therefore unlikely start shift production back bi central bankers’ speech 5 japan immediately response recent market developments. however, decision may change firm review medium- long-term outlook exchange rate, result gain confidence yen appreciate extremely high level see past. ii. monetary policy immediate future a. expansion quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) at monetary policy meet hold october 31, 2014, policy board decide expand qqe. a i cast dissent vote decision, i may delicate position talk policy change. i therefore provide view best possible extent. first all, i judge additional monetary ease necessary. this because, view, virtuous cycle economic activity price basically maintained, i mentioned. for time being, year-on-year rate increase core cpi range around 1 percent slightly 1 percent, effect decline energy price outweigh effect yen’s depreciation. this may suggest achievement 2 percent price stability target seem somewhat far away. in view, bank’s decision additional monetary ease aim offer kind insurance downside risk prices. to sure, i consider underlie trend price important monthly fluctuation price indicators. in regard, decline international commodity prices, recent decline crude oil prices, surely exert downward pressure core cpi. on hand, i mention earlier, somewhat longer-term perspective clearly positive effect japan’s economy reduce income transfers. in assess degree achievement price stability target, important focus monthly fluctuation specific indicator examine wide range indicator forward-looking manner. for example, important examine whether various economic entity firm household fact form business plan adapt behavior toward consumption base assumption around 2 percent inflation. more generally, important examine whether people’s medium- long-term inflation expectation – which, deflation last 15 years, say consistently remain low unite state – project re-anchored around 2 percent, comparable level unite state (chart 12). it noted, however, medium- long-term inflation expectation tie specific economic indicators, thus difficult measure. it might possible retroactively acknowledge development expectation change intercept phillips curve. however, one careful assess real-time measurement – even do – estimation bias take consideration. after all, seem whether people’s medium- long-term inflation expectation change change judge qualitatively by, example, behavioral pattern various economic entities. in regard, let give example wage negotiation fiscal year. many firm raise base pay first time since lehman shock. this attribute government’s initiative realize wage increases, set three-way discussion among government, employers, labor unions, also effort employer labor unions. specifically, economic condition changed, see rise inflation rate, side give renew attention ultimate goal achieve wage increase line price increase – almost forget deflation – reflected, albeit partly, actual wage increases. in light this, qqe assess exert certain effects. obviously, ask whether wage increase observe thus far enough re-anchor people’s medium- long-term inflation expectation 2 percent, i would say 6 bi central bankers’ speech halfway there. however, development price past fiscal year outlook price somewhat take consideration wage negotiation management labor union toward next fiscal year, thereby realize rise base pay two consecutive years, turn lead great breakthrough change people’s fix idea wages, base salary particular, rise deflation – words, deflationary expectations. i therefore carefully monitor development wage negotiation toward next fiscal year. my understand truly essential achieve price stability target rise productivity effort various entity carry structural reform resultant increase potential growth rate japan’s economy. on basis, inflation rate would increase moderately wage would continuously improve line increase productivity, consequently people would enjoy benefit overcome deflation. b. effect qqe second, attention need pay diminish marginal effect bring expansion qqe. interest rate expect decline owe expansion; however, consider nominal interest rate already historical low level real interest rate substantially negative, judge marginal upward pressure ease economic activity price large. moreover, effect qqe increase cumulative manner progress asset purchase bank. these effect become clearly evident front back end yield curve, expect strengthen progress make purchases. there seem insufficient need bank accelerate development process expand qqe, consider accompany cost benefits. now, i would like touch effect qqe interest rates. the bank commit purchase japanese government bond (jgbs) annual pace 80 trillion yen net basis – amount substantially exceed plan amount newly issue jgbs government. for large amount, bank consequently directly indirectly reduce amount outstanding jgbs markets. partly due financial regulations, many institutional investor hold jgbs compel reason good alternative, therefore preference jgbs strong. if bank conduct asset purchase form decrease net amount outstanding investors’ hold jgbs, effect – term price formation market – strengthen bank’s purchase continue. that is, tendency price jgbs rise interest rate decline. in japan’s money markets, effect asset purchase become clearly evident interest rate formation frequently observe negative territory. regard formation, arbitrage market rate interest rate 10 basis point apply complementary deposit facility work, market rate decline significantly negative territory, unlike situation ecb, impose negative interest rate excess reserves. however, necessary carefully monitor whether interest rate formation market create kind distortion economic activity lead accumulation financial imbalances, whether formation unexpectedly affect deposit rate well broadly-defined settlement system, include money market fund money reserve funds. c. the time frame continue qqe third, bank commit continue newly expand qqe open-ended manner, aim achieve price stability target long necessary maintain target stable manner. i view price stability target flexible concept allowance certain range upward downward deviation actual inflation rate target. therefore, i propose bi central bankers’ speech 7 “as long necessary maintain target stable manner” – word time frame public statement – assess flexible target base forecasts. some may point flexible target lack transparency conduct monetary policy. i believe expansion ease time decide primarily bank commit outcome – is, achieve price stability target 2 percent – base recognition. central bank major economy similarly experience tradeoff transparency flexibility policy, even central bank try improve transparency, policy conduct base simple rule actually easy accomplish. it seem important lesson draw case federal reserve bank england, abandon rule base economic indicator decide policy change return comprehensive assessment. a rule-based monetary policy seem easy conduct first, various issue arise process, i therefore position monetary policy conduct treat flexibly consider future economic price conditions. price reflect state economy variable directly operate central bank. generally speaking, channel effect central bank’s policy spread price consider decline interest rates, via foreign exchange rate asset price – indirect channels. on point, surgical precision regard aim specific inflation rate within specific time frame seem unreasonable, aim cannot achieved, central bank may expose risk credibility undermined. d. importance fiscal consolidation lastly, i would like touch importance fiscal consolidation, view postponement second round consumption tax hikes. a mention earlier, bank conduct purchase jgbs amount significantly exceed newly issue jgbs government work raise people’s medium- long-term inflation expectations. however, final outcome depend commitment fiscal consolidation government. furthermore, whether commitment fulfil judge neither government bank, markets. if concern government’s commitment heighten markets, effect materialize form expansion risk premium jgb market; however, bank’s prescription response limit (chart 13). from longer-term perspective, future process find exit qqe, government’s effort toward fiscal consolidation indeed important bank term smoothly start toward exit. on point, coordination fiscal austerity policy monetary policy consequently establish unite states, long-term interest rate low level trend relative level see time federal reserve begin convey information exit strategy public. a i mention earlier, decline trend level long-term interest rate major economy due fiscal austerity policy, may also affect argument regard secular stagnation, assessment u.s. experience make caution. on point coordination fiscal monetary policies, seem lesson learned. conclude remarks: economic activity kochi prefecture my conclude remark touch economy kochi prefecture. in term gross prefectural production, feature industrial structure kochi prefecture share manufacture prefecture small 8 bi central bankers’ speech country overall, share nonmanufacturing, construction service industries, relatively large. the prefecture’s economy therefore support domestic demand rather exports. thus, stagnant prolong period economic recovery phase japan 2000s, lead export industries. since 2013, however, country’s economy whole, prefecture’s economy continue improve – lead domestic demand, particularly public investment – albeit difference degree momentum pace improvement. regard recent developments, recovery sale disturb considerable loss – mainly retail, tourism, agriculture industry – incur irregular weather summer autumn. however, employment income situation, underpin private consumption, stay improve trend, business sentiment solid, moderate recovery trend prefecture seem maintain (chart 14). nevertheless, longer-term perspective, concern market shrinkage labor shortage kochi prefecture, confront structural issue low birth rate age population, well decline population. these issue – exacerbate prolong economic stagnation – arise prefecture ten year early rest country. in addition, momentous issue implementation measure preparation massive nankai trough earthquake tsunami, assume would extensive damage. however, encourage effort make various quarter toward tackle issues. for example, kochi prefecture proceed second industrial development project, private public sector make joint effort toward industrial development wide range areas. the specific effort include following: (1) strengthen local production local consumption external sales; (2) strengthen primary industry promote senary, sixth-order industry; (3) nurture new industries, relate disaster prevention new energy sources; (4) promote tourism industry intent encourage tourist visit prefecture overseas. i greatly impress strategy, aim generate sustainable development industry prefecture brand kochi-ke, “the kochi family,” work facilitate manufacture primary industry promote external sale prefecture overseas markets, amid concern age decline population. kochi prefecture produce many great historical figures, include patriot samurai close day tokugawa shogunate, i hear region enterprising spirit rooted. i hope economic activity kochi prefecture become active aggressive bold cooperative effort among industry, government, academia, financial institutions. bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 12 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 13 14 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 15 16 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 per jansson: swedish monetary policy financial crisis – myth fact speech mr per jansson, deputy governor sverige riksbank, svd bank summit 2014, stockholm, 3 december 2014. * * * “the riksbank recent year conduct monetary policy experiment aggressively, use high repo rate, attempt prevent household debt rising. the result le devastate swedish economy. eventually, riksbank realise policy wrong make 180 degree turn.” this roughly critic describe monetary policy conduct recent years. this description receive quite bite attention widely spread, many follow monetary policy debate probably gain impression actually happened. i argue description wrong i intend explain why. i shall divide criticism three different parts, claims, discus one one. i present claim form quotations, necessarily mean exact quotations. however, capture spirit criticism i believe follow monetary policy debate recognise them. it important meet criticism, several reason one question one might begin with, important respond claims. it natural part economic debate riksbank criticised, isn’t it? wouldn’t good ignore criticism look ahead instead? no, i don’t think so. one important reason wake financial crisis discussion activity task central banks, central bank it. it is, course, important debate sweden anchor reality base monetary policy actually conduct actually achieved. but meet criticism important discussion sweden. the debate swedish monetary policy also international interest follow abroad, least central banks.1 the reason central issue international discussion extent central banks’ policy rate use complement macroprudential policy, counteract build-up financial imbalances, instance, try prevent lend house price rise quickly.2 this often call policy “leaning wind”, i hereafter use expression sake simplicity. monetary policy sweden context regard particularly interesting, riksbank one central bank that, least far, explicit take consideration account policy-rate decisions. it would course unfortunate continue international discussion conclusion swedish experience policy lean wind attempt practice, lead poor, even catastrophic, result. because case. 1 see, example, visco (2014) yellen (2014). 2 see, example, blanchard, dell’ariccia mauro (2013), borio (2014), carney (2013), smets (2013), stein (2013) woodford (2012). 2 bi central bankers’ speech before i continue, i would like make clear purpose today justify every single decision riksbank made. it natural different observer make different assessment regard economic development thus reach slightly different conclusion regard exact policy conducted. with hindsight, clear monetary policy could somewhat expansionary know inflation would low now. this natural unavoidable consequence fact monetary policy base forecasts, uncertain. however, recent criticism go far beyond discuss type difference assessments. instead, claim policy conduct riksbank wrong fundamental level. this type criticism i intend focus here. “the riksbank aggressively, use high repo rate, try prevent household debt rising” the first part criticism turn divide different parts. for one thing, claim riksbank lean wind aggressively, another thing household debt main, only, reason policy. i intend comment point one one. so much riksbank practice lean wind recent years? my view clear. the monetary policy conduct crisis part govern traditional monetary policy motives, is, expect development economic activity inflation come years. give consideration risk associate development household debt house price part assessment, relatively minor part. the picture paint criticism quite different. here start point instead riksbank’s concern development household debt main motive raise repo rate financial crisis. much criticism even seem assume household debt motive raise repo rate. in so-called counterfactual analysis play central role criticism, actual policy conduct compare alternative raise repo rate all, leave unchanged 0.25 per cent since crisis.3 the latter assume represent policy lean wind. the riksbank economic analyst make similar forecast so support i view concern household debt limit influence repo-rate decisions? to begin with, one look riksbank’s motif state press release follow monetary policy meetings. if one this, pretty clear focus economic activity inflation come years. certainly, often mention time policy conduct expect contribute le risk imbalance build regard indebtedness house prices, side-effect main reason. the overall impression policy would marginally different risk address – would completely different. one also look discussion conduct within riksbank. it well-known fact differ opinion within riksbank, different they? the situation july 2011 example. the repo rate raise 2 per cent, high level reach reduce again. the minute monetary policy meet show executive board members’ view appropriate monetary policy year ahead. in figure 1, dot blue line show future repo-rate path 3 see, example, svensson (2014). this counterfactual analysis present number essays, article blog entries. bi central bankers’ speech 3 advocate majority executive board members, dot yellow line show path advocate two member argue monetary policy expansionary. one these, lars svensson, riksbank’s outspoken critic recent time also originator counterfactual analysis i mention earlier. it clear opinion differed. but also clear difference concern pace repo rate raise member advocate repo rate never raise crisis, remain 0.25 per cent. of course, would difficult time advocate large cut immediately near future. but one really think repo rate 0.25 per cent, difficult understand one would advocate repo-rate path turn come three years, rise throughout entire forecast period reach 3.8 per cent middle 2014.4 so view outside riksbank? at around time, june 2011, national institute economic research forecast repo rate would 3 per cent end 2012 end 2014 – is, around – would 4 per cent.5 the nier’s forecast often something benchmark analyst occasion, too, good reflection analyst perceive situation. the forecast repo rate also fairly well line riksbank’s view (see figure 2). this policy consider compatible balance resource utilisation 2014 cpif inflation rate close 2 per cent 2013–2015. it thus obvious picture policy essentially govern traditional monetary policy motif concern household debt certainly play major role. how international analyst view swedish economy point time? the oecd’s economic outlook may 2011 expect robust growth continue, increase real gdp average 3.3 per cent 2010–2015. it expect policy rate would need raise gradually economic activity improved.6 a similar assessment make international monetary fund (imf) july 2011. gdp growth assume gradually decline 3 per cent 2014, inflation expect amount 2 per cent (measured term hicp). it assume interest-rate increase begin would need continue.7 one conclusion i draw many unexpected event occur recent years. the situation today rather different analyst – executive board riksbank outside bank – expect time. i shall return later. another conclusion general picture riksbank’s policy whole well-motivated essentially base traditional monetary policy deliberations. although different opinion exactly high repo rate be, always are, policy thus perceive odd conspicuous. neither riksbank analyst perceive monetary policy conduct lean wind large extent, general impression definitely repo rate leave level cut financial crisis, is, 0.25 per cent. 4 in minutes, lars svensson present estimate dot yellow repo-rate path assume give inflation rate 2 per cent begin 2013 onwards unemployment rate would reach assume equilibrium level 5.5 per cent begin 2014. it may also worth note ensue meeting, september 2011, executive board member think 2 per cent suitable level repo rate, give economic situation sweden. 5 national institute economic research (2011). 6 oecd (2011), pp. 191–192. 7 imf (2011), p. 25 table 9. 4 bi central bankers’ speech a strange assumption give this, strange claim evaluation riksbank’s policy rely assumption alternative lean wind would hold repo rate 0.25 today. if one perceive time, appear strange paint picture retrospectively. base analysis assumption therefore reasonable way evaluate advantage disadvantage lean wind. one need assume riksbank lie motives, also well-known prominent external economic analyst say one thing really mean another. nevertheless, start point counterfactual analysis many appear rely draw conclusion riksbank’s monetary policy.8 in sweden, analysis give considerable scope, instance dagens nyheter newspaper’s editorial pages, riksbank’s policy describe le incomprehensible contrary prevail opinion time – ”interest-rate increase experiment summer 2010”.9 one might think strange claim riksbank’s repo-rate increase lean wind, moreover increase make contrary prevail opinion, become widely spread. after all, one need make in-depth check fact i provide see neither claim correct. it doesn’t require much dig able conclude riksbank also external domestic international economic analyst find natural, even repo rate raise 2 per cent, increase would continue – without particular reference household debt. accord to, instance, dagens nyheter newspaper’s editorial pages, policy instead “an interest-rate increase experiment”, base riksbank governor spread “misleading picture future”.10 the explanation i think claim nevertheless repeat refer often uncritically, people simply assume must true express emphasis intensity. a hazardous policy but claim lean wind mislead description policy conduct motif behind it. there also good reason wonder whether policy whereby repo rate remain unchanged since crisis might rather risky, regardless one claim would represented. accord counterfactual analysis, gain problems: inflation would close target employment would high repo rate raised. but i also believe would major risk other, le pleasant thing happen disregard analysis, consciously unconsciously. 8 see, instance, visco (2014): “an actual example debate macro-prudential use policy rate relate tighten monetary policy sverige riksbank begin july 2010 peak july 2011. deem leaning-against-the-wind move concern financial stability, specifically risk maintain low repo rate could increase already high ratio household debt disposable income, policy stance question basis counterfactual analysis emphasise macroeconomic cost term below-target inflation high unemployment.” another example financial time (2014): “sweden’s central bank lambast critic try use interest rate combat sign house bubble. it lift rate 2010 2011 publicly worry saw high household debt levels.” a example münchau (2014), say riksbank “raised interest rate rein domestic house bubble.” 9 wolodarski (2014). 10 wolodarski (2014). bi central bankers’ speech 5 something receive considerable attention since crisis lot thing happen regard expectation risk-taking economy interest rate low long period time. expectation regarding, instance, high interest rate future house market develop year come become distorted, risk-taking economy general could increase way may create problems.11 this something cannot capture good way economic model available today.12 but excuse completely disregard aspects. in alternative path assume represent policy lean wind, repo rate would close zero since july 2009, is, five years. this economy begin recover crisis quickly temperature house market cool temporarily. we see today, repo rate cut low levels, house price begin anew soar (see figure 3).13 lend household increase almost 10 per cent year repo rate increase begin july 2010 (see figure 4). and lend begin rise repo rate cut. another important element framework macroprudential policy time repo rate, accord alternative, 0.25 per cent. it august 2013 allocation responsibility macroprudential policy clarify swedish government set formal guideline this.14 a yet, remain see well framework actually work practice. give this, advocate repo rate 0.25 per cent five year entirely disregard risk distort expectation problem development house price quite remarkable. have policy implemented, i believe situation today would much worry – know, situation today hardly without problems. two relevant question before i continue i would like take two question natural ask context. a i noted, repo-rate decision mainly govern traditional monetary policy motives, consideration risk associate development household debt house price play fairly subordinate role. but exactly i mean “a fairly subordinate role”? that first question. 11 summer (2014) writes, instance: “[a] strategy rely interest rate significantly growth rate long period time virtually guarantee emergence substantial bubble dangerous build-ups leverage.” for review link monetary policy financial imbalances, well reference literature, see adrian lang (2014). 12 this discussed, instance, blanchard (2014). one problem counterfactual estimate economic policy change lot sensitive know lucas critique. this state difficult quantify effect completely different policy (for instance, much low interest rate long period time) reliable manner. the reason precisely expectation economic agent change. 13 remarkably, excessively low repo rate something dagens nyheter’s editorial page warn december 2009, lars svensson enter reservation hold repo rate 0.25 per cent advocate cut zero comment “input executive board riksbank reminiscent captain slavishly follow nautical chart, even ship hit iceberg. it one thing cut repo rate acute situation crisis ward depression. but economy begin recover, zero interest rate would add fuel house price fire.” (see wolodarski, 2009). 14 of course, measure take earlier, introduction framework must nevertheless regard important condition able conduct macroprudential policy systematically. 6 bi central bankers’ speech unfortunately, i believe one must accept cannot quantify precise way. i note part i find development household debt house market problematic, i would advocate somewhat expansionary policy – definitely repo rate remain 0.25 ever since crisis. but difficult precise this. for example, possible argue give monetary policy meet “of 25 basis point i feel repo rate raised, 5 point aim dampen risk link household debt house prices. the remain 20 basis point aim stabilise inflation economic activity short run”. monetary policy decision-making work like this. moreover, executive board consist six individuals. each likely view role risk link debt house price play decisions. it therefore possible respond question much riksbank lean wind quantify measure. but i quite convince none decide repo rate main reason, much le reason, monetary policy must lean wind. the second question whether policy lean wind tangible effect, give consideration risk link development household debt house prices, i said, play fairly subordinate role policy-making. i convince policy play important role, despite element lean wind much modest critic claim. the riksbank’s strategy combine marginally high repo rate communication emphasis fact perceive development high growth credit rise house price worrying. the slightly high repo rate effect itself, perhaps main function concrete reminder risks, thereby important part communication. in opinion, impact, least increase general awareness problems. the discussion question go underline case. more extensive problem indebtedness after thus respond first part first claim – riksbank lean aggressively wind – i intend move second part, namely purpose policy lean wind limit household debt. a i point out, element lean wind particularly large, extent. however, easy say aim get household borrow less, sometimes portrayed, riksbank target high debt may become relation income, example. even though development household debt definitely important part problem, picture much complex. a fair description riksbank try bite slow trend house price indebtedness rise rapidly simultaneously quite long time – appear slowdown period weak economic activity, direction upwards, matter economic situation, sign trend dampened. the long trend continues, great risk break abrupt way many country connection financial crisis – is, house price debt finally adjust downwards, dramatic manner, substantial price fall drop consumption, large long-lasting negative effect economy.15 in general, solid empirical support idea household 15 mian sufi (2014) describe sequence event u economy connection crisis. in really bad scenario, problem may also arise regard financial stability, see instance financial stability report 2014:1, sverige riksbank. bi central bankers’ speech 7 company borrow economic upturn, great risk upturn follow deep recession slow recovery.16 one make reflection here. one macroeconomic instability result type development could make difficult riksbank stabilise economic activity inflation sustainable manner. it therefore hardly remarkable riksbank try counteract it, difficult see something outside mandate, claimed. another reflection that, problem trend rise household debt house price affect many part economy, necessary several policy area cooperate able achieve last solution. regardless measure taken, neither monetary policy lean wind macroprudential policy sufficient – probably even two combined. other policy areas, especially house policy, need include equation. this something riksbank highlight discuss occasion i intend discus here.17 a third reflection come risk development type, critic clear, view. at time put lot effort criticise riksbank’s policy, often say little view potential risk managed.18 a common argument been, simplify somewhat: “firstly, risk probably aren’t great, risk always manage effectively macroprudential policy.” here i think one ought able demand great clarity critics. do think problem kind upward trend? or trend slow problem arise, and, so, mechanism achieve this? if slow level debt house price elevated, risk entail? be fact house price lend begin accelerate riksbank cut repo rate nothing worry about? if nevertheless risks, managed? if macroprudential policy effective, exactly measure implemented? and dosage appropriate? be macroprudential policy measure enough, policy area also need involved? these question relevant one i wish give much attention debate riksbank’s monetary policy. “the result policy devastate swedish economy” the picture critic like paint high repo rate push demand create le deflationist situation swedish economy. this something international analyst particular seem latch onto, interpret situation sweden today similar japan 1990s.19 16 see, instance, schularick taylor (2012) jordà, schularick taylor (2013). 17 see, example, jansson (2014). 18 in cases, critic also diametrically oppose views. paul krugman appear think sweden probably already house bubble time, late anything it, riksbank conduct policy lean wind (see andrén meiton, 2014). lars svensson, hand, appear think great risk house bubble build (see svenska dagbladet newspaper, 2014a) policy lean wind reason needed, harmful. 19 see, instance, krugman (2014a, 2014b) well liken sweden japan, also characterise monetary policy sweden example ”sadomonetarism”. among swedish critic le common make comparison japan. 8 bi central bankers’ speech it already clear i discuss far mislead description. a monetary policy lean wind great extent, hardly particularly devastate effect economy. with rather wear time tell likeness, riksbank period hit repo-rate brake, rather ease accelerator somewhat. no deflationist development drive weak real economy this picture confirm one examine how, instance, gdp employment develop since crisis. figure 5 summarise percentage change gdp per caput employment rate relation pre-crisis figure country sweden normally compare with. a seen, sweden right top, far it. there countries, accord statistic new zealand germany, good development gdp employment, is, right sweden figure. some claim development unemployment le favourable. but must bear mind fact labour force sweden increase relatively substantially period. this essentially positive, short run also contribute, purely mathematically, keep unemployment figures. the difference respect relation unite states, instance, fairly striking. the unite state favourable development unemployment, quite lot explain fact labour force participation state actually decline (see figure 6). of course, relatively good development solely due monetary policy conduct riksbank. economic policy general play large role, fact sweden hit hard crisis, reason necessarily relate policy conducted. it also possible different view regard exactly good one think development been. but minimum, clear difficult find support actual figure overly tight, “aggressive” monetary policy send economy state deflation, drive poor development real economy. if one look ahead, then? could case swedish economy manage fairly well far, thing go badly future, result policy conducted? of course, one cannot make guarantee regard future, one case note national institute economic research, ministry finance riksbank currently forecast growth around 2 per cent year around 3 per cent 2015–2016. this hardly picture economy state recession crisis. low inflation difficult predict – riksbank others but inflation? it become low price even fall times, least measure term cpi. be sign policy fail repo rate never raised? it important understand two thing here. firstly, clear i describe low inflation result economy bring knees. the picture high interest rate cause le recession-like state turn result low inflation, sometimes deflation, thus incorrect. secondly, i also mentioned, lot happen recent year effect inflation. remember national institute economic research’s forecast middle 2011, i mention earlier. in this, repo rate expect continue rise, 2 per cent level then, around 4 per cent 2014. this policy consider compatible inflation rate around 2 per cent 2013–2015. the reason i bi central bankers’ speech 9 return forecast i don’t think anyone would question national institute economic research serious competent forecaster – scarcely accuse deliberately spread “misleading picture future”. and i said, national institute economic research’s forecast way unique, reflect well forecaster general view situation. anyone claim predict current low inflation back repo rate increase begin 2010 must thus much great insight swedish international analysts. i would rather argue instead good illustration fact thing happen economy, could predict push inflation unexpected manner. unexpected international economic slowdown 2011 even low inflation 2013–2014 i would like give example two occasion recent year development turn rather differently expected. the first slowdown international economic activity become apparent second half 2011. global growth prospect deteriorate connection increase unease sovereign debt problem unite state euro area. uncertainty future lead increase pessimism among household company also affect financial markets. towards end year, clear sign growth swedish economy also slow down, partly due reduce demand swedish exports. figure 7 show riksbank analyst revise forecast increase swedish export 2012 second half 2011. the second occasion inflation begin fall already low level latter part 2013 begin 2014. this happen connection sequence negative inflation surprise indicate underlie inflationary pressure economy fallen. for example, inflation appear unusually low time relation increase unit labour cost (see figure 8). even that, inflation low expected, recently september year. figure 9 show forecast cpif inflation 2014 revise 1 per cent around 0.5 per cent. it clear example general picture changed, riksbank suddenly realise something everyone else know long time. the fact inflation surprisingly low way specific swedish problem, much international phenomenon. “eventually, riksbank realise policy wrong make 180-degree turn.” the last part criticism riksbank rather late day realise wrong time therefore make 180-degree turn. i indirectly answer part well. let me, able make point i wish make, describe i view way riksbank conduct monetary policy. in way conventional flexible inflation-targeting framework situation need find balance stabilise inflation stabilise economic activity, one may sometimes also need take various risk account deliberation. the risk riksbank include extent thus rapid persistent rise house price debt could cause setback late potentially lead major problem development economy general monetary policy. 10 bi central bankers’ speech lean wind question degree – either but important realise question achieve balance. allow risk nature influence policy-rate decision mean neglect traditional monetary policy objectives. for one thing, purpose try manage risk stabilise inflation economic activity sustainable manner, avoiding, least alleviating, dramatic downward adjustment house price indebtedness. but inflation economic activity short run – normal forecast period – also play major role decisions. a monetary policy lean wind thus, like economic policies, question degrees. it case – one might sometimes believe debate – one either refrain entirely lean wind lean wind one hundred per cent disregard everything else. it thus 0–1 variable. a i explained, riksbank’s policy recent year time support recovery get inflation rise towards target, extent address risk may threat sustainability. when thing happen economy, balance course affected. a i mention earlier, inflation time low riksbank analyst expected, undershoot target fairly long time. moreover, long-term inflation expectation fallen. although tenth percentage target 2 per cent, trend downward time (see figure 10). a basis inflation-targeting policy long-run inflation expectation anchor around target, development make even important prioritise bring inflation. in words, cost take risk account hold repo rate little high increased. it light riksbank’s gradual cut repo rate zero regarded. it thus question adapt monetary policy change circumstance 180-degree turn result sudden insight policy conduct wrong start. criticism also quarter however, cut repo rate zero criticise “last-minute conversion”. it also criticise quarters. there say riksbank’s attempt give consideration risk link indebtedness house price well-founded, low interest rate long period time risky – like “throwing petrol fire”.20 without doubt, situation regard house market household debt become problematic low repo rate long remain low. nevertheless, i think riksbank make right decision really alternative. in end, central bank’s main task maintain confidence price stability risk fail – scale start tip – possibility give top priority fast return inflation target. even risk link debt house price large before, even increase result repo-rate cuts, problem link low inflation become relatively important. however, unavoidably case place great responsibility public authority policy area regard manage development household debt house prices. i consider important note also criticism quarter – counterweight opinion principle everything riksbank do recent 20 see, instance, malmqvist (2014), svenska dagbladet (2014b, 2014c) mitelman (2014). bi central bankers’ speech 11 years, particular lean wind, wrong, unjustified harmful. my important message let conclude summarise main messages. the purpose review point flaw several notion monetary policy sweden conduct recent year result been. one thing i hope i make clear reasonable regard difference repo rate actually recent year fictitious interest-rate development 0.25 per cent since july 2009 measure much riksbank lean wind. this rather odd reconstruction event. nevertheless, much criticism base assumption, instance, claim riksbank’s policy lean wind crisis cost 60,000 jobs. a i shown, general view among forecaster time repo rate raise 2 per cent would necessary continue raise repo rate – traditional monetary policy reasons. the increase 0.25 2 per cent thus perceive particularly remarkable purely justify concern household debt. i also hope i convince low inflation rate sweden today reflect economy develop poorly since crisis result misguided, tight monetary policy. on contrary, swedish economy develop relatively well definitely state deflation drive weak real economy. the main focus monetary policy conduct crisis support recovery bring inflation back towards target. give consideration risk link development household debt house price part assessment play major role. the fact inflation low large degree, always, reflection event course time difficult predict. example slowdown international economic activity become evident second half 2011 fall inflation end 2013 begin 2014. it easy verify event difficult predict – merely something everyone riksbank aware advance – examine forecaster general view development time. thus, i think quite clear current low inflation logical predictable consequence repo rate hold 0.25 per cent crisis. a i mention start, international debate extent central banks’ policy rate use complement macroprudential measure try prevent lend house price rise quickly, generally counteract build-up financial imbalances. this important discussion would unfortunate critics’ alarmist incorrect conclusion regard swedish experiences, roughly summarise ”don’t try home – may burn house”, regard truth debate. it important monetary policy evaluated. but one condition draw right conclusion evaluation base correct description actually happened. the recent criticism has, opinion, become alienate actual events. 12 bi central bankers’ speech reference adrian, tobias liang, nellie (2014), monetary policy, financial conditions, financial stability. federal reserve bank

these effort early stage elaboration departure recent practice. here learn financial authority country recent experience deploy broad array macroprudential tools. the classic case time-varying broad

recognize fact cyclical systemic risk build financial intermediary robust expansions, risk also easily obscure buoyant environment. note, however, approach specify severely adverse scenario design avoid add source procyclicality financial system, design explicitly offset exist procyclical tendencies. the purpose stress-test scenario make sure bank properly capitalize withstand severe economic financial conditions, serve explicit countercyclical offset financial system. bi central bankers’ speech 5 also surface sectors, corporate lend boom confront korea mid-to-late 1990s. in addition time-varying broad macroprudential tools, countercyclical capital buff dynamic provisioning, many financial authority authority promulgate rule target activity specific sector. for instance, swiss authority activated, early 2013, countercyclical capital buff add 1percentage point capital requirement direct indirect mortgage-backed position secure swiss residential property, increase amount 2014 2 percentage points. time-varying lending-side tool in unite states, limit set authority federal reserve could exercise either jointly bank agency address sector-specific risks. most commonly, see leverage lending, bank regulator act together use tool supervisory guidance intensive supervision discourage bank take additional risk safety soundness grounds. moreover, annual supervisory stress test tailor increase severity loss specific portfolio loan market shock. however, authority fall short direct restriction activity particular sector. such supervisory action usually flow microprudential concern safety soundness individual institution rather macroprudential concern stability entire system. by contrast, section 165 dodd-frank act provide federal reserve could restrict activity bank asset great $50 billion nonbank systemically important financial institution (sifis) designate fsoc “to prevent mitigate risk financial stability unite states”, thus provide potential macroprudential authority. in addition, federal reserve authority security exchange act 1934 set initial variation margin requirement repurchase agreement security finance transactions, apply across financial system. this authority use curb perceive excess equity market mid-1970s see limit success, use manner since. there interest explore whether impose minimum margin requirement additional form security credit could prevent margin compress boom likewise help mitigate destabilize procyclical margin increase time stress, reduce associate “fire sales” short-term wholesale fund markets. consideration utility authority preliminary phases. it undertake part broad review macroprudential authority regard development particular sector. time-varying borrower-side tool for purpose comparison, instructive focus central bank several advance economy deal house boom recent years.6 financial authority unite kingdom, sweden, switzerland, new zealand recently confront rapidly rise residential house price macroeconomic environment compel reason use policy rate first line defense. they respond impose stricture borrowers, loan-to-value debt-to-income limits, 6 a show elliott, feldberg, lehnert (2013), unite state active macroprudential policy include frequent use borrower restriction 1980; however, use borrower restrictions, underlie legal authorities, diminish significantly since then. see douglas j. elliott, greg feldberg, andreas lehnert (2013), “the history cyclical macroprudential policy unite states”, finance economics discussion series 2013–29 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, may). 6 bi central bankers’ speech case concert disincentive lenders, many case escalate pattern. indeed, restriction borrow among commonly employ macroprudential tool and, accord research, among effective stem buildup borrowing.7 this problem face today. if anything, press problem currently face house authority unite state restore vitality single-family house market, construction activity remain puzzlingly weak. however, if, future, mortgage-credit fuel house price bubble reemerge, bank regulator could perhaps impose high risk weight mortgage loan certain characteristic either directly expectation around stress testing.8 this approach would slow, perhaps require upwards year adjust, narrow scope application, may prove ineffective time bank regulatory capital comfortably exceed require thresholds. third pillar: work across regulatory perimeter in cases, foreign central bank act concert financial authority address buildup risk house sectors. in american context, federal reserve’s work embed large web effort financial authorities. in parallel federal reserve’s effort formalize financial stability surveillance policy making, network independent financial agency enhance cooperation formal structure responsibility fsoc well joint rulemakings joint supervisory efforts.9 it vitally important bank market regulator actively work share assessment risk across financial system develop joint macroprudential effort address risk stretch across regulatory perimeters. realistically, however, effort early stage must respect difference mission mandate, authority, governance structures. a example, consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb) authority adjust definition qualify mortgage (qm), affect mortgage credit lenders, whether inside outside bank regulatory perimeter. it worth noting, however, cfpb operate primarily consumer protection mandate. while ultimate consequence mortgage credit boom have, past, prove costly families, danger consumer initial stage boom may unclear warrant timely action. 7 see stijn claessens, swati r. ghosh, roxana mihet (2014), “macro-prudential policy mitigate financial system vulnerabilities”, imf work paper series 14/155 (washington: international monetary fund, august). 8 the federal reserve board five federal agency approve risk-retention rule october 2014 design ensure securitization sponsor incentive monitor ensure quality securitized asset underlie securitization transaction. sponsor security collateralize solely “qualified residential mortgages”, qrms, define agencies, require hold credit risk securitizations. the qrm definition rests, part, debt service-to-income mortgage borrower, include loan-to-value ratios. the agency commit review qrm definition five-year intervals, early request agency, order ensure definition remain appropriate mortgage securitization market condition practice change. alter qrm definition frequently would likely cumbersome time-consuming. 9 a parallel evolution also way internationally across major financial jurisdiction international standard-setting body umbrella financial stability board (fsb). bi central bankers’ speech 7 fourth pillar: monetary policy recognition limit macroprudential framework bring u consideration monetary policy – powerful tool broad reach, also relatively blunt.10 monetary policy tool available federal reserve far-reaching effect private credit creation across entire financial system one tool change rapidly (although effect famously long variable lags). while recognize far-reaching effect monetary policy financial conditions, good reason view monetary policy second line defense. it good view complement rather alternative macroprudential tools. in many circumstances, standard monetary policy financial stability consideration reinforce one another. nevertheless, may time standard monetary policy financial stability consideration conflict. in several recent instances, foreign economy face tension high unemployment shortfall inflation relative central bank’s target, one hand, financial stability concern associate rapidly rise real estate price other. in unite kingdom, policymakers put place range measure limit buildup risk house market, and, partly result, house market appear cool somewhat. nonetheless, u.k. policymakers acknowledge potential monetary policy adjustment play role pursuit financial stability. the bank england’s 2013 forward guidance specific financial stability “knockout” monetary policy accommodation financial policy committee (fpc) judge stance monetary policy pose significant threat financial stability cannot contain substantial range mitigate policy action available fpc.11 if, future, unite state face similar dilemma, financial imbalance grow rapidly backdrop subpar economic conditions, federal reserve may consider monetary policy financial stability purpose readily foreign peer regulatory perimeter narrower, capital market important, macroprudential toolkit extensive. even circumstances, however, important prudent role monetary policy, recognize necessary adjustment monetary policy could broad consequences. for example, tighten monetary policy sufficient limit strong credit growth could depress employment potentially trigger sharp correction financial markets. these limitation lead u circumspect regard use monetary policy tool address financial stability risks, perhaps view second line defense. but equally important acknowledge potential utility monetary policy address risk financial stability broad economy continue expand work appropriate role financial stability monetary policy framework. conclusion in sum, federal reserve inherent responsibility financial stability, incomplete set authority limit regulatory perimeter financial system large capital market fragment regulatory structure. it therefore important actively utilize tool authority – place particular emphasis build structural resilience largest, complicate institution tough through-the- 10 see janet l. yellen (2014), “monetary policy financial stability”, speech deliver “2014 michel camdessus

bank korea, bank korea-imf regional office asia pacific joint conference, seoul, 20 november 2014. * * * lady gentlemen, i delight welcome seoul, bank korea-imf oap joint conference. i wish thank director odd per brekk imf regional office asia pacific, conference co-organizer; senior fellow john lipskyof john hopkins university, keynote speaker; president john c. williams san francisco fed, program participant include moderators, speakers, discussants. the world economy gradually recover now, six year global financial crisis, pace recovery remain painfully slow. it well know root financial crisis global imbalances, accumulate long time, also know structural imbalances, worsen country crisis remain place continue limit recovery today. history tell u unbalance economy is, low level growth great vulnerability negative external shocks. the correction economic imbalance therefore essential prevent future crisis achieve sustainable growth. against backdrop, i think conference focus issue economic rebalancing deeply meaningful timely. look back, so-called “great moderation” 2000s,imbalances many aspect build spread, externally internally. globally, external imbalance country run current account surplus run current account deficit worsened. at individual country level, various internal imbalance also accumulating, financial imbalances, increase fiscal deficits, widen gap output service manufacture sectors. from global perspective, external imbalance seem narrow somewhat recently. this due sluggishness demand deficit countries, rather improve competitiveness export sector expansion domestic demand surplus countries. from individual country perspective, however, internal imbalance continue exist, case even worsened. and global economy pick up, external imbalance likely worsen again. without fundamental rebalancing, full-fledged recovery world economy may remote possibility. but rebalancing within short period time trivial task. it require proactive concert policy effort currently made. the recent expansionary macroeconomic policy undertake response sluggish economic growth are, i see it, temporary measures, ultimate solution rebalancing. they serve mature condition carry structural reform essential remedy imbalances. in regard, follow suggest structural solution rebalancing. first, current account surplus economy need expand domestic sectors, thereby establish virtuous circle output, employment, income. the current account deficit countries, hand, need nurture manufacture industries, improve base exporting. in individual countries, imbalance real financial economies, manufacture service sectors, need corrected, must also work reduce debt disparity income class within populations. to secure impetus sustainable growth, country also need work together combine wisdom. the brisbane action plan, set comprehensive growth strategy 2 bi central bankers’ speech present g20 summit last weekend, one result combine wisdom, arrive long discussion among member countries, useful future rebalancing country. during two-day conference, deal topic rebalancing economy five separate presentations, well panel discussion participate former current policymakers major countries. i look forward participant reap many useful idea here, conference contribute rebalancing restoration sustainable growth. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 karnit flug: strength challenge face israeli economy main point remark dr karnit flug, governor bank israel, jerusalem ultra-orthodox campus ono academic college, jerusalem, 1 december 2014. * * * the israeli economy open economy greatly influence development abroad, reflect growth rate economy, much connect around world. the influence activity abroad mainly reflect global trade, affect demand israeli exports, good services. good export virtual standstill, due standstill global trade. they decline slightly 2013 recover slightly 2014. service export show good performance global trade service – mean state manufacture serious state service industries, also result development exchange rate. the labor market relatively good condition, unemployment rate low level despite continue trend labor force participation rate, result trend increase employment rate. this different picture country experiencing, indication labor market show relative robustness, also reflect international comparison unemployment rates. bank israel policy act achieve bank israel’s objective define law. the main objective attain price stability, mean meet inflation target and, subject that, support economic objective growth, employment, financial stability. in recent months, inflation rate target range, past 12 months, price decline 0.3 percent. the main reason decline commodity price abroad, reflect stagnation global economy, apparently low demand abroad, relatively moderate demand israeli economy. even though see decline private consumption, see decline investment exports. until month ago, also sharp appreciation shekel, also contribute low prices. the appreciation also make difficult israeli exporter compete global economy, therefore definitely bother u bank israel. monetary policy’s response development prolong reduction interest rate, historically low level 0.25 percent, foreign exchange purchase act moderate appreciation shekel. in recent months, experience depreciation, make easy exporter compete, also contribute return inflation target range. the israeli economy enjoy number point strength, stand behind technology drive growth economy recent years. israel enjoy high rate people post-secondary education, high level research development, carry mainly private sector, high percentage high technology industry economy. these strong point upon economic growth rely thus far. the israeli economy also face many challenges. the level per caput gdp low compare advance economies, still quite way go reach global frontline term quality life. the main explanation labor productivity israel significantly low advance economies, succeed close gap time. the productivity gap different among various industry sectors. in export-oriented industries, need compete parallel industry abroad, productivity relatively high, them, high advance economies. the industry concentrate production domestic economy suffer relatively low productivity. 2 bi central bankers’ speech israel one high level income inequality world, despite slight improvement take place past years. the high poverty rate also significant challenge. we see household two wage earners, rate poverty low. this surprise statistic. in addition, poverty among ultra-orthodox household (47 percent) arab household (54 percent) much high among general population (12.5 percent). these trend much result relatively low labor force participation education levels, i show. in recent years, achievement israeli education system low oecd average, certainly worry situation, mainly country whose growth strategy base human capital. we find international test ultra-orthodox boys, see girl ultra-orthodox sector, mark low girl public public-religious school systems. employment rate israel similar oecd countries, employment rate ultra-orthodox woman similar general average. in contrast, employment rate men particularly low. over time, see sharp increase employment among ultra-orthodox women, cannot distinguish trend among ultra-orthodox men. this also obviously result education trend – rate high education among ultra-orthodox population particularly low, cannot distinguish high rate hold academic degree among young population, certainly worry phenomenon. we see among ultra-orthodox students, focus profession business management law, among woman also focus therapeutic professions. over time, see growth rate high education among ultra-orthodox men. there doubt way integrate successfully labor market obtain academic education. we see hold degree enjoy much high rate employment, much high wage levels, hold degree. there broad agreement regard policy measure require order increase education employment rate among ultra-orthodox sector. these need implemented: • it important education system provide infrastructure assist obtain high education late life. • the variety high education field must expand boost broad variegate integration labor market. • it important adapt professional train program need labor market, relate various population groups. investment professional train israel relatively low, important expand among general population, ultra-orthodox sector. • an expansion active labor market policy required. • it important employer ready absorb employee sector population groups. employer open take employee sector le familiar enjoy broad variety manpower available them. these policy tool provide opportunity. in end, individual need take opportunity. a such, i happy say thing here, group student choose obtain academic education make require effort successfully integrate israeli labor market. bi central bankers’ speech 1 patrick honohan: the role central bank area mortgage interest rate open statement mr patrick honohan, governor central bank ireland, oireachtas (national parliament) joint committee finance, public expenditure reform, dublin, 26 november 2014. * * * accompany slide find central bank ireland’s website. there quite significant development since i speak last committee – many fully summarise short introductory statement. so i selective. the reduction two step ecb’s main policy interest rate complicate influence finance condition ireland. on balance positive ireland clearly outweigh negatives, least extent ecb’s expansionary policy help boost economic demand euro area whole course bring inflation back target. irish borrower tracker mortgage see interest rate reduction fully pass them, continue reinforce exceptionally lengthy period ultra-low interest rate help borrowers. because impact trackers, though, low ecb interest rate directly improve banks’ profitability, average marginal cost bank fund fall much. the banks’ drive restore profitability, combine lack sufficient new competition, mean that, far low standard variable rate past three year ecb rate fallen, (as well known) actually increase standard variable rate somewhat. the trend show attach figure base simple bank-by-bank average advertise standard variable rate 80 per cent loan-to-value mortgage. (since trend evident traditional interest rate series publish central bank line international standards, work assembly rigorous basis additional statistical series mortgage interest rates, expect publish data january 2015.) these rate indicate standard variable rate borrower still pay le crisis, much. a widen mortgage interest rate spread policy rate also occur uk many euro area country crisis, spread begin narrow uk elsewhere. until recently bank competition weak ireland result substantial inroad rates. what role central bank area mortgage interest rates? from prudential point view, could role seek ensure bank set rate new business sufficiently high cover risk future default. while current spread would sufficient compensate bank risk actually take boom, much still embed exist stock mortgages, i think would hard argue mortgage underwrite today bad require high margin new business. inevitably, though, constrain inability restore spread trackers, bank seek mean restore profitability include widen standard variable rate spreads, typically apply old well new business. a advance economies, ireland long understand tight administrative control rate charge bank would counterproductive ensure sufficient flow properly price credit last basis. for one thing, control would strongly discourage new entrants. therefore, interest rate spread high, since national credit policy craft welfare people whole “constant predominant aim”, i see sufficient basis alter view. 2 bi central bankers’ speech there much discussion central bank’s consultation paper macro-prudential instruments, limit propose high loan-to-value loan-to-income mortgages. the consultation period end december 8 hope able announce finalise set regulation soon date, depend complexity response received. it may ask whether central bank think recent property market development represent bubble. that specifically driver proposals. instead, want achieve measure place stand regime ensure credit-driven bubble take hold, new generation become indebted. absent regime, sharp price rise dublin – jump 42 per cent 18 month – thin market, yet elicit sufficient supply response, could sow seed trouble future. our approach seek draw ongoing research carry central bank, international experience, course matter may emerge consultation. we want shorten period uncertainty much possible. accordingly, make appropriate refinement (for example, relation first time buyers, potential future use private mortgage insurance float consultation paper), move quickly confirm parameter stand regime. almost discussion i participate committee past year naturally focus banks, course one element central bank’s mandate worth remind almost 9 10 staff central bank actually engage numerous task prudential supervision banks. (there are, course, aspect bank oversight staff deal with, consumer protection conduct business aspect bank regulation). indeed, micro-prudential bank supervisory decision make largely pass control eu single supervisory mechanism (ssm), come operation november 4. the ssm not, however, mean le work us, rather work, inasmuch procedure ssm require expansion bank supervisory staff well reorganisation function. indeed, three year staff level risen, central bank need increase staff number again, ssm, also additional complexity new international regulation cover non-bank financial service (which form heart ifsc), new rule bank resolution new mandates. (much cost recover industry; indeed regulatory cost could recovered, instead effect eat central bank’s surplus income transfer exchequer; central bank suggest successive governments.) have already absorb sizable increase staff 2010–11, currently engage extensive review internal organisation ensure condition steady improvement effectiveness work, relate essential matter which, especially work well, obviously visible general public. the review examine range issue include internal structures, career path internal processes. i expect significant beneficial change organisational structure practice within central bank result review. our effectiveness enhance carefully design efficient headquarter build north wall quay, main build contract tender. this result bring together (non-currency) staff single location; strong financial practical benefit move. finally, i add anything lengthy letter i send committee september provide commentary response committee’s recent report mortgage arrears situation, situation continue evolve line indication letter. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the committee’s invitation indicate wide range potential topic discussion today. and indeed wide range issue come remit central bank. i happy take question might have. bi central bankers’ speech 1 cecilia skingsley: change payment market speech m cecilia skingsley, deputy governor sverige riksbank, royal institute technology, stockholm, 24 november 2014. * * * i would like express warm thank björn segendorff help speech. the market payment change rapidly. sweden forefront regard development use electronic payments. cash therefore meet tough competition new, innovative method payment. this development positive many ways, change also entail challenges. the riksbank take active part work manage challenge make thing easy economic agents. why important payment function? we rarely think pay product service. often pay way always do assume work. it rather like walk cycle – think something else it. nevertheless, day-to-day payment important u – give u access good service need daily lives. but payment mean use highly-specialised services. behind every non-cash payment make intermediary mediate payment payer payee. this do within infrastructure various technical system necessary make payment. the intermediary infrastructure require depend mean payment chosen. it therefore relevant talk payment consumption payment services. an efficiently-functioning market payment service assume payment service meet certain important requirements. three important requirement retail payment service firstly, payment service must safe, enough. it must also perceive safe. both payer payee must feel secure, otherwise payment service used. if banknote easy counterfeit, shop want accept them. if card easily hijacked, consumer want pay them.1 when pay mean cash, security also mean rely mediator payment actually entrust money. secondly, payment service must useful. it must simple convenient. you may remember card payment make use paper slip, carbon between, fill amount sign show id. this simple easy chip pin code today’s card terminals. thirdly, payment service must accessible household accept company public authorities. accessibility mean easy get hold cash need it, expensive complicate acquire card online bank service mobile network good cover i want use mobile payment bank services. the reason also applies, course, recipient payment. willingness accept various type payment may undermine factor technical problems, high cost difficulty deposit daily takings. accessibility also closely link uniform payment standards. the method payment predictable case 1 by hijack card, mean skim similar activity card data secretly scan use fraudulent purposes. 2 bi central bankers’ speech agree payment made. the u agreement better, make use network effect economy scale inherent mediation payments. for instance, type unanimity mean fairly certain possible pay card cash near shop. the reason positive attitude towards innovation development enable u safe, efficient accessible payment services. i believe agree easy use banknote coin today couple hundred year ago, easier, quick safe use chip pin code paper slip card payments. card turn preferable cheques. what swedish payment market? doe give u payment service uniform, safe, efficient accessible? the transformation swedish retail payment market a market change rapidly technological advance establishment new operators, important riksbank follow analysis swedish retail payment market. the result i describe come telephone interview survey households’ payment behaviour riksbank regularly carry out. high accessibility high level confidence if look common payment service use pay point sale, 96% respondent say access cash, almost 99% say access bank credit card. no respondent say access neither cash cards. accessibility card cash thus high general public’s confidence reflect fact use considerable extent. however, card use increasingly often mean payment cost cash. the riksbank also examine access payment service use pay distance, instance, household bills.2 in sweden mainly use various credit transfer direct debit product pay bills. the survey show almost 90% access online bank service 23% access credit transfer use paper forms. only 3% say access services. if add direct debit, 1 per cent lack access payment service pay distance. these payment service also use large degree. broad access innovative payment service sweden often say technology-friendly country reflect fact many access online banking. now, online bank service available nearly 20 years, mobile payment service much newer. it therefore remarkable almost one quarter respondent say access form mobile payment service.3 if broaden perspective somewhat include non-traditional payment service payment via third-party provider virtual currency bitcoin, 40% access one services.4 a good 23% respondent say pay one alternative method past month. another example bank report early last summer log-in via mobile bank service via traditional online bank services. this, i see 2 card use pay distance, too, instance online purchases. however, riksbank confirm statistic payments. 3 example mobile payment service include swish, wywallet seqr. 4 example payment via intermediary include paypal, klarna (payment invoice) direct payment link directly online bank. bi central bankers’ speech 3 it, broad acceptance new technology solution interest observation i return shortly. the fact many people use card electronic payment form proof service widely available, household also retailer companies. there 20 million card sweden two hundred thousand card terminals. recently mobile card terminal opportunity accept card payment mobile phone also arisen. this chart, show often household say able pay card cash, illustrate high level acceptance among payees. a large majority say unable pay either card cash le month. close atm good internet connection cash possible use shops. household also need able withdraw cash retailer able deposit daily takings. this make physical distance service point atm important. the average distance shop-owner near service point deposit daily take 6 km sweden whole 10 km jämtland county, long distances. the distance cash withdrawal less; around 4 km country whole around 7 km norrbotten county. for electronic payments, access internet equivalent geographical proximity. it also become increasingly important household company good internet connection able make receive payments. in sweden whole, around 500 household company unable access internet. give sparsely-populated, geographically large, country, nevertheless impressively small figure. of course, i say mean individual shop household may much long distances, fee pay shop-owner card payment handle daily take perceive high problem unable access internet. i shall shortly return challenge identify market, i i would like say word current trend developments. trend change sweden forefront i say early sweden forefront regard use payment service cash, illustrate chart, summarise situation select countries.5 the picture appear use cash much low sweden country use cards, primarily bank cards, higher. the situation roughly nordic neighbour countries. i mention early sweden technology-friendly country. we extensive infrastructure telecommunication high percentage household internet homes, familiar technology smart phone tablets. moreover, high degree confidence trust households, companies, payment intermediary public authorities. this chart show aggregate factors. it world economic forum’s rank country accord well situate 5 if look card cash, unfortunately difficult find good comparable statistics. the information country sweden often year old, exact percentage take pinch salt. 4 bi central bankers’ speech regard utilise possibility offer information communication technology. we see sweden highly place long time. of course, create right condition payment market develop. change also create difficulty it positive market payment develop meet new payment requirement arise. payment increasingly base technology trend probably continue expand. however, time development lead new problem tension need overcome. the problem identify include following: household company need even good access different payment services. the capacity mobile network always adequate manage temporary peak may difficult, instance, make card payment hot dog soft drink sport event attend several thousand people. some group society, visually impair short people, face problem card terminal atm always adapt specific needs. other problem concern great extent tension may arise relation new payment services. household may also access technology need use new payment service, nevertheless prefer use old technology. a latter technology become le accessible, tension may arise individual feel need met. for instance, elderly person may want continue deposit withdraw cash counter bank pay payment there, few bank branch handle cash manually; become difficult practice. there also risk market become fragment i mean may number different payment solutions, none generally accept payment recipients. one example could mobile payments. if launch new mobile payment service continues, perhaps i consumer need couple different payment application mobile phone sure able pay different shops. similarly, retailer need subscribe several different payment services. last year, inquiry use cash sweden published, early autumn commission inquiry present report entitle cash management sweden. this inquiry result number proposal i discus two here. the first propose riksbank overall responsibility cash management sweden. the second count service cash-in-transit company become subject licence come financial supervision. it recommend riksbank become supervisory authority operations. the riksbank welcome work inquiry consider important cash management sweden function smoothly. we take part work inquiry analyse proposal put forward respond submission send comments. cash changeover positive entail practical challenge it banks’ service need become user-friendly, cost-effective certain time, banknote coin also need develop way. when new banknote coin introduced, start next year, size weight banknote coin decline two new denomination introduced; 2-krona coin 200-krona banknote. the banknote coin thus become much user-friendly cheap handle. safety also increase new security features. i believe agree improvement positive party concerned. however, electronic payments, introduction new banknote coin give rise practical problem friction transitional period. bi central bankers’ speech 5 firstly, huge amount banknote replaced; 300 million banknote withdraw around many put circulation. for coin figure 500 million distribute directions. secondly, sweden one world’s automate cash systems. this mean appropriate equipment sweden must adapt able handle new banknote coins. thirdly, much practical changeover work occur retail trade shops, partly use cash partly bank cut cash handling. however, condition vary considerably retail trade regard to, instance, technical equipment security. it necessary ensure entire changeover function way felt general public simple secure. how deal challenges? to summarise, one say two group challenge swedish payment market. one concern slightly longer-term challenge follow development payment market, concern near-term challenge regard banknote coin changeover. let begin cash near-term challenges. the cash changeover 2015–2017 the riksbank long time, since plan begin 2008, dialogue various participant market regard banknote coin changeover. this mean banks, cash-in-transit company retail trade able influence every part work, especially timetable. this important riksbank, long play role practical handle cash. the timetable changeover divide two stage extend relatively long period, mean involve plenty time prepare. you saw slide i show early general public whole relatively good access place make cash withdrawal retail trade good access service point leave daily takings, time well-known fact several bank cut back manual cash handling. the consequence number households, perhaps sparsely-populated area particular, long way travel near bank handle cash. this problem may increase regard banknote coin changeover. the riksbank therefore conduct regular dialogue bank changeover managed. the bank say help customer extent need contribute smooth changeover. we assume bank take responsibility, time monitor developments, instance, make survey access cash service different part country. the continue dialogue bank show whether riksbank need take measures. start 2015, carry extensive information campaign aim market participant general public. the effect electronic payment the challenge regard electronic payment essentially different. the challenge i mention include shortfall capacity telecommunication network, accessibility user problem vulnerable group possible fragmentation segment market. but challenges, too. common riksbank formal tool manage problems. often primary responsibility area lie another authority often many different party involve need cooperate resolve problems. for instance, county administrative board swedish post telecom authority task ensure 6 bi central bankers’ speech everyone access basic payment services. finansinspektionen (the swedish financial supervisory authority) responsibility financial supervision. the swedish competition authority responsible ensure suitable competition payment market, on. the banks, provider payment service retail trade different side market, participation often decisive factor bring change. the riksbank invite new retail payment council i believe riksbank well-positioned take part manage challenge arise change payment market. but i mention earlier, successful management depend various market participant talk one another work together. at present, suitable forum discussions. the riksbank, centrally-located independent participant, contribute create forum stakeholder discus try resolve problem market. this riksbank send invitation take part new retail payment council last week. the idea bring together public authority market participant supply demand side market. the council make decisions, act discussion forum identify analyse problem shortcoming market propose possible way counteract resolve them. the council thus become joint resource party involved. example question may discuss include improve situation vulnerable groups, remove obstacle competition improve statistics. the invitation send central participant market public authorities. preferably, council member represent group participant rather individual participant, is, bank represent swedish bankers’ association rather individual bank. we aware present exclude small participant compete bank introduce innovative product market. but aim broaden participation great participation work group may operate council. nor riksbank’s proposal regard set stone; must possible retail payment council develop remain relevant thus work method participation review regular basis. the riksbank intend preliminary constituent meet begin february. the way forward involve new old technology to summarise: sweden forefront regard development use cashless payment methods. this development positive many ways, change also entail challenges. the riksbank take active part work manage challenge make thing easy various participant economy. give this, i convince good basis resolve short-term long-term problem frictions. the way forward continue refine old technology new version also create entirely new solutions. there good scope ensure payment service even safer, efficient, easily accessible cheap future. thank you! bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: ecb press conference – introductory statement introductory statement mr mario draghi, president european central bank, frankfurt main, 4 december 2014. * * * lady gentlemen, vice-president i please welcome first press conference new premises. we report outcome today’s meet govern council, also attend commission vice-president, mr dombrovskis. base regular economic monetary analyses, line forward guidance, decide keep key ecb interest rate unchanged. a regard non-standard monetary policy measures, start purchase cover bond asset-backed securities. these purchase programme last least two years. next week, conduct second target longer-term refinance operation, follow six operation june 2016. take together, measure sizeable impact balance sheet, intend move towards dimension begin 2012. in come months, measure ease monetary policy stance broadly, support forward guidance key ecb interest rate reinforce fact significant increase difference monetary policy cycle major advance economies. however, late euro area macroeconomic projection indicate low inflation, accompany weak real gdp growth subdue monetary dynamics. in context, early next year govern council reassess monetary stimulus achieved, expansion balance sheet outlook price developments. we also evaluate broad impact recent oil price development medium-term inflation trend euro area. should become necessary address risk prolong period low inflation, govern council remain unanimous commitment use additional unconventional instrument within mandate. this would imply alter early next year size, pace composition measures. in response request govern council, ecb staff relevant eurosystem committee step technical preparation measures, could, needed, implement timely manner. all monetary policy measure gear towards underpin firm anchor medium long-term inflation expectations, line aim achieve inflation rate below, close to, 2%, contribute return inflation rate towards level. let explain assessment great detail, start economic analysis. real gdp euro area rise 0.2%, quarter quarter, third quarter year. this line early indication weaken euro area’s growth momentum, lead downward revision outlook euro area real gdp growth recent forecasts. the late data survey evidence november confirm picture weak growth profile period ahead. at time, outlook modest economic recovery remain place. on one hand, domestic demand support monetary policy measures, ongoing improvement financial conditions, progress make fiscal consolidation structural reforms,

central bankers’ speech 1 charles i plosser: economic growth monetary policy – new normal? speech mr charles i plosser, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank philadelphia, george washington university princeton university’s griswold center economic policy studies, philadelphia, pennsylvania, 13 november 2014. * * * the view express necessarily federal reserve system fomc. highlight • president charles plosser give view debate new normal economic growth u.s. economy. • while economist believe secular stagnation low growth reduce productivity may persist time, president plosser side think impossible predict state future technology. • president plosser notes, though, monetary policy tool fix secular stagnation case. introduction i would like thank george washington university princeton university’s griswold center economic policy study organize event. i also delight fellow panelists, frank schorfheide university pennsylvania, regular visit scholar philadelphia fed, neal sos credit suisse, and, course, moderator, binyamin appelbaum new york times. a usual, i remind everyone remark today view necessarily federal reserve system colleague federal open market committee (fomc). the question whether face prospect sort new economic normal steady state growth path challenge one. some ponder whether severity financial crisis recession, perhaps even policy response events, usher period low growth reduce productivity may persist time. others suggest seed secular decline growth predate recession. this view stress evolve secular decline arise weaken rate innovation productivity gain innovation often fosters. this view also point demographic factors, age population, strain government program transfer resource worker elderly. the evolution longer-run growth also implication longer-term real interest rate, largely determine growth per caput consumption growth rate population. in turn, growth per caput consumption depend productivity gain share population engage production. the implication factor real interest rate is, course, relevant central banker seek set policy rate stabilize price promote sustainable growth. yet, important note monetary policy capable reverse mitigate secular slowdowns. consequently, best tangential effort nation seek address secular decline growth. in brief time, i highlight issue underlie view secular slowdown. that said, however, i want emphasize hard determine precision longer-term growth rate economy. it often take many year data 2 bi central bankers’ speech establish degree confidence assert change trend. a result, come surprise i answer question whether face new normal. instead, i offer observation i believe key issue make assessment challenging. long-run trend let start question future productivity growth, since fundamental determinant economic prosperity. recently, robert gordon advance notion bout long-term secular stagnation.1 his write reflect idea, also propose tyler cowen, low-hanging fruit pick technological advance become increasingly difficult.2 on hand, scholar joel mokyr, erik brynjolfsson, andrew mcafee see reason anticipate long-lasting decline human ingenuity. gordon produce provocative research concern demise economic growth country. he describe number headwinds, four relevant discussion: slow innovation, reduce growth human capital due dysfunctional education system, slow population growth, associate change age distribution. these four component important economic growth natural level real interest directly affect growth total factor productivity. further, slow growth population decline participation rate due aging, thing equal, reduce natural long-run real rate interest low per-capita economic growth. gordon’s view stagnation base evaluation data long sweep economic history. he note decrease total factor productivity, decline growth rate human capital, reduce hour per worker, decline labor force participation rates. he date begin stagnation factor 1972. for 80 year then, gordon assert economic growth spark three great inventions: electric light bulb, internal combustion engine, wireless signals. he note three invention eventually lead round spinoffs transform society. gordon see round spinoffs it revolution, biotech, advance 3-d printing.3 economic historian joel mokyr bite cautious, believe much i nearly impossible predict state future technology.4 he note 20th century experience considerable technological advancement, even face considerable headwinds, include two world wars, cold war, great depression. some might argue, however, world war headwind boost technological advancement. it also may impediment innovation endemic nature science technological progress, instead create government thus reversed. for example, increase regulation make development new drug costly risky? could significant increase financial regulation financial crisis reduce productivity intermediation thus impede investment possibly rate 1 see gordon, “is u.s. economic growth over? falter innovation confront six headwinds” “the demise u.s. economic growth: restatement, rebuttal, reflections.” 2 see cowen, the great stagnation: how america eat all low-hanging fruit modern history, get sick, will (eventually) feel better. 3 gordon belief future development exist even yet-to-be-invented technology reasonably predictable, instance, cite jules verne one visionary. i don’t see choose ignore imagination gene roddenberry: think iphones, needleless injections, touch-screen computers, name few. 4 see mokyr, “the next age invention.” bi central bankers’ speech 3 growth? or increase tax return save investment support transfer program potentially reduce productivity growth? regulatory tax burden often act reduce entrepreneurial activity innovation thus retard productivity growth. such cost must weigh perceive benefit burdens. brynjolfsson mcafee optimistic future. they believe inflection point substantial period robust economic growth await u not-too-distant future.5 they point many revolutionary discoveries, dna sequencing, occur creatively string together prior scientific procedures. they point improvement computational speed algorithmic development make computer capable string together ideas, could result significant improvement productivity. i believe technological advancement increase productivity foster overwhelm drive force behind economic growth. demographic factor may drive hour per worker labor force participation relatively insignificant compare innovation’s effect productivity. after all, remarkable growth 20th century occur significant decline workweek 60 hour le 40, well significant increase vacation leisure time. it hard envision decline similar magnitude go forward. thus, i continue faith promise human ingenuity envision dire outcome envision gordon.6 that mean won’t experience spurt unusually high- low-productivity growth, period likely identify understand well fact. the argument present side secular stagnation debate highlight future could unfold different ways. i think doubt longer-term growth rate vary, thus, longer-term real interest rate also vary. yet, movement tend occur gradually difficult ass precision real time. a discussion suggests, focus policy design enhance innovation productivity continue improve per caput consumption general economic welfare. monetary policy how variation longer-term growth rate economy, thus longer-term real rate interest, affect monetary policy? first, i want reiterate long-term growth primarily determine productivity growth. monetary policy appropriate tool address perceive decline productivity. however, assessment long-run potential growth influence set monetary policy influence steady-state long-run real interest rate. if steady-state real rate lower, so-called “neutral set monetary policy” would also lower. that is, neutral fund rate would lower. the debate secular decline growth today thus translate discussion where, high, neutral policy rate be. so, high relative current fund rate, aggressive policy might vice versa. but factor could complicate policy path. if potential output low future previously thought, likely le “slack” current economy one might think. so, “output gaps” likely smaller, many policy rule would suggest high interest rates, thing equal. while low steady-state real rate 5 see brynjolfsson mcafee, the second machine age: work, progress, prosperity time brilliant technologies. 6 summer “u.s. economic prospects: secular stagnation, hysteresis, zero low bound” offer different concerns. he argue real rate interest may decline low, even negative, level lead possibility inefficient equilibrium form secular stagnation. 4 bi central bankers’ speech may act shift neutral rate, effect dynamic path policy return neutral somewhat complex. while expect neutral fund rate something may relevant, estimate communicate value confidence would challenging. measure longer-run trend difficult delicate issue. because expectation monetary policy important, particularly financial markets, may useful fomc indicate range likely neutral federal fund rate. but give uncertainties, may difficult convey false sense precision may prove counterproductive. so, i believe, adjustment perceive neutral fund rate do great care discipline. they do response typical cyclical fluctuation real rates. our ability truly ass significant shift longer-term real rate quite limited, and, presence uncertainty measurement error, one careful confuse public. conclusion in summary, lively debate future innovation factor shape prospect growth. my view human ingenuity innovation continue source productivity growth. but mean complacent future. productivity ultimate mean economic prosperity, undertake policy promote innovation technological progress eliminate practice discourage progress. monetary policy limit role play endeavor except promote stable environment allow long-run force succeed. yet, appropriate set monetary policy affect longer-term trends. failure adjust trend lead deviation central bank’s inflation target. yet, distinguish short-run transitory fluctuation permanent persistent movement growth real interest rate tricky difficult task. it near impossible real time. these consideration lead believe monetary policymakers take great care make significant adjustment view neutral policy rate. we live constantly change world one hopefully full surprise new development enhance economic welfare. reference

regulatory paperwork reduction act outreach meeting, los angeles, california, 2 december 2014. * * * on behalf federal reserve system, i please first series outreach meet design hear feedback concern regulatory burden. i want thank take time participate important dialogue also extend thank federal reserve bank san francisco provide space today’s meet los angeles branch. the federal reserve take mandate economic growth regulatory paperwork reduction act (egrpra) seriously. the egrpra review provide opportunity agency consider whether current regulation well-balanced effective whether outdated, unnecessary, unduly burdensome. public input critical process help u identify potential solution alleviate undue burden. well-conceived regulation help ensure safety soundness bank system, well fair treatment consumers. but unnecessary regulation drain bank resource reduce important service depository institution provide household businesses. create balance regulation effective thoughtfully calibrate avoid undue burden require input stakeholders. in-person meetings, like one hold today, help u gather information critical understand regulation affect bank industry also consumer community serve. they also enable stakeholder learn one another provide u multiple perspective complex issue regulation address. outside meetings, also look forward receive write comment elaborate improve regulation detail cover time today. we recognize depository institution come many sizes, different business models, manage different risks. a result, often necessary tailor regulation institution. apply one-size-fits-all approach regulation may produce small benefit disproportionately large compliance cost small institutions. of particular concern regard need ensure regulation appropriately calibrate small institutions. for example, large bank present great risk stability financial system, many regulation pass dodd-frank wall street reform consumer protection act 2010 (dodd-frank act) specifically target firms. it would counterproductive apply expectation small banks. accordingly, think important tailor rule whenever possible clearly differentiate expectation different portfolio bank reduce undue burden community banks. tailor regulation may challenge areas, rule provide transparency fairness consumer transactions. those standard apply throughout financial system. i note dodd-frank act transfer rule-writing authority many consumer law regulation consumer financial protection bureau, cfpb. the review regulation must undertake cfpb procedure incorporate dodd-frank act rather egrpra. however, federal reserve board, office comptroller currency, federal deposit insurance corporation retain rule-writing authority community reinvestment act, interest comment regard way improve regulation. 2 bi central bankers’ speech in addition change regulatory supervisory landscape, bank industry also undergo major changes. advance technology shift industry composition depository institution nondepository company change type financial service product offered, well service product accessed. we interest feedback regard type industry change impact effectiveness regulations. let conclude say consider comment carefully agency coordinate discus consider appropriate action likely best serve financial system interest institution consumers. the result contain agencies’ report congress summarize issue raise agencies’ conclusion need regulatory legislative changes. thank join u today.
