Mark Carney: What are banks really for? Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the University of Alberta School of Business, Edmonton, Alberta, 30 March 2009.  The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * Across the world's major economies, addressing the failures of banking ranks among the highest policy priorities. In the harsh glare of the current financial turmoil, it is clear that many banks outside of Canada were either not doing their jobs or were doing them in ways that created enormous risks. It is vital that we learn from these mistakes to build a more robust financial order. The financial system should be the servant of the real economy. As one of my international colleagues recently remarked, "it is time the banks stopped swanning around like the Queen of England and resumed their traditional role as handmaidens to industry." It is apparent that an era of self-absorbed finance that viewed itself as the apex of economic activity led to widespread misallocation of capital. Now, in some major economies, the challenge is that banks are not allocating capital at all. Around the world, banks are accused of not lending enough, charging too aggressively when they do lend and, most fundamentally, of deepening the recession rather than dampening it. These concerns are much less valid in Canada than abroad, but we too should reflect upon them and respond accordingly. My remarks today will address the role of banks and markets in our economy. In recent years, these core elements of our financial system became increasingly intertwined, with each expanding into the traditional role of the other, and each reliant on the health of the other. This blurring between banks and markets led to the emergence of the so-called "shadow banking" sector, whose presence helped trigger the crisis and whose absence will complicate the recovery. We now face important policy questions about which activities banks should perform, which should be located in sustainable, continuously-open markets, and which should be prohibited. The final answers to these questions require reflection and implementation will take time, but broad direction is needed now. Markets are overshooting. On the current trajectory, virtually all financial activities will be put back onto bank balance sheets at potentially tremendous cost in terms of lost output and employment. Restoring stability to financial markets requires broad direction on the type of global financial system that should emerge from the current financial mess. Important steps will be taken at this week's meeting of the leaders of the G-20 in London. Canada has much to offer these discussions, and is participating actively and constructively. Let me stress at the outset that many of my comments today apply more acutely internationally than domestically. While some commentators have been too quick to ascribe global failings to our local institutions, we should not engage in a bout of perverse envy. Our system is better. Regulation has been more consistent. Our banks have been more conservative. Credit conditions in Canada remain superior to those in virtually every other industrialized country. That is not to suggest that access to credit is not a challenge, that risks do not lie ahead, or that our system cannot be improved. However, many of the current constraints in our system reflect the impact on Canada of failures in the international financial system and of international institutions. The core of our system has many – although not all – of the elements of a more sustainable global financial system. BIS Review 39/2009 1 
The traditional roles of banks Commercial banks perform several key functions in our economy. To begin with, banks are a critical part of the payments system – the pipes through which financial transactions occur. By facilitating decentralized exchange, the payments system is critical to the functioning of a market economy. Like oxygen, the payments system passes unnoticed unless disrupted. It is one of the Bank of Canada's jobs to oversee systemic elements of the payments system, as well as its reliability. Reflecting years of investment and planning, our payments system has functioned smoothly and reliably, despite the enormous shocks to our financial system over the past two years. The second important role of banks is to transform the maturities of assets and liabilities. Banks take short-term liabilities, usually in the form of deposits, and transform them into long-term assets, such as mortgages or corporate loans. Households and businesses can therefore do the reverse, holding short-term assets and longer-term liabilities. This helps them to plan for the future and to manage risks arising from uncertainties over their cash flows. Banks also provide liquidity to their customers by allowing rapid access to those same short-term assets. Indeed, by transacting at a wide range of maturities, banks provide arbitrage which increases the efficiency of financial markets. This allows borrowers to obtain the lowest rate of interest appropriate to their risk characteristics. The social value of maturity transformation is without question. However, by definition, it also leads to a maturity mismatch that creates a fundamental risk for banks. Banks hold liquid reserves that are only a fraction of their outstanding obligations. What if a depositor wants his money back, but that money is committed to long-term investment projects? Generally, this is not a problem, because banks maintain sufficient liquidity to meet typical demands and can borrow from other banks if the shock is larger than anticipated. But what if many depositors want their money back at the same time? There is a tipping point when the liquidity problem becomes self-fulfilling. To manage this risk, banks rely on two crucial supports. First, deposit insurance gives depositors the comfort that their funds will be there when they need them.1 Second, the Bank of Canada acts as a lender of last resort to solvent but illiquid institutions.2These support mechanisms are carefully crafted to discourage banks from taking inappropriate risks while still providing the necessary support. They are also accompanied by a robust regulatory framework. Bankers implicitly accept a social contract that gives them access to liquidity support in times of a stress in return for regulation of their behaviour at all times. Banks perform a third essential role of credit intermediation, channelling funds from savers to investors. This allows savers to diversify their risk and all of us to smooth our consumption over time. Young families can borrow to buy a house, students can pay for university. Canadians can invest in low-risk, interest-bearing accounts for their retirements, and businesses can finance working capital and investment.                                                  1  The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation insures eligible deposits up to a maximum of $100,000 (principal and interest combined) per depositor against the failure of a bank or other financial institution if it is a CDIC member. Canadian chartered banks are CDIC members, as are federally regulated trust and loan companies that take deposits and deposit-taking associations governed by the Cooperative Credit Associations Act. 2  A more detailed description of the Bank's role as lender of last resort can be found in the Winter 2004-05 issue of the Bank of Canada Review, available at http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/review/winter04-05/daniel.pdf. 2 BIS Review 39/2009 
Banks, markets, and the crisis Banks are not the only game in town. In recent years, markets have grown to the point that they are now an important alternative for corporate and household finance. From a financial system perspective, the deepening of markets is generally very welcome because it makes the system more robust and increases competition, which disciplines banking activity. While markets expand the choices and lower the prices available to financial consumers, they function differently from banks. Unlike banks, markets rely more completely on confidence for liquidity. We have seen during this crisis that confidence is not always present. Liquidity waxes and wanes, and with it, so do the prices of securities. In recent months, as we have seen a fundamental repricing of virtually every financial asset across the world, liquidity in many securities has fallen dramatically. Banks have relationships with their customers. They follow borrowers over time and monitor their payment history and reliability. When performing their role properly, banks tailor their products to the borrower, imposing higher or lower standards as appropriate. In contrast, markets are transaction oriented. They act as an intermediary between savers and borrowers but maintain relationships with neither. Consequently, market instruments are more robust when the underlying product is more standardized. Determining whether an activity is best financed through a bank or a market depends on the relative benefits to that activity of specialization versus standardization. In response to increased competitive pressure from markets, banks have become direct participants in markets. This move helped to sow the seeds of the crisis through three channels in particular: wholesale funding, securitization, and proprietary trading. First, banks have become increasingly heavy users of markets to fund their activities. In recent years, many international banks borrowed in short-term markets to finance asset growth and, in the process, to substantially increase their leverage. This made them increasingly dependent on continuous access to liquidity in money and capital markets. In the process, banks conflated a reliance on market liquidity with their access to central bank liquidity. This exacerbated the potential liquidity problems of banks to a magnitude that we now better appreciate. Second, banks increasingly used securitization to straddle relationship banking and transactional market-based finance. Under the originate-to-distribute business model, banks originated a set of loans, repackaged them as securities, and sold them to investors. In essence, banks took specialized loans and sold them in standardized packages. While securitization promised to diversify risks for banks, the transfer of risk was frequently incomplete. Banks often sold securities to "arms-length" conduits that they were later forced to reintermediate or held onto AAA tranches of structures that proved far from risk-free. At the extreme, the business models of some institutions were wholly reliant on the continuous availability of markets for securitized assets (e.g., Northern Rock). The global financial crisis exposed the fundamental incentive problems that can occur with securitization. In the originate-to-distribute model, the incentives of the originating institution were no longer aligned with those of the risk-holders. Once that relationship was severed, the standards for new loans and their ongoing monitoring were adversely affected. However, pricing and risk management did not reflect these changes until they were abruptly adjusted, helping to trigger the onset of the crisis. Third, many retail and commercial banks expanded into investment banking. This allowed banks to package traditional lending with higher value-added agency business, market-making activities and, increasingly proprietary trading. Banks' push into markets helped spur the proliferation of over-the-counter derivative products, which created counterparty and investment risks that were difficult to identify and control. Incentive problems also plagued this transition. In many banks, a culture that rewarded innovation and opacity over risk management and transparency eventually undermined its BIS Review 39/2009 3 
creators. Senior managers and shareholders of banks discovered that actual risks were much greater than originally thought. By that time, the more junior traders who had assumed the risks had already been paid, largely in cash. Many large, complex institutions learned too late that there can be principal-agent problems within firms, as well as between firms and their shareholders. Just as banks began doing what markets traditionally did best, there was an explosion in highly specialized products that required monitoring and continuous access to funding liquidity. More and more of the traditional functions of banks – including maturity transformation and credit intermediation – were conducted through a broader range of intermediaries and investment vehicles, which have been collectively referred to as the "shadow banking" system. Shadow banks included investment banks (in other countries), mortgage brokers, finance companies, structured investment vehicles (SIVs), hedge funds, and other private asset pools. The scale of these developments was remarkable. During this decade, banking assets grew enormously, to anywhere from one and a half times to six times national GDP in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe. In all countries besides Canada, much of this growth was financed by increased leverage.3 In the final years of the boom, when complacency about access to liquidity reached its zenith, the scale of the shadow banking system exploded. The value of SIVs, for example, tripled in the three years to 2007. The growth in financial activity and the increasingly complex array of financial players have prompted a dramatic increase in claims within the financial system, as opposed to between the financial system and the real economy, which created risks that were difficult to identify and evaluate. Financial institutions, including many banks, came to rely on high levels of liquidity in markets. In the United States, the total value of commercial paper rose by more than 60 per cent and the ABCP market by more than 80 per cent in the three years before the crisis. In essence, the shadow banking system practiced maturity transformation without a safety net – that is, it was wholly reliant on the continuous availability of funding markets. The collapse in market liquidity that began in August 2007 crystallized these risks. The regulatory system neither appreciated the scale of this activity nor adequately adapted to the new risks created by it. The shadow banking system was not supported, regulated, or monitored in the same fashion as the banking system. With hindsight, the shift towards the shadow banking system that emerged in other countries was allowed to go too far for too long. Financial deleveraging The financial crisis is now reversing the decades-long transition from bank-based, relationship-oriented finance towards market-based, transaction-oriented finance. Banks are playing a larger role in the ongoing extension of credit. However, this transition carries enormous risks. Banks alone cannot support the same level of economic activity as the entire system did before, particularly since many need to delever. Moreover, the financial system as a whole is more robust when both banks and markets are strong, healthy, and liquid. Financial deleveraging is now one of the dominant forces in the global economy. After a decade during which household debt, leverage in the financial sector, and cross-border                                                  3  Average asset-to-capital ratios for U.S. investment banks rose to 25 prior to the onset of the crisis, to 30 in the euro area, and to over 40 for some major global banks. These are all much higher than the Canadian equivalent of about 20. 4 BIS Review 39/2009 
capital flows all rose rapidly, all have slowed or are now falling. The duration and orderliness of these shifts will help to determine the severity of the global recession. Financial institutions around the world must bring their leverage down to more sustainable levels by shrinking assets and raising more capital. Considerable, albeit disruptive, progress has been made in the shadow banking system, where SIVs and other conduits have been largely wound up. Hedge fund assets under management have been cut in half to about US$1 trillion, and the leverage applied to these assets has been substantially reduced. As liquidity in many funding markets has dried up, so has embedded leverage in many pension funds. However, there has been less progress in the regulated banking sector. This is a large task. We estimate that to bring leverage ratios down to Canadian levels by raising capital alone, global banks would need more than US$1 trillion in new capital, before any additional writedowns on assets. The deleveraging process has contributed to a dramatic reversal in cross-border capital flows. Many of the largest global banks have dramatically curtailed their international activities. Hedge funds have similarly retreated to their home countries in anticipation of redemptions and over concerns for cross-border liquidity. The Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimates that net flows from private creditors to emerging markets, which topped US$630 billion in 2007, will be negative this year. Once the crisis passes, the scale of cross-border financial transactions is unlikely to return to pre-crisis levels. This reflects both the re-emergence of home bias amongst investors and the impact of measures to support domestic institutions. This financial protectionism, if not checked, could permanently impair cross-border capital flows and could be a serious setback for the global economy. Reform of the global financial system It is clear that the global financial system needs to be restructured, but doing so requires a clear view of the objectives. The fundamental objective is a system that efficiently supports economic growth while providing financial consumers with choices. The system must be robust to shocks, dampening rather than amplifying their effect on the real economy. It should also support sensible innovation. The system needs both stable banks and robust markets, since both play a central role in financing and, if properly structured, each can support the other. Achieving these objectives will require a range of measures starting with short-term initiatives to keep the system functioning and then bridging to more fundamental long-term reforms, which help define the roles of banks and markets. Keeping the system functioning Extraordinary measures have been taken to underpin the financial system. All G-20 countries have explicitly and repeatedly confirmed that no systemically important institution will be allowed to fail. In some countries, there has been direct support for banks through capital injections using public money. Support has also taken less direct forms, such as liquidity support to help keep open the markets on which banks and market participants depend. Some of these measures are expediencies taken in the midst of a crisis and elements may need to be adjusted later to support a more permanent solution.4For example banks have been provided with considerable liquidity support to reflect the scale of the funding pressures. The broader intent has been to grease the wheels of the financial system. In providing liquidity to banks at the core of the system, central banks expected that                                                  4  The Bank of Canada has outlined some principles for the provision of liquidity in the following article http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/en/fsr/2008/pol0608.pdf. BIS Review 39/2009 5 
key markets would resume functioning as liquidity cascaded down to other market participants and, ultimately, through private credit creation to the real economy. However, the weaker the starting point of regulated institutions and the greater the importance of the shadow banking sector, the longer the healing process has taken. While the provision of extraordinary liquidity is limiting the damage from the crisis, it has long been apparent that official liquidity, irrespective of size, cannot re-open markets on its own. Reopening markets will ultimately require a series of measures to improve the infrastructure of core funding markets, securitization, and credit default swaps (CDS). Building systemic markets A robust and efficient financial system needs core markets for interbank lending, commercial paper, and repos of high-quality securities that are continuously open, even under periods of stress. To that end, the Bank of Canada is currently engaged in wide-ranging discussions with market participants, regulators, and other central banks on the steps that may be needed to create continuously open markets. Potential measures include improving the transparency of securities (as with ABCP), standardizing terms such as through-the-cycle haircuts for repos, and exploring the potential use of clearing houses to limit counterparty risks. Regulations and standards could reinforce these initiatives. Central bank operations could also be adapted to create a market-maker of last resort. Authorities are also taking important steps to improve the functioning of key markets such as securitization and CDS by creating more robust infrastructure and standardizing the products. For example, to reduce opacity, the models and data underlying securities could be published to move securitization from black box to open source. An extreme would be to standardize securities by introducing a government "wrap" or guarantee, as is the case with Canada Mortgage Bonds.5 6 Similarly, a host of measures are being pursued to make the CDS market more sustainable. The U.S. Federal Reserve has improved clearing and settlement arrangements, and has encouraged the move of CDS onto clearing houses. This will encourage the standardization of these products, while making CDS counterparties – often banks – less systemically important at the margin. The limits between banks and markets These initiatives will change the margin between banks and markets and will make markets much more robust. This will reduce risks to those institutions that rely on these markets and reduce the extent to which certain banks are "too interconnected to fail." Nonetheless, even with these changes, banks can be expected to continue to be active market participants. For some, such progress is insufficient. A simple lesson that they draw from the crisis is that banks should be divorced from markets. To those who think this way, banks are most naturally heavily regulated utilities that collect deposits and make loans. Once banks become involved in the market "casino," they are overwhelmed by the resulting risk-management challenges and all too often have to draw on their public safety nets. Indeed, the very existence of those safety nets may encourage excess risk taking and promote financial crises. That is why some advocate restricting banks' activities to their "core" functions of deposit taking and lending. The range of activities related to the markets would be kept                                                  5  For example, the former Deputy Chairman of the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority, Sir James Crosby, proposed the introduction of government guarantees of newly-issued mortgage-backed bonds. In March, the Bank of England introduced an Asset Purchase Program to support corporate credit markets. 6  In addition, to align incentives, originators could brand their products to retain part of the security or to absorb first loss. 6 BIS Review 39/2009 
outside the heavily regulated banking sector. To this way of thinking, banks could not then get themselves into trouble or, if they did, their demise could be safely managed. In the midst of the crisis, this is a seductive viewpoint, but its practical value may be limited for three reasons. First, banks perform a broad range of market-related activities that are vital to the existence of markets. Canadian banks are the major agents, market makers, underwriters, and traders of most government debt and corporate debt. Even with substantial improvements to market infrastructure, it is difficult to see markets functioning effectively in the absence of bank participation. These activities can be distinguished from principal positions or proprietary investments and are essential to well-functioning markets. Efforts to improve market infrastructure described above will make markets less risky and the system as a whole more robust. Second, banks are the major providers of cross-border financing products ranging from trade finance, to foreign exchange hedging, to foreign financing. In a world of global supply chains and corporations, it would be very costly to prohibit bank provision of these services that have become integral to global commerce. Moreover, with global cross-border flows already under such pressure, further impediments would be extremely risky. Third, the crisis has demonstrated that there are many firms that have been deemed systemic and worthy of rescue even though they were not deposit-taking banks. Efforts to build more robust markets and to define clearer and more comprehensive resolution schemes may limit these cases in the future, but they are unlikely to eliminate them entirely. In my opinion, a better approach is the plan by the G-20 to expand the perimeter of regulation. As a general principle, all financial activities that can pose a systemic risk to financial stability should be supervised and regulated. This will include pools of capital of material size, leverage, and maturity mismatches. In addition, to avoid regulatory arbitrage, markets should be regulated according to economic substance, placing similar activities into the same regulatory bucket, even if undertaken in different institutions. Regulating by economic substance should limit the destabilizing impact of shadow banks on the banks themselves. In many respects, the relative success of Canadian banks and their consolidated supervision by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions demonstrates that, with the proper regulatory regime and professional management, banks can be much more than utilities. In this spirit, Canada is contributing to the international debate on financial sector reform. We are stressing the need for a macroprudential (i.e., comprehensive and system-wide) approach that takes into account the importance of banks, markets, and the interactions between them. Conclusion Our principal preoccupation is weathering the financial and economic storm, but as we respond to the current tempest, policy-makers must also focus on where we want to end up when calmer conditions arrive. Our destination should be one where banks and financial markets play critical, and complementary, roles in a financial system to support long-term economic prosperity. The system as a whole will be more stable if market infrastructure is substantially improved, market products are more standardized and transparent, and banks can fulfill their market-making roles with appropriate liquidity backstops. As the G-20 pursues its critical agenda of financial reform, Canada will contribute an important perspective on these issues, drawing on the fine example we continue to set. BIS Review 39/2009 7 
Paul Tucker: The Turner Review Conference – comments occasioned by the Turner Review  Remarks by Mr Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at The Turner Review Conference, London, 27 March 2009. *      *      * The dreadful crisis affecting the international economy and financial system will rightly prompt a thorough re-examination of principles and structures: the “rules of the game” for global finance. There will be many reports. As after the 1987 stock market crash and after the 1990s’ EME crises, they will be rich in analysis, proposals and plans. The Turner Report is an early distinguished intervention, taking its place alongside, for example, the reports from Paul Volker’s G30 Committee and Jacques Larosière’s European group.  We would be foolhardy not to start thinking about the shape of the system we want, and we should take the quick wins. But it might well be a mistake to reach early conclusions on the truly big issues. Before this crisis is over, we could well learn quite a lot more about which business models and risk management practices worked best; and about how effectively the current efforts to stabilise banking systems and stimulate nominal demand work to revive our economies. We will then be in a better position to make judgments about just how much we need to constrain financial activity in the future in the interests of stability.  My own working definition of “financial stability” has long been as follows. It is to do with money. It starts with monetary policy being directed, of course, to ensuring that the value of central bank money in terms of goods and services is stable. But most money in economies everywhere is private money: deposits with commercial banks. In significant degree, financial stability is about safeguarding the stability of private money (deposits with the banking system) relative to central bank money. Prosaically, depositors with banks have to be confident that they can exchange their deposits at face value for our money – our notes; or that they can switch to another bank where they can be confident of that. At the level of the system, we need an “exchange rate” of unity for private money and central bank money. And we need wholesale funders of banks to be confident of that too. When that is secured, demand for our money is low, and society reaps the efficiency benefits of the private sector banking system. Absent that confidence, the payments system simply would not work. And the supply of credit would be imperilled, as we have rediscovered to the global economy’s great cost. These objectives – price stability, and banking system stability – are the two key facets of stability in a monetary economy. As recent events show, they can be affected profoundly by conditions in capital markets and in overseas financial systems. Focusing ultimately on the stability of our monetary system therefore clearly requires a broad view of financial markets more generally. Stability in the elemental sense I have described was profoundly threatened last autumn – when the universal crisis of confidence triggered by Lehmans’ failure tore the fabric of international commerce. That stability has been sustained owes everything to governments stepping in, effectively being prepared to borrow from the future in order to prop up the banking system now. In that sense, we are, of course, “beyond Financial Stability”, insofar as, ordinarily, we would regard instability as a state of affairs that requires such support. The Turner Report rehearses the analysis of how we got to that point. It rightly places weight on the baleful effects of persistent and cumulative global current and capital account imbalances. I dearly wish that the international authorities had taken on board the lessons from the 1990s EME crises about the vital importance of monitoring, and where necessary managing, national balance sheets – for large countries as well as EMEs. It is striking, however, that other analysts, including recently from the IMF, are starting to play down the part played by the international monetary system. I do not go along with that. There can BIS Review 39/2009 1 
surely be no disputing that macroeconomic imbalances have mattered greatly to the crisis, as they contributed to the build up of debt and, through the compression of risk-free rates and risk premia, the appreciation of asset prices. But in acknowledging that, we do not have to claim that of themselves such imbalances lead inevitably to financial instability. A necessary condition, in my view, is for faultlines to exist within the financial system itself – and the deeper they run, the greater will be the threat to stability. The identification and mitigation of such faultlines requires engagement with the details of the system. Those who argue that it is all down to global imbalances and that we did not need to know about leverage via CDOs and the shadow banking system and so on are equally wrong. But the scale of the macroeconomic imbalances that were allowed to accumulate surely raised the bar for resilience of the financial system, and probably beyond what was reasonable. We need to quit pointing the finger, alternatively, at global macroeconomic and financial system causes, and accept that it was both. The Turner Report does that. A few points on micro regulation  The Report and accompanying FSA Discussion Paper’s principal focus is, of course, micro regulation. I have just three points to add or emphasise on that this morning. Effective prudential supervision of individual firms relies on the line supervisors being prepared to substitute their views for those of management when they have good reason to believe that the viability or stability of a bank otherwise may be in peril. They need the confidence, when necessary, to face down management, and even boards; and also to be prepared to take the risk of being overruled on appeal. A respected, self-confident but restrained line supervisor, with the forensic skills to get to the heart of things, can do a very great deal for stability. It is terrific that Adair and Hector are renewing the emphasis on line supervision. (But, by the way, when supervisors do their job, their achievements are invisible and they get no thanks.) Second, it is important to remember that most bank failures have their roots in large or concentrated exposures. This crisis is in some respects no exception. It is, therefore, good news for the future that, ahead of this crisis, the EU was already planning to extend the bar on large credit exposures to interbank deposits. Line supervisors must additionally look for concentrated exposures to sectors or instruments; to give just one of many possible examples, large holdings of super-senior CDO tranches just might have been a pointer to the vulnerabilities at some large internationally active banks. And the possibility of fateful concentrations in bank funding structures should be given similar weight. If all that requires more reporting by banks, it would be worth it.  Third, effective prudential supervision is seriously impeded by complex group structures. That was a headline lesson from the failure of BCCI nearly two decades ago; and EU Directives were amended to make unsupervisable structures a ground for withholding or withdrawing authorisation, and so for exercising regulatory powers. But complexity is not just a convenient shield for wickedness. It can also make it hard for management and supervisors to figure out what is going on in a perfectly honest business. The explosion of what I referred to a couple of years ago as Vehicular Finance, with committed credit lines and reputational risk constituting umbilical cords back to parent or sponsoring banks, was precisely a manifestation of that variety of obfuscatory complexity. Supervisors around the world should not allow it. And, related to that, as the Turner Report rightly says, supervisors should get serious about working together on the oversight and regulation of international groups. The long-standing challenges of consolidated supervision are unfinished business, more than thirty years after the first Basel Concordat.  2 BIS Review 39/2009 
Micro-to-macroprudential Those issues, and even more those of capital and liquidity, shade into the debate about macroprudential oversight and regulation.  One explanation of the parlous state of the industrialised world banking system is that too many banks had made too many rotten individual-loan underwriting decisions. Quite plainly there was some of that: for example, manifestly in the US subprime market, in commercial property, and probably in some Leveraged Buy Outs. It would be the job of the authorities’ bank examiners, as they are termed elsewhere, to detect significant erosion in the quality of individual portfolios or underwriting standards, and get it fixed before it overwhelmed the system. Another, not mutually exclusive, explanation is that by virtue of holding large “trading” books that were marked to market, banks found themselves having to make very large portfolio write downs in the face of sharp rises in liquidity premia in asset markets. As highly-levered institutions – as banks are unavoidably: deposits are debt – those mark-downs depleted their net worth to the point of imperilling solvency. That caused a retrenchment in the availability of credit, helping to plunge the world economy into recession, and so impairing traditional loan books, in a vicious spiral. The point of this account is that it emphasises the role of banks’ leverage. Combined with maturity transformation, this unavoidably makes banks brittle. And that underlines just why our predecessors placed such great weight on the safety and soundness of banks. Indeed, the original reason for regulating capital was that an assurance of capital adequacy, for all but the most extreme circumstances, would make runs less likely. But that was hardly meant to lead to the neglect of liquidity highlighted a few years ago by one of my predecessors, Andrew Large, and others.  Liquidity We therefore welcome the Turner Report’s exploration of “core funding”. And we very much support, and have encouraged, the FSA’s plan that all banks should in future hold a minimum level of high-quality government bonds, on the grounds that only they carry a reasonable assurance of market liquidity in stressed conditions. I hope the same approach can be adopted internationally. Further, supervisors should be vigilant in ensuring that banks’ so-called “treasury” or “liquidity” portfolios are not concentrated in funding instruments, such as FRNs, issued by other banks. That turns out to have been all too prevalent. And they were not liquid when the music stopped. Years ago, regulators decided to deduct banks’ holdings of each other’s capital-instruments, to avoid the system as a whole generating illusory capital. The same principle could perhaps apply in liquidity regulation. The authorities also need to be clear about what level of stress, and/or what proportion of short-term liabilities, the stock liquidity buffer must cover. That must be a judgment for the authorities; and it must, as the Turner Report makes clear, be more demanding than in the past. But just as important, we must not imagine that the kind of modelling that can be applied to, say, credit risk and, perhaps, to some types of market risk can sensibly be carried across to liquidity risk. Liquidity goes wrong when there is, in the jargon, strategic interaction: I run (or sell) because I think you will etc. Liquidity buffers need to sustain confidence; if successful, the buffer is never needed. A time series of data showing low use of a liquidity buffer is not compelling evidence that a requirement was too high. Our successors must remember that in 10-20 years time. Of course, no liquidity buffer can be proof against all circumstances. Which is why central banks are in the business of providing liquidity insurance to the system. That insurance needs to be provided on terms that do not incite imprudent liquidity risks, and that are time consistent, in the sense that we avoid needing to recast our regime when really difficult times hit. The Bank set out its approach in the paper we issued last autumn on the launch of our Discount Window Facility, through which we stand ready to lend against a wide range of BIS Review 39/2009 3 
collateral at pre-determined fees to banks that are not facing fundamental problems of solvency or viability.  Capital, and capital-of-last-resort I have talked about liquidity partly because, as our community returns to thinking about bank supervision in terms of stability as well as consumer protection, it needs to be centre stage again; but also because we can think about capital regulation under the same broad headings. What should count as capital; what risks should it protect against; and what happens when the system turns out not to have enough capital?  On the definition of capital, I agree with the Turner Report that what matters to stability is common equity (and possibly, subject to further analysis, also instruments that can unambiguously be converted into common equity at the option of the bank or regulator). That is because confidence in a bank as a going concern is crucial to the stability of its deposit and wholesale funding base. Subordinated debt may well help to protect depositors in the event of liquidation, but it cannot absorb losses on a going-concern basis and so does little to avoid the incentive to run or, therefore, the slide into resolution. Nor does subordinated debt alter the position of retail depositors, who can look to the deposit-protection scheme, especially now that it provides 100% cover up to £50,000. Subordinated debt can enhance recoveries made by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. But it is not directly stability-enhancing. The composition of regulatory capital was allowed to become too complicated. Including debt instruments is effectively to allow double leverage. The Basel Committee is itself returning to this question.  As with liquidity, I do not want to say much today about how to measure the risks that capital should cover. I applaud the Turner Report’s analysis of “trading book” risks; as discussed in the Bank’s Financial Stability Review a few years ago, making Value at Risk the bedrock of market risk requirements allows capital to fall, or leverage to rise, during periods of unusually low volatility. The Basel Committee are addressing this. More generally, the degree of stress that capital should enable banks to withstand, whether against default risk or market risk, should be decided by the authorities not by individual banks, precisely because of the systemic significance of banks to the payments and credit system. Even when individual banks look adequately capitalised taken in isolation, the aggregate position may be more vulnerable taking into account common exposures to credit, market or liquidity risk, and cross-system exposures. Capital requirements for individual firms may, therefore, need to depend on how liquidity mismatched and how leveraged the system as a whole is. Even so, just as with liquidity, there will be rare episodes, which we must strive to make very rare, where there is a capital deficiency in individually significant banks, or even in the system as a whole. And, again analogously, we therefore need ex ante policies for catering with that.  There are two elements to such policies.  First, we need regimes for resolving distressed banks in an orderly way, outside of the insolvency regime applying to ordinary companies. The UK has taken a useful step forward in introducing a Special Resolution Regime for banks. We will need to keep its provisions under active review. Large and Complex Financial Institutions present a special challenge. Nearly a decade ago, a joint G10/Financial Stability Group, on which I served, articulated the imponderable scale of the challenge of winding up such a group. The conclusion was that it lay beyond the current capability of the authorities internationally; but that, nevertheless, we should work together – providing factbooks on firms and exchanging information – to put ourselves in the best possible position. None of that was done, and the FSF and G20 are, thankfully, now again underlining how vitally important it is. We need in particular to ensure that financial groups maintain information on the assets and liabilities of their legal entities; it is legal entities that 4 BIS Review 39/2009 
go into resolution not business divisions. Lehmans shouts that out loud and clear. We need to ensure that banks, however grand they are, keep information that would facilitate rapid payout from deposit-protection schemes. We need banks to have contingency funding plans that are shared with regulators and central banks. We need, more ambitiously, to address Too Big To Fail. And we need to do just massively better at working together internationally.  However much we do, I fear that the inescapable conclusion will be that we cannot rule out that very rarely the banking system will end up needing to be supported by some ultimate source of capital. If that is right, then society needs principles and policies for what might be called “Capital of Last Resort”, to sit alongside the Lender of Last Resort (LOLR) principles developed by and for central banks since the 19th century. Parts of the academic community have started to think about and advocate capital-insurance from the private sector, but over the long term we need to decide whether or not to have a policy for public sector capital insurance. At a high level, this faces exactly the challenges of central bank liquidity insurance. Its terms must not incentivise imprudent behaviour; and they must be time consistent. These were exactly the challenges faced by the Bank in articulating the terms of its Discount Window Facility. But the challenges are even greater in this area because the exit strategy from capital injections is so much more difficult; by potentially delivering control, capital-insurance is much more closely intertwined with issues of management; and because there would have to be clarity about treatment of all parts of the capital structure. I think that articulating and sticking to policies in this area will be one of the great challenges over the coming years and decades. Macroprudential: taming the credit cycle  It would all be a lot easier if we could tame the credit cycle. This is the debate about the missing “macroprudential instrument”. What would be the objective; is there in principle an instrument; would it work in practice in a world of free capital flows? Those debates are prior to questions of institutional responsibility. And they have a bearing on the parallel debate about the regulatory boundary, which is where I will begin. I start from the position that excessive leverage and maturity transformation in parts of the non-bank financial sector – funds, conduits, securities dealers, and so on – was predicated on the availability of plentiful credit on too-easy terms from the commercial banking system. Up to a point, the same goes for liquidity in asset markets. Of course, persistently strong demand for financial assets – crudely, rising prices – created an illusion of liquidity but, beyond that, the willingness and terms on which “market-makers” underpinned liquidity depended on their access to credit to finance inventory. And the ultimate private sector providers of such credit are commercial banks. One big question, therefore, is how far we could get in dampening the credit cycle by focusing on the provision of liquidity, and so leverage, by banks to other financial firms. That goes to whether hedge funds and other vehicles need to be brought within the net. Frankly, it is hard to know whether, internationally, the regulatory community tried and failed to control the leverage available to the non-bank financial sector; or whether it was not really attempted taking into account system-wide conditions. Either way, more information from non-banks would probably be needed to make such a policy workable. But a second question, perhaps the biggest, is whether “dampening the credit cycle” should be the goal at all; or, alternatively, whether it is a realistic goal. A very slightly more modest – but, in truth, still demanding – objective might be to concentrate on making banks themselves more resilient to economic or market shocks, so that it is less likely that they expose banking system fragility that amplifies an economic downturn. A third big question is about instruments. Lots of candidates are canvassed. Dynamic provisioning under which banks would, in the manner of previous generations, set aside general provisions as loan books grew. Capital requirements that increased with the rate of BIS Review 39/2009 5 
growth of balance sheets, or some measure of incipient stress. Variable margin requirements on the terms of credit provided to financial, or even real-economy, borrowers. A fourth big question is whether the chosen instrument(s), whatever it is, could be operated by rules or would require an element of top-down judgment. On that, I am inclined to the view that our community is unlikely to be able to write down a suitably robust rule. I have two reasons for that. One draws a parallel with monetary policy. The history of monetary policy, not least in this country, is littered with failed attempts to design an optimal rule, giving way to efforts to constrain the discretion of policymakers making judgments. I cannot see why we would be any better at developing rules for financial stability. As the structure of the financial system evolved, we would need to adapt the rule and would probably fail to spot the need to do so. But there is also something about the nature of financial stability problems that makes “rules” implausible to me. In the upswing of the credit cycle, there is often a collective-action problem. Even though individual banks may perceive risk as underpriced, not knowing for sure whether or when the party will end they hesitate to step off the rollercoaster for fear of damaging their business franchise. This is precisely why it is the job of the authorities to “take away the punchbowl as the party gets going”. I just cannot see how we could calibrate ex ante rules for the increase in capital requirements or whatever that would be needed to do that, but we would of course need somehow to find a way of sensibly constraining the discretion at the core of the alternative approach.  Even if we could resolve all those issues, a fifth big issue is how far individual national authorities would be able to operate in this field on their own, given free flows of capital internationally and cross-border banking. These big questions are, of course, inter-related. Most obviously, how far we could get in designing an instrument(s) and a process for its deployment will affect whether the objective should be to ameliorate the effects of economic shocks on the banks or also the effects of the credit-creation process on the economy. And the objective will have a bearing on whether it is host or home authorities who need to constrain a bank’s lending growth. That is a formidable agenda, and it underlines just how much there is to do.  Macroprudential: markets and infrastructure as part of the transmission mechanism But if we are to deliver and maintain stability, a macroprudential agenda cannot focus only on countercyclical capital (or margin) requirements. We need to focus on how large shocks might be transmitted through the financial system.  Again, there is an analogy with monetary policy. Effective monetary policy relies upon a rich and subtle understanding of the structure of the economy and how our policy decisions are transmitted to our final goals (the so-called “monetary transmission mechanism”). Equivalently, effective delivery of a financial stability mandate requires a rich and subtle understanding of the structure of the domestic and international financial system, and how developments in one part are transmitted to others. That means our range must continue to extend beyond banks to the capital markets and the financial infrastructure.  The analogy does not stop there. In the monetary sphere, policymakers in the 1980s and 1990s urged reforms to make the real economy, especially labour markets, more flexible, as that would reduce the burden on monetary policy in smoothing cyclical fluctuations. The analogue in the financial stability sphere is that the authorities need to help to identify and, crucially, remedy faultlines in the financial system. Whereas for monetary policy we want real-economy flexibility, for financial stability we want financial system resilience. And just as the monetary policy transmission mechanism evolves, so the structure of the financial system changes. The explosion of Vehicular Finance and the development of credit trading are just two recent examples that affected the current crisis. We therefore need a very high-quality, continuous assessment of emerging vulnerabilities in the system as a whole, and how it would behave under stress.  6 BIS Review 39/2009 
Internationally the official community has not distinguished itself on that front over recent years. Just three examples; there are more, I fear. First, there were too many large financial businesses for which an AAA rating was, fatally, more than a description of their credit standing; it constituted their business model. Examples include Fannie and Freddie; the Landesbanks; the US monoline insurers; the SIVs; and, if they can be thought to have a business model, the ABCPs. These institutions distorted the supply of credit across the global economy. (In the case of the monoline insurers, for structured finance they were effectively in the business of providing “end-of-the-world insurance with a settlement period of T+1”.)  An even wider group of private-sector AAA institutions were not required to collateralise derivatives-related counterparty-credit exposures. The effect for the system as a whole was to introduce an extraordinary vulnerability to a ratings downgrade of any of these institutions or structures. There was, in effect, a potentially systemic cliff. A second serious faultline in global capital markets – arguably the greatest – was the firm expectation of “no break the buck” in the massive global Money Market Mutual Fund industry; c. $3trn in the US, more or less the same size as commercial bank deposits. The failure to pay par at a major US money fund when Lehman collapsed helped trigger the unravelling of confidence across global markets. Constant net-asset value MMMFs have perhaps been, globally, the most important non-bank banks lying outside the scope of what I like to call the banking Social Contract: no prudential supervision, no “deposit” insurance, no access to the discount window, and yet nevertheless allowed to conduct maturity transformation and offer payments services. Although smaller in Europe than in the US, this industry does exist over here; the ECB even include money funds in their definition of monetary institutions and so in measures of broad money. But there is the added twist that during the boom a large part of their assets comprised bank CDs and conduit ABCP. In other words, they have essentially been an intermediary between the banks and corporate treasurers, insurance companies etc, who fund banks at one remove. As Paul Volker’s G30 report concludes, we need to review whether or not to continue to allow Constant NAV MMMFs; the alternative would be that they convert either into variable NAV funds (ie like any other mutual fund) or into regulated deposit-takers. A third faultline may have been the extension of mark-to-market accounting to (more or less) everyone or everything without attention to how the dynamics of the system as a whole would be affected. If liquidity premia can fluctuate materially, the effects on portfolio values can be material, increasing or reducing leverage and affecting risk-seeking or shedding behaviour. Accounting measures then become actors rather than purely passive measures. This is a world away from only a small handful of dealers marking to market. My point here is not that marking to market is necessarily flawed, but rather that the “rules of the game” for global finance matter. It is really no good anyone arguing against that: the debate needs to move on and, thanks to the Financial Stability Forum, probably is.  The moral of this story is that the details of the structure of our capital markets matter to stability. They may matter only in the event of very low probability shocks to the system. But policymakers must focus on containing the impact of such tail events. Systemic resilience is as much a part of a macroprudential approach as countercyclical capital requirements.  This is not just a matter of picking out those features of the system we should dislike. It should occasionally, but with restraint, be as much about what we do want. The current topical issue is whether CDS contracts, or vanilla OTC contracts, should be centrally cleared and exchange-traded. Ideally yes, which will underline the importance of the integrity of central counterparty risk management, and systemic oversight by the authorities. But the broader issue is that the authorities should be ready to nudge intermediaries, asset managers and infrastructure providers into those market-development initiatives that are clearly desirable in the interests of stability but need not harm efficiency. BIS Review 39/2009 7 
Put another way, the “plumbing” matters. We have positive reasons, as well as negative ones, for believing that. Two examples. Fifteen to twenty years ago, central banks moved wholesale payment systems on to a Real-Time Gross Settlement basis. Cutting through the details, this meant that settlement banks are no longer exposed to each other during the day for the payments they send each other; and, in the UK and most other countries, the central bank delivers this without taking unsecured intra-day credit exposures itself. Without those unheralded reforms, I have little doubt that last autumn’s crisis would have been calamitous on a scale massively exceeding the dreadful near-seizure we did experience in the money markets. That example was a public sector initiative; the banks were more or less herded into it. But there is an equally important private sector initiative. Without the collateralisation of OTC-derivative counterparty credit exposures, the credit spillovers from firm and fund failures around the world would surely have been much greater.  What those two examples demonstrate is that the authorities and practitioners can get things right – when we focus on what will matter in bad states of the world.  Summary The Turner Report makes a big contribution to developing the agenda for reforming the global financial system, including on macroprudential oversight. If anything, I may have added to that agenda this morning.  We need to undertake serious research and analysis on whether we can develop a macro instrument for taming the credit cycle.  But, in making the system more resilient, we cannot rely solely on bank capital or loan market requirements. That endeavour – heading-off incipient stress, and keeping the “rules of the game” up to date and fit for purpose – requires high-quality surveillance of the system as a whole, bringing together analysis, experience and intelligence on markets, the macro environment, the infrastructure, firms. We have to identify and address faultlines. The system’s strengths and weak points “morph” over time. One era’s solution may be today’s or tomorrow’s faultline: Fannie Mae is an example of that. And, for when those efforts fail, we need to be clearer about how the authorities will intervene to preserve stability, and whether we can construct a “capital of last resort” policy that does not create perverse incentives during “peacetime”.  Surveillance, building system resilience, crisis management. A macroprudential approach to stability has to do rather more than bring together a central bank’s macroeconomists and a micro regulator’s line supervisors. What lies in between matters hugely: markets, payment systems, the plumbing. I should like to think that, amongst others, central banks can bring something to this, drawing on our conjunctural expertise, but also on our operational presence in money and bond markets and at the heart of the payments and settlements system. Certainly the Bank will engage actively with the FSA, HMT, overseas central banks, and the industry in designing new “rules of the game” for the global financial system.  8 BIS Review 39/2009 
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi: Developments and prospects for the European economy in 2009 Speech by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Conference “Altagamma: Scenari 2009”, Milan, 30 March 2009. *      *      * I would like first of all to thank the President of Altagamma, Leonardo Ferragamo, for the invitation to participate to this conference.  The issue I was asked to address – “Developments and Prospects for the European Economy in 2009” – is certainly not an easy one. Never has it been so hard to make a forecast, not only about the future but also about the present and even the recent past (although it might sound paradoxical). The forecasts of major international organisations are being systematically revised downwards, not only with respect to the next few months, but mainly due to what happened over the past months, which turns out to be much worse than expected. The last ECB forecast, from early March, was worse than the one published a few weeks earlier by the European Commission mainly because it was able to include preliminary data for the last quarter of 2008, showing a GDP fall of 1.5%. In the last few days other forecasts have come out, based on more recent data, which are even more pessimistic. The difficulty in making forecasts in these circumstances derives from the fact that available economic models are not calibrated to take into account shocks of a size similar to the one we are experiencing, nor are they capable of understanding the nature and mechanisms of the transmission process.  Rather than elaborating a new scenario, which risks becoming obsolete quite rapidly, I would like to share with you some reflections on the current crisis and on possible developments. In this respect, I would like to remind that, given that the Governing Council will meet on this coming Thursday, we are in the so-called Purdah period in which we abstain from making comments on monetary policy. What I will say should thus in no way be associated to possible monetary policy decisions, and I would appreciate if the media reporting on this event could acknowledge it. The starting point of this reflection is that before the start of the crisis the world economy was not in a balanced position. On the contrary, it was characterized by several imbalances, within individual economies and across countries.  At the global level, the world economy experienced wide and growing current account imbalances. On the one side, the US ran continuous deficits since the 1980s, with the exception of a couple of years, and growing over time, reaching 6% of GDP in 2006. On the other hand several Asian countries, notably China, recorded growing current account surpluses (which in the case of China reached over 10% of GDP in 2007). The financing of the US deficit took place largely through the purchase of dollar denominated Government bonds by the rest of the world, resulting in the accumulation of huge liquid reserves, in particular in China, Japan and oil exporting countries.  Another international imbalance derived from the growing pressure that world demand exercised on the scarce resources of the planet, in particular primary commodities, such as oil, generating a sharp price rise until mid 2008. Primary commodity price developments have put into question the convenience of several durable products with high energy intensity, thus reducing their demand.  Imbalances have emerged also within countries, generating excessive growth in some sectors, such as finance and housing, and large financial flows, especially household debt. In the US all these imbalances have developed at the same time. Just to give an example, in the five years before the crisis the share of profits made in the financial sector profits rose to BIS Review 39/2009 1 
40% of overall corporate profits, the double with respect to the average of the previous thirty years. From 2002 to 2007 the world economy grew at a yearly average of 4.3%, pulled by international trade growing by 7.3% per year. This has been the most intense period of post-war growth. It has also been the most fragile, as a result of domestic and global imbalances.  This suggests that won’t be possible to exit from this crisis and return on a sustainable growth unless the imbalances which have accumulated until a couple of years ago are reabsorbed. It implies in particular that some sectors of economic activity which grew in an unbalanced way in the past might be substantially downsized, not only in the short term but also over the medium term, when the world economy will start growing again.  One of the sectors that is likely to be downsized, at least for some time, is finance, given that risk aversion is likely to remain elevated for some years, reducing the scope for innovation. Financial regulation will tend to reduce the scope for non regulated sectors. The whole financial system will have less leverage, lower margins and thus less employment than in the so-called “golden years”. Another example is housing, where prices are unlikely to return soon to the pre-crisis levels, especially in some countries. Also in this sector profit margins are likely to be lower and so will investments and employment. Excess supply and debt might require years before being absorbed again, as shown in the early 2000s after the burst of the high-tech bubble. Other sectors which could be downsized in a permanent way are those in which technology turned out to be out of pace with medium term trends in energy prices. Another grave side of the current crisis – which was also largely unpredicted – is the collapse of international trade, which has brought the process of economic integration backwards, some sort of de-globalization. This has hit exports and imports of all countries, in a rather brutal way, with multiplier effects on investment, consumption and employment. The sectors which have been more seriously hit are those that were more exposed to international competition, which had grown strongly over the recent years thanks to the global integration of production processes. Those countries which relied most on exports and manufacturing production have been hit hardly by a crisis which had originated in the financial sector. According to some estimates, around 90% of world trade was partially or totally supported by financial instruments, which in the past years had also experienced a rapid process of innovation. The crisis of confidence which burst after the failure of Lehman brothers, stopped financial flows, especially those between agents located in different countries which are less acquainted with each other and base their transactions on market-based liquid and sophisticated credit instruments, which are however also riskier. The reflow of capital towards the major financial centres and the de-leveraging process, which started in the second half of September 2008, has induced banks to reduce their non-core activities.  Export credit, which consists in financing not only the export company but also the foreign importer which buys from the exporter, entails higher risks than domestic activities. Credit lines with foreign counterparties, which require a greater use of capital, tend to be reduced, especially for small and medium size enterprises and towards emerging markets. We are observing recently that trade finance is going back to simpler instruments, such as documentary credit and confirmed letters of credit, which substantially reduce risk. The link between financial integration and trade integration has been the transmission mechanism through which the loss of confidence in the financial system has spread to the real economy, and from the country where the crisis started to the rest of the world. This implies that restarting the trade integration process will depend confidence coming back in all the components of the global financial system. The overall solidity of the global system depends on its weakest part. During the last few months enormous resources have been put in place, on both sides of the Atlantic, to support the commitment made by the policy authorities not to let any systemically important financial institution fail. The effects of these measures are starting to be appreciated.  2 BIS Review 39/2009 
Once the financial system is stabilised, time will be needed to rebuild a financial infrastructure for international trade comparable to the one prevailing before the crisis. This means that the pace of exports and imports growth during the recovery could be slower than before the crisis.  Another risk factor for the rebound of world trade, over the medium term, relates to the fragmented network of production, distributed across borders, which contributed to maximize efficiency. This network has been hardly hit. For instance, trade in euro area intermediate products fell in January 2009 by 20%, compared to the previous year. The protectionist pressures and the slowdown in foreign direct investments might lead to a restructuring of production, which might take time and turn out to be less flexible and efficient.  For those countries more open to international trade, which will be hit by the contraction of exports and imports, re-directing idle resources towards domestic demand might be slower and more difficult than expected. To sum up, a thorough analysis of the causes of this crisis suggest that it is due not only to cyclical factors but also structural ones, associated to the downsizing of sectors which had grown too quickly and excessively in the past. This is not a novelty. During al recessions some sectors suffer more than others. Think about the burst of the high tech bubble in 2000. However, never before was the over-indebtedness so spread out and intertwined with the real economy. This explains why it is so difficult to understand how intense and lasting the downward adjustment of economic activity will be and how much dynamism there can be after the through. This reflection suggests that the cyclical pick-up will hardly bring back economic activity to a level comparable with the one prevailing before the crisis, but rather to a lower level. This means that at the steady state, after the economy has stabilised and gone back to a growth path, production potential is likely to be significantly lower than before the crisis. This means that the so-called output gap, which measures the distance between the level of production and its potential, and which is generally used to estimate the path of economic recovery, could be substantially lower than the one estimated with traditional statistical methodology. In other words, this crisis might have affected the structure of the “world production function”, as a result of the downsizing of some productive sectors, such as finance, and the permanent change in relative prices.  This is particularly relevant not only for economic analysis put also for the conduct of macroeconomic policies. These policies, in particular fiscal and monetary policies, contribute to cyclical stabilization by bringing forward resources in the low phase of the cycle and delaying payment to the favourable phase. For instance, an increase in public expenditures financed through debt delays payment to the cyclical upturn. Monetary policy also acts through incentives aimed at shifting consumption and savings over time. The sustainability of these policies crucially depends on the pace of economic growth and income level achieved over the medium term, after the crisis is over.  Given the uncertainty on the structural and cyclical components of the current crisis, there is the risk of a divergent assessment of the sustainability of economic policies, between financial markets on the one side and policy authorities on the other. The latter might have the tendency, or the temptation, to calibrate the policy response on an income target as high as the pre-crisis one, as if the crisis was entirely of a cyclical nature rather than structural, while financial markets might consider lower levels of potential income over the next few years, as a consequence of the structural effects of the crisis. Such a divergence might impair the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies.  It might be useful in this respect to recall the experienced of the 1970s, after the first oil crisis, when economic policies did not take into account that the higher oil price had reduced potential growth in advanced economies and calibrated their policy response to an unrealistic target.  BIS Review 39/2009 3 
What can be drawn from the above considerations is that the exit from the current crisis does not depend on macroeconomic policies only, but also on structural factors, such as the functioning of goods and labour markets. As I already mentioned, the contraction of sectors that had grown excessively before the crisis is likely to have a structural component, lasting over the medium term. This means that not all the employment lost in these sectors during the slowdown might be reabsorbed during the recovery. Some labour will have to be reallocated to other sectors, to avoid weighing on growth and on public finances, and on social conditions. This raises the need for accompanying short term macroeconomic policies with measures aimed at reallocating idle resources, for instance by enhancing training, human capital, market flexibility and income stabilizers.  Measures aimed at improving competitiveness are also required, especially in those sectors exposed to international competition and in those countries which experienced poor performance even prior to the crisis, due to low productivity growth. Furthermore, the global dimension of the current crisis shows the need to support trade finance, in particular through traditional instruments of risk insurance. Experience shows that measures aimed at postponing the problems, such as early retirement, should be avoided, as they aggravate public finances and slow down production potential. Differently from previous crisis, the current one takes place in a phase of demographic stagnation, in which life expectancy increases while birth rates are falling. In a situation similar to that of Italy, an increase in the overall number of retired would dramatically worsen the working environment for the younger generation, which would have to pay for the higher contributions to finance the pension system. Under such circumstances all should be done to maintain a high participation rate in the labour market. The highest risk, in this uncertain environment, is to limit policy action to the short term horizon, relying on stimulating the cycle without addressing the necessary structural reforms which would foster a better allocation of resources during the recovery. We would loose precious time and would find ourselves down the road with problems even greater than we can imagine. It would be a grave mistake. Thank you for your attention.  4 BIS Review 39/2009 
Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Financial stability through collaboration and understanding Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas), at the Insurance Congress of Developing Countries (ICDC) 2009, Makati City, 25 March 2009. *      *      * Atty. Eduardo Malinis, Insurance Commissioner and Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Insurance Congress of Developing Countries 2009, other distinguished speakers, distinguished delegates to this Insurance Congress, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  To our visiting delegates, Welcome to Manila! Welcome to the Philippines! I hope you’ve had or you will have the chance to partake of the many options to help further “stimulate” our domestic economy. I am sure all of us in this room have heard about the different financial stability and fiscal stimulus packages, being pursued by economies across the globe, to help stem the impact of the current global financial and economic crisis. I am certain the organizers of ICDC Manila 2009 have also put together their “own” version of a post-meeting stimulus package to complement the many interesting conference breakout sessions. For my part, I’d like to encourage all of you to participate as actively in that endeavor as you would in the different sessions in the next three days. Let me begin my remarks this morning by thanking Commissioner Ed Malinis and the Congress organizers for inviting me to speak before you today. At first blush, the keynote message for a gathering of insurers to be delivered by the governor of a central bank that supervises only the banking sector, may be a bit peculiar. But if one seriously looks at the situation, it is indeed quite reflective of the theme of the Congress, which is Financial Stability through Collaboration and Understanding.  Ladies and gentlemen, at no other time than now has the need for promoting financial stability been more imperative. As we are all keenly aware, the current financial turmoil has gone beyond the borders of the epicenter of the financial crisis – the US and the major economies – and has reached the shores of emerging markets. More importantly, the global financial turmoil has transcended the bounds of the financial realm and has crossed over to the real sector of most economies, including several represented here today. You will be pleased to know that my remarks this morning will be brief. I only have two messages that I wish to bring across, in light of our desire for financial stability. First is that, information efficiency must be created and maintained among financial regulators. As we have witnessed in this current crisis, the lines delineating the financial institutions that make up the financial system have become at times blurred, making improved collaboration among financial regulators exigent. Second, there must be a conscious effort among regulators to devote more resources to the regulation of the conduct of business. There is often the temptation during a large-scale (global) crisis, such the one we are in at the moment, to speak only about systemically important institutions. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we must be careful not to forget the public that ultimately we serve. We must remember that the financial sophistication of the investing public may not necessarily coincide with the pace of financial innovation. This creates a gap that could result in the public not fully appreciating the products and new structures that they are investing in, thereby unduly exposing them to risk.  I.  The need for information efficiency In discussing my first point, which is the need for information efficiency, I’d like to highlight two recent developments in the global financial markets. First, the convergence among BIS Review 38/2009 1 
different types of financial institutions. And second, the convergence in the framework for financial regulation and supervision.  A.  Convergence among different types of financial institutions The financial crisis in the US, as we now understand it, is partly explained by the relatively loose regulation of entities heavily involved in financial innovation, including the oversight of the sale of these products to the wider public. Financial markets have developed in recent years so that the same financial products are sold across different financial sub-sectors – from banks to insurance companies, to securities firms, with several cross-combinations thereof. In addition, the emergence (through common ownership) of financial conglomerates that encompass the different types of financial institutions has eroded the long-standing barriers that kept these business lines apart. With these changes, it has become important that financial regulators clearly understand the mechanisms for passing on of risks among these different sub-sectors.  Let me illustrate. The distress certain insurance companies currently face can be directly traced to their exposure to risks that originated in the banking system, including structured products and derivatives whose underlying assets were sub-prime mortgages. This further highlights the fact that the risks to financial soundness of insurance firms may now also arise from the asset side of their balance sheets, a clear departure from the traditional insurance firm risk management practice that focused exclusively on the underwriting risks associated with insurance liabilities.  Indeed, the barriers that used to separate the analysis of risks in different lines of business have slowly been breaking down. To give you another example, unlike in their old (standard) business models, banks are now paying more attention to the adequacy of pricing risk exposures so as to at least cover expected losses. In many business models, this is called the probability function for loss given default. Curiously, this is central to and is a long-standing practice among insurance firms. As we are now able to appreciate, this product and financial structure convergence has been driven by financial liberalization and advances in information and financial technology. Developments in risk management and in valuation methodologies also helped to heighten convergence. These factors nurtured convergence, particularly during the extended low-interest rate environment – referred to as The Great Moderation – when market participants sought to enhance yield and “offload” or spread risk.  B.  Convergence in the framework of prudential regulation and supervision  A second major development in the financial market, which makes information efficiency among regulators urgent, is the convergence in the framework of prudential regulation and supervision. Just as in banking, for instance, a set of core principles now lays out the broad prudential framework in insurance too. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) has released just two weeks ago an Issues Paper on Group-Wide Solvency Assessment and Supervision. This sets out the future IAIS work on the development of a comprehensive suite of supervisory papers on group-wide solvency assessment and supervision. One could look at this as the international insurance industry’s version of the capital adequacy framework under Basel II for banks.  It is not only, however, the framework for prudential regulation and supervision that has converged. At the national level (counting over 30 countries now), there has also been a physical convergence of the different financial supervisory bodies – more specifically the establishment of “integrated supervisors” (i.e., supervisors that are responsible for at least two (2) types of financial institutions).  2 BIS Review 38/2009 
Internationally though, the convergence has not really been physical but only intellectual, with the creation of the Joint Forum. The Joint Forum is composed of international financial supervisory organizations, namely, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and the IAIS. The Forum has been performing a valuable role in identifying differences in prudential arrangements across sectors and in considering the ever larger set of issues of common interest across the different supervisory communities. C.  The Philippine case In the Philippines, we do not have an integrated supervisor for the financial system although, as I will explain later, there are existing collaborative arrangements among the different financial supervisory agencies in order to achieve our goal of a stable financial system. Supervision of the Philippine financial system follows a “silo” approach, i.e., each supervisory agency is responsible for supervision of a certain segment of the system – (1) the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) for banks and quasi-banks, their financial allied subsidiaries and affiliates; non stock savings and loan associations, and pawnshops; (2) the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for investment houses, financing companies, securities dealers/brokers, investment companies, and pre-need companies; and (3) the Insurance Commission (IC) for insurance and reinsurance companies, insurance brokers, and mutual benefit associations. While the BSP supervises the largest financial groups holding the bulk of the financial system’s resources, in some instances, the existing mandates of the three supervisory agencies result in overlaps in supervisory jurisdictions. These overlaps are, however, remedied by our continuous collaborative efforts. Most notable of these collaborative efforts is the establishment in 2004 of the Financial Sector Forum (FSF), which is similar to the Joint Forum but only on a national scale. The FSF is comprised of the three supervisory agencies – the BSP, the SEC and the IC – together with the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC). The members of the FSF are the heads of the four member agencies, with the BSP Governor as the Chair. FSF is essentially a cooperative effort without any legal mandate lest it be construed as being an integrated supervisory body.  A quick survey among the participants in this Congress will show that there is no clearly identifiable single optimal model for supervision. There are motivations commonly cited for establishing consolidated supervision, although no standard has been established for its design. These motivations include 1) regulatory consistency and coordination to harmonize rules and standards, 2) the difficulty that hybrid financial instruments and presence of financial conglomerates pose to separate regulators, and 3) the value of economies of scale given limited financial and human resources.  What is evident in all discussions, however, is the need to share information efficiently, regardless of the form of supervision structure present in the economy. Ladies and gentlemen, what is incumbent among financial supervisors in order to facilitate and strengthen financial stability at this time, is to create and maintain an information sharing structure that will allow all to react swiftly and preemptively to changes in the operating environment. This will certainly help prevent the occurrence of a crisis of the magnitude and breadth we’re seeing today.  II. Conduct of business supervision Let me now move on to my second message which, I believe is an issue that is of particular interest to developing countries.  One characteristic of developing countries is the relatively weaker financial sophistication of their consumers, which makes the customers quite vulnerable to financial scams, including relatively simple ones. I believe therefore that financial supervision in developing countries BIS Review 38/2009 3 
should not only focus on setting prudential standards, but also on strengthening conduct of business oversight of financial institutions (i.e., supervision of the business practices, including dealings with customers). The increased globalization of the financial industry presents a further complication as globalization improves the availability of and access to complex financial products across developing countries, without necessarily discriminating among levels of sophistication of the target markets.  Ensuring that financial institutions conduct their business in a proper and transparent manner should therefore be a primary concern for financial supervisors in developing countries. Failure to ensure proper business conduct by financial institutions would have adverse implications on market confidence, which, in turn, could threaten the viability of the financial markets as source of funds that could support the productive capacity of the economy.  This point could not be more apparent in the developments in the global financial markets we are witnessing right now. The fallout from the global financial crisis left many investors in financial products with substantial losses, and exposed some investment schemes as economically unsound if not totally fraudulent. The immediate impact was the weakening of confidence in financial markets, which played a key role in stoking the crisis. Restoring market confidence through conduct of business supervision is therefore essential in order to restore the smooth functioning of financial markets.  In the Philippines, financial supervisors, independently and in collaboration with the Financial Sector Forum, have already undertaken initiatives and issued rules to improve the conduct of business by financial institutions, especially those relating to complex products and services. The BSP, for instance, came out with circulars requiring banks and trust entities to take a more pro-active responsibility in marketing their derivative and trust products by conducting client suitability tests. Under these rules, the bank/trustee shall perform a client profiling process under the general principles on client suitability assessment to guide the client in choosing investment outlets that are best suited to his objectives, risk tolerance, preferences and experience. In addition, the BSP has tightened disclosure requirements covering the interest structure on credit cards, fees paid on loans and deposits, and the management and custody fees for trust funds. The FSF, for its part, has also intensified the release of advisories against fraudulent and unsound corporate financial practices. Concluding remarks Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to conclude my remarks this morning by recapping my two points.  The increasing convergence of the different types of financial institutions and financial products calls for closer collaboration among the different financial supervisory agencies or units in order to ensure financial stability. For the developing countries, however, another important issue is the refocusing of financial supervision to include not only the oversight role of supervisors in the safety and soundness of financial institutions, but also the oversight role of supervisors in the conduct of business of these institutions.  I trust that these would be food for thought among you, as you consider the many different issues that surround financial stability during these very difficult and challenging times.  I wish you all a productive and meaningful Congress. Thank you very much for your attention, and good day. 4 BIS Review 38/2009 
Hirohide Yamaguchi: Recent economic and financial developments and the conduct of monetary policy Speech by Mr Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at a Meeting with Business Leaders, Otaru, 25 March 2009. *      *      * Introduction I would like to thank the financial and business communities in Otaru for giving me the opportunity to speak here today. I would also like to thank you for your close cooperation with our Sapporo Branch in providing information on the economic and financial situation of the region. The information is very valuable in enabling us to accurately grasp current economic and financial conditions in Japan and formulate the conduct of monetary policy. I visited Otaru previously a number of times in connection with the closing of the Bank of Japan's Otaru Branch in 2002 and its remodeling as the Bank of Japan Otaru Museum. Closure of the branch was not easy for the local community to accept, but I am very glad to hear that the museum has become well known and welcomed its 500 thousandth visitor in May 2008, five years after its opening. This successful transition owes a great deal to the understanding and cooperation of the local community. Before we exchange views, I will speak about recent economic and financial developments in Japan and abroad and also about policy responses in major countries. In particular, I will describe my view of the current substantial economic downturn and the economic outlook, and how the authorities worldwide, including the Bank, have acted, as well as the thinking behind their actions. I.  Global financial markets and economic developments A.  The background of the turmoil in global financial markets and economic downturn I will start with developments in global financial markets and the world economy. The turmoil in global financial markets began in the summer of 2007, but the situation worsened suddenly when the markets were hit by the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September of last year. Market participants' and investors' concerns about the creditworthiness of their trading partners, or counterparty risk, intensified, and as a result the volume of market transactions dropped sharply and market liquidity dried up. These developments subsequently caused a widening of credit spreads on corporate bonds and a chain reaction of financial institutions' failures and deteriorating performance in many countries, with prices of financial products – especially securitized ones – dropping and these products eventually becoming nonperforming assets of the financial institutions holding them. As you know, the turmoil in global financial markets and the subsequent global economic downturn was triggered by the U.S. subprime mortgage problem, which surfaced in the summer of 2007. This problem, however, was merely a prominent example of corrections to various financial and economic imbalances that had accumulated. Looking back, the world economy enjoyed favorable conditions until a couple of years ago, and unprecedentedly high growth rates of around 5 percent continued from 2004 through 2007. Notwithstanding the high growth, prices were generally stable due mainly to an expansion of global supply capacity resulting from the entry of emerging economies into the market economy. Amid the high economic growth and low inflation, interest rates worldwide remained low for a prolonged period. BIS Review 38/2009 1 
In this continued benign environment of high growth, low inflation, and low interest rates with growing optimism about prospects, financial and economic activity overheated and imbalances accumulated. This overheating caused a number of things to happen. For example, the rapid growth of emerging economies significantly increased the demand for resources such as crude oil, and led to a surge in commodity prices. Investors and financial institutions eased their credit standards, and a global credit bubble emerged, as seen in the U.S. subprime mortgage problem. Looking at developments in final demand on a global basis, not only industrialized economies in North America and Europe but also emerging and commodity-exporting economies experienced robust private consumption, particularly of durable consumer goods, and also very strong business fixed investment. These were all indications of the overheating of financial and economic activity. The current global financial crisis and the large economic downturn can therefore be viewed as part of the process of correcting imbalances that had accumulated. These developments suggest that the current financial crisis and economic downturn were essentially caused by the cycle of the generation and bursting of a global credit bubble, or the cycle of the overheating and corrections of financial and economic activity, similar to cycles that occurred repeatedly in the past. Looking back over the previous two decades, we can see many boom-and-bust cycles: Japan's asset price bubble in the late 1980s, the Asian currency crisis in the late 1990s, and the global IT bubble in the early 2000s. But the most recent cycle has brought a worldwide economic downturn that is much larger than any in recent history, with distinctive features of "simultaneity" and "rapidity." I will now describe the background of this simultaneous and rapid downturn of the world economy in terms of three features: the progress of globalization in financial activity; the progress of globalization in economic activity; and IT innovations. Taking the progress of globalization in financial activity first, financial institutions and investors around the world now carry out a large volume of cross-border financial transactions and invest in a variety of financial assets. The U.S. subprime mortgage problem had immediate repercussions also on Western European financial institutions because they made large investments in securitized products backed by U.S. subprime mortgages. Financial institutions and investors in the United States and Western Europe had an important role channeling funds to emerging economies in regions such as Central and Eastern Europe and in Latin America. Since these financial institutions suddenly scaled back their exposures to emerging economies, the financial crises of the United States and Western Europe have spread to the rest of the world. The second feature of the background is the progress of globalization in economic activity. Since the 1990s, emerging economies – the NIEs, the BRICs, the ASEAN countries, and the former centrally planned economies – have become full-fledged members of the market economy. Although these economies continued to enjoy a level of growth higher than the industrialized economies until recently, they have now decelerated significantly due to the outbreak of turmoil in global financial markets and the drop in their exports caused by the downturn in the U.S. and European economies. Emerging economies increased their presence in the global marketplace not only as production bases of durable consumer goods and parts for industrialized economies but also as a huge market for the latter's products. Consequently, the decrease in the industrialized economies' exports to emerging economies has aggravated the economic deterioration in the industrialized economies. It is clear that an interregional adverse feedback loop between trading partners – a process in which both imports and exports of individual countries decline, resulting in a further economic stagnation of all countries involved – is now operating around the globe, irrespective of the level of economic development. The third feature of the background is IT innovations, which have supported the progress of globalization in financial and economic activity. The widespread use and popularization of IT systems has supported globalization through the increased speed of transactions, reductions 2 BIS Review 38/2009 
in the interregional information gap, and a global network of transactions. The breakthrough in information processing capacity has enabled the formation of massive financial trading systems as well as payment and settlement systems, both of which process an enormous amount of trading information in a second. Ironically, these sophisticated systems perform equally well in times of contraction in financial transactions and economic activity. In the current environment, they accelerated the speed of contraction and may have caused a sudden unwinding of imbalances, leading to the rapid economic downturn. B.  The current state of and outlook for the world economy With the abrupt contraction of credit and the drop in commercial trade around the globe, many economies are inevitably facing either recession or a slowdown. U.S. economic conditions have deteriorated significantly. The housing market has been undergoing adjustments, and business and consumer spending behavior has become cautious reflecting tight funding conditions and greater uncertainty about economic prospects. In European economies, in addition to a decrease in exports, domestic demand has also been declining partly due to financial institutions' tightening of lending standards. Emerging economies and commodity-exporting economies, as I described earlier, have been slowing because their exports have decreased reflecting the U.S. and European economic deterioration and also because financial conditions have worsened reflecting increased capital outflow. Thus, in many economies an adverse feedback loop is operating – a process in which production, income, and expenditure spiral downward with a decrease in, for example, exports as a starting point. Simultaneously operating worldwide is yet another adverse feedback loop, between financial and economic activity – a process in which worsening economic conditions due to financial institutions' tightening of lending standards squeeze the institutions' profits, and this in turn further tightens their lending standards. We are often asked whether the current global economic downturn might evolve to become as serious as the Great Depression of the 1930s. The difference between the Great Depression and the current economic downturn is relatively clear if one looks at the policy responses by the relevant authorities worldwide. Unlike the time of the Great Depression, when the authorities could not take effective measures in response to failures of financial institutions, the authorities in many countries today have already formed a framework to protect depositors and are expeditiously injecting public funds into financial institutions in distress. Other differences are that currently governments and central banks in major countries are promptly taking fiscal and monetary policy actions and the system of free trade between nations is being basically maintained. However, the following questions should continue to be kept in mind: (1) whether the actions that have been taken to date to secure financial system stability are sufficient when the adverse feedback loop between financial and economic activity is still operating; (2) what specific means should be employed to compensate for the weakness in effective demand; (3) whether current financial conditions are sufficiently accommodative relative to the severity of the deterioration in economic conditions; and (4) whether protectionism will reemerge, with too much support being given to domestic industry. I think it is important to continue analyzing the current difficult situation coolly from a contemporary perspective, neither overstating nor understating developments, and referring to the lessons learned from the past rather than trying to make imperfect comparisons with the past. Looking ahead, since the current financial crisis and economic downturn are a process of correction of various imbalances that had accumulated over the past several years, the present severe situation will likely continue for some time. For the world economy to return to a recovery path, the following conditions need to be fulfilled: (1) the U.S. and European financial systems will have to regain stability, reducing downward pressures on the world economy from the financial side; and (2) at the same time, adjustments in asset prices, production, and excessive capital stock will have to make progress, paving the way for a recovery in aggregate demand. However, there are lingering concerns about the U.S. and BIS Review 38/2009 3 
European financial systems, and the drastic disposal of nonperforming assets has only just begun. There is no clear sign of improvement in indicators for major economies at this point, and it will be some time before fiscal and monetary policy actions in these economies fully take effect. The Bank expects that, from the latter half of fiscal 2009, global financial markets will regain stability and overseas economies will move out of their deceleration phase. However, given the current state of the global economy, it is inevitable that uncertainties about the outlook are great. II.  Economic and financial developments in Japan A.  The current state of and outlook for Japan's economy Now I will discuss economic and financial developments in Japan. Japan's economy started to decelerate from the spring of last year, and since the autumn exports and production have been experiencing one of the sharpest drops ever. In January this year, exports and industrial production fell by 15.8 percent and 10.2 percent respectively, on a month-on-month basis, both showing a decline comparable to the sharpest falls in history. In addition, domestic demand has become weaker against the background of declining corporate profits and the worsening employment and income situation in the household sector. Against this background, the Bank's assessment is that Japan's economic conditions have deteriorated significantly and are likely to continue deteriorating for the time being. Real GDP contracted in the October-December quarter last year by 12.1 percent on an annualized quarter-on-quarter basis, the sharpest decline since the period immediately after the first oil crisis, and this figure supports the Bank's assessment. The rates of real GDP growth for the United States and the euro area in the same quarter were minus 6.2 percent and minus 5.7 percent, respectively, and the fact that Japan's economy contracted more sharply underscores the severity of the country's current economic conditions. The fact that the downturn is more severe in Japan than in the U.S. and Western European economies, from which the global economic turbulence stemmed, seems to be due mainly to the growth mechanism of Japan's economy that has operated for some years. Japan's economy continued to grow from early 2002 until recently, moderately perhaps, but uninterruptedly. The background to this long period of growth was provided by – in addition to Japanese firms' efforts to reduce excessive debt and capital stock – the favorable environment of a rapidly growing world economy. In this situation, Japan established an economic growth mechanism that is primarily based on production for export of durable consumer goods and capital goods, especially automobiles, electrical machinery, and general machinery. I believe that this may be due partly to the following facts: (1) due to the declining birthrate and the aging population, rapid growth of domestic demand could not be expected; and (2) the yen was on a depreciating trend until the middle of 2007. In fact, the industries manufacturing the three types of products I just mentioned account for about half of industrial production in Japan, while the share of their counterparts in the United States is only about 20 percent. About 65 percent of all domestically produced automobiles were exported in 2008, a great increase from about 55 percent in 2002. With regard to general machinery, external orders, led by strong demand from member countries of the European Union (EU) and commodity-exporting and emerging economies, grew steadily from 2002 until 2007, increasing by slightly over 50 percent during the period. The ongoing global economic downturn has delivered a blow to this growth mechanism of Japan's economy. A large drop in real GDP in the October-December quarter was also observed in South Korea, Taiwan, and Germany – all of which have economies with a high share of manufacturing industries sensitive to changes in exports, such as those producing durable consumer goods, capital goods, and parts for both. In addition, in the case of Japan, it seems that the rapid appreciation of the yen from the summer of last year has amplified 4 BIS Review 38/2009 
downward pressure on exports that already existed due to a drop in final demand overseas. Furthermore, in Japan the share of domestically produced parts and materials is higher than in other countries such as the United States, and therefore a decrease in exports tends to adversely affect even industries that are not export-oriented. These industries are cutting production sharply to reduce excessive inventories, and therefore production is likely to continue decreasing for the time being. Business fixed investment, particularly for expanding production capacity, is also likely to decrease for the time being, as firms have increasingly regarded their capital stock as excessive. Labor market conditions are slackening, and developments warrant careful monitoring as adjustments in the labor market, in terms of both wages and the number of employees, might spread from manufacturers to nonmanufacturing firms. Japanese households, whose savings ratio is high, own large amounts of financial assets, but they are not under pressure to make large-scale balance sheet adjustments, unlike their U.S. counterparts, which are suffering from falling land and home prices. However, the worsening employment and income situation has been gradually taking its toll, and this may exert additional downward pressure on private consumption. Furthermore, attention should be paid to the possibility that recent unstable stock prices and the deteriorating employment situation may weaken consumer confidence further. Prices are on a downward trend. In the summer of last year, CPI inflation, in terms of the year-on-year rate of change, rose to 2.4 percent, its highest level since the first half of the 1990s. Thereafter, however, it moderated reflecting declines in the prices of petroleum products, falling to 0 percent in January this year. It is projected to become negative soon with the increasing slackness evident in supply and demand conditions due to the severe economic situation. As for the outlook for the economy, the Bank's baseline scenario projects that it will start recovering from the latter half of fiscal 2009, with price declines abating as global financial markets regain stability and overseas economies move out of their deceleration phase. However, a high level of uncertainty surrounds this scenario, involving some risks. Japan's production is likely to continue decreasing for the time being, but it is also likely that the pace of the decrease will slow gradually as inventory adjustment pressures diminish. In this situation, whether final demand will start to recover rapidly when the adjustment is completed is the key to the recovery of Japan's production and the economy as a whole. As I just mentioned, it is highly uncertain when and how the world economy will begin recovering, and therefore it is also unclear to what extent recovery in exports will bring economic recovery in Japan. If recovery in final demand – including exports – is long delayed, or if the degree of the recovery is small, this may cause a decline in firms' medium to long-term growth expectations and a consequent increase in adjustment pressures on capital stock and employment, eventually depressing domestic private demand further. With regard to prices, if downside risks to the economy materialize and the rate of change in prices continues to be negative for a long period of time, firms' and households' medium- to long-term inflation expectations may decline. The Bank will continue to carefully examine developments as well as various downside risks. B.  The financial environment in Japan Next, I would like to talk about the current financial environment. Financial conditions in Japan have remained tight since the failure of Lehman Brothers. I would like to focus on recent developments in corporate financing, which is most relevant to today's audience. The first issue is the levels of interest rates applied to borrowing by firms. They are declining due mainly to the effects of the reductions in the policy interest rate since the autumn of last year and improvements in the CP market. CP issuance rates, which surged through the end BIS Review 38/2009 5 
of last year, have declined since the turn of the year, and banks' lending rates have also declined slightly, partly reflecting reductions in short-term prime lending rates. On the other hand, credit spreads are increasing or remain elevated, counteracting the effects of the policy interest rate reductions. The second issue is the amount of borrowing by firms. Firms are inclined to compensate for a decline in cash flows by borrowing and also to increase cash in hand in view of the uncertainty of the future. In this situation, there have been some improvements in the issuing environment for CP and bonds, but issuance of these instruments as a whole has been below the previous year's level. By contrast, bank lending, especially to large firms, has continued to increase rapidly. On the lender banks' side, however, they are becoming increasingly conscious of their capital constraints against the background of expanded securities-related losses and higher credit cost caused by a deterioration in the business performance of borrower firms. In this situation, an increasing number of firms have reported that their financial positions are weak and lending attitudes of financial institutions are severe. Various research results show that small firms, lending to which has remained below the previous year's level, see their financial positions as having deteriorated and financial institutions' lending attitudes as having tightened as much as in 1998 and 2002, and the Bank needs to pay due attention to developments. The financial condition of Japanese financial institutions has been relatively stable even after the emergence of the U.S. subprime mortgage problem, because they have generally made progress in the disposal of nonperforming assets since the bursting of the economic bubble and also because their investments in overseas securitized products have been limited. In fact, unlike in the United States and Europe, failures of financial institutions and their rescues by injection of public funds have not occurred in Japan. Notwithstanding this, given that the economic downturn is likely to continue for the time being, attention needs to be paid to the possibility that the financial health of Japanese financial institutions may worsen and their risk-taking ability may decline gradually, in turn reducing their lending capacity. The Bank will continue to carefully examine whether the financial intermediation function of Japanese financial institutions and the financial system in Japan will be maintained so that the adverse feedback loop between financial and economic activity will not intensify. III.  Policy responses Having explained economic and financial developments at home and abroad, I would now like to move on to recent policy responses in major countries to those developments. Major countries have been taking policy measures to cope with problems in their financial systems. Increased strains in global financial markets and heightened concerns about their financial systems have prompted them to take various measures since the autumn of last year. The U.S. and European authorities, the governments in particular, have taken a wide range of measures: injection of public funds into financial institutions in distress; expansion of deposit insurance coverage; and purchases of nonperforming assets from financial institutions. The increased capital constraints that I mentioned earlier have made strengthening financial institutions' capital bases all the more important also in Japan, even though its financial system remains stable compared with those of the United States and Europe. Against this background, the revised Act on Special Measures for Strengthening Financial Functions was passed by the Diet in December to improve the framework for utilizing public funds. Many of the measures being taken in the United States and Europe at present are very similar to those adopted in Japan to fight the financial crisis in and after the second half of the 1990s. In that sense, I believe that Japan's experience has been reflected in the measures being taken in foreign countries today. Lessons learned from Japan's experience 6 BIS Review 38/2009 
include the fact that, when an adverse feedback loop is at work between financial and economic activity, policy responses to ensure the stability of the financial system might not by themselves resolve the problem completely. The key is to launch a comprehensive policy package to prevent intensification of the loop. In such a policy package, measures in different areas will need to be implemented simultaneously: not only measures to strengthen financial institutions' capital bases, but also measures to resolve excesses in the corporate sector as well as support its revitalization, and others to underpin overall economic activity. In this regard, the Bank will continue to find opportunities to explain to other countries the lessons Japan has learned. Major countries have been taking decisive measures as well in fiscal policy. In the United States, the new Obama Administration has launched large-scale fiscal stimulus packages equivalent to about 75 trillion yen. The Chinese government has announced measures equivalent to about 60 trillion yen to boost the economy. The Japanese government also intends to implement 12 trillion yen in fiscal measures and 63 trillion yen in financial measures. In the conduct of fiscal policy, generally speaking, it is important to examine ways not only to create demand in the short run but also, for example, to improve the infrastructure, which will enhance productivity, eventually increasing the growth potential of the economy in the long run. Moreover, as indicated in the statements of the latest G-7 and G-20 meetings of finance ministers and central bank governors, it is also important that the measures be consistent with medium- to long-term fiscal sustainability. As for monetary policy, major central banks have been taking appropriate measures in a timely manner, varying in accordance with the economic and financial situation in each country. The Bank has been conducting monetary policy in three main areas: reductions in interest rates; provision of ample liquidity to stabilize financial markets; and facilitation of corporate financing by influencing individual financial markets. Taking each area in turn, I would now like to explain the measures the Bank has implemented since the autumn of last year. With regard to reductions in interest rates, the first area, the Bank reduced the target for the uncollateralized overnight call rate – its policy interest rate – to 0.1 percent, from 0.5 percent. It also worked on the interest rates on term instruments by devising methods for liquidity provision, and as a result they have been slightly lower than at the beginning of this year, even though demand for funds tends to increase as the fiscal year-end approaches. The second area is ensuring stability in financial markets by providing ample liquidity. The Bank has been conducting U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations in a coordinated action with other central banks, and has also been providing ample funds in yen by, for example, purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) outright. Following December's decision to increase outright purchases of JGBs from 14.4 trillion yen per year to 16.8 trillion yen, the Bank decided, at the Monetary Policy Meeting held last week, to increase the amount further by 4.8 trillion yen to 21.6 trillion yen per year. Last week's decision was made because, given the likelihood that the markets will remain under stress in the new fiscal year, the Bank judged that continued provision of substantial liquidity is required to ensure stability in financial markets. With this decision, the Bank would make greater use of its long-term funds-supplying operations, thereby facilitating smooth money market operations. Regarding the third area, measures for facilitating corporate financing, the Bank has been conducting since January 2009 new operations called "special funds-supplying operations to facilitate corporate financing." These enable financial institutions to obtain funds with a maturity of up to three months with no explicit ceiling on the total quantity of funds available, although the maximum amount borrowed by an individual financial institution may not exceed the value of the corporate debt it has pledged as collateral. The interest rate on these funds was set at 0.1 percent, lower than the market rates for funds with corresponding maturities. In addition, the Bank expanded the operations in February by, for example, increasing the frequency of the operations to once a week from twice a month and standardizing the BIS Review 38/2009 7 
duration of each loan to three months instead of one to three months; these changes were aimed at encouraging a decline in longer-term interest rates, which are the rates actually applied to firms' borrowing, and relieving firms' funding concerns. Furthermore, in January the Bank decided to conduct outright purchases of CP totaling 3 trillion yen from financial institutions. Last month, it also decided to purchase outright 1 trillion yen of corporate bonds with a residual maturity of up to one year. The Bank took these measures based on its recognition that a decline in the functioning of CP and corporate bond markets was causing a tightening of overall corporate financing conditions. These measures are expected to encourage financial institutions to sell CP and corporate bonds they hold and thus expand their lending capacity. The Bank's outright purchases of corporate debt, however, involve a relatively higher probability of imposing costs on taxpayers by incurring losses, and deepen the involvement of the Bank in microeconomic resource allocation among individual firms. In addition, they involve higher risks, compared to other policy measures, of damaging the financial health of the Bank by causing it to incur losses and ultimately undermining confidence in the currency and monetary policy. Since they are an exceptional measure for a central bank, the Bank has been purchasing CP and corporate bonds outright based on certain necessary conditions for the implementation of such purchases. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England (BOE) have also been purchasing corporate financing instruments, as is being done by the Bank of Japan, although the size and range of corporate financing instruments purchased vary according to the differences in the degree of the decline of market functioning and in the structure of financial intermediation. Furthermore, the Fed and the BOE both announced the introduction of large-scale outright purchases of government bonds from this month, although there are differences in the policy objective and the thinking behind the introduction. I would not be exaggerating greatly if I said that, to address the present economic downturn, major central banks have been going beyond the boundaries of conventional monetary policy and stepping into a new sphere of policy conduct. In addition to these measures in the three main areas, the Bank has been taking decisive measures to ensure the stability of the Japanese financial system, in view of its recognition that persisting strains in global financial markets and the deterioration in economic conditions at home and abroad have been adversely affecting financial institutions' business performance and financial intermediation function. Specifically, last month the Bank resumed its purchases of stocks held by banks. Based on the recognition that reducing market risk associated with stockholdings remains an extremely important issue for financial institutions' management, the Bank aims to support their future endeavors to reduce such risk. Moreover, last week it decided to explore a new framework to provide banks with subordinated loans, which constitute part of their capital bases. The aim of this measure is to provide banks with a way to maintain adequate capital bases – along with capital-raising by banks themselves in the markets and based on the Act on Special Measures for Strengthening Financial Functions – and ultimately to ensure the stability of the financial system. In view of this aim, the Bank will draw up a scheme for implementation as early as possible. As I have just explained, the Bank has been implementing various measures in rapid succession since the autumn of last year. The end of the fiscal year is only a few days away, but financial markets in Japan have so far remained relatively stable, as firms and financial institutions have strived to secure liquidity in a planned manner at an early stage and the Bank has provided large amounts of liquidity at a faster pace than in ordinary years. However, as I explained previously, Japan's economic and financial conditions will likely continue to be severe. In this situation, the Bank's policy priority will be placed, for the time being, on securing market stability and facilitating corporate financing – the second and third main areas of the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. In any event, the Bank will continue to 8 BIS Review 38/2009 
examine carefully developments in financial markets and corporate financing and to take necessary measures in a decisive manner without any predetermined view. Closing remarks Today I explained economic and financial developments at home and abroad and the policy responses of the authorities around the world, including the Bank of Japan. As I said at the beginning of this speech, the current economic downturn is a process of correcting various imbalances that had accumulated over the past several years, and the severe situation will therefore likely continue for some time. I believe that Otaru has also been significantly affected by the global economic downturn, with a sharp drop in exports to Russia and a decrease in the number of domestic and foreign tourists. It is also true, however, that both domestic and overseas financial markets, especially money markets, have started to gradually regain stability. Furthermore, the effects of major countries' fiscal and monetary policies, as well as measures implemented to secure the stability of financial systems, are expected to be felt gradually. However, we must bear in mind the important fact that these policies and measures can only temporarily mitigate financial and economic shocks and reduce the degree of the economic downturn – in other words, they are merely measures to buy time. Resolution of various excesses in the private sector and the subsequent establishment of new business models are indispensable for realizing sustainable economic growth in the medium to long term. Fiscal and monetary policies are no more than a support to facilitate adjustments in and the positive efforts of the private sector. Japan's economy has been exposed to many severe downturns over the decades, but every time it enhanced its capability to create new products and services with added value based on the experience, strengthening the foundation for future growth. Good examples are the efforts made during the recession of the 1980s caused by the strong yen and in the 1990s after the bursting of the bubble economy. I hear reassuring remarks of corporate managers, for example, in the reports made at the meetings of general managers of the Bank's branches, such as that they are determined to continue with their investment in research and development, human resource training, and mergers and acquisitions, to prepare for the future despite, and also because of, the economic downturn. In addition, Japanese firms have continued to work assiduously in research and development of energy-saving and eco-friendly technologies, fields in which they are competitive, believing these fields to have growth potential. Otaru has a history of being a pioneering city, supporting the development of financial and economic activity in Hokkaido Prefecture. It has great potential, in that it is a city with a large number of tourist attractions and functions as a distribution center for the trade between Northeast Asia and the whole of Hokkaido Prefecture. I very much hope that you, as corporate managers, are determined to continue to develop creativity with which you can meet the current economic downturn as well as the severe competition, and that, when you have overcome the difficulties, Japan's economy, including Otaru, will transform itself into a more flexible, strong economy that can fully cope with global economic swings that may occur repeatedly in the future. The Bank will support firms' proactive activity from the financial side, and at the same time do its utmost as a central bank to realize the early return of Japan's economy to a sustainable growth path with price stability. Thank you very much for your kind attention. BIS Review 38/2009 9 
Nout Wellink: Basel Committee initiatives in response to the financial crisis Remarks by Dr Nout Wellink, President of the Netherlands Bank and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament (ECON), Brussels, 30 March 2009. *      *      * Thank you, Madame Chairwoman and members of the Econ Committee, for this opportunity to share with you the Basel Committee’s strategy and initiatives to respond to the present financial crisis as it relates to the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. The work of the Basel Committee is consistent with and supports the initiatives of the Financial Stability Forum and the Leaders of the G20.  In formulating responses to the financial crisis, it is necessary to address both the near term challenges related to the weakening economic and financial situation and the long term regulatory structure issues. The two are linked and we need to manage carefully the transition from current measures to a more sustainable long term framework. With regard to the near term situation, it is clear that the banking sector has been at the heart of the adverse feedback loop between the financial and real side. We have moved from what I would call the mark-to-market and illiquidity phase of the crisis related to legacy assets to the fundamental credit cycle part of the crisis. This is associated with large write downs from corporate and retail lending books, and I believe this phase will continue to play out over the medium term.  It is critical that supervisors have a comprehensive strategy to deal with both phases of the crisis and their associated impact on banks. That is essential if we are to restore stability to our financial systems and economies. When it comes to the long term, we need to establish a clear target for the future regulatory system which substantially reduces both the probability and severity of a crisis like the one we currently are working though. By providing clarity about the future regulatory framework, we will help re-establish near term confidence, reduce the risk of competitive distortions and limit the degrees of uncertainty for the public and private sector. Also, by emphasising that these reforms will be phased in over an appropriate horizon, we reduce the risk that our own actions contribute to procyclicality in the system. In this regard our plans are closely aligned with the views expressed in the de Larosière Group’s report. This group’s report has been strongly appreciated by the Basel Committee. Let me now say a few words about the steps the Basel Committee has and will be undertaking to produce a more robust supervisory and regulatory framework for the banking sector.  Such a framework needs to have four key components:  1. Strong regulatory capital, 2. Robust standards for bank liquidity, 3. Enhanced risk management, governance and supervision, and 4. Better transparency I would like to say a few words about each of these components. Regulatory capital The Basel Committee, in a press release issued on March 12th following its recent quarterly meeting, underscored the importance of a strong capital base as a necessary condition for a strong banking sector. It stated that the level of capital in the banking system needs to be strengthened to raise its resilience to future episodes of economic and financial stress. The BIS Review 38/2009 1 
Committee will do this through a combination of initiatives, which I will describe momentarily. Our press release also noted that the Committee will review the regulatory minimum level of capital, taking account of these initiatives. Our objective will be to arrive at a total level and quality of capital that is higher than the current Basel I and Basel II frameworks and appropriate to promote the stability of the banking sector over the long run. This effort will be phased in over a time frame that will not aggravate the current stress. Building on the three pillars of the Basel II framework, we need to develop a more resilient capital framework that has multiple safeguards built into it. First, we need to improve risk coverage.  One of the most procyclical dynamics has been the failure of risk management and capital frameworks to capture key exposures in advance of the crisis. For example, risks arising from securitisation activities – especially so-called resecuritisations – as well as certain trading book exposures were not sufficiently captured. I could also point to exposures to complex financial instruments that experienced severe declines in value because of impaired liquidity. The Basel Committee’s response therefore is to enhance the Basel II framework so that risks are more comprehensively and more accurately covered. Second, there needs to be a solid capital base backing these risks.  We will achieve this by strengthening the quality, consistency, and transparency of the highest forms of Tier 1 capital. It must be based on a clear definition of capital that needs to be transparent and it must be global to ensure competitive equality. The Basel Committee already has a strong foundation for such a definition, namely common equity and reserves. We now need to deal with the many differences related to definitional issues, such as deductions from capital and the treatment of prudential filters. Third, we need to address procyclicality.   Procyclicality is a complex issue and it is the product of many factors. At the most basic level, it is the result of animal spirits, which produce exuberant behaviour in the upswing of the cycle, and fear during the downturn. We cannot change this behaviour, but we can seek to dampen the channels through which it manifests itself. These include accounting and capital frameworks, liquidity regimes, risk management and compensation, margining, basic infrastructure, transparency, and the way supervision is carried out. In the case of the regulatory capital regime, we need to address any excess cyclicality in minimum requirements over the credit cycle while maintaining appropriate risk coverage and sensitivity. The Basel Committee has put in place a process to systematically assess the quantitative impact of Basel II on the level and cyclicality of capital. We will take appropriate steps if the results of our capital monitoring suggest the capital framework is unduly procyclical. But even more importantly, we need to build countercyclical buffers into capital frameworks and provisioning practices. This will help ensure that reserves and capital are built up during periods of earnings growth, so that they can be drawn down during periods of stress. The Committee is working to translate this important principle into a concrete proposal. The approach needs to have robust standards that can be applied at the global level and translated into national contexts. Finally, the capital framework needs to be underpinned by a non-risk based supplementary measure. This is particularly important as the Basel I-based floors are phased out. Just like we expect banks to manage to a variety of measures when they assess risk (such as net and gross exposures, VAR and stress tests), we as supervisors also must not constrain ourselves by evaluating risk through the lens of a single, risk based measure. We need the risk based measure to interact with a simple metric that can act as a floor and help contain the build up of excessive leverage in the banking system, one of the key sources of the current crisis. The Basel Committee is working to develop by year end a specific proposal in this area. Key principles guiding this work are that the measure must be simple and 2 BIS Review 38/2009 
transparent, and it must address issues related to accounting differences and off-balance sheet exposures, among others. Finally, it needs to interact with the risk based measure in a prudent but sensible manner.   Once these different streams of work are further advanced, taken together they will form the basis for the Committee’s assessment of the appropriate level of minimum capital that should be put in place over the long term.   But whatever we do – and this gets back to my link between the near and long term – we must not raise global capital requirements in the middle of this crisis. Capital buffers are there to be used and we must provide a clear road map where we are headed. Liquidity Let me now say a few words about our work on liquidity. Capital is a necessary condition for banking system soundness but by itself is not sufficient. Of equal importance is a strong liquidity base. Many banks that had adequate capital levels got into trouble because they did not manage their liquidity in a prudent manner. In response to these shortcomings, the Basel Committee last September issued its Principles of Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision. This was a significant step toward setting a new global soundness standard for what constitutes robust liquidity risk measurement, management and supervision. But this was only the first step. The next step is to monitor implementation of the principles and we have put in place a process to do just that. We also are developing benchmarks, tools and metrics that supervisors can use to promote more consistent liquidity standards for cross-border banks. Better risk management and supervision  I have discussed the importance of having stronger global standards for capital and liquidity, but this is not enough. If firms have poor governance and risk management cultures or if supervision is weak, then we could again find ourselves with the types of problems we are now facing.  We propose to build on Basel II’s supervisory review process – Pillar 2 – to raise the bar for risk management and supervision practices. This past January, the Basel Committee published for comment supplemental Pillar 2 guidance. The purpose of this guidance is to address the flaws in risk management practices revealed by the crisis, which in many cases were symptoms of more fundamental shortcomings in governance structures at financial institutions. The Committee will strengthen its supervisory guidance and the links to the Pillar 2 review process. It is focusing on firm-wide governance and risk management; capturing the risk of off-balance sheet exposures and securitisation activities; more effectively managing risk concentrations; and providing incentives to better manage risk and returns over the long-term, including compensation practices. Moreover, we need to move towards a macroprudential approach to supervision. What does this mean? In our discussions in the Basel Committee, we have emphasised the need to focus supervision not just on the soundness of individual banks but on broader financial stability objectives. This should inform where we focus our limited supervisory resources and how we develop our supervisory and regulatory tools.  Transparency  One of the main amplifiers of the crisis was the lack of transparency regarding the risk profile of institutions and structured products. Moreover, the process by which these products are valued often lacks rigour. Lack of transparency about the risk profile of products and financial BIS Review 38/2009 3 
institutions caused a massive retrenchment by investors and counterparties further amplifying the deleveraging process.  To help mitigate this behaviour, the third pillar of the Basel II framework – market discipline – sets out a series of required disclosures that are intended to complement the other two pillars of the Basel II framework. This should allow market participants to assess capital adequacy of a bank through key pieces of information on the scope of application, capital, risk exposure and the risk assessment process. The Committee’s January proposals for enhancing Pillar 3 are focused on disclosures related to securitisation, off-balance-sheet exposures and trading activities. We believe that these proposed enhanced disclosure requirements will help to avoid a recurrence of market uncertainties about the strength of banks' balance sheets related to their capital market activities.  Conclusion Taken together, the recent and planned initiatives of the Basel Committee should promote a more robust banking sector and limit the risk that weaknesses in banks amplify shocks between the financial and real sectors. Because our measures are far reaching and ambitious, they will need to be phased in over a reasonable timeframe.  I should also note the invitation to join the Basel Committee that we have extended recently to the BRIC countries – Brazil, Russia, India and China – as well as Australia, Korea and Mexico. The expansion of our membership will help enhance the global reach and acceptance of our standards. The efforts of the Basel Committee need to occur in a broader context of achieving the right balance between the scope and depth of regulation. Failure to produce adequate regulation for other "bank like" activities means that we in the banking sector will just be “pushing on a string”, and the activity will simply migrate elsewhere. I therefore strongly welcome the activities of other bodies like the G20, the Financial Stability Forum and the Joint Forum to ensure that all sectors are subject to an appropriate degree of regulation, oversight or transparency commensurate with their systemic significance. The Committee will actively contribute to these other efforts Finally, Madame Chairwoman, I would like to thank you and the ECON Committee for holding this important meeting. The official sector is at a critical juncture and the actions we take in response will have a far-reaching and long-lasting effect. 4 BIS Review 38/2009 
Zhou Xiaochuan: On savings ratio  Keynote address by Dr Zhou Xiaochuan, Governor of the People’s Bank of China, at the High Level Conference hosted by the Central Bank of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, 10 February 2009. *      *      * There are no commonly accepted explanations for savings and consumption behaviors in the economics and statistics community. With further transmission of the current financial crisis, discussions on the causes to the crisis intensified. Some believe that the high savings ratio of the East Asia and oil-producing countries is one major cause for the global imbalance and the crisis. This paper attempts to explore the factors that affect savings ratio, and examine the reasons behind the high savings ratios in the East Asian and oil-producing countries and the low savings ratio in the U.S. It also provides a brief description of savings ratio in China and the corresponding adjustment approaches, as well as a set of options for adjusting this ratio. Major views of this paper were discussed at the High Level Conference Hosted by Bank Negara Malaysia on February 10, 2009. I.  Factors affecting savings ratios  The term “savings” in this paper includes domestic savings, current account surplus and foreign reserve. As of now, we have not seen sufficient and solid academic studies illustrating the linkage between the savings ratio and determinant factors, such as the level of wealth as measured by per capita GDP, foreign exchange rate, the development of financial intermediation and capital market, tradition, demographic structure and social security system. While exchange rate is statistically correlated with savings ratio to some degree, the coefficients are generally low and the correlation usually insignificant. It therefore seems that savings ratio can’t be adjusted by simply adjusting exchange rate. Identifying the factors determining savings ratio is a major policy challenge for all countries. We can only come up with an effective policy tool kit after identifying determining factors for and their impacts on the savings ratio. II.  Causes for high savings ratio in the East Asia and oil-producing countries  Tradition, cultural, family structure, and demographic structure and stage of economic development are the major reasons for high savings ratio in the East Asia. First, the East Asia countries are influenced by Confucianism, which value thrift, self-discipline, zhong yong or Middle Ground (low-key), and anti-extravagancy. Second, we may be able to trace the cultural differences from a large number of textbooks and literature of different countries. For instance, the Latin American countries have similar levels of national wealth as the East Asian countries but lower savings ratios. This can be attributed to the cultural differences in the region, where people have a higher propensity of consumption and tend to quickly use up all their salaries. Third, family tie is strong in the East Asian countries, and families shoulder social responsibilities such as providing for the elderly and bringing up children. Fourth, according to the Life Cycle Hypothesis by Franco Modigliani, more money is saved to meet future pension and healthcare needs as the share of working age population increases. When we study the phases of economic growth, in times of exceptionally high economic growth, most of the incremental income will be saved, resulting in an unusually high savings ratio. China fits in the above-mentioned two conditions for a high savings ratio. Japan and the U.S. can also demonstrate the contribution of these factors in determining savings ratio. Similar to the U.S., Japan is a developed country with high per capita income. The social security systems in the two countries have their respective weaknesses. However, Japan’s BIS Review 37/2009 1 
savings ratio is much higher than that in the U.S. This can be largely ascribed to cultural, family value and demographic feature in Japan, which are fairly similar to those in other East Asian countries.  Some argue that an inadequate social security system leads to high savings ratio. Though logically sound, this argument lacks adequate empirical support. Moreover, it is based on the assumption that human behaviors are rational and people increase their savings for future healthcare and pension needs. In fact, such an assumption does not necessarily stand.  High savings ratio in oil-producing countries has different reasons. Endowed with rich oil resources that far exceed their normal demand, these countries naturally accumulate their wealth in the form of savings. The elementary textbooks on economics always start with “supply, demand and prices”, which lead the readers to believe that certain prices (e.g., exchange rate and interest rate) can determine the behavior of savings and consumption. However, the fact is that the level of savings ratio is influenced by a wide range of factors, and it can’t be adjusted simply by changing nominal exchange rate. Factors such as national tradition, culture, family structures, demographics and social security system can’t be changed in the short term. As a result, it may take a long time for policies to yield intended impacts. III.  Implications of the Asian financial crisis for savings ratio in the East Asia Savings in the GDP are composed of resident, corporate and government savings. If total savings exceed domestic investment, the surplus will take the form of foreign reserves. To analyze the drastic increase of imbalance of savings and trade in East Asian countries that emerged after 1997, we need to examine the impact of the Asian financial crisis on savings ratio in these countries.  The high savings ratio and large foreign reserves in the East Asian countries are a result of defensive reactions against predatory speculation. During the Asian Financial Crisis, the rampant speculations of hedge funds caused large capital inflows and subsequent reversal in these countries, which exacerbated their economic woes. People in these countries were shocked, and disgusted by these speculative attacks. Afterwards, many suggested that unregulated predatory speculation caused the crisis, and appropriate international regulation was needed. However, for various considerations, some countries were against such regulations, and failed to see the need to adjust the regulatory frameworks. International organizations also failed to perform their regulatory responsibilities over abnormal capital flows, forcing the East Asian countries to amass foreign reserves to fend for themselves.  The increase of savings ratio and current account surplus in the East Asian countries is also a result of the rescue plan designed by international organizations. The rescue plans were silent on regulating cross-border speculative capital flows, which otherwise should have been put under scrutiny. Instead, excessive and stringent conditionalities were imposed, demanding that the crisis-stricken countries adopt tight fiscal and monetary policies, raise interest rates, cut fiscal deficits and increase foreign reserves. In the decade thereafter, the East Asian countries learnt the lessons, and increased foreign reserves and domestic savings in order to beef up their defense against financial crisis. Of course, there were also vulnerabilities in economic development models, foreign debt management as well as institutional arrangements of the East Asian countries. Sweeping structural reforms on the corporate and financial sectors were launched in the wake of the crisis, social security systems were improved, and education and healthcare systems reformed. However, it takes time for these efforts to take effect. 2 BIS Review 37/2009 
IV.  Can China adjust its savings ratio effectively?  During the Asian Financial Crisis, China, as a responsible large economy, did not devalue its currency and paid the price – a fairly slow recovery. The endeavor of the Chinese authorities to maintain the stability of RMB against all odds contributed to stemming the spread of the financial crisis.  After the crisis, China intensified efforts to revamp its corporate and government sectors with the deepening of market-oriented reforms. Profitability of enterprises, especially SOEs, increased; fiscal position improved and residents’ income improved steadily. Starting 2002, savings ratio began to surge, with steadily rising resident savings and remarkable increase of corporate savings. China’s savings ratio increased from 37.5% in 1998 to 49.9% in 2007. During the period, the ratio of corporate sector disposable income to the national disposable income increased from 13% to 22.5%, while the share of government disposable income to the total increased by only 2 percentage points. The rate of corporate savings to GDP in China is high compared with other countries in the world. This is closely related to the unsolved distortion of cost/profit of enterprises during China’s economic transition. Under the planned economy, housing, healthcare, and pension were provided by the enterprises and the government, and weren’t accounted for in wages. This had dampened people’s incentives to save. Savings were even considered “involuntary” as people had to regularly line up in queues at shops for consumer goods in short supply. After the reform in the 1990s, the “iron bowl” (lifelong secure job and welfare) system was smashed and the enterprises stopped providing pension and housing for free. However, effective social security system had not been in place either. These significantly increased the incentive for precautionary savings. Nevertheless, the real cost of labor takes time to be reflected in the cost of the enterprises. As a result, the extraordinary profit from cost distortion did not find its way to liability accounts of pension, healthcare and housing for employees, where it should, lead to significant surge of corporate savings. This broadly explained the increase in household and corporate savings. This is also why some people suggested that part of the state-owned shares of listed companies should be transferred to the national social security fund. The Chinese authorities have a clear policy intention to reduce savings ratio. Since 2005, boosting domestic demand and encouraging consumption have been important components of the national economic policies. These policies would eventually bring down the savings ratio. Yet, in-depth studies are needed to identify factors influencing the savings ratio, its elasticity with respect to these factors, and the specific adjustment measures to take. Besides, the incomplete reforms in some areas have affected the adjustment of savings ratio. Although private enterprises in China are already market-driven and free of cost distortion, the reforms of the public sector are incomplete despite considerable achievements in reforming SOEs. The lack of clearly-defined and fully monetized cost structure hampered the adjustment of savings ratio. It is therefore important to expedite the reform of the public sector and the transformation of the government functions. V.  Observations on low household saving ratio in the U.S. The U.S. household savings ratio in recent years went through two phases: before the mid-1990s, it ranged between 7-10%; after 1997, it declined remarkably with pronounced “twin deficits”, especially trade deficit. Some attributed the low savings to the so-called “euphoria” on the U.S. economic performance since the mid-1990s. Specifically, in late 1980s and early 1990s, after the collapse of the central planning system of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, growth in those regions steadily slipped. In the 1990s, the Japanese economy was also trapped in prolonged stagnation, and EU’s economic performance was lackluster due to structural problems including rigid labor market. The U.S., as the largest economy, boasted the optimal economic system that was seemingly unparalleled in the BIS Review 37/2009 3 
world. The only remaining challenge, in terms of economic system, came from Asia; after 1997, the Asian economies suffered heavy blows. In contrast, the US economy demonstrated strong flexibility and resilience, and recovered rapidly from the 9/11 attack and the burst of IT bubble in recent years. All these augmented the euphoria sentiment in the market, which in turn influenced the saving behavior of the U.S. residents. However, the unprecedented magnitude of the current financial crisis is expected to dramatically dampen such euphoria sentiments. The time series show that this round of low savings and high consumption in the US commenced in mid-1990s. In contrast, the savings ratio of East Asian countries only surged after the Asian financial crisis and China's savings ratios did not begin to increase until 2002. The difference in time distribution indicates that there is no significant causal relationship between the two. VI.  Options for adjusting saving ratio Global savings imbalance exists for many reasons. It seems inappropriate to link savings ratio only to exchange rate, and it is also unrealistic to resolve long-term issues in the short run. One should, instead, adopt a broader and more comprehensive mindset in examining the imbalance of savings. First, a comprehensive set of prescription is needed. Although the U.S. can’t sustain the growth pattern of high consumption and low savings, it is not the right time to raise its savings ratio at this very moment. It needs to strike a balance between stimulating consumption and facilitating the economic recovery. On the other hand, the East Asian nations should attend to economic growth model, economic structure, price system and the like, in order to bring down savings ratio. Of course, reform of the exchange rate mechanism is part of this prescription. The Chinese government has focused on boosting domestic demand to sustain economic growth in an effort to tackle the ongoing financial crisis and conducting economic adjustment. The RMB 4-trillion yuan stimulus package, one of the largest in the world, is mainly an expenditure program. The program underscores public welfare, job creation, and income growth for the rural areas and the underprivileged groups. Second, countries and international organizations should strengthen their cooperation and intensify the regulation of the international speculative capital flows. The current financial crisis underscores the necessity of reinforcing the regulation over international capital flows and enhancing their transparency. International organizations and countries concerned should help developing countries to establish a robust early-warning system and guard against attacks from predatory speculation. International cooperation should be strengthened to improve the aid mechanism. In case emerging markets experience temporary BOP difficulties, international aid should be swift, and conditionalities attached should be reduced. This would encourage countries to lower savings including foreign reserves and expand domestic demand.  Third, appropriate measures should be taken to channel more savings into developing countries and emerging markets. Savings flowing from emerging markets to the advanced economies is neither rational nor consistent with the intention of the advanced economies to increase their domestic savings. However, the adjustment of savings ratio in the East Asian countries will not see immediate effects. Meanwhile, savings in oil-producing countries may remain at a high level so long as oil prices don’t plunge further. Therefore, global savings imbalance will remain for some time in the future. The top priority at present is to facilitate the rational flow of savings and improve their allocation efficiency. One option is to redirect surplus savings to other developing countries and emerging markets, those with abundant resources, low labor cost, but lack of capital. These economies are the future growth engines of the global economy. 4 BIS Review 37/2009 
Finally, the reform of the international monetary system should be advanced. Currently, U.S. dollar is used in most international trade and financial transactions, and is also the most important reserve currency. The IMF data showed that the U.S. dollar accounted for 63.9% of the total foreign reserves by the end of 2007. When countries increase savings and if these savings are in the form of dollar denominated foreign reserves, capital will inevitably flow into the U.S.. In the short run, the U.S. may need more capital inflows to deal with the financial crisis; over the long run, large capital inflows are not in its best interest of making adjustments to its economic growth model. Moreover, the over-concentration of foreign assets in one particular currency may bring about undesired consequences. Therefore, in addition to upgrading regulatory cooperation and rationalizing savings allocation, the international community should move forward in reforming the international monetary system. Efforts should be made to strengthen the surveillance on the economic and financial policies in major reserve currency countries and to enhance the status of the SDR, so as to advance the international monetary system towards diversification over the long run.

Ardian Fullani: Recent developments in the global and the Albanian economy Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the regional meeting, Korça, 13 February 2009. *      *      * I feel very privileged to be among you again, in this marvellous audience of intellectual values and professionalism. It is the second time I visit Korca in the capacity of the Governor of the Bank of Albania and I observe with pleasure that this city has made admirable progress. Allow me to emphasise once more that Korça, this charming and hospitable city, has given and will always give me pleasure. Usually favourite topics for a Governor are monetary policy, financial stability, banks and money, structural reforms and economic-financial policies. However, the current situation makes inevitable the communication on recent developments the global economy in general and the Albanian economy in particular are being faced with. Global economy is confronted with numerous challenges. 2008 year-end and January 2009 have definitely confirmed recession in the USA, Germany, Britain and Japan, let alone many other European emerging economies, such as Ukraine, Hungary, Byelorussia, Serbia and any other country. While risk of further financial stability shocks is overcome for the developed economies, the economic situation is deteriorating more and more, where unemployment is increasing rapidly, along with output reduction. In the meantime, the emerging economies are experiencing a deterioration of financial conditions, tightening of lending, pressure on exchange rate and at the same time significant reduced demand for some very important branches of the economy. I made this introduction to make you understand that global economy is experiencing a great contraction, which as concerns the shocking intensity and extension, has never been experienced before in the modern history or after the second world war. Many taboos have fallen and continue to fall. The grave financial crisis ignited and erupted at the heart of capitalism, in the USA and from there it spread up quickly all over the world.  Though it may sound paradoxical, our economy has been resistant to this tsunami. According to available official data and judging upon a number of indirect indicators, we have concluded that the economic activity over 2008 performed in line with the early 2008 projections. Generally the economic activity at home has been sustained by domestic financial resources, while the Albanian banking system has been dynamic and effective in channelling the savings towards the funding of corporate production or household consumption This process has been also facilitated by the macroeconomic stability, which has enabled the fall of risk perception in the economy. Dwelling briefly on the fulfilment of legal obligations of the Bank of Albania, I would like to highlight that inflation returned within the 2-4 percent target of the Bank of Albania over the second half of the year. The relaxation of supply-side shocks and appropriate monetary conditions have been key factors enabling the balancing of demand and supply-side factors. During 2008 the key interest rate was held unchanged, at 6.25 percent, aiming at and materializing the anchoring of economic agents’ inflation expectations close to the 3 percent target of the Bank of Albania. Money market activity was conditioned by the performance of monetary indicators and the real economy. In response to these developments, the Bank of Albania intervened in the money market by injecting liquidity of different maturity terms. Also, BIS Review 37/2009 1 
in order to better satisfy the banks’ needs, the Bank of Albania changed in November the repo auction form to auctions with undetermined amounts. In the end of January 2009 the Bank of Albania’s Supervisory Council decided to reduce the key interest rate by 0.50 percentage point, recording a turning point in the monetary policy stance in terms of easing it. However, I should underline that developments during 2008 year-end and early 2009 enable an objective and real assessment of the overall economic-financial situation of the country for the present and the future. Let me mention two or three of them, bringing our insight to your attention. 1. During January 2009 the logical reluctance of individuals towards their bank, reflected mainly in the form of deposit withdrawal over the period of October-December 2008, came to an end. Naturally this is a good news indicating that the Albanian banking system has passed a difficult exam, which many of its “colleagues” in the region and beyond could not pass. The liquidity situation has ameliorated. Symmetric distribution among banks has promoted increased volume of interbank market transactions, turning it back to normal trading levels. In response to Bank of Albania’s reaction, this has been associated with reduced interest rates for all instruments and maturities. Is it accidental? Is it merely destiny? No, it has neither to do with destiny, nor with turning back to any slogans of the centralised economy era. According to latest data, the banking system appears profitable. Return on equity is 11.35 percent for 2008. In the meantime, banks have extended their investments but they have also increased their equity. Capital adequacy rate is 17.23 percent of total assets and risk-rated off-balance sheet items, while loan portfolio quality is at satisfactory levels. Year 2008 coincides with increased prudential policies of the Bank of Albania in terms of adopting a more conservatory approach. The passing of the new banking law, the 2007 developments once credit bubble exploded in the USA and high lending rates over 3-4 last years were assessed with prudence by the Bank of Albania. Therefore, in early 2008 the Bank of Albania organised the first open forum with the banking system, submitting through an open communication, a new packet of prudential regulations for being discussed there, aiming at consolidating the financial stability of the country. The Bank of Albania’s Supervisory Council gave way to the approval of the whole proposed packet, thus creating an effective vaccine, which has produced appropriate antibodies or has provided the immunity I mentioned earlier in my speech. Which are these modifications that have increased our resistance so much? • In compliance with the new law, there were approved new criteria for calculating, supervising and reporting large exposures of banks to parent banks and connected subjects, aiming at managing the risk deriving from concentrated exposure to them. • In order to achieve a more effective management, a new regulation was drafted, strengthening the internal audit in banks and branches of foreign banks. It regards the internal audit as a part of the general governance of banks. It ensures the platform for creating an efficient internal audit system, as the main factor in management and administration of banks and branches of foreign banks. 2 BIS Review 37/2009 
• A special importance was given to transparency of banking and financial products and services. This is another aspect where we intervened during 2008. The new requirements standardise the way and form of supplying customers with information about banking products and services. Special emphasis was laid on obligatory publication of effective interest rates for deposits and loans. Through this information bank customers may get acquainted with calculation of loan effective interest rate, elements of credit and deposit contract, marketing of products and services, maintaining of customer data and confidentiality, dealing with customer complaints and establishment of specific structures relating to such complaints. • Part of the new package was also the standardization of obligatory information the banks and branches of foreign banks should disclose about the main business of banks, their organisation and management, financial performance and position, risk management and accounting policies. • Taking into consideration the international situation and aiming at a better diversification of risk deriving from the concentration of bank investments in international financial markets, the Bank of Albania’s Supervisory Council made some other amendments to the Regulation on Risk Management, consisting mainly in putting more prudential benchmarks on large exposure indicators and on the techniques of collateral calculation and recognition. After presenting the work we have done during 2008, naturally we have the right to claim that we have acted appropriately, taking many preventing actions, which have helped absorbing the negative effects of recent developments. 2. Initial data of December 2008 indicate a contraction of credit to the economy, particularly of credit in foreign currency. Allow me to explain once more that it has to do with one of the gravest symptoms accompanying the latest financial crisis internationally. This is so real that in developed economies, credit to the economy and the interbank channels have almost stopped functioning or are operating at minimum levels. Though peripherally, this development has been materialised even in our economy. However, I believe that, what really matters is the future. Of specific contacts we have had with banks operating in Albania, we have drawn the conclusion that we share the same concern that a drastic stoppage of credit to the economy would gravely damage the economic activity of the country and the financial system’s position. Therefore, we are constantly communicating with banks, to guarantee that during 2009 the Albanian economy will receive the deserved financial support from the banking system. I am confident that the presence of senior representatives of the banking system here in this hall testifies the awareness and understanding of this concern. The decision made some days ago by the Bank of Albania, as also stated in the press release on the Supervisory Council’s meeting, creates “more breath to the economic activity of the country”. I feel well to observe that the banking system has already reacted. Treasury-bill and interbank market interest rate reduction has been evidenced. 3. Interbank money market development, as a necessary bridge for enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, has been and will always be in Bank of Albania’s focus. As such the interbank market development has been subject to discussion in many meetings conducted by the Bank of Albania. In these meetings banks have highlighted credit risk as one of the main obstacles for the development of this market. To minimise this risk, the Bank of Albania drafted the Law on Repurchase Agreements and sample contracts. BIS Review 37/2009 3 
The passing of this Law finalised the Bank of Albania’s endeavours to set up an appropriate legal infrastructure for the market of repurchase agreements among commercial banks. Following its passing, the Bank of Albania held a number of meetings, aiming to clarify its core elements. The main purpose of these meetings was to speed up the concluding of relevant contracts among banks, in order to materialise the practical implementation of this Law. The period we have left behind is regarded as sufficient for finalizing the process of drafting and signing individual contracts on repurchase agreements. Therefore, I draw the attention of the banking system to proceed quickly, sparing the time for signing respective contracts. The process finalization should be necessarily followed by daily quotations of banks in terms of interbank borrowing and lending. The latest decision of the Bank of Albania’s Supervisory Council serves the spirit of transparency increase and customer protection, making compulsory the quotation of mortgage loan rate on the basis of Bank of Albania’s key interest rate. Distinguished participants, Recently the Bank of Albania has constantly stated that year 2009 carries over numerous challenges, which in the context of sharp global issues, make our task more difficult. However, I would highlight that assessing objectively the current situation and that of the near future is an expression of prudence. We at the Bank of Albania remain committed to monitor cautiously all the economic-financial developments, willing to take proper actions to further consolidate the macroeconomic and financial balances. In this way we accomplish our constitutional service for the country’s sustainable growth and development. In this difficult task, I avail myself of the opportunity to invite all the stakeholders and the broad public to become part of the dialogue for finding ways and optimal solutions, in order to minimize the negative effects the international economy transmits to our country. 4 BIS Review 37/2009 
Axel A Weber: The role of forecasting for central banks Keynote address by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the conference on “Forecasting and monetary policy”, organised by the Deutsche Bundesbank, Freie Universität Berlin and the Viessmann European Research Centre, Berlin, 23 March 2009. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to participate in this conference and to be able to share with you some views on what contribution forecasting can make to monetary policy. 1  The role of forecasting in the Eurosystem The reason why central bankers have a strong interest in forecasting is straightforward: because of substantial and variable lags in the monetary policy transmission mechanism, central banks cannot influence current inflation and output. Given these time lags, it is widely recognised that monetary policy should be forward-looking and take a medium-term perspective. Furthermore, the publication of forecasts helps to anchor the expectations of firms and households, thereby making the central bank more effective in fulfilling its objective. As a consequence, forecasts for inflation, output and other macroeconomic variables are an essential input in the monetary policy decision-making process. Forecasting also has an important role to play in the Eurosystem, albeit a less prominent one than in central banks pursuing an inflation-targeting strategy. The Eurosystem’s Governing Council bases its comprehensive assessment of the risks to price stability and its policy decisions on a broad spectrum of information provided by two analytical tools: the economic analysis and the monetary analysis. The monetary analysis assesses medium to long-term developments in inflation based on the well-established relationship between money and prices over long horizons. Monetary analysis takes into account developments in a wide range of monetary indicators including M3, its components and counterparts, notably credit, and measures of excess liquidity. The economic analysis identifies short to medium-term risks to price stability. It includes regular monitoring of a broad set of non-monetary economic and financial variables, such as developments in overall output, labour market developments and financial market indicators. Projections of key macroeconomic variables carried out by Eurosystem staff are also an integral part of the economic analysis..  Of course, differences in strategy mean forecasts play a somewhat different role in the Eurosystem than at central banks pursuing an inflation targeting strategy: For example, it is important to note that these forecasts are carried out under the sole responsibility of the Eurosystem staff, not the Governing Council. In contrast to decision-making bodies at inflation-targeting central banks, such as the Bank of England’s MPC, the ECB Governing Council exerts no influence on the forecasts and their assumptions. In our two-pillar strategy, forecasts do not represent an all-encompassing tool – as would be the case for pure inflation targeters. Instead, projections are merely one input factor in the economic analysis, which, together with the monetary analysis, supports the robustness of the Governing Council’s assessment of risks to price stability. Despite these differences in monetary policy strategy, the Eurosystem publishes its projections for inflation and output four times a year. This is done for reasons of transparency, and, not least, to better guide expectations of future monetary policy actions. In addition, many national central banks (NCBs) in the euro area, including the Bundesbank, have started publishing their national GDP and inflation projections as part of their communication strategy. These projections are a useful by-product of the Eurosystem’s BIS Review 36/2009 1 
regular staff projections, which are carried out jointly by the ECB and the NCBs Central banks therefore have a natural interest in applying the best forecasting methods available. Economic and research departments at central banks aim to incorporate the latest academic developments in forecasting methods into their forecasting practice – provided they turn out to be an improvement on the existing procedures. Against this backdrop, I would like to discuss some of the developments that have lately been of interest in the Eurosystem and at the Bundesbank. First, I will touch on recent developments in short-term forecasting and then elaborate on the uncertainty and risk of macroeconomic forecasts. 2  Recent progress in short-term forecasting To enhance policy effectiveness, the Eurosystem has spent a lot of resources on developing forecast methods and models and, as a result, we have seen substantial progress in recent years. Let me start by saying that there is as yet no unique or best approach to forecasting in central banks; in general, however, central banks try to pursue full-information strategies. In many cases, the forecast procedure may be best described as model-based forecasting complemented by valuable information from experts. With respect to model-based forecasting, most central banks have adopted a so-called “suite-of-models” approach. Instead of relying on just one model, they employ a large variety of different econometric models and a broad set of monitored time series. The suite-of-models approach has the advantage that it takes into account model uncertainty to some extent and does not neglect potentially important information. As for the individual design of a central bank’s forecast model, it may differ with respect to variable coverage, econometric rigour and the economic theory it incorporates. Basically, however, macroeconomic variables can be predicted in two different ways: structural macroeconometric models, which include traditional multi-equation models and DSGE models, and short-term forecast models, usually based on time-series analysis. Although structural macroeconometric models remain workhorses used for forecasting and policy simulations, short-term forecast models have received increasing attention in the Eurosystem in recent years. Why is the short-term horizon so important? For the reasons I have already mentioned, monetary policy decisions require timely information on the current state of the economy. Such information is not always available, however. GDP as an important indicator of macroeconomic activity is, for instance, released with a considerable time delay and only once a quarter. In Germany, GDP is released about five to six weeks after the end of the reference quarter. For example, we expect the Federal Statistical Office to release first-quarter GDP data on 15 May 2009. To allow an assessment of developments in real activity in the current quarter, the central bank’s economists must therefore provide a so-called “nowcast”. Hundreds of variables including high-frequency indicators are, in principle, available for this purpose. Think, for instance, of financial or survey data. But as policy-makers pursue a full-information strategy, central bankers would like to sum up the (at times conflicting) information content of all these variables into a single measure. The workhorse models (structural multiple-equation models and DSGE models) are based on quarterly data only and are therefore ill-suited to evaluate the vast amount of high-frequency data available. By contrast, modern short-term forecast models are well able to process large datasets. What is more, they can also deal with datasets that are unbalanced because data is sampled at different frequencies (monthly – quarterly) or is subject to different publication lags, leading to missing observations at the end of the sample (the “ragged edge” of multivariate data). 2 BIS Review 36/2009 
The most prominent recent examples of such short-term models are: large factor models, mixed-frequency state-space models, bridge equations, or mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) regressions. Unlike structural macro models and DSGE models, these models are not based on economic theory, but on modern time-series econometrics. Research in the Eurosystem and at the Bundesbank shows that exploiting mixed-frequency data is indeed useful for forecasting, as balancing the data and time aggregation to quarterly frequency would lead to a loss of information at the end of the sample.1 Furthermore, it has been shown that these models work particularly well for short horizons, whereas structural macroeconometric models or DSGE models tend to perform well in the medium and long term.2  This highlights that short-term models are not substitutes for traditional macroeconometric and DSGE models. However, they do add another piece of valuable information to the entire forecasting process. To my mind, short-term models should therefore be regarded as complementary tools in the large “suite of models” used within central banks. 3  Uncertainty and risk in macroeconomic forecasts While the central tendency of a forecast, the point forecast, generally receives most public attention, forecast uncertainty and forecast risks are two other important features in forecasting exercises. Uncertainty and risk are two different things. I am therefore going to cover them separately. Point forecasts are surrounded by uncertainty, and knowledge about the degree of forecast uncertainty is essential for decision-makers. Basically, we can identify five sources of forecast uncertainty: • Uncertainty about future shocks to endogenous variables (eg shocks to consumption or labour demand),  • Uncertainty about assumptions concerning exogenous variables (eg assumptions about oil prices and exchange rates),  • Uncertainty about model parameters (eg marginal propensity to consume),  • Uncertainty about data (eg revisions of GDP) and  • Uncertainty about models (eg linear or non-linear effects of oil prices on GDP).  Ranking these sources of forecast uncertainty according to their importance is a difficult task, since their impact depends on the variable and the forecast horizon being studied. Moreover, the effects of these sources of forecast uncertainty are not independent of each other. Finally, an extremely large variety of models would be needed to evaluate the effects of model uncertainty. However, in a given model, uncertainty about future shocks and assumptions concerning exogenous variables often turn out to be greater contributors to aggregate uncertainty than uncertainty about parameters and data. Although the sources of forecast uncertainty are known, forecast uncertainty is of course itself uncertain, and must therefore be estimated. Many forecasting institutions convey information about forecast uncertainty by using projection ranges when publishing their forecasts. In practice, a variety of measures of uncertainty can be used to compute these projection ranges:                                                  1  See Schumacher C and J Breitung (2008), Real-time forecasting of German GDP based on a large factor model with monthly and quarterly data, International Journal of Forecasting, 24, 368-398; Marcellino M and C Schumacher (2007), Factor-MIDAS for now- and forecasting with ragged-edge data: A model comparison for German GDP, Deutsche Bundesbank Discussion Paper No 34/07. 2  See Wang, MC (2009), Comparing the DSGE model with the factor model: an out-of-sample forecasting experiment, Journal of Forecasting 28, 167-182. BIS Review 36/2009 3 
• Dispersion of board members’ point forecasts (eg Federal Reserve),  • Confidence intervals based on past forecast errors and the judgement of board members (eg Bank of England) and  • Dispersion measures derived from past forecast errors, such as the mean of absolute past forecast errors (eg Bundesbank and, until recently, Eurosystem staff projections).  The computation of Eurosystem staff projection ranges was changed in autumn of last year. Instead of deriving them from past forecast errors, these ranges are now based on Bayesian Vector Autoregressions (BVARs) that account for shock and estimation uncertainty. The ranges are conditional on assumptions on several exogenous variables such as oil prices, exchange rates and foreign demand. In general, model-based projection ranges have two possible advantages over calculating uncertainty based on past errors. If the sample of forecast errors is small, the uncertainty about past forecast uncertainty can be large. Moreover, in the case of structural change, past forecast uncertainty can be a misleading measure of future forecast uncertainty. But the structural change can be incorporated into a model from which uncertainty is derived. However, model-based projection ranges also have two major disadvantages. First, the effects of model uncertainty are ignored. Second, information not contained in the model variables, which is typically incorporated into the forecast by means of subjective adjustments by the forecaster, is ignored. How to best represent forecast uncertainty is still the subject of intensive discussions in the Eurosystem, and a final decision has yet to be taken. Furthermore, it should be taken into account that forecast uncertainty may vary markedly over time, so that neither past forecast uncertainty nor the forecast uncertainty derived from models is always a good basis for assessing current forecast uncertainty. This is one of the reasons why the forecast uncertainty conveyed by the ranges of the Eurosystem staff projections may be supplemented with a qualitative assessment by the ECB Governing Council. (For example, in December 2008, when year-end uncertainty was rising, the Governing Council concluded that in its “view …, the economic outlook remains surrounded by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty.”). In addition to uncertainty, forecasts might be subject to upward or downward risks. That is, realised data might be more or less likely to come in above the point forecast than below the point forecast. Information about risks can be of great relevance to decision-makers. If risks to price stability lie on the upside, this could, for example, call for a more restrictive policy response than risks on the downside. As in the case of forecast uncertainty, the risks to the forecast are, of course, difficult to quantify and have to be estimated. To begin with, these estimations often rely on subjective assessments of risks. These assessments can start with input variables (eg risks to oil prices, exchange rates or the output gap), which are then aggregated to determine the risk to the relevant variable (such as inflation or output). However, risks might also reflect the asymmetry of views in a decision-making body. For example, the views held by a minority within such a body could represent a risk. Forecasting institutions convey information about forecast risks in different ways: in a quantitative manner, they are communicated by the shape of a density forecast (eg Bank of England) and in a qualitative manner, they are communicated verbally (eg ECB Governing Council). While quantitative risk statements appear more precise at first glance, it should not be forgotten that, in general, it is extremely difficult to forecast risks to a forecast. It either requires correct assumptions to be made about the risks to the input variables and correct aggregation, in other words, a correct model. Or it requires the asymmetry of views in a 4 BIS Review 36/2009 
decision-making body to correctly reflect the true asymmetry of the forecast density. Doubts have been expressed as to whether these requirements can be fulfilled in a satisfactory manner.3 I am therefore rather sceptical about the ability to forecast macroeconomic risks in a precise, quantitative manner. To my mind, assessing risks only in a qualitative, verbal manner strikes a good balance between expressing our view on the degree of uncertainty related to the forecast and, at the same time, showing an awareness of the general limitations of risk assessments. 4  Current assessment of economic development Forecasting risk and uncertainty is currently of particular interest to central bankers, as forecast uncertainty has reached a comparatively high level. Because the scale and speed of the current economic downturn is unlike anything seen in the last few decades, forecast uncertainty can at present be incorporated into econometric analyses to a limited extent only. Conversely, “judgement-based risk management” has become extremely important. However, despite an active exchange between modellers and macroeconomic experts, economic forecasts for 2009 and 2010 have repeatedly been revised downward since last autumn as downside risk has been realised both in the euro area and globally. Yet from now onwards, with substantial macroeconomic stimulus under way and extensive financial system rescue schemes in place, the risks to the economic outlook in the euro area should become more balanced. On the one hand, confidence and growth effects may be stronger than anticipated as a result of the enormous scale of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies worldwide. On the other hand, there remains, of course, the risk that the economic downturn in the euro area might become more severe than the staff projections indicate, for instance because of negative feedback effects from the financial system. Nevertheless, the degree of uncertainty surrounding the outlook for both the economy and inflation remains substantial. In order to fulfil our mandate and to contribute to financial stability and sustainable economic growth, the Eurosystem has been providing unlimited liquidity support to the euro-area banking system since October last year. The Governing Council has decided to continue the non-standard liquidity support beyond the end of 2009 in any case. As a direct consequence of this ample supply of liquidity, the Eurosystem has augmented its balance sheet by more than 600 billion euro since the start of the financial crisis in August 2007. At the same time, our monetary policy operations are having a visible effect on overnight money market rates in the euro area. Furthermore, the ECB Governing Council has cut interest rates sharply to unprecedented levels. And we still have room to cut interest rates further. But it is essential to bear in mind that an expansionary monetary policy comes at the price of creating a breeding ground for future risks to price stability. It might therefore prove useful to keep at hand instruments that enable us to reverse our monetary policy stance at the first signs of a recovery of the financial sector. 5  Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, I have highlighted some aspects that lie at the heart of each and every central bank engaged in forecasting, and I have mentioned a number of issues that are particularly relevant to the state of play in the Eurosystem in general and the Bundesbank in particular. I hope that our conference will help stimulate further research into forecasting. The diversity of modelling approaches as well as their empirical testing enriches the wealth of experience                                                  3  See Knüppel, M and G Schultefrankenfeld (2008), How informative are Risk Forecasts?

available to monetary policymakers. This helps to draw further conclusions for a robust and successful monetary policy in a continuously evolving economic landscape and, hence, helps to maintain price stability in the long run. Thank you for your attention. 6 BIS Review 36/2009 
Ardian Fullani: The importance of consumer confidence indicators  Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the Press Conference on Publication of Business and Consumer Confidence Surveys, Tirana, 16 February 2009. *      *      * Distinguished participants, We are holding this meeting to announce business and consumer survey results. These surveys represent an important long-run project of the Bank of Albania. Starting from today, the Bank of Albania will quarterly publish them, together with supporting materials for the user, including a publication schedule, the methodology applied for their compilation and the relevant questionnaires. Considering this day as a special one, I avail myself of the opportunity to share some ideas with you on the importance of confidence indicators, their methodology and the significance the Bank of Albania has given to this project. The publication of business and consumer confidence indicators is an important moment for enhancing Bank of Albania’s transparency. For some years on end, these indicators have been produced and made use of by Bank of Albania’s experts and by its decision-making structures, but now it is just the time to share this useful product with potential users of all levels. I would like to highlight that the results obtained from the processing of businesses’ and consumers’ answers are totally independent of and not influenced by the Bank of Albania, by economic, political and social conjunctures at home and abroad. All the users of this information should be aware that this information does not substitute or duplicate the official macroeconomic statistics. These qualitative indicators are compiled on the basis of opinions and expectations of the interviewed economic agents. I would like to be more concrete relate to this point. The Bank of Albania, having the awareness, independence and a certain degree of institutional transparency, and aiming at achieving high professionalism, plays an active and proactive role in the country’s economic development. Economic analysis is under direct function of the monetary policy decision-making process. In essence, the decision-making precedes the medium-term developments, sustaining the maintaining of price stability as the primary policy target drafted and implemented by the Bank of Albania. Profound analysis of the past, present and future developments of the economy contribute to appropriate decision-making. I assure you that building a complete “picture” of the present and the future of an economy is a rather difficult process, not only for an emerging economy, such as that of Albania, but also for the most advanced economies of the world. Economic and financial developments are accompanied by elements of insecurity, which have become, as you already know, dominant in last two years. Making decisions on the future of this already globalised world of economic links, requires professional maturity. Assessing and selecting appropriate and reliable statistical information requires profound intuitive abilities. Making the selected data bank beneficial to the decision-making, requires analytical foresight. As a matter of fact forward-looking decisions should be made on the basis of an ever larger and timely information; They should be constantly consulted with specialized economic and financial market agents. The Bank of Albania, likewise other central banks, endeavors to increase the qualitative and quantitative data base, in order to improve analyses and the decision-making process in making new steps. The finalization of the several-year project of the Bank of Albania, along which the Business and Consumer Confidence Indicator was consolidated, is an accomplishment of one of the medium-term development strategy objectives of our institution. The decision to publish these indicators passed through a prudent process and matured only after experts and decision-makers of the Bank of Albania were convinced that the confidence indicators, together with other indicators, revealed valuable additional BIS Review 36/2009 1 
information about the recent and future developments in the country’s real sector of the economy. Allow me to briefly summarize some of the basic concepts on confidence, tendency and the foregoing indicators. They have been widely used in many advanced countries of the world, particularly over the last two decades. These indicators are constructed on the basis of information collected from surveys, which are technically referred to as Business and Consumer Confidence/Tendency Surveys. The Bank of Albania conducts these surveys in cooperation with INSTAT. Increasing demand of analysts, decision-makers, market agents and the broad public for timely economic information and the ability of these indicators to hint business cycle turning points, have made them very common and useful. The peculiarity of these indicators is that they reveal information on the tendency of various economy indicators, based on qualitative opinions of businesses and consumers. The Bank of Albania has been working for several years to construct these indicators, based on the results from large-scale surveys conducted with 720 businesses and 1200 consumers. The cooperation with global leaders in this area has been very efficient. Experts from the German Institute of Economic Studies have supported the process of methodological and economic analysis of business confidence indicators. While working for this project, Bank of Albania’s experts have studied and applied important aspects of contemporary methodologies followed by the OECD countries and by the European Commission. Until coming to the decision to publish them, researches and tests have been constantly carried out on the developments, suggested by these indicators and later on verified by the statistics of the INSTAT. The compliance degree of the tendencies from both sources is assessed as statistically significant, thus making them useful. Various methodologies and empirical findings have been introduced in technical round tables, and in working papers and articles compiled by the Bank’s experts. For more than four years, the results revealed by these indicators have been more and more taken into consideration by Bank of Albania’s decision-making, thus contributing to the building of inflation expectations indicator. They provide preliminary information on expected producer price performance, an important link for the price-setting process in the economy. Consumption and savings tendencies of the population are revealed through relevant indicators. In conclusion, the economic sentiment indicator combines the businesses’ and consumers’ opinions, giving hints of the economic prospects in the short run. I would like to speak at length about the importance and informational utility of the confidence and the foregoing indicators. But, I would rather emphasize the respect the users should pay to such indicators, opting for being oriented to the large information flow through them. I regard this only as the beginning of a comprehensible and transparent cooperation. To this end, other special meetings and activities will follow, enriching various groups of interest with knowledge on business confidence or tendency indicators. I have confidence in the added values they will bring to users’ analyses. But, I advise and require of users, researchers, economic journalists of written and electronic media, students and pupils, businesses and consumers and the broad public, to rightly understand these indicators, before using them. These tendencies have resulted from businesses’ and consumers’ opinions and do not constitute the official stance of the Bank of Albania. The Bank of Albania has built them on the basis of an advanced methodology. It has made use of the information obtained from interviewed businesses and consumers and it has confidence in their qualitative assessments and in those indicators. Their publication enhances the public transparency and makes the decision-making process more comprehensible. It is up to users to decide whether to use these indicators or not. I assure you that experts from the Bank of Albania will stand by the users, making them well-informed, highlighting that further improvements will be made in this area. Thank you for your attention! 2 BIS Review 36/2009 
W A Wijewardena: The role of statistics and challenges for statisticians  Keynote address by Mr W A Wijewardena, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the Stat Day, organized by  University of Colombo, Colombo, 26 March 2009. *      *      * Consciously or unconsciously, we use statistics in everything we do in our day to day life. When we say that it rained yesterday, we simply pronounce a fact we have observed as having happened. When we say that it is raining now, we again mention something that we have observed as happening. When we say that it will rain tomorrow, we are predicting a future event. Our life is full of such statements: facts that have been experienced by us in the past, facts that are happening now and being experienced in the present and facts that we feel would happen in the future. What has happened and is happening now are our personal experiences. What will happen are our learned judgements based on our experiences. If we keep these experiences and learned judgments to ourselves, then, it would not form the subject matter of statistics. It becomes statistics only when we share them with others. Hence, statistics is basically, observing, analysing, learning and sharing facts about the real world. That sharing of facts need not necessarily be in quantitative or measurable form. They can be simple expressions in verbal form so that others could form opinions on the happenings in the real world. Statistics do not have a heart or a religion When we express our personal experiences, we step into a dangerous territory. Our personal experiences are guided by our emotional and subjective feelings. When we share them with others, we are inviting them to accept our emotional and subjective feelings as if they too have experienced the same. This is where we run into problems. Unless others too have the same emotional and subjective feelings, there is no reason for them to accept our experiences as their experiences. Hence, statistics to be shared by everyone should necessarily be based on objective considerations. In other words, statistics should not have a heart. Its religion should be pure objectivity. It should convey facts as has been observed by an individual free from personal biases or prejudices. Only such an impersonal statistical framework has the capability of serving people intending to use them for making judgments about the real world. How economic development occurs? An economy has to play a specific role towards its members. It has to produce and supply goods and services as demanded by them having consideration for timeliness, quantity and quality. When an economy produces these goods and services in larger and larger volumes year after year, new wealth is created, raising the well-being of its members. The continuous creation of wealth by people in this manner raising the overall welfare levels brings about what is called “economic development”. That has become the prime objective of all societies today as has been demonstrated by the choice of the theme of this Stat Day Event.  Wealth is created in any society by people who make choices between consumption and production, decide on appropriate production methods and take risk on what they do. A vital input which they use for this process is “information”. Statistics is nothing but another name for information presented in a more sophisticated and analytical form. Hence, any society desiring to attain the highest level of economic development cannot disregard the importance of statistics. BIS Review 36/2009 1 
The use of statistics as an input If statistics are an input, like any other input, there should be a demand for them. If statistics help people to create wealth, they should be prepared to pay a price to acquire them. When there is a price for statistics, there should be a supply of statistics as well. It, therefore, connotes that there is a market for statistics, like the market for all other inputs. This means that people who have information that can be traded in the market will have to package and sell it. The packaging should be done in such a way that the users would be able to consume statistics as an instant product without having to process them further in-house. This is the biggest challenge which statisticians face today: how to sell their product to would-be users as a readily consumable product and help them to create wealth. The market for information and statistics There are market based statistics-producers in developed countries. The market agents are ready to pay a price in order to acquire such statistics. The producers of statistics conduct frequent market surveys, analyse results, supply them on line at a price and help market agents to create wealth. Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka, we do not have such market based statistics-producers. The collection and analysis of vital data that are useful to market agents are being done by a few governmental organisations. Like any other product supplied by the government, such data are also supplied as a public good free of charge. Even when the governmental agencies could sell statistics at a price, they do not venture to do so, because they are guided by such principles as “doing utmost benefit” to people as a social service. The country too, therefore, expects free goods from these governmental organisations. But this creates a problem known as “the agent-principal problem” in economics.  The agent-principal problem The agent-principal problem is typical to any government service. It says that the agent who is a government bureau or a department or even a university does not have incentive to produce its output at its best. The principal who is the user of the service, on the other hand, is scattered and not in a position to influence the agent to improve quality. This is why in many countries the governments have tried to make the agents amenable to public’s requirements through the implementation of such devices as “people’s charters”. The result is the production of the agent remaining at low quality, becoming unreliable and failing to satisfy the users. The same fate has befallen the governmental organisations that produce and supply statistics to the public free of charge. Many have witnessed the increasing occurrence of the “misuse of statistics” by those who produce and supply statistics to the market. The Google search machine has documented some 2.5 million cases of the misuse of statistics from around the world. The misuse of statistics Why does the production of statistics become unreliable? There are many pitfalls to which statisticians fall when they produce statistics. Wikipedia, the cyber-encyclopaedia, has listed out these errors often committed by statisticians. According to Wikipedia, “a misuse of statistics occurs when a statistical argument asserts a falsehood”. It could be due to both accidental and purposeful. When it is purposeful, it is always perpetrated in order to gain an undue benefit to the perpetrator. The danger with the wrongful use of statistics is the creation of a statistical fallacy that would be costly to those who make use of the deliberately doctored statistics. Such statistics are damaging to the quest of knowledge in the sense that, once they are rooted in the minds of the people, it would take years to correct the falsehood that it would have created in the society. The types of misuse of statistics listed by Wikipedia are as follows:  2 BIS Review 36/2009 
• First, the statistician may discard the unfavourable data and make use only what is favourable for him to prove his point.  • Second, in field surveys, the statistician may ask loaded questions in order to elicit an answer of his choice. • Third, the statistician may tend to over-generalise facts and make wrong conclusions. • Fourth, the samples used may be biased. • Fifth, the causality outlined may be fallacious. • Sixth, the data may have been manipulated in order to show a result favourable to some interested party. • Seventh, data may be dredged or mined in order to find a correlation that would not be there. How to gain credibility for statistics? All these instances of the misuse of statistics make the statistics less reliable and suspicious. The governmental statistical agencies throughout the globe are criticised by public on this ground. Once the organisations lose credibility regarding the compilation of statistics, it would be very hard to regain trust and confidence of users. The statistical bureaus run by former Soviet Union and its satellite states have been subject to this criticism. The way to avoid this criticism is to adopt global best practices with regard to compilation and dissemination of statistics. It requires countries to adopt a code of ethics and practices when it comes to dissemination of information. Many member countries of the International Monetary Fund have adopted such a code in the form of signing for following the principles of outlined in a general data dissemination system and, at a more stringent level, a special data dissemination system. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is a signatory to the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System. The final message In summary, if statisticians are desirous of supporting economic development, they should necessarily produce and supply statistics to meet the requirements of the market. It is essential that they produce such statistics as a readily usable product that could be sold in the market at a price. It is now time in Sri Lanka for the private statistics-producers to enter the vast market of information. The universities in this sense are in an advantageous position, because they have the best human talents with them. It is unfortunate that they sit idly on this vast wealth of resources. It is time that universities in Sri Lanka reorient themselves to gain advantage from the market resources and become financially self supporting. In addition, the universities should train their statistics students to become entrepreneurs of statistics rather than becoming employees of agencies that may plan to hire statisticians.

William C Dudley: Oversight of the Federal Government's intervention at American International Group  Testimony of Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, 24 March 2009. *      *      * Good morning, Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and other members of the Committee. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to appear before you today. As you know, on January 27, 2009, I became the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Before I assumed that position, I served as the head of the Markets Group at the New York Fed. I appreciate having this opportunity to discuss the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's involvement with American International Group, Inc. (AIG). Role of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York At the outset, it is important to note that before the New York Fed became involved with AIG as a lender on September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve lacked any kind of authority to oversee AIG. The lack of effective consolidated supervision over AIG was a critical contributing factor to the debacle that occurred at the company. The Federal Reserve made its decision to lend based on a judgment that a failure of AIG would cause dramatically negative consequences for the financial system and the economy – consequences worse than what occurred in the aftermath of the failure of Lehman Brothers. We stand by that judgment today. In the case of Lehman, some of the most severe repercussions related to the difficulties in coordinating cross-border insolvency regimes and in coordinating the insolvency regimes among different types of institutions within the organization's corporate structure. In light of AIG's unparalleled global footprint – operating in more than 130 countries around the globe – and the multiplicity of different types of financial services entities within its structure – including insurance providers, foreign banks, consumer lending companies and OTC derivatives affiliates – the factors that proved unmanageable in the Lehman insolvency threatened to be much more severe in AIG's case. The fact that no effective emergency resolution procedures exist under U.S. law to reconcile these difficulties heightened the need for quick, effective action by the Federal Reserve, in consultation with and supported by the U.S. Treasury. From the outset, the New York Fed has been sharply focused on addressing two overarching goals with respect to AIG: (1) the stabilization of the company so that it no longer poses a disruptive threat to our financial system and economy and (2) obtaining full repayment of the government funds that have been extended to AIG. In light of the exceptional size and scope of AIG's operations, with over 110,000 employees in more than 130 countries, spanning hundreds of legal entities, it was clear from the beginning that the New York Fed – which had never been engaged in any regulatory oversight of the company – was not in a position to exert day-to-day management control over the company. Rather, the New York Fed's actions have consistently been directed at securing its objectives as lender. As any lender in our position would do, the New York Fed has put into place a loan agreement that contains covenants designed to help ensure ultimate repayment of the loan – but these creditor's rights do not create an ability to manage AIG. Responsibility for AIG's day-to-day affairs continues to rest with AIG's chief executive officer, Edward Liddy, under the oversight of AIG's board of directors. Mr. Liddy, who has only become involved with AIG in a public-spirited attempt to resolve its troubled affairs, has BIS Review 35/2009 1 
made strides in dealing with AIG's opaque corporate structure, lack of centralized controls and complex risk exposures, but much remains to be done. In light of the inherent conflicts that would arise from either the U.S. government or the Federal Reserve exerting ownership control over the world's largest insurer, the Federal Reserve, with the support of the Treasury Department, directed in the loan agreement that an approximately 77.9 percent equity interest in AIG be issued to an independent trust established for the sole benefit of the United States Treasury. The trust, which now holds that controlling equity interest, is overseen by three independent trustees who are of the highest integrity and who have considerable experience leading major companies. These trustees have a legally binding obligation to exercise all of their rights as majority owner of AIG in the best interests of the U.S. taxpayer, with the proceeds of any ultimate sale of shares going directly to the Treasury of the United States. Efforts to reduce risk at AIG Financial Products As has been widely noted, the activities at AIG's Financial Products unit (FP) were a principal cause of the losses that drove AIG to the brink of bankruptcy in September 2008. Risks of substantial magnitude – including derivatives positions with a current total notional value exceeding one trillion dollars – still remain in force at FP, meaning that not millions but billions of taxpayer dollars are potentially at stake as the orderly wind-down of FP continues to progress. The winding down of these risk positions at FP is a delicate and complex matter with systemic implications for the U.S. and global economy. Our oversight of this risk-reduction process remains a top priority. With respect to the retention awards owed to FP employees under their pre-existing contracts, we believe that Mr. Liddy weighed a number of factors in deciding not to attempt to prevent payment, including: • the likely negative effects of disruption in staffing at FP in managing its multi-billion dollar exposures;  • legal advice that the contracts were valid – meaning that breaking them would likely increase the amount of company funds ultimately paid to the covered employees; and  • the negative consequences to AIG's business that could result from the public abrogation of contracts.  In conducting our oversight as lender, the New York Fed did not see reason to disagree with Mr. Liddy's judgment from a risk perspective. Equally important, we did not think it was legally permissible – or within the proper role of the New York Fed – to attempt to substitute our judgment for that of Mr. Liddy in this circumstance, even though we found the payment of the retention awards extremely distasteful. The broad public disapproval of sizeable retention payments being directed toward the unit most responsible for last fall's downfall of AIG is understandable. Americans naturally feel outraged when confronted with news of such payments to an entity that worsened the financial crisis and that is dependent on taxpayer funds to stay out of bankruptcy court where these contracts would not have been fully honored. Moreover, the payments occurred during a time when so many Americans are struggling to find jobs, seeing their wages reduced or watching their retirement savings plummet as a result of a crisis they had no hand in creating. This feeling of outrage underscores the urgent need to reform the system of compensation at our financial institutions to more closely align the incentives of executives, owners and taxpayers. Congress saw fit to impose appropriate compensation restrictions on recipients of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funding, and we think it is crucial for Congress and the U.S. Department of the Treasury to continue to craft effective and sensible policies in this area. 2 BIS Review 35/2009 
Although oversight of TARP-related compensation matters rests with the Treasury Department, the New York Fed has played a role since September in reviewing the adequacy of AIG's corporate governance procedures. This review has helped to identify longstanding deficiencies with respect to compensation committee governance, compensation benchmarking and lack of centralized control over compensation policy. We will continue to work with our colleagues at Treasury and the independent trustees to ensure that AIG's management properly addresses these deficiencies. Ongoing involvement with AIG The total package of assistance that the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department have committed to AIG has established a more durable capital structure for the company that gives AIG greater time and flexibility to execute its asset disposition plan to repay government funds. Notably, we have recently agreed in principle to accept preferred interests in two of AIG's large foreign life insurance subsidiaries, AIA and ALICO, in order to make repayment of our loan less dependent on forced divestitures into a depressed acquisition market. Although it will take time, we still expect that the proceeds from asset sales should enable AIG to repay the New York Fed in full. In all that we have done, we have been motivated by two goals: to preserve the stability of the U.S. economy and to protect the U.S. taxpayer. The threat of a major systemic risk event has been averted by honoring all of AIG's contractual obligations around the globe – from insurance policy obligations owed to individuals, municipalities and businesses across the U.S., to the posting of collateral under credit default swap arrangements with the full range of counterparties recently disclosed. As unattractive as certain aspects of this treatment may be, these negative aspects have followed unavoidably from the decision to avert a systemically destructive bankruptcy. I look forward to your questions today and, in the longer term, to working with you and your staffs on the broader public policy questions – such as formulation of a resolution regime for institutions like AIG and consideration of the appropriate supervisory structure for OTC derivatives – that are posed by the events at AIG. Thank you. BIS Review 35/2009 3 
Lucas Papademos: Strengthening macro-prudential supervision in Europe Speech by Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the European Central Bank, at the conference on “After The Storm: The Future Face of Europe’s Financial System”, organised by Bruegel, National Bank of Belgium and the International Monetary Fund, Brussels, 24 March 2009. *      *      * I.  Introduction This conference has provided an excellent forum for an enriching and stimulating debate on “The Future Face of Europe’s Financial System”, a subject which is both topical and highly policy relevant. In my remarks, I will focus on two issues:  • First, what are the key lessons of the ongoing financial crisis for EU financial supervisory policy; • Second, what are the objectives and responsibilities of macro-prudential supervision, and what are the instruments and institutional requirements for the effective performance of macro-prudential tasks.  II.  The lessons of the crisis for financial supervisory policy A first lesson of the financial crisis is that it has been a consequence of factors and processes that have affected both the overall macro-financial environment as well as the behaviour of individual institutions and the functioning of specific market segments. It was the joint influence of both macro and micro factors that resulted in market excesses and the emergence of systemic risks of unprecedented magnitude and complexity. At a macroeconomic level, large and persisting global imbalances, rapid credit expansion over a protracted period of time, in a benign environment of low inflation and high growth, fostered a huge increase in leverage, a significant underpricing of risk and a consequent divergence of asset prices from fundamental values. At a micro-economic level, financial innovations, notably the securitisation process, although in principle should have helped to better diversify and distribute risk, were implemented in a manner that fostered improper incentives and resulted in the loosening bank lending standards, the creation of complex and opaque products whose real value and embedded risk was difficult to assess, and the establishment of off-balance sheet investment vehicles that led to the concentration of (credit and market) risk and maturity mismatches that contributed to the severity and duration of the crisis. A second lesson of the crisis is that the nature and magnitude of the systemic risk in the financial sector is not related only to the potential illiquidity or insolvency of large banks or other big regulated financial institutions, but it also depends on the degree of “interdependence” or “interconnectedness” between financial institutions and between markets. This “interconnectedness” reflects a variety of direct and indirect linkages in the financial system and it involves institutions and markets that are regulated as well as those that are not subject to sufficient, or any, regulatory oversight. This second category includes not only hedge funds but also off-balance sheet financial entities, such as structured investment vehicles, as well as the securitisation market, and the market for credit default swaps (CDS). In this respect, two points are relevant for the design of the regulatory policies. First, the size of some of the non-bank financial institutions and the overall magnitude of the activities of the “non-bank, non regulated sector” have become significant and can pose systemic risks. Second, and as a consequence of the first, the “interconnectedness” of all BIS Review 35/2009 1 
institutions and markets implies that it is the “collective” behaviour of all that determines endogenously systemic risk and its potential impact on the real economy. A third lesson is that the increasing financial integration in Europe and globally has important implications for the cross-border distribution and propagation of systemic risk and the appropriate institutional setting for the prevention and management of a crisis. More specifically, the regulatory framework and the supervisory arrangements in Europe must be broadly compatible with those in other large economic areas, notably the United States and vice versa. And within the EU, the growing presence and significance of cross-border financial institutions (the largest 43 cross-border banking groups in the EU accounted for 76 % of total EU bank assets at the end of 20071 requires the strengthening of the pan-European character of supervision.  A fourth and final lesson that I want to stress is that effective crisis prevention and management call for close cooperation and efficient information exchange between the supervisory authorities in various jurisdictions as well as between the central banks, whose tasks include the safeguarding of financial system stability, and the supervisors of individual institutions. The effectiveness of such cooperation, which is relevant both within countries, and across borders, crucially hinges on the exchange of relevant information in a timely manner. What broad conclusions can we draw from these lessons, and more generally from the recent experience, for supervisory policy? Although the severity of the ensuing problems has differed across institutions and countries, overall the crisis revealed that micro-prudential supervision in many cases proved inadequate to identify, in a timely manner, the nature and size of accumulating risks and to impose appropriate remedial action. Moreover, although the build-up of financial imbalances, the underpricing of risk and the rise in the degree of leverage in the financial system had been identified as sources of potential instability by international institutions and central banks, including the ECB, their warning signals, which had become progressively louder over time, did not trigger appropriate responses either by market participants or by the authorities responsible for the oversight of individual financial institutions or specific market segments. There is, therefore, a manifest need to strengthen both the macro-prudential and micro-prudential supervision of the financial system and to do so in a way that achieves valuable synergies and has a mutually reinforcing impact on the stability of the financial system. In particular, the role of macro-financial factors, of the interconnectedness of markets and institutions and of cross-border financial integration in determining the size, nature and propagation of systemic risk calls for the strengthening of macro-prudential supervision in Europe and globally. This should help prevent the recurrence of similar episodes of market excesses and corrections in the future, with disruptive effects on the real economy, and it should help ensure that the financial system is dynamically stable and resilient to shocks. III.  The framework for macro-prudential supervision in the EU What are the implications of the lessons of the crisis of these broader policy conclusions for the appropriate design and the effective functioning of the EU supervisory framework? I will address this question by taking as a “frame of reference” the pertinent recommendations of the Report of the de Larosière Group that was broadly welcomed by the European Commission. The Report is a comprehensive and valuable contribution that deals with a wide range of issues concerning financial regulation, supervision and global cooperation. I will focus on the envisaged framework for macro-prudential supervision, as outlined in the two                                                  1  In the euro area, the largest 30 cross-border banking groups accounted for 73% of euro area total bank assets at the end of 2007. 2 BIS Review 35/2009 
recommendations, 16 and 19, both because of the importance of establishing such a framework – since it does not yet exist and is urgently needed – and because of the central role that the ECB and the European System of Central Banks are proposed to play. The Report recommends that a new body – called the European Systemic Risk Council (ESRC) – should be set up, to be chaired by the ECB President, and which should function under the auspices and with the logistical support of the ECB. The new body should pool and analyse all information, relevant for financial stability, pertaining to macro-economic conditions and to macro-prudential developments in all the financial sectors. The general task of this body will be to “form judgements and make recommendations on macro-prudential policy, issue risk warnings, compare observations on macro-economic and prudential developments and give directions on these issues”. Let me elaborate on two sets of issues: (1) the functions of the macro-prudential framework; and (2) a number of necessary conditions pertaining to instruments, institutional requirements and procedures for the effective performance of macro-prudential policies.  The main functions of the macro-prudential framework include: • the identification and assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the EU financial system (including all markets, institutions and infrastructures); • the issuance of risk warnings; and  • the adoption of related recommendations on macro-prudential policies.  These functions could be complemented by other relevant tasks: • the definition of specific macro-prudential reporting requirements for financial institutions to fill significant information gaps; • an advisory role on EU regulatory measures that are relevant for macro-prudential supervision. This role could also include the identification of possible regulatory gaps stemming from financial innovation that could pose systemic risks. The performance of these tasks requires the support of appropriate analysis and a comprehensive information base. The interconnectedness of financial institutions and markets within the EU but also globally implies that the monitoring and assessment of potential systemic risks should be based on a broad set of relevant macro-economic and macro-financial data and indicators, as well as information provided by micro-prudential supervisors and information obtained from market intelligence. The development of the appropriate structure and the procedures for bringing together all types of pertinent information, also in a manner that ensures strict confidentiality in the use of micro data, will represent a major challenge, which will require analytical sophistication, market knowledge and supervisory expertise. Moreover, the monitoring of risk exposures across institutions, markets and borders will have to rely on the close cooperation with the relevant supervisory authorities (banking, insurance and securities supervisors) within the EU and globally. The analysis necessary for carrying out the macro-prudential tasks can partly be based on the economic and monetary analyses undertaken by central banks for the formulation of monetary policy. But it will have to be complemented with the further development and use of models for macro-stress testing and of financial stability indicators. These analytical tools can help monitor, and assess the implications for systemic stability, of risk exposures across institutions and markets, for instance, the common credit exposures of interconnected financial institutions to other firms, sectors or regions; or the market risk exposures through holdings of securities or common positioning of interconnected institutions in relevant markets (i.e. potentially leading to so-called “crowded trades”). Macro-prudential analysis and supervision focus, by definition, on the monitoring and assessment of systemic risk in the whole financial sector. This risk, which can emerge both during the upswing and the downswing of an economic and financial cycle, reflects the BIS Review 35/2009 3 
effects of macroeconomic forces and the collective behaviour of institutions and other market participants. Central banks, whose primary objective is the preservation of price stability –a necessary though not sufficient condition for the stability of the financial system– and which maintain close links with the money and financial markets in order to perform their monetary policy tasks, are well suited to be the authorities mainly responsible for macro-prudential supervision. In the EU, the ECB and the European System of Central Banks stand ready to carry out the analytical and statistical work necessary so that the new EU body responsible for macro-prudential supervision can perform its functions effectively. At the same time, the involvement and cooperation of supervisory authorities is also essential. In addition to the proposed participation of the chairpersons of CEBS, CEIOPS and CESR, as well as one representative of the European Commission, the heads of national supervisors could be invited to join the national central bank governors as required by the subjects being discussed.  Appropriate links should also be established between the ESCB and the proposed European System of Financial Supervision. These links should contribute, inter alia, to effective information-sharing as well as to providing an additional channel through which the “output” of the deliberations of the new EU macro-prudential supervisory body will be communicated to the micro-prudential supervisors and help trigger appropriate policy measures. This could include changes to capital requirements and liquidity buffers in order to respond to identified emerging systemic risk. And this observation brings me to my last two points. The de Larosière Group emphasised that once a macro-prudential risk warning has been issued “it must be clear to everyone who should act and according to which timetable”. It is therefore essential that a suitable mechanism is in place to ensure that the required supervisory or regulatory actions are implemented in an effective and timely manner.  No reflection on the appropriate macro-prudential framework for Europe would be complete without due consideration of its international dimension. This global financial crisis has underscored the importance of concerted policy responses globally. The early identification and assessment of risks and vulnerabilities, the issuance of risk warnings, and the adoption of the related macro-prudential policies should be key responsibilities in a reformed global framework for financial oversight, in which the IMF and the FSF should play a key role, but all relevant parties, including the new EU macro-prudential supervisory body, should be closely involved. Our European framework should fit in, and be compatible with the global approach to be adopted.  IV. Conclusion In conclusion, let me emphasise that the establishment of the proposed EU body responsible for macro-prudential supervision, the effective performance of its tasks, the efficient translation of its risk assessments and macro-prudential policy recommendations into appropriate policy measures will require addressing a number of legal, institutional and organisational issues. One such issue is the institutional relationship and fruitful collaboration between the European Systemic Risk Council and the envisaged European System of Financial Supervision. We should all contribute to addressing these issues in a constructive and timely manner, for the strengthening of macro-prudential supervision in Europe is an important and urgent policy objective. Thank you very much for your attention. 4 BIS Review 35/2009 
Ben S Bernanke: The financial crisis and community banking Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Independent Community Bankers of America's National Convention and Techworld, Phoenix, Arizona, 20 March 2009. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website. *      *      * When I addressed this convention three years ago, with all of five weeks under my belt as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, I opened my remarks with three observations: that community banks played a critical role in the U.S. economy, that community banks were generally doing well, and that community banks faced a changing business environment that posed important challenges. I am struck that all three observations, at least to some degree, still hold true today. Community banks continue to play a critical role in our economy and, in many cases, have an opportunity to step in and make sound profitable loans, where some competitors have pulled back. Relatively speaking at least, community banks are doing better as a group than other segments of our financial system, but at the same time they are far from immune to current conditions. And, surely, it is still true that the business environment poses important challenges to community banks.  In fact, I think it is safe to say that few of us in the convention hall three years ago envisioned the financial and economic environment we now confront. Envisioning the conditions we will face three years from now is equally difficult, but it is my hope and expectation that those conditions will be significantly brighter. This morning, I'd like to spend some time reviewing the Federal Reserve's response to the financial crisis of the past 18 months, as well as the current challenges – and opportunities – facing community banks. In addition, I'll discuss two important steps that policymakers can and should take to improve the financial regulatory system that likely are of particular interest to you. The first step is the need to address the very real problem caused by institutions that are too big – or too interconnected – to fail in a disorderly manner. The second involves ways of making the system less procyclical, so that the financial system is less susceptible to exuberant booms and disastrous busts. In discussing the road back to financial stability and economic prosperity, I want to leave you with the idea that, yes, this is indeed a time of challenge for community bankers, as it is for all Americans, but it also is a time of opportunity.  Federal Reserve actions to address the financial crisis The depth and complexity of the strains that have gripped financial markets and institutions since the summer of 2007 have led the Federal Reserve to take innovative and extraordinary actions aimed at restoring stability to markets and supporting the flow of credit to businesses and households.  Most directly, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has eased monetary policy aggressively. From the second half of 2007 to the spring of 2008, the Committee reduced its target for the federal funds rate from 5-1/4 percent to 2 percent. And, as the financial turbulence intensified last fall and the economic outlook deteriorated, the Committee responded by cutting the target for the federal funds rate to near zero by the end of last year. As a result, a number of interest rates, especially shorter-term rates, have declined significantly, offsetting, at least to some degree, the effects of the financial turmoil on the cost of credit. However, as community bankers are no doubt aware, that offset has been incomplete. Widening credit spreads, more-restrictive lending standards, and credit market dysfunction are working against the monetary easing and leading to tighter financial BIS Review 34/2009 1 
conditions overall. To address these problems, the Federal Reserve has employed a range of additional tools. These tools can be divided into three sets. The first set is closely tied to the central bank's traditional role of provider of short-term liquidity to sound financial institutions. Over the course of the crisis, the Fed has sought to ensure that financial institutions – including banks of all sizes as well as primary dealers – have had adequate access to short-term credit.1 We substantially reduced the spread of the primary credit rate over the target federal funds rate and increased the maximum maturity of primary credit loans to 90 days; we have also been conducting regular auctions of discount window credit for terms of up to 84 days. In fulfilling this traditional lending function, we have helped ease conditions in interbank funding markets, thus increasing the willingness of banks to extend loans and thereby easing credit conditions for the households and businesses that depend on banks.  Despite our provision of liquidity to banks and broker-dealers, a number of critical nonbank financial markets – such as the commercial paper market and the market for asset-backed securities – deteriorated significantly. Under normal circumstances, these markets are important sources of credit for American businesses and their customers. Thus, we developed a second set of policy tools to provide liquidity directly to borrowers and investors in key credit markets. Notably, we have introduced facilities to purchase highly rated commercial paper at a term of three months and to provide backup liquidity for money market mutual funds.  In addition, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have jointly established a facility – the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF – that lends against AAA-rated asset-backed securities collateralized by recently originated student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. This program just got under way; the first subscription for funding under the program was completed yesterday, with the funds to be disbursed next week. Over time, we expect to expand this facility to include loans against other types of newly issued AAA-rated asset-backed securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities and private-label residential mortgage-backed securities. If this program works as planned, it should make new consumer, business, and mortgage loans more available, at lower cost.  The Federal Reserve's third set of tools for supporting the credit markets involves the purchase of longer-term securities for the Fed's portfolio. As we announced this week, we are purchasing up to $300 billion in Treasury debt, $200 billion of the debt of government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), and up to $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the GSEs and federal agencies this year. These purchases are intended to improve conditions in private credit markets. In particular, they are helping to reduce the interest rates that the GSEs require on the mortgages that they purchase or securitize, thereby lowering the rate at which lenders, including community banks, can fund new mortgages.  The Federal Reserve continuously assesses the effectiveness of its credit-related tools. So far, we have generally been encouraged by the market responses, including the decline in mortgage interest rates I mentioned. In addition, our commercial paper facility has helped American businesses finance their payrolls and other operational obligations by significantly lowering rates on the paper and opening access to financing at terms longer than a few days. Our actions to stabilize the money market mutual fund industry, together with other government programs, have also shown some success – the sharp withdrawals from funds in September on balance have given way to modest inflows.                                                  1  Primary dealers are broker-dealers that trade in U.S. government securities with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

These credit-easing programs, along with actions taken by the Treasury and other government entities, are crucial determinants of the timing and strength of the economic recovery. However, although low interest rates and ongoing fiscal stimulus will help, we cannot have a vigorous economic recovery unless we succeed in restoring a reasonable degree of financial stability. Conditions and outlook for community banks As you well know, community banks have been adversely affected by the turmoil in the financial system. As a group, community banks – which I define to include commercial banks with assets of $1 billion or less – have seen their financial performance and condition deteriorate substantially since the middle of 2007. Nevertheless, as I will discuss, the longer-term outlook for community banks is positive in light of their unique competitive advantages.  Looking first at current conditions, higher loan loss provisions and significant realized losses on investment securities – related in many cases to impairment of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac equity holdings – substantially eroded the profitability of community banks in 2008. Community banks reported net income of just $4.6 billion, less than one-half of the level of 2007. In the fourth quarter, almost one in every three community banks reported a loss, and overall they reported a small net loss of about $150 million. Community banks entered the crisis with strong capital, and, despite weakening earnings, the vast majority – well over 95 percent – remained well capitalized at year-end 2008 under Prompt Corrective Action standards. Nevertheless, the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets rose to its highest level since 1992 as residential mortgage and construction loans continued to deteriorate. And given the near-term economic outlook, loan quality at many community banks may decline further.  I know that bankers – including community bankers – have expressed concern over some of the "mixed messages" they perceive are coming from the federal banking agencies in the current environment – particularly admonitions to continue lending at the same time that institutions are being urged to maintain adequate capital and prudent lending standards. We are sensitive to this issue, which is why last November the agencies jointly issued the "Interagency Statement on Meeting the Needs of Creditworthy Borrowers."2 In that statement, we noted that continuing to lend in this environment is not inconsistent with maintaining good risk management and high underwriting standards. For example, we emphasized that, while rectifying past shortcomings in underwriting standards and other aspects of risk management, banks can and should continue to provide loans to creditworthy customers. We have directed our examiners to be mindful of the procyclical effects of excessive credit tightening and to encourage banks to make economically viable loans, provided such lending is based on realistic asset valuations and a balanced assessment of borrowers' repayment capacities. Across the Federal Reserve System, we have implemented training and outreach to underscore that direction.  In recent years, I and others from the Federal Reserve have underscored the importance of community banks to the U.S. financial system and economy. I continue to believe that firmly. Community banks serve businesses and consumers throughout the country, in both rural and urban areas. They are a leading provider of credit to small businesses, a key source of job creation in this country.  In the decades leading up to the current crisis, the nature of lending had changed dramatically, with greater industry consolidation, increased economies of scale and scope,                                                  2  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift Supervision (2008), "Interagency Statement on Meeting the Needs of Creditworthy Borrowers," joint press release, November 12.

and a larger portion of credit being supplied by nonbanks. While such changes challenged community bankers, your institutions have remained vitally important. Indeed, during the current crisis, some data show recent increases in loan and deposit balances at community banks, while such balances are generally flat or even decreasing at the largest banks.  The various efforts that the Federal Reserve has taken to provide backup liquidity to financial firms and to improve the functioning of financial markets have, I believe, helped all segments of the financial system, including the community banking sector, and the economy more generally. Helping community banks also helps the local communities that they serve. One important way that community banks may assist their communities is by working with at-risk homeowners to avoid preventable foreclosures. Foreclosures can result in clusters of vacant properties, which in turn can foster crime, stretch municipal resources at a time of weakening revenue, and lead to lower house prices throughout the neighborhood. These are some of the reasons why the Federal Reserve, along with the other U.S. banking agencies, has encouraged banks to participate in the Making Home Affordable loan modification program established by the Treasury. While continuing challenges remain, opportunities also exist for community banks. In some instances, community banks are able to step in at crucial moments when local businesses or consumers have been unable to find credit elsewhere. Indeed, as some banks have chosen to cut back on lending to conserve capital and liquidity, community banks in strong financial condition may find that they can gain creditworthy customers even in today's economic environment. Such community banks also may find opportunities to reclaim customers and business from nonbank lenders who have drawn back as the securitization markets have encountered difficulties. Community banks are able to respond promptly in such cases because of their in-depth knowledge of their markets, their locally focused management teams and boards, and their commitment to tailoring unique credit products for individual borrowers and businesses.  Addressing the "Too Big to Fail" problem  Many of you likely are frustrated, and rightfully so, by the impact that the financial crisis and economic downturn has had on your banks, as well as on the reputation of bankers more generally. You may well have built your reputations and institutions through responsible lending and community-focused operations, but nonetheless, you now find yourselves facing higher deposit insurance assessments and increasing public skepticism about the behavior of bankers – outcomes that you perceive were largely caused by the actions of larger financial institutions. Many of you managed your businesses prudently and shunned more exotic instruments and activities. And many of your customers – households and businesses – avoided excesses and are able to meet their financial commitments on a timely basis. No doubt this frustration has been heightened by the problems caused by financial firms that are too big or too interconnected to fail. Indeed, the too-big-to-fail issue has emerged as an enormous problem, both for policymakers and for financial institutions generally. Creditors of a firm perceived as too big to fail have less incentive to monitor and restrict the firm's risk-taking through adjustments to the price at which they lend money to the firm. If left unaddressed, this weakening of market discipline creates an unlevel playing field for smaller institutions, which may not be able to raise funds as cheaply, even if their individual risk profiles are better, or at least no worse, than those of their larger competitors. The erosion in market discipline distorts market behavior and can give firms an incentive to grow – either internally or through acquisitions – in order to be perceived as too big to fail. Government rescues to prevent the failure of major financial institutions also have required large amounts of public resources. These actions have involved extremely unpleasant and difficult choices, but given the interconnected nature of our financial system and the potentially devastating effects on confidence, financial markets, and the broader economy that would likely arise from the disorderly failure of a major financial firm in the current 4 BIS Review 34/2009 
environment, I do not think we have had a realistic alternative to preventing such failures. That said, these episodes have shown clearly that the problem of too-big-to-fail is extremely serious. To address this issue, which should be a top priority for financial reform, policymakers will need to act on several fronts. First, supervisors – as we are already doing – must vigorously address the weaknesses at major financial institutions with regard to capital adequacy, liquidity management, and risk management. Firms whose failure would pose a systemic risk must receive especially close supervisory oversight and be held to the highest prudential standards. Aside from its direct benefits for the safety and soundness of these large institutions, such an approach also would help offset financial firms' incentive to grow until they are perceived to be too big to fail.  Second, supervisors must pay close attention to compensation practices that can create mismatches between the rewards and risks borne by institutions or their managers. As the Federal Reserve and other banking agencies have noted, poorly designed compensation policies can create perverse incentives that can ultimately jeopardize the health of the banking organization. Management compensation policies should be aligned with the long-term prudential interests of the institution, be tied to the risks being borne by the organization, provide appropriate incentives for safe and sound behavior, and avoid short-term payments for transactions with long-term horizons.3  Third, as the recent financial crisis has highlighted, risks to the financial system may arise not only in the banking sector, but also from financial firms that traditionally have been outside the regulatory and supervisory framework applied to banking organizations. Under federal law, all banking organizations – regardless of size – are subject to consolidated supervision for safety and soundness purposes. At a minimum, policymakers must ensure that a similar statutory framework is put in place for all systemically important financial firms organized as holding companies. The agencies responsible for implementing this framework also must vigorously exercise their authority to help ensure the safety and soundness of nonbank firms whose failure could threaten the stability of the financial system. Broad-based application of the principle of consolidated supervision would also serve to eliminate gaps in oversight that would otherwise allow risk-taking to migrate from more-regulated to less-regulated sectors. Fourth, continued strong and concerted efforts are needed to improve the financial infrastructure – or "plumbing" – that supports the trading, payments, clearing, and settlement activities that are so critical to the functioning of the financial system. I have described elsewhere the various steps that the Federal Reserve is taking in coordination with other supervisors and market participants to improve the resiliency of over-the-counter derivative markets and the market for triparty repurchase agreements.4 Improvements in these areas should reduce the likelihood that the failure of any individual institution would have substantial spillover effects on other financial institutions or the broader markets, and thereby make it less likely that the government would need to intervene.  Finally, an important element of addressing the too-big-to-fail problem is the development of an improved resolution regime in the United States that permits the orderly resolution of a systemically important nonbank financial firm. We have such a regime for insured depository institutions, but it is clear we need something similar for systemically important nonbank financial entities. Improved resolution procedures for these firms would help reduce the too-big-to-fail problem by giving the government the option of safely winding down a systemically important firm rather than keeping it operating.                                                   3  See "Interagency Statement," note 2. 4  Ben S.

Reducing procyclicality in the financial system In the current environment, financial institutions of all sizes are trying to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers while at the same time maintaining sufficient capital and other resources to weather the ongoing crisis. Capital rules, accounting policies, and other regulatory standards should not make this job even more difficult by encouraging excessively procyclical behavior by financial institutions – that is, behavior that causes financial institutions to tighten credit in downturns and ease credit in booms more than is justified by changes in the creditworthiness of borrowers. No one questions the underlying objectives of capital rules and accounting standards, which are to ensure the safety and soundness of financial institutions and to accurately and transparently disclose an institution's financial condition, respectively. However, some aspects of existing capital rules and accounting standards may unduly magnify the ups and downs in the financial system and the economy. For example, the capital rules require banks to maintain capital ratios that meet or exceed fixed minimum standards. Because banks typically find raising capital to be difficult in economic downturns or periods of financial stress, their best means of boosting regulatory capital ratios during difficult periods may be to reduce new lending, perhaps more so than is justified by the credit environment. Moreover, as many institutions and auditors will attest, determining the appropriate valuation of illiquid or idiosyncratic assets can be very challenging, especially in highly strained market conditions. The economic downturn also has renewed the debate concerning the appropriate levels of loan loss reserves over the cycle.  Institutions themselves often try to offset the potential for procyclicality in capital levels by maintaining strong capital buffers to absorb swings in regulatory capital requirements. This type of action is in line with supervisory expectations that call for banking organizations to be able to assess their overall capital needs and hold capital commensurate with their individual risk profiles – beyond complying with minimum regulatory capital requirements. Most community bankers understand this point. Your institutions generally hold capital in excess of minimum regulatory requirements – sometimes well in excess.  Nonetheless, the issues surrounding procyclicality are not easy, and their consideration will require a careful balancing of important public policy interests. Policymakers should review existing capital rules and accounting standards to determine whether these rules and standards could be modified to reduce their potential to have unduly procyclical effects without weakening their ability to achieve their fundamental objectives. I'm pleased to note that the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Forum already have work under way to address excessive procyclicality in capital regulations, and that the Financial Accounting Standards Board is issuing new guidance that relates to market-to-market accounting in inactive markets and other-than-temporary impairments. Conclusion I want to conclude by encouraging you as community bankers to operate prudently in the current environment, but not to let fear drive your decisions. You should all continue to exercise good risk management – including strong underwriting for individual exposures and proper management of credit concentrations in your portfolios. You should also be certain that any deterioration in asset quality and borrowers' conditions are accurately identified, measured, and managed. And you should take steps to maintain a strong financial condition with sufficient capital and liquidity levels as preparation for any future economic and financial uncertainty. By doing so, you can ensure that your institutions can continue to provide a steady and consistent source of credit to businesses and borrowers for years to come. If community banks are prudent but opportunistic in extending credit to strong borrowers, they will help the economy recover while benefiting from that recovery themselves. 6 BIS Review 34/2009 
Caleb M Fundanga: Access to improved financial services in Zambia Remarks by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the Standard Chartered Bank M-Banking Media Launch, Lusaka, 17 March 2009. *      *      * The Standard Chartered Bank Plc – Managing Director, Ms Mizinga Melu Management and Staff – Standard Chartered Bank Zambia Plc Members of the Press; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen I am honoured and thankful for the invitation to officiate at this important launch of the m-Banking product. Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen; allow me to begin by commending Standard Chartered Bank for the important role it continues to play in the financial sector in Zambia. Since 1906, when Standard Chartered Bank was established in Zambia, the bank has grown to be one of the biggest players in the market. As at 31 January 2009 the bank accounted for about 15% of the banking sector’s total assets, while its deposit base accounted for 18% of total sector deposits. More importantly, the bank’s loan portfolio accounted for 13% of the total loans in the sector. Madam Managing Director, I congratulate you for the Bank’s commitment to providing products and services that best suit the needs of customers. This, in my view, should be emulated by other banks to ensure that more people have access to banking and financial services that are tailor made to meet the needs of customers. Under your leadership the bank has continued to bring to the banking sector an array of products and services that provide convenient alternative channels that lead to customer satisfaction and improved service delivery. The introduction of new products and services such as mobile banking, internet banking and e-statements provide customers with greater flexibility in their banking requirements, enabling them to transact at their own convenience, knowing that their finances are completely secure. This will no doubt enhance customer confidence in the banking system in Zambia. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am reliably informed that the m-Banking product we are launching today, will allow the bank to reach out to many more customers. This will increase the number of people with access to the financial system. At Bank of Zambia, we believe strongly that wider access to financial services through positive action by the banking community is vital. We also believe that the driving force will be banks and other financial institutions searching for new, profitable market opportunities. Furthermore, a key element in the strategy of poverty alleviation is the provision of financial services to the majority of our people especially the small and micro entrepreneurs who are financially excluded. Access to improved financial services, through the provision of better ways of accumulating savings and access to credit to augment accumulated savings, avails funds for investment in income generating projects that help the public to lay foundation for better standards of living for themselves and their families. Madam Managing Director, as your bank introduces these products on the market, please ensure that the pricing aspect is also critically looked at. Many a time a good product is introduced on the market yet it is out of reach of ordinary citizens due to the costs associated with the products. Consumers of these products expect an affordable service if indeed these are new and innovative products. Banks need to show more commitment to the growth and BIS Review 34/2009 1 
development of the country by encouraging more Zambians to open bank accounts through provision of easily accessible and affordable products and services. As I end my remarks, I want to remind all players in the financial sector that some of the challenges we face in our country today can indeed be mitigated by all stakeholders playing their respective roles. In particular, we have seen food prices increasing dramatically in the past few months. This is despite Zambia possess vast arable land, relatively good weather and plenty of fresh water. Further, Zambia is predominantly an agricultural country, but lending to agriculture has been limited. The challenge therefore is to devise financial products that meet the requirements of the sector while at the same time devise means of protecting the financial institutions from the risks associated with lending to the agricultural sector. A vibrant Agriculture sector will no doubt lead to a vibrant economy less dependent on the mining sector. I hope that Standard Chartered Bank will lead the way in establishing affordable products and services for our small scale farmers throughout our country. I encourage you Madam Managing Director in your capacity as the Deputy Chairperson of the Bankers Association of Zambia to expand your horizon and collectively join hands with all stakeholders in addressing this problem. I thank you for your attention. 2 BIS Review 34/2009 
V K Sharma: Genesis, diagnosis and prognosis of the current global financial crisis Address by Shri V K Sharma, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Senior Management Conference, Mumbai, 21 November 2008.  The views expressed are those of the author and not of the Institution with which he is associated. *      *      * I heartily welcome you all to the Senior Management Conference 2008. As at the time of the last Senior Management Conference, the now 14-month old, and still ongoing, global financial market convulsion, with no hint even now of its cataclysmic denouement, and its recent direct outcome, the widespread global economic slowdown, provide, again, the perfect backdrop, and contextual topicality, to this year's conference theme "Financial Sector Development in India: Agenda for RBI in the next 5 years". While in my address last year, I had identified broad spectrum and generic failure of an inertial regulatory and supervisory system as being the genesis of the crisis, this year, I propose to briefly review its evolution since, and make a modest attempt at the prognosis of, and lessons from, the crisis. As we are aware, since the onset of the global financial crisis, the worst since the Great Depression, the typical stock policy response has been to dramatically and aggressively cut interest rates and inject ever increasing doses of liquidity, giving the impression that the crisis was diagnosed to be liquidity-genic when, in fact, it was fundamentally, asset toxicity-genic. The latest data indicate that the Fed, ECB, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank have together injected USD 2.74 trillion in outstanding amount of liquidity. It may not be entirely fortuitous/coincidental that the estimates of total potential write-downs and losses which range from USD 1.5 to 2.5 trillion also roughly match the amount of central bank liquidity outstanding ! In this context, the popular refrain that banks are continuing to “hoard” liquidity borrowed from central banks, and which is why 3 month Libor–OIS spreads continue to remain elevated, is a myth for no bank will ever countenance a negative spread which will do no more than burn a bigger hole in its capital/balance sheet. Perhaps, the logical reason for this is that even after having written down a whopping USD 965 bn. of assets, and having raised USD 825 bn. in new capital, banks are still having to continue to finance huge amount of illiquid/toxic assets on their balance sheets. In other words, through their ever aggressive long-term rollover liquidity injection what central banks have done is enable banks to substitute ABCPs worth USD 1.6 trillion to USD 2 trillion and other more expensive liabilities and are thus effectively substituting what should be funded by shareholders! Thus, it is only after full recapitalization of capital-haemorrhaged banks is behind us, will credit and money markets normalize and transmit monetary policy to the broader real economy by way of resumption of lending to businesses and households. There is significant risk that the current monetary policy environment of very low interest rates and unprecedented deluge of liquidity may yet again engender another bubble in the not too distant future! Indeed, we almost had a commodity bubble which, to all intents and purposes, was caused by this very huge deluge of liquidity but burst due to the enveloping global economic downturn. Perhaps, if this swamp of liquidity and monetary easing are not unwound appropriately, and in an orderly and timely manner, the next crisis might well be a veritable "financial and economic nuclear winter"! The foregoing inevitably leads us to seek answers to questions such as what then are the lessons going forward on how to pre-empt such an apocalyptic event. In this context, it must be emphasized that even if global imbalances and accommodative monetary policy provided an enabling environment for excessive leverage and risk taking, it was still the responsibility of regulators and supervisors to have taken appropriate macro-prudential measures, pre-emptively and proactively, rather than reactively. Significantly, Greenspan, in a congressional BIS Review 34/2009 1 
hearing in October, admitted that he had found a flaw in his free market philosophy that shunned financial regulation and expressed “shocked disbelief” that financial firms failed at all to self regulate and exercise sufficient surveillance over their trading counterparties to prevent losses. In contrast, as I had observed in my address last year, the Reserve Bank pre-emptively and proactively delivered counter-cyclical prudential measures like increasing risk weights for exposure to commercial real estate, capital market and systemically important non-deposit accepting NBFCs as also higher provisions on certain riskier categories of standard assets which were only recently rolled back again counter-cyclically to cushion the impact of tighter liquidity and slowing economic growth. This counter-cyclicality aspect of prudential regulation and supervision, which requires a systemic capital charge based on overall asset growth in good times, and which can be rundown in bad times, has gained international acceptance and recognition and represents a significant improvement over Basel II. The Spanish model in this regard is noteworthy and worth emulating. Besides, another Basel II – incongruent prudential capital measure that has compelled attention of international regulators and supervisors is the so called “leverage ratio” so much so that Swiss regulators have required their biggest banks to introduce this measure of capital that does not allow for any risk-weighting of assets. Indeed, American lobbyists failed in their campaign for an absolute leverage ratio before the crisis. In particular, the case for a maximum leverage ratio has become incontrovertibly compelling after fatal consequences suffered by three of the biggest 5 broker dealers in the USA. It is significant that their combined gross leverage ratio exceeded 30 times (incidentally those of Fannie and Freddie exceeded 60 times) although they were very well capitalized on a risk-weighted basis as per the Basel II inspired rule change by SEC in 2004 permitting them to compute capital on a risk-weighted basis. Indeed, because of this high leverage, risk perception of these prime brokerages deteriorated to a point that their hedge fund clients came to eclectically decide which investment banks they will deal with rather than the other way round! This was because hedge funds leverage was much lower at about 10 to 15 times in comparison. Equally, according to a latest report in The Economist, the risk-weighted assets of two big European banks viz., Barclays and Deutsche Bank are about 25% of their total assets underscoring a very high level of absolute leverage. The same report cites this high absolute leverage of Deutsche Bank to explain why it has the highest net amount of outstanding credit default swaps written on its debt of any corporate borrower. That suggests plenty of people think that in spite of being very well-capitalized on a risk-weighted basis, the bank is at risk of getting into trouble. Therefore, in India we might contemplate stipulating a maximum leverage ratio in addition to the current CRAR prescription. Besides, the recent changes to international accounting rules mean that many more banks can reclassify assets so that they are not subject to mark-to-market accounting. Supporters of new rules argue that mark-to-market accounting forces banks into a vicious spiral of forced sales and more losses. But, avoiding write-downs will do little to restore trust to a financial system that is sorely lacking it. But in spite of this, some banks like France's Société Générale refused to use the new rule. The trouble with the new rules is that they pretend that the problem is not there because you cannot see it anymore but given today's sophisticated and efficient financial markets, investors will take their own call and incorporate their risk perception in the prices of equity and credit default swaps anyway.  The credit crisis has also thrown into sharp relief a “strong connect” between “liquidity risk” and “opaque off-balance sheet exposures” of whatever description. The appropriate supervisory and regulatory response to these risks would, therefore, be to insist on full disclosure and transparency of off-balance sheet commitments/ exposures and supervisory insistence on an appropriate mix of “stored” and “purchased” liquidity and appropriate capital charge for liquidity risk; the higher the “purchased liquidity” component, the higher the capital charge and the higher the “stored liquidity” component, the lower the capital charge. Thus, banking supervisors and regulators need to be more hands-on and pro-active in focusing supervisory attention on this critical risk category than has been the case so far. (In fact, in India the Committee on Financial Sector Assessment almost presciently focused on this 2 BIS Review 34/2009 
critical risk in the month of May itself, much before the liquidity and credit crunch of August 2007). Given the serious question mark over the credibility of rating agencies, the Basel Committee need to revisit the primacy of role assigned to ratings of such agencies. In fact, credit appraisal and measurement is the most basic function of intermediation performed by banks traditionally. In the light of this, ratings, if at all, may be meant for, and be relied upon, by unsophisticated and uninitiated retail and small investors, but not banks. Besides, given the fact that rating agencies generated almost 40% of their revenues from assigning the so-called inflated ratings to CDOs tranches, backed by sub-prime mortgages and the obvious inherent conflict of interest involved, US Congress and regulators are investigating into the role and function of rating agencies. In view of this, Basel II needs to de-emphasise rating for assigning capital charge for credit risk by banks. Indeed, if anything, given the tremendous volumes and liquidity of credit derivatives in general and of CDSs (both single-names and indices-based), it would be more market-price discovery-driven for banks and supervisors to rely on prices backed out from these. Indeed, CDSs price credit risks almost on real-time basis as much as US Treasury, foreign exchange, stock and commodities, markets do. Credit Rating agencies, in comparison, are much more lagged. Significantly, as if to redeem their lost credibility and reputation, all the three Rating Agencies viz., Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's, have now started a new service which provide implied credit ratings backed out/derived from CDSs spreads! In view of the foregoing, there is a very strong case for kick starting a full fledged CDSs market in India. The popular refrain that the recent global financial crisis was caused or exacerbated by CDSs is again a myth in that CDSs which are simple plain-vanilla off-balance-sheet/non-fund based derivatives, were confused with the CDOs (collateralized debt obligations) which are on-balance-sheet and funded securitized structured credit products. It was securitization/re-securitisation, involving CDOs, that played a seminal role in the crisis and no way the CDSs. In fact, it is also a myth that securitization through CDOs was an originate-to-distribute model; rather, really speaking, it was an originate-to-distribute-back-to-originators model! This is because almost all CDOs originated came back to sit on the SIVs/conduits sponsored by originating banks themselves ! Besides, for all the overdone fears about systemic risks from the so called unregulated OTC CDSs markets, remarkably orderly and non-disruptive auction-based settlement of CDSs claims in respect of CDSs written on Lehman Bros., Icelandic banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac incontrovertibly attested to the resilience of CDSs markets! Indeed, if anything, CDSs can be an effective and neat answer, and substitute, for CDOs/securitization as it is less messy, more transparent and easily monitorable. Interestingly, the New York Fed led initiative to improve the OTC CDSs markets seeks to replicate our CCIL-model, where although OTC foreign exchange transactions are bilaterally negotiated, they are cleared and settled through CCIL. Today CDSs prices/spreads are by far the most closely monitored early warning signals for real time changes in credit risk of an entity whether private or sovereign. This is because CDSs make it possible to back out an implied credit price even when one is not discovered in the underlying cash market instruments like bonds or loans. Thus, CDS market has tremendous practical application as a reliable diagnostic tool in stress-testing for supervisors and regulators. Besides, a CDS market will also enable efficient hedging and trading of credit risk and synergise development of active and liquid corporate bond and Repo markets. Like equity, credit risk subsumes all other risks as it is a function of forex risk, interest rate risk, leverage risk, liquidity risk, governance risk and that is why CDSs and equity prices are, in equilibrium, almost perfectly negatively correlated.  As is invariably the case with any major crisis, the ongoing global financial crisis has unleashed a passionate debate over the design of a new global financial architecture. The opinion on overarching role in global financial surveillance is sharply divided between assigning it to Financial Stability Forum, on the one hand, and to IMF, on the other. However, the trouble has been not so much with the existing, inter-temporally evolved, global financial architecture as really with how it was actually worked in practice. Recent huge losses at global banks running to about USD 1 trillion are not because existing best practices failed but BIS Review 34/2009 3 
because those responsible for implementing and enforcing them failed them! After all, of all risks to regulators and regulatees alike, human resources risk is by far the most serious as it is the source of all risks as confirmed by the ongoing financial cataclysm. The crux of the matter is what we need is not more or less regulation and governance but good regulation and governance. This has been the undoing of both regulators/supervisors and financial firms/banks alike. In the way of example, in the USA, the traditionally very healthy AAA rated mono-line bond insurers MBIA and Ambac changed their business model from insuring only their staple municipal bonds to insuring CDOs and ABS. While this went unnoticed by insurance regulators, Pershing Square, a hedge fund, spotted trouble and started shorting both equity and credit risk of these two companies. But even after this, regulators failed to take notice and corrective action with the two companies being eventually downgraded several notches. The same is true of financial firms and banks where independent directors on the boards, much less ask right questions, apparently didn't even understand the arcane world of modern finance and banking and according to a column in the Financial Times, after the crisis, one leading global bank ran an advertisement inviting applications for board positions from experienced professional bankers ! Besides, rather than take timely notice of, and act on, early warning signals coming from financial markets, like stock and CDSs markets, regulators chose instead to shut themselves to these early warning signals themselves by banning short selling which act effectively amounted to shooting the messenger for the unpalatable message it had to convey!  Against a global financial backdrop as sombre, traumatic portentous and sobering as the present one, it was only very sagacious on the part of the Hon'ble Finance Minister and the Governor of the Reserve Bank to have set up the Committee on Financial Sector Assessment under the very able stewardship of Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor, almost a year ahead of the outbreak of the crisis. This prescient action remarkably captured the spirit of the following adage from the Armed Forces : the more you sweat during peace, the less you bleed during war! As we will see in the course of the Conference, the Committee has done an excellent and superb job of its mandate, going into many new areas, much beyond the scope of the standard FSAP framework. With these words, I close my address and request the Governor to make it convenient to inaugurate and declare open the Conference. Thank you so very much. 4 BIS Review 34/2009 
Tarisa Watanagase: Rethinking monetary policy in a globalized world – coping with current challenges and beyond Remarks by Dr Tarisa Watanagase, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the Central Bank of Malaysia High Level Conference 2009, Kuala Lumpur, 10 February 2009. *      *      * 1. Introduction I would like to congratulate Bank Negara Malaysia on its 50th anniversary, and the magnificent job the Bank has done both in the domestic and international arenas. I wish the Bank continued success in the next 50 years and beyond. Thank you for the opportunity to address this distinguished audience on a topic that is a current concern for all central bankers during these turbulent times. I would like to raise a number of issues which have challenged the traditional thinking behind monetary policy as a consequence of globalization and the current turmoil. In some others I hope to propose solutions – some new, and some old. In many cases I will address the challenges and the blind spots which we face as monetary policy makers, and raise questions to which I myself do not yet know the answer. The developments that globalization has brought about has tested the limits of conventional monetary policy, both in terms of the current thinking about how monetary policy is conducted, as well as the effectiveness of the current approach to monetary policy. I will discuss these points in detail in a moment. But first of all, let me briefly outline what exactly have been the challenges in recent decades that have required us to rethink the way we conduct policy. Globalization has been a long and drawn out process. Countries have jumped at the opportunity to reap the benefits of globalization, with advanced countries leading the pack. Jumps in technology in recent decades, particularly in information and communications, have ensured that services – particularly financial services – have become truly borderless for advanced and developing countries alike, in a much shorter period of time. 2.  Challenges to traditional monetary policy under globalization We are all familiar with the benefits of globalization, with the past few decades seeing cheap exports from emerging markets fueling global trade and growth, albeit with some hiccups along the way. China’s accession to the WTO and the subsequent flux of Chinese exports to the rest of the world, as well as oil exports from the Middle-East, helped to create an environment of prolonged low global prices and low global inflation. We are all familiar with this episode and have given it a few names: the great moderation, the Goldilocks’ economy – not too warm and not too cold, and stable disequilibrium. This is an episode in our history where variability of growth in real output has declined along with the variability in inflation. Along the way, imbalances in the global economy began to build up. The imbalances manifested themselves in huge trade surpluses and an accumulation of foreign exchange reserves in the countries which relied on export-oriented growth – including those in the Asian region. They were reflected in the dollar revenue which was subsequently reinvested in US financial markets – which in turn helped to finance the US saving deficit, permitting these imbalances to remain uncorrected for a prolonged period of time. And as a result, asset price bubbles were also allowed to persist for a prolonged period as well. BIS Review 33/2009 1 
All was well as long as everyone continued to grow. However, as emerging markets opened up, global demand, and particularly demand from growing economies like China and India, drove up the prices of oil and other global commodities. Many economists began to predict a structural shift in global demand and changing dynamics of global inflation which would effect domestic prices and make inflation higher and more persistent. 3.  Coping with the global financial crisis At the same time, problems were brewing on the financial side in the advanced economies. I will not lay out the causes of the financial crisis here, as that has been discussed widely elsewhere. In a nutshell, the slowdown in the US housing market, coupled with a mix of troubled banking practices, regulatory blind spots, and absolute faith in the market mechanism, among other things, led to a financial crisis in advanced economies. But the important point here is that financial innovations, coupled with technological advances in communications, helped to link financial markets across the globe. This globalization of financial services allowed the collapse of major financial centers to spread to the rest of the globe so efficiently. In fact, these very financial instruments which had been earlier used to diversify risks turned out to be the very means for spreading contagion. The spread of the impact of the financial crisis onto the global real economy through the trade channel changed the world’s economic outlook rapidly and dramatically. This had a drastic impact on the inflation outlook, and the threat of inflation has rapidly shifted to one of possible deflation. At the same time, central banks are running out of traditional monetary policy ammunition to fight the slowdown in growth and potential deflation – namely cutting interest rates. Given the increasing influence of external factors on global inflation dynamics, traditional monetary policy which focuses on domestic dynamics of inflation needs to be reconsidered. As a result of globalization, the prices of important commodities and goods tend to move together, making external price shocks a more and more important determinant of domestic inflation. Fluctuations in oil prices and other commodity prices, or even a sustained period of cheaper or dearer exports, can change global inflation dynamics. The spike in oil and commodity prices last year, which initially appeared as a supply shock at the individual country level, in fact represented economic overheating at the global scale, and domestic monetary policy tightening may not have been the most effective way to deal with this situation in the global context. In addition, at the present juncture, the unprecedented and contagious slowdown in each country’s economies as a result of global linkages means that monetary policy now needs to respond to the monetary policy stance in other countries. This has added an extra international dimension to policy making, in addition to previous considerations such as the impact via capital flows and trading partners’ economies. 4.  Testing the limits of monetary policy under globalization But what exactly are these changes that globalization has brought about to traditional monetary policy? And in particular, how have these changes affected central banks? The first aspect has been the challenge to the basis of our traditional monetary policy decision-making process. Traditional conduct of monetary policy would rely on the accuracy of our forecasts of the economy, of inflation dynamics, and of our understanding of how the economy works. With globalization, making accurate economic forecasts become more difficult. The recent economic cycle has demonstrated that shocks to the economy and the price level have been both rapid and frequent. This is most clearly demonstrated by the volatility in 2 BIS Review 33/2009 
inflation in the past year. In the case of Thailand, headline inflation peaked at 9.2% in July last year, but has fallen dramatically to -0.4% in January. While it is natural for forecasts to be revised in light of new developments and information, a concern arises that globalization is likely to have changed the various relationships in the economy. This is particularly timely now, when fear and uncertainty takes over rational behaviour. And if our models are still based on assumptions which have not incorporated these changing relationships, then we are likely to make systematic errors in our forecasts. As a result of this volatility in inflation and the marked slowdown in global output, many central banks have had to reverse their tightening cycles – originally conducted to tackle inflationary pressures, while others have pursued an aggressive easing of monetary policy to shore up growth and fight off prospects of deflation. Many countries, including Thailand, had to do both. This in turn, also becomes a concern for the central bank if frequent revisions or the abrupt reversal of the central bank’s monetary policy stance affects the public’s perception of the central bank’s credibility. As a result of the speed and magnitude of deterioration in economic conditions, central banks across the globe have pursued extremely aggressive monetary policy easing, with the intent of actively supporting their domestic economies against the global slowdown. This situation has led us to the second challenge to monetary policy – namely the challenge to its effectiveness. Given current economic conditions, all the usual transmission channels have been clogged up. What happens when interest rates cannot be lowered any further? This is the challenge already faced in the US and the UK, and this challenge may need to be addressed by other countries in the near future. The US and the UK have begun to explore “unconventional measures” now that the traditional ammunition of lowering interest rates has been exhausted. This has included tackling the spread between commercial and government rates directly. The “unconventional” approach taken by Japan in earlier decades – namely purchasing of medium- and longer-term government bonds, is also an option, although the Japanese experience has shown that this has led to an increase in base money but did little to stimulate lending, as commercial banks have increased short-term liabilities and too many illiquid and undervalued long-term assets on their balance sheets. On the other hand, recent easing, as in the case of the US, has resulted in a more targeted, direct lending to businesses through purchases of commercial paper, and indirectly to households through purchases of mortgage-backed securities. 5.  Lessons from the current crisis: where do we go from here? So what are we to do going forward on this issue of monetary policy in a globalized world? I believe that there are a few issues that need our immediate attention amid the unprecedented crisis that we are in. First, recent monetary policy actions around the globe have included the aggressive, and in many cases unprecedented easing of policy interest rates, as well as measures to extend and improve banks’ access to long-term liquidity, limit systemic risk, and increase banks’ willingness to lend. But the use of these unconventional measures remains in unchartered territory, and few countries have had actual experience with their use, or to identify which ones are the most effective. Therefore, we need to significantly improve our understanding about how these measures might or might not work, what the conditions or indicators are that they aim to achieve, such as a pickup in growth or inflation, or a narrowing of short- and long-term bond spreads, for instance. BIS Review 33/2009 3 
Second, given that such measures are relatively new and unconventional, communications with the public and investors are important so that they understand what these unconventional measures mean in terms of monetary policy stance and when to expect an exit once these conditions or indicators are met. Clear understanding will improve confidence, which we need to restore as soon as possible. Third, the feasibility of unconventional measures such as credit easing may be limited in emerging markets, where the stock of such assets for purchase is limited. What then, are the alternatives should emerging economies run out of interest rate ammunition, and are there other options before the traditional ammunition runs out? Fourth, taking a longer term perspective, beyond the current crisis, we need to continue to improve our understanding of monetary policy in a globalized world. What other important ingredients need to be considered when implementing monetary policy or when forecasting growth and inflation ahead? The role of external shocks is likely to become more important and needs to be considered more carefully. We need to find ways to anticipate these shocks including the future financial architecture and improve upon limitations in our foresight and in the forecasting ability of our models. Fifth, the role of policy makers in other countries which will add to these external shocks opens up room for greater policy coordination and cooperation at the international level. Like other previous crises, the current crisis is likely to be followed by discussion about intensive reforms at the international level. We should grab this opportunity to highlight the need for international cooperation in monetary policy in maintaining global financial stability. I don’t need to point out that international cooperation in the area of supervision is far ahead, both in normal times and in time of crisis. In order to secure international cooperation in monetary policy, we need more research and dialogues on how to make early warning and surveillance really work at a global level. In addition, coordination may not be enough; a redesign of global financial architecture may be necessary, and we need to work on this area as well. One last point before I end, I believe that most of us now agree that central banks need to maintain financial stability in addition to price stability. Therefore, we also need to improve our understanding of the implications of globalization on financial stability, as well as the tools to conduct monetary policy in addition to the interest rate tool for stability purposes. 4 BIS Review 33/2009 
Thomas Jordan: The Swiss National Bank’s monetary policy in turbulent times  Summary of a speech by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Geldmarkt-Apéro of the Swiss National Bank, Zurich, 19 March 2009. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * The financial market crisis has now widened into a global economic recession, and the Swiss economy is feeling the full impact. The SNB has taken prompt and decisive action in response, and substantially relaxed its monetary policy.  In mid-March, as a result of the sharp economic downturn since December 2008, a further major expansion of monetary policy became necessary. However, the SNB was already operating a de facto zero interest rate policy (ZIRP), and the natural limits of conventional monetary policy had been reached. The SNB therefore took three unconventional measures: increasing the number of transactions in repos with longer terms, purchasing Swiss franc bonds issued by private sector borrowers, and buying foreign currency on the open market.  In implementing these unconventional steps, the SNB has demonstrated that, even in an environment of zero interest rates, it still has a number of tools at its disposal which allow it to react flexibly to any undesired tightening of monetary conditions. In this context, it is important not to misinterpret the foreign currency measures as the start of a “beggar thy neighbour” policy. In periods of zero interest rates, such purchases help to counter the risk of deflation.  The Swiss economy faces an exceptionally difficult year in 2009. Economic activity is set to pick up again gradually over the course of 2010, thanks to the extremely expansive monetary policy. This is, however, conditional upon an economic recovery by our main trading partners, as well as a return to stability on financial markets. The SNB measures are also aimed at reducing the risk of deflation in Switzerland.  Despite the creation of massive amounts of liquidity, the SNB remains committed to ensuring price stability in the future. We will use all means at our disposal to reduce liquidity again in good time, so as to prevent any upsurge of inflation in Switzerland once the crisis has ended. BIS Review 33/2009 1 
Mervyn King: Finance – a return from risk Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, to the Worshipful Company of International Bankers, London, 17 March 2009. *      *      * Master, Sheriff, My Lords, Alderman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Introduction The financial turmoil that began in August 2007 led to a financial panic in September 2008 and now to a severe worldwide economic downturn. It is fair to describe the events that followed the failure of Lehman Brothers as the Panic of 2008 because of the almost complete collapse of confidence in financial institutions and the flight of funding that ensued. Perhaps we had forgotten that such panics and banking crises have occurred with depressing regularity in the financial systems of market economies. But the history of the City is in large part the history of banking crises. The measures that central banks took, and continue to take, to restore confidence in the banking system were extreme and on an extraordinary scale – the Bank of England has lent hundreds of billions of pounds to the banking system. But they were not unprecedented – it has happened many times before in crises over the years. So I want tonight to reflect on why we seem to find it so difficult to learn from experience. But even when set against that historical background, the extraordinarily sudden, severe and simultaneous downturn of activity and trade in every corner of the world economy last autumn is remarkable. A collapse of confidence in the coffee houses of Lombard Street was one thing; a collapse of confidence in the world economy is quite another. An examination of these parallels will, I hope, help to throw light on three questions. First, does the nature of financial risk explain the frequency of crises and what does it imply for the design of banking regulation? Second, what are the lessons from the crisis for central banks in their pursuit of both monetary and financial stability? And, third and most urgently, how do we find our way out of the present crisis? The nature of financial risk and its implications for the regulation of banks There is no shortage of proposals for reform of bank regulation from official groups, such as the Financial Stability Forum, and unofficial groups, such as the G 30, chaired by Paul Volcker and the Geneva Forum. Since the excessive risk-taking of recent years has now given way to an extraordinary degree of risk aversion, there is no hurry to choose among them. Whatever exuberance – rational or irrational – existed has been destroyed by the crisis. So we have time to reflect before we decide on the shape of a new regulatory system. Another reason for reflection is that recent years have seen a natural experiment. Some regulatory systems were light touch, others heavy touch, and yet others placed both ownership and regulation of banks in the public sector. Yet they all failed to some degree to prevent the accumulation of risks that finally produced the crisis. So it is unlikely that there is a simple answer. Any plan for reform should take into account the nature of financial risk. Why were so many people misled for so long? And was there an inherent weakness in the structure of modern banking? Banks are dangerous institutions. They borrow short and lend long. They create liabilities which promise to be liquid and hold few liquid assets themselves. That though is hugely BIS Review 32/2009 1 
valuable for the rest of the economy. Household savings can be channelled to finance illiquid investment projects while providing access to liquidity for those savers who may need it. But given how risky banks are, it should not be surprising that from time to time they get into trouble. And they have done so regularly since banking began. Confidence in a bank can disappear quickly making it vulnerable to a destructive bank run. If a large number of depositors want liquidity at the same time, banks are forced into early liquidation of assets – lowering their value. And, of course, if banks make sufficient unwise loans to borrowers who do not repay, then that can threaten solvency as well. Banks can of course take their own actions to ensure that investor confidence is maintained. For example, a visible source of liquidity helps. In the panic of 1906, the founder of what is now the Bank of America displayed his gold reserves on the street and offered to convert deposits into gold, creating confidence in his bank at a time when many others failed. Forty years ago, the clearing banks in London held around 30% of their assets in short-term liquid instruments. Today that liquid assets ratio is about 1%. For the major UK banks, almost 25% of customer loans are now funded by short-term borrowing in wholesale markets. At the turn of the new century it was close to zero. This was the distinctive feature of the contemporary British model of banking. Distinctive it may have been; sensible it was not. HBoS and RBS paid the price as the availability of this funding dried up, and not one of the building societies that de-mutualised in the 1980s and 1990s in order to expand beyond the constraints of their deposit base has survived as an independent entity. Banks have changed. They have encouraged the expansion of proprietary trading, the funding of long-term assets in short-term wholesale markets, a rapid expansion of balance sheets and a marked rise in leverage. Commercial banks followed the path of investment banks. Balance sheet size and high leverage were seen as the key to obtaining funds at lowest cost. The total assets held by the world’s largest banks roughly doubled in the five years to the end of 2008, and leverage in UK banks rose on average by two-thirds. The bulk of credit growth in the economy as a whole was taking place within the financial sector. And the complexity of the products being created made it hard to evaluate the underlying risks. Why did banks change so much and take risks which eventually led to some spectacular downfalls? Ultimately, the main factor was an inability to perceive the true nature of the risks involved. In this they were not alone. John Maynard Keynes took pains to distinguish between risk, where probabilities or frequencies could be calculated, and uncertainty, where there is no scientific basis on which to form any probability estimates. Keynes went on, in an article published in 1937, to spell out exactly how we tend to behave in the face of such ignorance. It explains a great deal of recent behaviour in financial markets. Keynes argued that uncertainty affects our behaviour in three ways: “(1) We assume that the present is a much more serviceable guide to the future than a candid examination of past experience would show it to have been hitherto. In other words we largely ignore the prospect of future changes about the actual character of which we know nothing. (2) We assume that the existing state of opinion as expressed in prices and the character of existing output is based on a correct summing up of future prospects, so that we can accept it as such unless and until something new and relevant comes into the picture. (3) Knowing that our own individual judgement is worthless, we endeavour to fall back on the judgement of the rest of the world which is perhaps better informed. That is, we endeavour to conform to the behaviour of the majority or the average. The psychology of a society of individuals each of whom is endeavouring to copy the others leads to what we may strictly term a conventional judgement”. This suggests that it is very hard to take a truly independent view – especially a contrarian one that recognises the possibility that improbable but conceivable events could result in 2 BIS Review 32/2009 
large losses. In other words, the sheer difficulty of forecasting the future makes it hard for contrarian investors without substantial net worth to survive in the market. As a result the market is vulnerable to “sudden and violent changes”. As Keynes put it, “the forces of disillusion may suddenly impose a new conventional basis of valuation. … At all times the vague panic fears and equally vague and unreasoned hopes are not really lulled, and lie but a little way below the surface”. So a conventional wisdom that leads to a speculative mania, can quickly collapse as sentiment turns on its head. But a speculative mania is not the product solely of the creative imagination of financial engineers. It requires the willing collaboration of gullible investors, who may not fully appreciate the risks that they are taking. Take a simple example of an investment that provides a long, regular stream of profits interspersed with occasional large losses, such that on average you would expect it to have the same return as a safe investment – not an unreasonable characterisation it would now appear of many of the investment strategies of recent years. Over short time periods, where it is unlikely that disaster will strike, it is more likely than not that investors will come out ahead, with a high return. But over long periods, where the risk that disaster will strike at some point is higher, it is likely that the overall return will be worse than the safe investment. And, because charges are often structured so that investment managers receive more of the upside from risky behaviour than they share in the downside, they have an incentive to promote the risky investment strategy. That, allied to a massive increase in the complexity of financial products and instruments in recent years, has meant that investors have, perhaps unwittingly, aided an enormous increase in the risks being run in the financial system. Given these problems, it seems to me that regulation should aim to be simple and robust. Overly complex measures of risk and capital adequacy are rarely robust to developments that are easy neither to anticipate nor calibrate. And robust rules for regulation will of necessity need to be simple or supervisors will be lost in a morass of unnecessary detail. For the same reasons we should not expect too much of regulation. Conventional judgment is a safe haven for bankers and regulators alike. It is not easy to persuade people, especially those who are earning vast sums as a result, that what looks successful in the short run is actually highly risky in the long run. As in monetary policy, it is unlikely that prudential supervision can be implemented as a set of rules to be applied mechanically. Nevertheless, to rely solely on the discretionary judgment of individual bankers and regulators is asking too much of human capabilities. This suggests that the principle of constrained discretion, applied so successfully in monetary policy, needs to be applied to banking regulation. That is not to say that a similar institutional apparatus would be appropriate, but we need to build into the system some simple and robust impediments to excessive risk-taking that can be monitored. And we must ensure that an institutional memory is maintained so that the lessons from the crisis are not forgotten and those impediments to excessive risk-taking are not swept away once memories of the crisis recede. The design of those impediments should be based on an explicit identification of the market failures that regulation can hope to correct. Such market failures seem to relate to two dimensions of banking – the “cross-section” and the “time-series” aspects of behaviour. The former reflects the extreme interconnectedness of banks. Each individual institution can appear relatively safe while the links between them mean that the system as a whole is vulnerable. Any shock could lead banks to fail through a domino effect. The superstructure of complex transactions within the financial sector (in derivatives for example) greatly increased this interconnectedness. The time-series aspect is the pro-cyclical behaviour of risk-taking in the financial system that I described earlier. Optimism feeds on itself until the occasional setback changes the mood to one of pessimism. And individuals are reluctant to accept that success may not be the BIS Review 32/2009 3 
result of superior wisdom, which should naturally be reflected in compensation, but the short-run outcome of a risky strategy. To deal with the “cross-section” problems we need to reduce the exposure of the system to domino effects. For some, especially over-the-counter, markets this could be achieved by increasing the role of central counterparty clearing houses. Much good work on this is going on, led by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But a clearing house should not be an excuse for allowing flawed financial instruments, such as many of the mortgage-backed securities, to be treated as high quality assets. We also need to improve the regulation of the liquidity of banks. After the crisis began, the most striking feature of the regulatory system, as embodied in the Basel arrangements and implemented in the UK, was the absence of any effective regulation of liquidity. The FSA is acting to remedy the situation, and the Bank is in active discussion with FSA about how such regulation should best be implemented. More attention has been paid to the “time-series” dimension where there is now a clear international consensus among the members of the Financial Stability Forum and the Basel Committee that some form of counter-cyclical prudential supervision is required. The principle has been established. To correct these types of market failure will require a system of regulation that effectively marries the “top down” assessment of the risks to the system as a whole to the “bottom up” supervision of individual institutions. The present system has not delivered that. A lot of detailed work needs to be done to convert these general principles into concrete implementation. How would the interaction between the “cross-section” and “time-series” risks be taken into account? Would the framework take the form of an addition to capital requirements as a function of the degree of maturity mismatch, leverage or the rate at which the balance sheet was expanding? Or would there be a limit on leverage ratios? How would leverage and maturity mismatch embedded in the assets side of the balance sheet be taken into account? And how would the framework be implemented for banks whose assets and liabilities span jurisdictions? Can we define a group of institutions that are systemically significant? In the present crisis most institutions are deemed to be potentially systemic because of the impact of the failure of any of them on creditor confidence. If most banks appear systemic in a crisis won’t countries want to require foreign banks to be subsidiaries not branches? And, more fundamentally, should there be a Glass-Steagall type of provision to prevent retail deposits from being used to fund investment banking activities? There are good arguments in favour – to separate the utility functions of a retail bank taking household deposits and running the payments system from the casino trading of an investment bank, and good arguments against – the difficulty of maintaining a credible boundary between those institutions that are eligible to receive government support and those that are not. We need a public and informed debate on the merits of the arguments. We also should reflect on the fact that the belief that the authorities will step in when risks materialise encourages risk taking and means that risk-adjusted returns to financial activity are too high. The experience of unsustainably high returns in normal times interspersed by regular crises has been repeated across countries and over time. So if banks are to bear the true cost of the risks they take, changes need to be made to the environment in which banks operate. All these are important issues. While committing at international level to broad principles on regulatory reform, such as extending the net to all highly leveraged institutions and making capital requirements counter-cyclical, there is time to think through carefully the best way to implement them, and it is important that we take it. Many of these questions about the future of the regulatory structure will be discussed in the Turner review to be launched tomorrow. The Bank awaits the Review with interest. It will wish to take time to reflect carefully on the Report before expressing a view. 4 BIS Review 32/2009 
Given what has happened there is now international support for developing a counter-cyclical toolkit for the prudential supervision of banks. But let us be clear what such tools would have entailed had they operated in the past. They would have imposed constraints on the growth and profitability of bank balance sheets. They would have been seen as a tax on the success of the investment banking community and the City of London more generally. And that would have taken place at a time when virtually the entire weight of opinion, not only in this country but also abroad, was in favour of the expansion of financial services. Indeed, just before the financial turmoil broke out in the summer of 2007, there was a debate in New York about the need to follow London’s example of unfettered markets if they were not to lose ground. What are the lessons for central banks? With the passage of the new Banking Act last month, the Bank of England now has two objectives enshrined in statute: monetary stability and financial stability. Events of the past six months show that there are limits to what can be achieved in respect of either objective. No policy framework can, or should be expected to, stabilise output when demand in the rest of the world suddenly and simultaneously “falls off a cliff”, to use the expression heard so often in recent months. Even the safety valve of a floating exchange rate cannot insulate an economy from its trading partners. World trade fell by around 5% in the final quarter of 2008. 54 of the 56 nations for which data are available for the fourth quarter registered falls in industrial output. 7 of those suffered double digit declines. For many years trade has been the route to faster growth. Now trade is leading the world down as the economies most adversely affected by the current downturn are those most dependent on exports, such as Japan and some of the other Asian economies, not those with the worst banking problems. Sharp changes in sentiment, confidence, animal spirits – whatever words you care to use – are capable of wreaking havoc on the world and our own economy. I shall turn later to our immediate response to the crisis. I want first, however, to ask whether central banks have the right instruments and the right policy frameworks to deal with a world in which some of the biggest risks are of the type I have discussed earlier, namely events which occur very infrequently but when they do so have large adverse effects; events such as those through which we are living. In other words, was our framework suitable for a world of stability but inadequate for preventing or responding to large adverse shocks? In particular, should central banks continue to use their single monetary policy instrument – in our case Bank Rate, supplemented when necessary by unconventional operations – to aim solely at price stability, or should they aim also at wider financial stability objectives, as some have suggested? For over fifteen years Bank Rate has been set to meet an inflation target. And it was very successful in achieving that objective until commodity prices pushed up inflation in 2007. Since the Monetary Policy Committee was established, the average inflation rate has been only 0.1 percentage points away from the target. The strategy of inflation targeting ensured that the MPC maintained a balance between overall demand and supply in the economy. We could, of course, have pursued a different policy. We could have set interest rates consistently at a higher level in order to lower the growth of domestic demand below the rate at which inflation was stable and close to the target. In the words of my predecessor, we could have rejected the approach of accepting “unbalanced growth rather than no growth”. But to argue that Bank Rate should have been set to achieve not price stability but other objectives would have meant accepting rising unemployment and falling inflation. And that would not have altered long-term interest rates in world capital markets and “irrational exuberance” in financial markets in the US and elsewhere. If we want to slow the growth of the financial sector balance sheet, and most of the expansion of credit in recent years was within the financial sector, we can surely do better than raising Bank Rate to a level that undermines the real economy and our commitment to the inflation target. BIS Review 32/2009 5 
As Chairman Bernanke rightly emphasised last week, one of the causes of the crisis was the impact of the growing current account imbalances on financial intermediation in the main deficit countries, the US and the UK. The large and persistent inflows of capital lowered market interest rates to extremely low levels and encouraged the “search for yield”. In response, the financial services industry rediscovered the time-honoured way of raising rates of return – increasing leverage and taking more risk while finding ways of making the degree of risk less transparent. The crisis resulted from the interaction between the “micro” behaviour of banks and other institutions in creating new financial assets and the “macro” economic strategies pursued by the world’s major countries. If we are to make crises less likely in future we will need to concentrate on policies covering these interactions. The size to which the current account imbalances were allowed to grow reflected the fact that the international monetary system, such as it is, placed no pressures on surplus countries and that the main debtor country issued the world’s reserve currency. Year after year international meetings expressed surprise, and indeed concern, that the imbalances continued to accumulate, but in the absence of a correction the theme became a worn groove in discussions and interest waned. The more forcefully the warnings were expressed, the more they were ignored, precisely because each country appeared able on its own to achieve price stability and steady growth despite the continued build-up of the imbalances. The consequences of this are now evident: a severe global downturn affecting virtually every country in the world. In a world of imbalances it is just as dangerous to rely too heavily on foreign demand for goods and services as it is to rely excessively on foreign borrowing. Surely now no country can be indifferent to the objective of improving the consistency of our macroeconomic strategies. So I hope that the debate about the need for symmetric obligations on surplus and debtor countries alike will move on from previous unsuccessful dialogues stretching back to the Bretton Woods conference in 1944. Turning to the “micro” cause of the crisis, a root cause was a degree of over optimism in financial markets. History, whether the run up to the 1929 stock market crash or more recently in the dotcom mania, suggests that only very substantial rises in short-term interest rates will bring to an end the excessive speculation, and that such rises bring about the very recession which the policy is designed to avert. What is needed is an additional instrument, or possibly a set of instruments, to provide the authorities with the ability to control the growth of the financial sector and its interactions with the wider economy. A set of counter-cyclical policy instruments is the right response to the dilemma of trying to use Bank Rate to control both inflation and excessive expansion of the financial sector. It provides the “top-down” judgement for prudential supervision that I described earlier, but detailed work is needed to flesh out that general principle. How should we deal with the present crisis? I have spoken so far about the long-term lessons of the crisis for the structure of banking and its regulation. But the immediate need is to deal with the extraordinarily steep and simultaneous downturn in so many economies around the world, and to stabilise the banking system in those countries where it has failed. That should be the main priority at the forthcoming G20 Summit. There are three parts to the required policy response. First, there is an urgent need for a collective commitment by all the countries in the G20 to restore confidence. Second, in those countries where the banking system has failed, there must be a credible promise that banks will be restructured and recapitalised so that they can resume their normal functions and support the flow of credit to their own and other economies. Third, we need to identify and explain a coherent exit strategy through which all of the unprecedented official policy actions can be unwound and which provides a bridge back to stability. 6 BIS Review 32/2009 
A joint commitment to a macroeconomic stimulus – the division between monetary and fiscal measures is a matter for individual countries to determine – is required to ensure a growth of nominal demand sufficient to reverse the extraordinarily steep and simultaneous downturn in output around the world. Much has already been done. But the measures need to add up to a collective determination to support an adequate level of money spending, and will need to include actions to help poorer countries borrow either from the IMF or on world capital markets. Without that collective commitment, countries may neglect the beneficial effects that their policy actions can have on other countries, resulting in an excessively cautious approach. The G20 summit in London in two weeks time offers an opportunity and a challenge. The occasions on which the words and actions of policy-makers really matter are probably fewer than many of us care to admit. But this is one of them. And I was encouraged by an unusual sense of determination at the G20 Ministerial Meeting at the weekend to show a collective commitment to deal with our problems. In the UK we are already taking unprecedented action to boost nominal spending. The Government announced a temporary fiscal stimulus in the Pre-Budget Report in November. Bank Rate has been reduced by 4½ percentage points in the past six months. And this month the Bank began a series of asset purchases aimed at boosting the supply of money in the economy directly. In due course, this will act to expand money spending. In its entire 300 year history, the Bank of England has never acted so swiftly or extensively in response to an economic downturn. The second aspect of the required policy response is effective stabilisation of the banking system. The experience of those countries that have most successfully resolved banking problems, such as Sweden in the early 1990s, suggests that that will require uncertainty about the values of some of the more opaque assets on bank balance sheets to be dispelled. It will take many months to audit forensically the true state of those balance sheets and for some of the underlying macroeconomic uncertainty to dissipate. In the meantime governments have to stabilise the banking system by reassuring creditors in order to prevent the risk of either retail or wholesale runs of the kind we saw in the Panic of 2008. They have to subscribe sufficient equity capital – plain ordinary equity – in order to underpin the capital position of banks in the event of future losses. Although there are different ways to do this (splitting banks, insuring pools of assets), they all have in common a commitment to provide contingent capital to banks so that core equity capital does not fall below some minimum ratio and so creditors are protected. It follows that governments must be prepared to hold whatever proportion of equity capital turns out to be necessary. The final part of the policy response relates to the longer term. There needs to be a clear exit route by which the extraordinary level of official financial support will be unwound as conditions return to normal. And there needs to be a credible commitment to implement the longer term reforms. For monetary policy, the inflation target provides a natural guide to when, and by how much, the extraordinary degree of policy stimulus should be withdrawn. In particular, the outlook for inflation will determine when and by how much asset purchases are in due course reversed and the timing of a return of interest rates to more normal levels. For fiscal policy, there needs to be a credible plan for consolidation of deficits and debt in the future contingent on the state of the economy. And in terms of support to the banking sector, governments should signal their commitment to return banks to the private sector once balance sheets have been restructured. In the UK that will be underpinned by UKFI formulating an explicit mechanism through which the Government’s shares can in due course be sold back to the private sector. There will also, eventually, need to be a way to scale back the extraordinary levels of liquidity support provided by central banks during the crisis. The Bank of England has lent, and continues to lend, over £300 billion pounds through our repo operations and the Special Liquidity Scheme. And a backstop of further liquidity support is still available if the system BIS Review 32/2009 7 
requires it through our discount window. The Federal Reserve has lent more than $900 billion dollars, and the ECB around €700bn. Relative to GDP, the balance sheet of the three central banks has broadly doubled during the crisis. But in providing this support, central banks cannot offer long-term funding and should not offer support against assets that are unlikely to have a viable future in the absence of official intervention. At some point central bank balance sheets will need to contract. Finally, although I have stressed the need to take time to think through carefully the long run reforms required, we need to commit now, while the political will exists, to a process for decisions on long-term reforms in key areas such as bank regulation, reform of the international monetary system and the governance of international financial institutions. Conclusions Why did no one see this crisis coming? In fact, most of the underlying causes of the crisis attracted attention from economists, central banks, international financial institutions and regulators. But the difficulty of overcoming coordination or collective action problems meant that nothing was done. Banks felt that they had to keep on dancing while the music was playing. Regulators could never prove that the risks they identified would crystallize, and the “top down” and “bottom up” dimensions of prudential supervision were not married. Central banks and the IMF discussed the imbalances for so long that some came to believe that they were crying wolf. And no one country could prevent the world wide increase in asset prices. Christopher Fildes’ law of the financial cycle says that “disasters happen when the last man who can remember what happened last time has retired”. Periods of euphoria and panics in the financial system are inherent features of a market economy. They are the cost we pay for the benefits of a market economy – long-run increases in our standard of living which other systems have failed to deliver. After another twenty years or so, memories of the Panic of 2008 will have faded, and the regulations put in place in its wake will no doubt be seen as old-fashioned, inhibiting of the potential of the City, and as ripe to be swept away as was the Glass-Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking in the United States a few years ago. A lesson of history is that few generations have been able to avoid a repetition of earlier banking crises. The essential problem is that we can no more bind our successors than our predecessors were able to bind us. Rare events, even when dramatic at the time, lose their power to shape policy as memory recedes. The role of institutions is to retain a collective memory and to resist the temptations of the present. That is one of the most important roles of a central bank. It is accepted as such in the domain of monetary policy. And there is an equivalent role in financial stability. The introduction of simple and robust policy tools into a regulatory regime based on the exercise of constrained discretion would make it easier to resist overly rapid expansion of financial institutions. In particular, the authorities should maintain a clear focus on the issues that matter when the worst occurs – liquidity and leverage. It should be intrusive, in the sense of knowing what is going on, but not bureaucratic. A system in which it is easier for a large bank to expand and then destroy its balance sheet than for an individual to open a bank account has lost focus. That is not the fault of regulators, but a reflection of the pressures and incentives they have faced – from all of us. As a Kennedy Scholar at Harvard, I have always treasured Harold Macmillan’s words in his tribute to John F Kennedy. He was, said Macmillan, a man “whose eyes were on the horizon but whose feet were on the ground". In re-designing the regulatory framework we certainly need to keep our feet on the ground, and we should also keep our eyes on the horizon, both ahead of and behind us. More urgent, however, is the immediate task of generating an economic recovery. Most of us come from the generation that grew up believing that mass unemployment and world 8 BIS Review 32/2009 
recession were things of the past, relevant to the history books but not the textbooks. That assumption is under threat. We must rise to the challenge. BIS Review 32/2009 9 
Tarisa Watanagase: Aspects of optimal supervisory arrangements Remarks by Dr Tarisa Watanagase, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the SEACEN Governors’ Conference, Kuala Lumpur, 6 February 2009. *      *      * Bank Negara Malaysia’s background paper provides a good summary of issues related to the choice of optimal supervisory arrangements. It is generally accepted that integrated model of supervision may have inherent synergies, economy of scale and scope, very little or no regulatory arbitrage and the ability to identify problems sooner. However, its possible weaknesses are the blurring of focuses and a tendency to compromise multiple objectives. On the other hand, separate supervisors have been credited with being more focused on their mandates, but of course the biggest concern is about supervisory coordination, the lack of which can lead to regulatory arbitrage, making supervision ineffective. It is also generally accepted that no one model is better or more optimal than the other. It all depends on the context of each country, including its supervisory capacity and resources, and details in operational arrangements. Thailand can certainly agree to such a conclusion. In our case, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) supervises the banking sector, which is the core of the financial sector. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supervises market conduct, the Insurance Commission supervises the insurance companies. This model has worked well so far. By law, the BOT chairs the Financial Institutions Policy Committee, whose members include the Secretary General of the SEC and the Insurance Commissioner, that meets on a monthly basis. The forum provides the opportunities for policy dialogues, exchange of views and concerns, and information updates, among other things. This is the major operational arrangement that we have put in place to make the separate authorities model work for us. No doubt other operational arrangements can be put in place to make the integrated model work as well. Having said that, let me add another dimension to the issue of supervisory arrangement – one that is related to central bank’s other key function, namely, monetary policy. I believe that supervisory policy and monetary policy can be arranged in such a way that they are complementary and supportive to each other. I also believe that the often-cited conflicts of interest between the two roles, if performed by the same institution, may have been overstated somewhat. If there are policy conflicts, these conflicts will have to be resolved regardless of who is in charge of supervision. Then, would it not be more efficient if the conflicts could be internalized and resolved within an institution? In fact, many possible mechanisms exist to help ensure full accountability for each role, thereby minimizing potential conflicts while getting synergies from having the two roles under one roof. The arrangement we use In Thailand, as I alluded to earlier, is the establishment of two separate policy boards that include outside experts. The linking pin is membership in both policy boards by central bank’s senior management, which makes it possible for information and knowledge in one area to be usefully employed in performing the other, without compromising the mandate of each policy board. For example, detailed supervisory information about banks’ changing risk appetite and exposure to different economic sectors and markets – as well as how these risks are being managed – can provide useful early warnings about the health of the economy and potential systemic problems down the road. This can be a very important input for monetary policy board. On the other hand, central bank’s oversight of monetary policy and economic stability can strengthen and provide context to its supervisory responsibilities, for example, in identifying potential macro factors that may affect the health of financial institutions. Decisions about the stance and timing of prudential and supervisory policies in general can BIS Review 32/2009 1 
also be more appropriately made with the full knowledge of macroeconomic conditions and monetary policy. As can be seen, the two policies are essential to each other and hence it is useful or even desirable, in my opinion, for central banks to supervise at least the core financial sector, whether under a separate or integrated supervision model. This is most evident in times of systemic crisis where central banks’ last-resort lending is likely to be called upon and prompt decision is vital. Central banks that also supervise core financial institutions would have the clear benefits of immediate access to vital information and expert assessment from supervisory staff about the health of individual institutions and their systemic implications. This could greatly help reduce the likelihood of any unnecessary delay or even misinformed decision that might hamper efforts to stem a financial crisis. For emerging market economies, the case for central banks to supervise the core financial institutions may be even stronger. This is because, financial markets in these countries are typically not well developed enough to serve as an efficient channel for the transmission of monetary policy. Market interest rates and even commercial banks’ prime rates react only sluggishly to changes in central bank’s policy rate, and often with a long time lag. In these circumstances, the traditional tool of monetary policy alone is unlikely to be enough to maintain economic and financial stability. Since in most emerging market economies, commercial banks are by far the most dominant players in the financial system, central banks with supervisory responsibilities could and should make use of targeted prudential policy to tackle financial imbalances and excessive asset price movements, both of which lie at the heart of all financial crises. This was what we did in 2003 to successfully contain incipient speculative bubbles in the property sector by imposing a ceiling on banks’ loan-to-value ratio of high-end housing loans. In the same vein, in order to contain household debt at prudent levels to prevent financial imbalances, a maximum credit-to-income ratio was imposed on credit card and personal loans. Let me now turn to the current financial crisis and discuss some lessons that are relevant to the issue of supervisory arrangement. If we look at the wide range of counties afflicted by the current turmoil, we immediately notice that financial sector problems happened in countries with either supervisory model. Notably, the US is well-known for its multiple agencies, whereas the UK has an integrated one. Yet both countries are currently faced with similar financial sector problems. One cannot help but think that there must be certain common supervisory weaknesses that led to the crisis, regardless of the supervisory arrangements. So perhaps the key question is not about the institutional form but rather about how to strength the regulatory framework to ensure financial stability. Of course, this is not an easy task, given the scale and the complexity of the problems that we are in right now. Several committees and working groups of various organizations, including the BIS, are working on a number of issues that have been identified as contributing to the crisis, such as the procyclical nature of supervisory and accounting rules and the inadequate focus on liquidity risk. I do not know whether there are efforts to try to identify common weaknesses of different institutional setup of supervision. But no doubt this is an area that more work will be needed. To me, both types of institutional setup may have one important common weakness, that is, there does not seem to be the notion of a lead supervisor in either model. Allow me to elaborate on this point. In the case of separate authorities, it would be normal for each authority to assume that every authority is doing its job according to its mandate. Therefore, one would tend to focus only on its own mandate. This can be a problem if some authorities fail to do a proper job, others may not be able to take note. Worse still, if there are supervisory gaps, the chance of any one authority identifying potential adverse impact from areas outside of one’s own mandate is even smaller. Take the US as an example, the authorities and investors did not 2 BIS Review 32/2009 
realize that credit rating agencies were not doing an adequate job in their rating of complex structured products. If there were a lead supervisor, would the whistle have been blown earlier? I believe that there would have been a better chance if there were a lead supervisor with a clear mandate to take the lead responsibility and who is risk focused. There would have been more dialogues through which weaknesses may have been identified and corrected. The idea of a lead supervisor has gained widespread support in the area of cross-border supervision, as it contributes to better coordination, which in turn could help to prevent or identify problems at an early stage. By the same token, such benefits could be gained in the domestic setting from having a lead supervisor under the separate authorities model. Of course, in the case of the integrated model, the notion becomes a lead department in the same agency, rather than an outside lead supervisor. The next question is: who should be the lead supervisor? The obvious answer is it should be the one that supervises the core financial institutions of the country. And following my previous argument that a central bank should supervise the core financial sector, the central bank should be the lead supervisor. The financial landscape, role, and systemic importance of financial institutions evolve overtime, so must the scope of oversight and focus of lead supervisor. The lead supervisor must closely monitor this evolution and ensure no regulatory gap emerges. It can do so by expanding its scope of supervision either directly or indirectly through the relevant agencies and build coordination to ensure it can perform its lead role properly.

Duvvuri Subbarao: India – managing the impact of the global financial crisis Speech by Dr Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Confederation of Indian Industry's National Conference and Annual Session 2009, New Delhi, 26 March 2009. *      *      * Introduction Less than a year ago, much of what has happened in the Indian economy since last October would have been hard to anticipate. I recall, around this time last year, the most frequently asked questions (FAQs) were, what are the factors that put India on a high growth trajectory and what can we do to remain there? Today, the FAQ is, when and how do we get back on to the high growth trajectory? The sharp turn around in the FAQs summarizes in a nutshell the impact of the global financial crisis on India. Global outlook The global economic outlook deteriorated sharply over the last quarter. In a sign of the ferocity of the down turn, the IMF marked down, yet again, its estimate for global growth in 2009 to a range of (-)1.0 to (-)0.5 per cent, the first global contraction in 60 years. With all the advanced economies – the United States, Europe and Japan – having firmly gone into recession, the contagion of the crisis from the financial sector to the real sector has been unforgiving and total. Recent evidence suggests that contractionary forces are strong: demand has slumped, production is plunging, job losses are rising and credit markets remain in seizure. Most worryingly, world trade – the main channel through which the downturn will get transmitted on the way forward – is projected to contract by 2.8 per cent in 2009, the fastest pace of shrinkage in the last 80 years. Policy making around the world is in clearly uncharted territory. Governments and central banks across countries have responded to the crisis through big, aggressive and unconventional measures. There is a contentious debate on whether these measures are adequate and appropriate, and when, if at all, they will start to show results. There has also been a separate debate on how abandoning the rule book, driven by the tyranny of the short-term, is compromising medium-term sustainability. What is clearly beyond debate though is that this Great Recession of 2008/09 is going to be deeper and the recovery longer than earlier thought. Decoupling hypothesis and emerging economies Contrary to the “decoupling hypothesis”, emerging economies too have been hit by the crisis. The decoupling hypothesis, which was intellectually fashionable even as late as a year ago, held that even if advanced economies went into a downturn, emerging economies will remain unscathed because of their substantial foreign exchange reserves, improved policy framework, robust corporate balance sheets and relatively healthy banking sector. In a rapidly globalizing world, the “decoupling hypothesis” was never totally persuasive. Given the evidence of the last few months – capital flow reversals, sharp widening of spreads on sovereign and corporate debt and abrupt currency depreciations – the “decoupling hypothesis” stands invalidated. Reinforcing the notion that in a globalized world no country can be an island, growth prospects of emerging economies have been undermined by the cascading financial crisis with, of course, considerable variation across countries. BIS Review 39/2009 1 
Questions to be addressed India too has been impacted by the crisis, and by much more than we had earlier thought. Against this background, what I propose to do is to address the following questions:  (i) Why has India been hit by the crisis?  (ii) How has India been hit by the crisis? (iii) How have we responded to the challenge? The answers to the above three questions form the basis for the fourth, and perhaps more important question. (iv) What is the outlook for India? Why has India been hit by the crisis? The ferocity with which the global crisis hit India dismayed many. And this dismay stems from two analytical strands.  The first analytic goes something like this. The Indian banking system has had no direct exposure to the sub-prime mortgage assets or to the failed institutions. It has very limited off-balance sheet activities or securitized assets. In fact, our banks continue to remain sound and healthy. So, the enigma is how can India be caught up in a crisis when it has nothing much to do with any of the maladies that are at the core of the crisis.  The second reason for dismay is that India's recent growth has been driven predominantly by domestic consumption and domestic investment. External demand, as measured by merchandize exports, accounts for less than 15 per cent of our GDP. The question then is, even if there is a global downturn, why should India be affected when its reliance on external demand is so limited?  The answer to both the above causes of dismay lies in globalization. Let me explain. First, India's integration into the world economy over the last decade has been remarkably rapid. Integration into the world implies more than just exports. Going by the common measure of globalization, India's two-way trade (merchandize exports plus imports), as a proportion of GDP, increased from 21.2 per cent in 1997-98, the year of the Asian crisis, to 34.7 per cent in 2007-08.  Second, India's financial integration with the world has been as deep as India's trade globalization, if not deeper. If we take an expanded measure of globalization, that is the ratio of total external transactions (gross current account flows plus gross capital flows) to GDP, this ratio has more than doubled from 46.8 per cent in 1997-98 to 117.4 per cent in 2007-08.  Importantly, the Indian corporate sector's access to external funding has markedly increased in the last five years. Some numbers will help illustrate the point. In the five-year period 2003-08, the share of corporate investment in India's GDP rose by 9 percentage points. Corporate savings financed a little more than half of this, but a significant portion of the balance financing came from external sources. While funds were available domestically, foreign funding was perceived to be less expensive than domestic financing. On the other hand, in a global market awash with liquidity and on the promise of India's growth potential, foreign investors and lenders were willing to take risks and finance investment in India. Last year (2007/08), for example, India received capital inflows amounting to over 9 per cent of GDP as against a current account deficit in the balance of payments of just 1.5 per cent of GDP. These capital flows, in excess of the current account deficit, evidence the importance of external financing to the corporates and the depth of India's financial integration.  So, the reason India has been hit by the crisis, despite mitigating factors, is clearly India's rapid and growing integration into the global economy. 2 BIS Review 39/2009 
How has India been hit by the crisis? The contagion of the crisis has spread to India through all the channels – the financial channel, the real channel, and importantly, as happens in all financial crises, the confidence channel.  Let us first look at the financial channel. India's financial markets – equity market, money market, forex market and credit market – had all come under pressure from a number of directions. First, as a consequence of the global liquidity squeeze, Indian corporates found their overseas financing drying up, forcing corporates to shift their credit demand to the domestic banking sector. Also, in their search for substitute financing, corporates withdrew their investments in domestic money market mutual funds (MFs); consequently, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) where the MFs had invested a significant portion of their funds came under redemption pressure. This substitution of overseas financing by domestic financing brought both money markets and credit markets under pressure. Second, the forex market came under pressure because of reversal of capital flows as part of the global deleveraging process. Simultaneously, corporates were converting the funds raised locally into foreign currency to meet their external obligations. Both these factors put downward pressure on the rupee. Third, the Reserve Bank's intervention in the forex market to manage the volatility in the rupee further added to liquidity tightening.  Now let me turn to the real channel. Here, the transmission of the global cues to the domestic economy has been quite straight forward – through the slump in demand for exports. The United States, European Union and the Middle East, which account for three quarters of India's goods and services trade, are in a synchronized down turn. Services export growth is also likely to slow in the near term as the recession deepens and financial services firms – traditionally large users of outsourcing services – are restructured. Remittances from migrant workers too are likely to slow as the Middle East adjusts to lower crude prices and advanced economies go into a recession. Beyond the financial and real channels of transmission as above, the crisis also spread through the confidence channel. In sharp contrast to global financial markets, which went into a seizure on account of a crisis of confidence, Indian financial markets continued to function in an orderly manner. Furthermore, our banks have continued to lend. However, the tightened global liquidity situation in the period immediately following the Lehman failure in mid-September 2008, coming as it did on top of a turn in the credit cycle, increased the risk aversion of the financial system and made some banks cautious about lending.  The purport of the above explanation is to show how, despite not being part of the global financial sector problem, India has been affected by the crisis through the adverse feedback loops between external shocks and domestic vulnerabilities.  How have we responded to the challenge?  Let me now turn to how we responded to the crisis. The failure of Lehman Brothers in mid-September 2008 was followed in quick succession by several other large financial institutions coming under severe stress. This made financial markets around the world uncertain and unsettled. This contagion, as I explained above, spread to emerging economies, and to India too. Both the government and the Reserve Bank of India responded to the challenge in close coordination and consultation. The main plank of the government response was fiscal stimulus while the Reserve Bank's action comprised monetary accommodation and counter cyclical regulatory measures.  Monetary policy response The Reserve Bank's policy response was aimed at containing the contagion from the outside – to keep the domestic money and credit markets functioning normally and see that the BIS Review 39/2009 3 
liquidity stress did not trigger solvency cascades. In particular, we targeted three objectives: first, to maintain a comfortable rupee liquidity position; second, to augment foreign exchange liquidity; and third, to maintain a policy framework that would keep credit delivery on track so as to arrest the moderation in growth. This marked a reversal of Reserve Bank's policy stance from monetary tightening in response to heightened inflationary pressures of the previous period to monetary easing in response to easing inflationary pressures and moderation in growth in the current cycle. Our measures to meet the above objectives came in several policy packages starting mid-September 2008, on occasion in response to unanticipated global developments, and at other times in anticipation of the impact of potential global developments on the Indian markets.  Our policy packages included, like in the case of other central banks, both conventional and unconventional measures. On the conventional side, we reduced the policy interest rates aggressively and rapidly, reduced the quantum of bank reserves impounded by the central bank and expanded and liberalized the refinance facilities for export credit. Measures aimed at managing forex liquidity included an upward adjustment of the interest rate ceiling on the foreign currency deposits by non-resident Indians, substantially relaxing the external commercial borrowings (ECB) regime for corporates, and allowing non-banking financial companies and housing finance companies access to foreign borrowing. The important among the many unconventional measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India are a rupee-dollar swap facility for Indian banks to give them comfort in managing their short-term foreign funding requirements, an exclusive refinance window as also a special purpose vehicle for supporting non-banking financial companies, and expanding the lendable resources available to apex finance institutions for refinancing credit extended to small industries, housing and exports. Reflecting the rapid turn of events that could impair assets down the line, we reversed the counter – cyclical regulatory measures introduced in 2006.  Government's fiscal stimulus Over the last five years, both the central and state governments in India have made a serious efforts to reverse the fiscal excesses of the past. At the heart of these efforts was the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act which mandated a calibrated road map towards fiscal sustainability.  The depth and extraordinary impact of this crisis, however, clearly indicated the need for counter cyclical public spending. Accordingly, the central government invoked the emergency provisions of the FRBM Act to seek relaxation from the fiscal targets and launched two fiscal stimulus packages in December 2008 and January 2009. These fiscal stimulus packages, together amounting to about 3 per cent of GDP, included additional public spending, government guaranteed funds for infrastructure spending, cuts in indirect taxes, expanded guarantee cover for credit to micro and small enterprises, and additional support to exporters. These stimulus packages came on top of an already announced expanded safety-net for rural poor, a farm loan waiver package and salary increases for government staff, all of which too should stimulate demand.  Impact of monetary measures Taken together, the measures put in place since mid-September 2008 have ensured that the Indian financial markets continue to function in an orderly manner. The cumulative amount of primary liquidity potentially available to the financial system through these measures is about Rs.390,000 crore or 7 per cent of GDP. This sizeable easing has ensured a comfortable liquidity position starting mid-November 2008 as evidenced by a number of indicators including the weighted average call money rate, the overnight money market rate and the yield on the 10-year benchmark government security. Taking the signal from the policy rate cut, many of the big banks have reduced their benchmark prime lending rates. Bank credit 4 BIS Review 39/2009 
has expanded too, but slower than last year. However, Reserve Bank’s rough calculations show that the overall flow of resources to the commercial sector is less than what it was last year. This is because, even though bank credit has expanded, it has not fully offset the decline in non-bank flow of resources to the commercial sector. Evaluating the response In evaluating the response to the crisis, it is important to remember that although the origins of the crisis are common around the world, the crisis has impacted different economies differently. Importantly, in advanced economies where it originated, the crisis spread from the financial sector to the real sector. In emerging economies, the transmission of external shocks to domestic vulnerabilities has typically been from the real sector to the financial sector.  Countries have accordingly responded to the crisis depending on their specific country circumstances. Thus, even as policy responses across countries are broadly similar, their precise design, quantum, sequencing and timing have varied. In particular, while policy responses in advanced economies have had to contend with both the unfolding financial crisis and deepening recession, in India, our response has been predominantly driven by the need to arrest moderation in economic growth.  What is the outlook for India?  The outlook for India going forward is mixed. There is clear evidence of economic activity slowing down. Real GDP growth has moderated modestly in the first and second quarters of 2008/09, and sharply in the third quarter. The services sector, which has been our prime growth engine for the last five years, is slowing, mainly in construction, transport and communication, trade, hotels and restaurants sub-sectors. For the first time in seven years, exports have declined in absolute terms for four months in a row during October 2008 – January 2009. Recent data indicate that the demand for bank credit is slackening despite comfortable liquidity in the system. Dampened demand has dented corporate margins while the uncertainty surrounding the crisis has affected business confidence. The index of industrial production has shown negative growth for two recent months and investment demand is decelerating. All these factors suggest that growth will moderate more than we had earlier thought.  In addressing the fall out of the crisis, India has several advantages. Some of these are recent developments. Most notably, headline inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index, has fallen sharply though consumer price inflation is yet to moderate. Clearly, falling commodity prices have been the key drivers behind the disinflation; however, some contribution has also come from slowing domestic demand. The decline in inflation should revive and support consumption demand and reduce input costs for corporates. Furthermore, the decline in global crude prices and naphtha prices, if sustained, will reduce the size of subsidies to oil and fertilizer companies, opening up fiscal space for infrastructure spending. From the external sector perspective, it is projected that imports will shrink more than exports keeping the current account deficit modest. There are also several structural factors that have come to India's aid. First, notwithstanding the severity and multiplicity of the adverse shocks, India's financial markets have shown admirable resilience. This is in large part because India's banking system remains sound, healthy, well capitalized and prudently regulated. Second, our comfortable reserve position provides confidence to overseas investors. Third, since a large majority of Indians do not participate in equity and asset markets, the negative impact of the wealth loss effect that is plaguing the advanced economies should be quite muted. Consequently, consumption demand should hold up well. Fourth, because of India's mandated priority sector lending, institutional credit for agriculture has remained unaffected.

implemented by the Government should further insulate the agriculture sector from the crisis. Finally, over the years, India has built an extensive network of social safety-net programmes, including the flagship rural employment guarantee programme. These uniquely Indian versions of automatic stabilizers should protect the poor from the extreme impact of the global crisis.  RBI's policy stance Going forward, the Reserve Bank's policy stance will continue to be to maintain comfortable rupee and forex liquidity positions. There are indications that pressures on mutual funds have eased and that NBFCs too are making the necessary adjustments to balance their assets and liabilities. Despite the contraction in export demand, we will be able to manage our balance of payments. It is the Reserve Bank's expectation that commercial banks will take the signal from the policy rates reduction to adjust their deposit and lending rates in order to keep credit flowing to productive sectors. In particular, the special refinance windows opened by the Reserve Bank for the MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) sector, housing sector and export sector should see credit flowing to these sectors. Also the SPV set up for extending assistance to NBFCs should ease the financing constraints of NBFCs. The government's fiscal stimulus should be able to supplement these efforts from both supply and demand sides. When the turn around comes Over the last five years, India clocked an unprecedented nine per cent growth, driven largely by domestic consumption and investment even as the share of net exports has been rising. This was no accident or happenstance. True, the benign global environment, easy liquidity and low interest rates helped, but at the heart of India's growth were a growing entrepreneurial spirit, rise in productivity and increasing savings. These fundamental strengths continue to be in place. Nevertheless, the global crisis will dent India's growth trajectory as investments and exports slow. Clearly, there is a period of painful adjustment ahead of us. However, once the global economy begins to recover, India's turn around will be sharper and swifter, backed by our strong fundamentals and the untapped growth potential. Meanwhile, the challenge for the government and the RBI is to manage the adjustment with as little pain as possible. 6 BIS Review 39/2009 
Ric Battellino: An update on the economy and financial developments Address by Mr Ric Battellino, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Urban Development Institute of Australia, National Congress 2009, Brisbane, 31 March 2009. *      *      * Introduction The past six months have certainly proved that we live in a globalised world. Last September, the US investment bank, Lehman Brothers, collapsed and several other major US financial institutions came under immense stress. These events transformed what was a difficult but manageable situation in global markets into a full-blown financial crisis. The consequences for the global economy have been severe. Up until these events, most forecasters had been predicting that the major economies would have a relatively mild slowdown in 2009, and that Asia would be largely unaffected. Those predictions have since been replaced by forecasts of a major global downturn, with all significant countries affected. Australia entered this difficult period in much better shape than many other countries. Disciplined monetary and fiscal policies in earlier years, sound regulation and a prudent approach to lending by our banks meant that the country was largely free of major problems. It is not surprising therefore that, so far, we have weathered this global downturn better than most. We have had more scope than others to move policies in the expansionary direction and our banks, being largely free of problem assets, are in a position to keep supplying credit to the economy. Having said that, no amount of good economic management can totally shield us from what is happening in the global economy. In my talk today I would like to review how the global economy is evolving; update you on how we are seeing the domestic economy; and say a few words about household sector finances and the housing market. The global economy We all know by now that the global economy is going through a recession. In itself, this is not unusual; the world economy has tended to experience a downturn every 7-10 years. The current global downturn is, however, more severe than we have experienced for a long time. This is because in some important countries a banking sector crisis has been overlaid on the regular economic cycle. This has added to the severity of the downturn because: • it has undermined the confidence of the community; and  • it has led to a sharp slowdown in the availability of credit.  This cycle is also highly synchronised, with every significant country in the world affected. Household and business confidence collapsed simultaneously in every country late last year, as we all reacted in the same way to the dramatic news being transmitted around the world. The events of the past six months have resulted in big changes in the forecasts for the global economy. Mid last year, official international bodies were generally forecasting that the world economy would grow by around 4 per cent in 2009, only a little below average. Now they are forecasting that global GDP will fall by around 1 per cent in 2009, the weakest outcome in the post-war period. It is widely accepted that a precondition for economic recovery is the restoration of financial stability. Markets have at times been frustrated at how long it has taken countries with BIS Review 39/2009 1 
banking problems to implement measures to restore the health of their financial institutions. But these are very complex problems and it takes time for consensus to build about the solution. Another complication is that, not surprisingly, a common initial reaction is to want retribution from the financial institutions that are seen as having caused the problem. While this is understandable, it makes it difficult for the political process to support making public funds available to stabilise the financial system. These issues are not new and, by the standards of some past banking crises, the US, the country at the heart of the current crisis, is making reasonable progress. The US authorities last week announced further plans to restore the health of their financial sector. These were followed by a solid rise in share prices, particularly for banking stocks, though market sentiment is clearly still fragile. On the real economy, we are starting to notice the odd positive economic indicator in the run of US monthly data, in contrast to the universally negative outcomes a few months ago. Let’s hope this continues. From Australia’s perspective, no discussion of the global economy is complete without reference to China. Like other countries, China experienced a sharp slowdown in the second half of last year, after a couple of years of extraordinary boom in which output growth increased to around 12 per cent per year. The downturn in China has been of great significance to Australia, given that China is now our largest trading partner. My guess is that the Chinese authorities, like everybody else, were caught by surprise at the suddenness of the downturn. But they have since reacted with great speed and vigour in implementing monetary and fiscal measures to stimulate their economy. There are some signs that these measures are starting to work. While China is not going to return to a 12 per cent growth rate any time soon, it is quite possible that the past six months will turn out to have been the period of maximum weakness in the Chinese economy. Of course, it will be a while before we know one way or another. The Australian economy Like all other economies, the Australian economy was very much affected by the extraordinary events of last September. As in other countries, confidence was severely eroded by the spectacle of large US financial institutions either collapsing or coming under immense financial strain. Concerns began to arise about the safety of our own financial institutions, even though they were in a very strong position. The Australian Government therefore elected, as did governments in other countries, to guarantee the debts of banks. In addition to these adverse confidence effects, the Australian economy was also affected by the collapse of commodity prices. Mid last year, commodity prices were at boom levels; six months later, many had broadly halved. This has resulted in a large loss of real income to the economy.  The fall in commodity prices has also caused businesses to revise down sharply their investment plans in the year ahead. Households have also become much more cautious, cutting back on spending and increasing saving. All this meant that there was a sharp change in the outlook for the economy in the closing months of last year. The Reserve Bank responded to this with a very substantial lowering of interest rates: between September last year and February this year the cash rate was reduced from 7¼ per cent to 3¼ per cent. Other central banks have also cut official interest rates sharply, but in many cases, because of problems in their banking sectors, this did not flow through to any great extent to interest rates faced by households and businesses. In essence, the monetary policy transmission mechanism in many countries has become severely impaired, which is why some central banks have resorted to non-traditional monetary measures. 2 BIS Review 39/2009 
This problem has not arisen in Australia. The monetary policy transmission process has been effective and there remains scope to ease policy further if circumstances require. The 400 basis point reduction in the cash rate since last September has reduced the overall cost of funds to banks by 340 basis points, after taking into account movements in interest rates in global capital markets. On average banks have cut interest rates on loans by the same amount – i.e. they have on average fully passed on the fall in their cost of funds to borrowers. Interest rates on housing loans have fallen by more, while interest rates on some consumer and business loans have fallen by less. As a result of the reductions that have occurred, both housing interest rates and business lending rates are at historically low levels. In the case of housing, this has produced a very quick response in terms of the pick up in loan demand. Housing loan approvals are up 20 per cent since their low point in July. This has been concentrated almost entirely among owner occupiers. It is not hard to understand why demand for housing loans has responded so quickly. With interest rates on housing loans around 5½ per cent, the cash payments involved in servicing a housing loan are now not much more than those involved in renting. Combined with the First Home Owner Grant, this has attracted a lot of first home buyers into the market. Governments are also supporting the economy with increased spending. Perhaps the best single measure of this is the change in their fiscal position. Across all levels of Australian governments, last financial year there was a fiscal surplus of 1½ per cent of GDP. This year, it is estimated there will be a deficit of 2½ per cent of GDP. This turnaround – about 4 per cent of GDP – is the largest in the post war period. These measures will go a long way to offsetting the negative influences on the economy coming from abroad, but the reality is that we cannot fully insulate ourselves from what is happening elsewhere in the world. As such, GDP is likely to fall in 2009. Even so, Australia will remain one of the better performing economies in the developed world and be well placed to benefit from the renewed global expansion when it comes. Household finances and housing As I am sure you are all acutely aware, households have experienced a large reduction in wealth over the past year or so. Mainly this is the result of the fall in the share market. As incomes have grown, we have accumulated more financial assets and an increasing proportion is held in market-linked investments such as equities and unit trusts. This is the natural outcome of financial development and is generally beneficial. It does mean, however, that there is more variability in the returns on our investments. Many people regard a fall in the share market as an aberration but the reality is that share markets produce negative returns every few years. This should be factored into our return expectations. If we don’t, we will be over-estimating the long-run rate of return that can be achieved on savings. It is important that we be realistic in our expectations about returns if we are to achieve our financial goals. Assumptions about investment returns have a big impact on decisions about how much we need to save out of income, and for how long we need to work, in order to accumulate a given amount of money. As a rule of thumb, for every one percentage point reduction in the long-run average return on savings, households would need to increase the proportion of income saved over their working lives by 3 per cent in order to accumulate a given amount of assets. Alternatively they would need to work for an additional 3 years. It is interesting that, over the past year, as the share market has fallen, the household saving rate has increased substantially and more older workers are either remaining in, or returning to, the workforce.  BIS Review 39/2009 3 
Even after the large fall in wealth over the past year, the household sector is still in a relatively sound position. If we look at household balance sheets, we see that, on the liabilities side, households on average have debt equal to about one and a half year’s income. On the assets side, they have a property valued about 4 years’ income and financial assets equal to 2½ years’ income. Let me end with a few words on the housing market. This market was fairly subdued in 2008, with prices falling on average by 3 per cent across Australia. Some states – such as Western Australia which had a late boom – are now experiencing larger falls than average. Prices at the top end of the market have also been softer than other segments, no doubt reflecting the deleveraging that is taking place among high income households following the global financial crisis. Overall, however, the housing market in Australia has held up pretty well compared with that in countries such as the US and the UK, where prices have fallen in the order of 20 per cent. We continue to believe that the market here will hold up better than overseas. There are a number of reasons why this is likely to be so, but perhaps the most important is that we did not have the same deterioration in lending standards that occurred elsewhere. By and large, the great bulk of Australians who took out housing loans have been able to afford the repayments. Notwithstanding some rise over the past year, the 90 day arrears rate on housing loans is only 0.5 per cent, which is broadly in line with its long run average and well below that in countries such as the US and UK. In the period ahead, there will be forces pulling the arrears rate in opposite directions. On the one hand, as unemployment rises, more households will have difficulty continuing to service their housing loans. On the other hand, the very large reduction in interest rates has greatly reduced the debt servicing burden of households. On an average-sized mortgage, loan repayments are now $7,000 a year less than they were six months ago. This is a very large reduction, equal to about 8 per cent of average household income. The majority of households have chosen not to spend the money that has been freed up. Rather, they have maintained high repayments and are therefore moving ahead of schedule in repaying their loans. This will give them breathing space if they do subsequently find themselves in circumstances where their repayments are interrupted. Conclusion Let me sum up by saying that the past six months have been a very difficult time for the world economy. There are some tentative signs of improvement, but in reality it is going to take quite some time for the world to recover from the financial shock that has occurred. While the Australian economy has also weakened, it has held up better than most during this difficult period, helped by earlier disciplined policies and prudent financial behaviour. However, there are limits on how much we can insulate ourselves from what is happening abroad, and therefore there are probably still some difficult times ahead. Nonetheless, the underpinnings of the Australian economy are sound so we are well placed to benefit from the global economic recovery when it comes. 4 BIS Review 39/2009 
Mario Draghi: Fact-finding on issues affecting the banking and financial system Testimony of Mr Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy and Chairman of the Financial Stability Forum, before the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, Chamber of Deputies, Rome, 17 March 2009. *      *      * All the main advanced economies recorded a sharp contraction of output in the fourth quarter of 2008. Consumption and investment demand is falling owing to the rapid, generalized deterioration in household and business confidence, the increase in unemployment, the drop in share prices and house values, and tighter access to credit. The recession has passed to the emerging economies, hit by the drop in exports to advanced countries, the decline in raw material prices, and the sudden reversal of capital flows. The countries that depend most heavily on financing from abroad, such as those of Central and Eastern Europe, are especially vulnerable. The International Monetary Fund and other official and professional forecasters have progressively revised their estimates of world economic growth downwards. In January, the IMF projected that world trade would contract by almost 3 per cent in 2009 and that GDP would fall by 1.6 per cent in the United States, 2 per cent in the euro area and 2.6 per cent in Japan. It has already announced that the estimates are being newly revised in the light of more recent data. World GDP growth will probably be negative on average for the year. Economic policymakers have acted promptly to contain the spread of the financial crisis and counter its effects on the real economy. Central banks supplied ample liquidity to the financial system, with interventions of unprecedented size and degree of international coordination. Governments have introduced or strengthened guarantees for bank deposits and securities and have prepared or taken measures to recapitalize financial institutions.  These actions have prevented the collapse of the system but they have not yet shed full light on the financial situation of those banks that invested most heavily in “toxic” assets: there is still uncertainty as to the size and distribution of the losses on the balance sheets of what were once the world’s largest banks. Moreover, it is likely that the recession will cause a further deterioration in banks’ assets. The restoration of confidence in financial institutions and properly functioning credit markets is essential, along with support for demand offered by monetary and fiscal policies, in order to restart growth. Official interest rates now stand at minimal levels in the leading economies. There is limited scope for the monetary policy lever to work, although there remains the option of unconventional measures, which are being implemented in part. In some cases, notably the United States, the central bank has put itself in a position to intervene directly in certain segments of the credit market in order to guarantee liquidity to the private sector. The leading governments have introduced fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the contraction in income and employment. The United States has launched a programme of expenditure measures and tax cuts amounting to almost $800 billion, which will have an overall impact on the deficit for the three years 2009-11 of about 5 per cent of annual GDP. The stimulus measures adopted by the European countries and Japan are of a smaller order of magnitude but considerable nonetheless, partly reflecting differences in the initial condition of public finances and in the operation of automatic stabilizers. In China, too, the Government has announced a broad programme of extraordinary expenditure to boost demand. BIS Review 38/2009 1 
The importance of international cooperation for a return to stable world economic growth and the strengthening of the international financial system was stressed at the meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Brighton last weekend. In Italy, as in the rest of the euro area, the recession, which worsened in the middle of 2008, is expected to continue through this year. All the indicators (production, orders and inventories) continue to point to extremely slack activity. GDP is expected to contract in the first quarter of this year, for the fourth consecutive time. The whole of 2009 will probably close with a new, large drop in economic activity, above all in the private sector. The difficulties of the main outlet markets have affected exports, which were the most important source of support for demand in 2006-07. In January, Italian exports to non-EU countries fell to historic low levels. Firms have cut back dramatically on their investment plans owing to the large margins of spare capacity. Consumer price inflation, which has been falling since last autumn, stood at 1.6 per cent in February; it is expected to continue to fall until the summer, mainly thanks to the trend in energy and food prices. Despite the contraction in activity, leading international organizations and professional forecasters do not expect a deflationary spiral to set in. The additional expenditure and reduction in revenue that Italy has approved for counter-cyclical purposes amounts to about 0.5 percentage points of GDP; these measures are financed by others of opposite sign. In addition, previously allocated resources have been channelled into uses that stimulate aggregate demand more effectively. The decision as to the forms of government intervention to support demand is no less important than the question of its magnitude. They must support the consumption of the weakest categories of citizens and strengthen the economy’s capacity for growth through public investment projects that offer a high rate of return and are shovel-ready. The Government has temporarily extended the possibility of benefiting from social shock absorbers to most categories of atypical workers; further improvements were defined last week. Funding for these measures was recently increased thanks to an agreement between central government and the regions. These provisions are opportune, but there is still the need to tackle a comprehensive reform. The Government has also announced it is examining provisions to facilitate the expansion of residential buildings and to reduce construction charges. The procedures, contents and timetable of any possible measures are not yet known. Simplifying formalities and reducing charges could constitute a stimulus. The complex nature of this subject, concurrent powers between the central and regional governments, and the need to design the intervention so as to preserve the natural environment and balanced town planning make the effects of such action uncertain in the short term, however. The amount of firms’ receivables from general government, connected with deferments and delays in paying for goods and services, is very high: about 2.5 per cent of GDP, more than 30 per cent of annual general government consumption and investment expenditure. Faster payments would support firms without structurally burdening the public finances. In countries like Italy, with high public debt, broad and incisive short-term interventions must be compensated for by structural measures giving immediate assurance of the restoration of budget balance in the medium term. It is essential to look farther ahead: the long-term sustainability of the public finances is fundamental to ensure the effectiveness of short-term policies. Lending and the banks Italian bank lending has decelerated sharply. The annualized three-month growth rate of loans to the private sector, adjusted for the accounting effect of securitizations, fell to 2.3 per 2 BIS Review 38/2009 
cent in January, from 8.6 per cent in September. On the basis of partial data, lending is estimated to have contracted slightly in February with respect to January. The slowdown has affected all categories of debtors. For firms, in January the three-month growth rate was 5.5 per cent, about three points lower than in September; however lending to firms with fewer than 20 employees and to manufacturing industry declined. The fall in production and uncertainty about the future of the economy reduced the demand for credit for investment and for funding inventories and working capital. Lending to households increased by 3.3 per cent in January, against 4.7 per cent last September. The growth in lending to households, which was quite robust a few years ago, had already moderated before the beginning of the financial crisis; the fall in house sales and the drop in spending on durable goods caused a further slowdown. As regards loans for house purchases, which constitute 68 per cent of credit to consumer households, in the fourth quarter of 2008 new loans were down by 20 per cent from a year earlier. Consumer credit for the purchase of goods and services – which accounted for 6 per cent of bank lending to households – slowed sharply. New mortgage loans at fixed rates amounted to €36 billion in 2008 or 64 per cent of the total granted to households, compared with €32 billion (51 per cent) in 2007. The wide gap between Italy and the euro-area average in the cost of new fixed-rate mortgages (one percentage point in June 2007) has now narrowed to nearly nil. In the last few months the share of new fixed-rate loans has fallen slightly, though remaining higher than in the past (55 per cent in January). One factor in this reduction was the fall in interest rates on variable-rate mortgages, making them more attractive to households; on the supply side, difficulties encountered by banks in recent months in obtaining long-term funds may have induced them to limit their supply of fixed-rate mortgages. The stagnation in lending is also due to banks’ adopting a more cautious policy in lending to households and businesses. The Italian banks participating in the Bank Lending Survey reported that in the fourth quarter of 2008 lending conditions tightened somewhat, while firms’ demand for credit was basically stagnant. Between September and December, existing credit lines were reduced by 1 per cent in the face of a virtual standstill in actual lending. The fact that banks are being more cautious in lending reflects difficulties in the funding markets and the deterioration of customers’ creditworthiness.  In 2008 fund-raising by Italian banks from non-resident intermediaries fell by almost 10 per cent. As funding from abroad dried up, banks responded by raising funds from households, in particular by selling bonds. This allowed overall fund-raising to continue to expand, but it did not prevent a sharp slowdown; the average growth rate fell from 11 per cent in 2007 to 5 per cent in 2008; in January the latter figure was confirmed. In the same year, lending to the private sector grew more rapidly (7.3 per cent). Lending by large banks, which are more reliant on fund-raising abroad and more exposed to market strains, slowed sharply. Local banks, by contrast, maintained similar credit flows to those before the crisis, thanks in part to a greater inflow of funds. The recession is impinging on the quality of credit. The ratio of new bad debts to total lending to firms is rising rapidly: at the end of 2008 it reached 2 per cent, the highest value since 1999, excluding the spike in 2003 when the Parmalat group collapsed. Preliminary data for the first two months of 2009 show a further increase in the number of customers having bad debts for the first time. The exposure of these customers to the banking system more than doubled compared with the same period in 2008. Although it deteriorated slightly, the quality of credit to households remains high. Private-sector debt is much lower in Italy than in other countries. Although higher than in the past, households’ financial debt is 49 per cent of the sector’s disposable income, as against more than 90 per cent for the euro area and about 150 per cent for the United Kingdom and BIS Review 38/2009 3 
the United States. Firms’ financial debt is 75 per cent of GDP, compared with a euro-area average that is about 13 percentage points higher and ratios of 77 and 113 per cent respectively for the United States and the United Kingdom. Compared with the years before the 1993 recession, Italian firms appear to be in a sounder financial position today. At the end of 2007 the leverage ratio, calculated on the balance sheets of more than 50,000 firms, was about 50 per cent, 7 percentage points less than at the beginning of the 1990s. Above all the proportion of financial costs covered by internal sources of financing is higher today. In the eighteen months of the crisis the major Italian banks have suffered smaller losses than those of other countries thanks to their limited exposure to toxic assets and strong roots in traditional banking activity, the prudence of the regulatory and supervisory framework, and the less pronounced indebtedness of their customers. For the leading banking groups structured credit instruments are less than two per cent of their balance sheet assets. Investments in the most complex securities are a tiny proportion of the total. The capital of our banks, which, in contrast with developments in nearly all the other leading countries, has not yet benefited from public recapitalizations, remains above the minimum regulatory requirements. The leverage ratio of the leading Italian banking groups – a simple indicator that avoids the complicated risk-weighting of assets required by the Basel 2 rules – is considerably lower than that of the main European banks. The proportion of hybrid capital instruments, the least robust component of tier 1 capital, is small because the Bank of Italy has applied limits that are much more stringent than the relevant international standards. It follows that even when measures of “tangible” capital are adopted, the judgement on the solidity of Italian banks does not change. In line with international practice, the calculation of Italian banks’ regulatory capital excludes the book value of goodwill, an item that in present market conditions is subject to considerable uncertainty. Accordingly, any impairment of this item would not affect banks’ regulatory capital. The market’s assessments nonetheless consider the possibility that a further strengthening of the banking system may be necessary. Banks must prepare to cope with the risks, already materializing, associated with the rapid deterioration in economic conditions. A fundamentally sound model of intermediation has so far sheltered them from the worst effects of the financial crisis; it cannot make them impermeable to the global recession. Capital strengthening, including by means of the instruments made available by the state, is a condition for maintaining the ability of the banking system to provide the economy with credit. In 2009 banks’ gross income will continue to contract, after an estimated fall of about 5 per cent in 2008, despite the still substantial growth on the order of 8 per cent in net interest income. As in the past it is likely that the decline in economic activity and interest rates will have a negative impact on interest income. According to econometric estimates, a one percentage-point reduction in GDP would lead to a 0.7 percentage-point contraction in net interest income; that produced by a one percentage point fall in money-market interest rates would be much larger, on the order of 3.5 percentage points. On the international front, the balance sheets of Italy’s leading banks are weighed down by their exposures to some Central and Eastern European countries, which are suffering from the particularly serious repercussions of macroeconomic imbalances accumulated in the past. According to BIS data, in September 2008 the Italian banking system’s exposure to these countries amounted to just over €150 billion, or 5 per cent of the system’s total assets. More than 70 per cent of the exposure is to five countries (Poland, Croatia, Russia, Hungary and Slovakia). The situation is being carefully monitored by the Bank of Italy. At European level, the political will and the instruments exist for intervention to prevent regional crises if necessary. 4 BIS Review 38/2009 
From the end of September up to yesterday the share prices of the major Italian banks fell on average by more than 50 per cent, in line with the fall recorded by the leading European banks. The share prices of international banks did not benefit from the recapitalization measures adopted abroad. In the same period major Italian banks’ credit default swap premiums, which started from low levels by international standards, rose by about 70 basis points to about 180 basis points, a figure that is analogous to that obtaining yesterday for the corresponding European index. The premiums payable on credit default swaps are influenced by significant variations in the liquidity of these contracts. I have noted on several occasions that from the beginning of the turmoil in summer 2007, the Bank of Italy stressed how essential it was for banks to ensure adequate control of liquidity risk. Enhanced monitoring, moral suasion and specific interventions had a rapid and significant impact; they enabled Italian banks to address the worsening of the financial crisis last September with balanced liquidity conditions, which allowed them to emerge from the most acute phases without incident. Supervisory activity, participation by the Bank of Italy in the collective decisions and actions of the Eurosystem, providing support to the Government and Parliament in the preparation of measures aimed at restoring confidence in the markets – to which I will return shortly – were accompanied by numerous initiatives taken directly by the Bank in the performance of its monetary functions and to alleviate specific difficulties. I have reported on this in detail elsewhere. I wish to recall in particular the swap transactions whereby some of the highest quality securities in the Bank of Italy’s portfolio were made available to banks against securities not eligible as collateral for refinancing, in order to strengthen their ability to access these operations with the Eurosystem at times of tension. The swaps were activated from 16 October onwards. The strong capital base of Italy’s central bank has been of great importance in recent months. It enabled us to plan and implement the interventions we believed necessary to support systemic liquidity promptly and for significant amounts, without jeopardizing the Bank’s balance-sheet. While less tense than a few months ago, conditions on the interbank liquidity market are still far from normal. There continues to be a need for initiatives to rebuild confidence and revive trading. On 2 February trading commenced on the new Collateralized Interbank Market (MIC), a joint initiative by the Bank of Italy, the Italian Banking Association and e-MID SIM S.p.A., the company that operates the e-MID electronic interbank market. Participating banks are given the opportunity to execute transactions with medium-term maturities, in conditions of anonymity and sheltered from credit and liquidity risks. The Bank of Italy evaluates the collateral deposited by the participants and ensures prompt settlement of transactions in the event of default by a counterparty; the banks themselves, which are called on to bear some of the cost of an eventual failure, contribute to the proper functioning of the system on a mutualistic basis. The collateralized market is open not only to Italian banks but also to other European banks that meet the same requirements, subject to an agreement with their home central banks. The volume and prices of trades are satisfactory. Between the first and sixth weeks of activity average daily trades rose from €50 million to €318 million and outstanding deposits reached €2 billion. For maturities of one and two weeks, the most traded by banks, the interest rates on the collateralized market have been consistently lower than those on the uncollateralized market, between 10 and 30 basis points on average per week; on the same contracts the bid-ask spread for the best quotes in the MIC order book have fallen progressively, from 5 basis points to 1 basis point, testifying to increasing market liquidity. In all the main countries the authorities took steps to support the financial system. In Italy the Government and Parliament, with the technical support of the Bank of Italy, adopted a set of measures to protect depositors, support banks’ liquidity and capital, and reinforce their ability BIS Review 38/2009 5 
to finance economic activity. The provisions, which were adopted under the emergency decree procedure, were ratified by Laws 190/2008 and 2/2009. I believe it is useful to recall their main points. In a first measure (Decree Law 155/2008, ratified by Law 190/2008), retail banking deposits were granted a state guarantee. The guarantee supplements the insurance provided by the previously existing interbank funds. The measure was important to reassure savers when market anxiety levels were most acute. A second set of measures, contained in Decree Law 157/2008, empowered the Ministry for the Economy and Finance to grant a state guarantee on new bank liabilities with a residual maturity of between three months and five years, guarantee entities that offer banks securities eligible for use in refinancing operations with the Eurosystem, and supply government securities to banks in exchange for newly issued liabilities (this is in addition to the Bank of Italy asset swap transactions recalled earlier). All these measures serve to guarantee banks access to a sufficient supply of liquidity, in order to ensure that the normal operation of the lending and payments system is never interrupted, even in conditions of serious turbulence. Together with the interventions by the monetary authorities, the announcement of these measures helped ease tensions on the interbank market in the autumn. Thirdly, to deal with potentially difficult situations, Decree Law 155/2008 authorizes the Treasury to subscribe capital increases of banks facing a situation of capital inadequacy ascertained by the Bank of Italy. The Government shareholding takes the form of non-voting preference shares; such public intervention is subject to the presentation of a restructuring plan assessed by the Bank of Italy. Lastly, Decree Law 185/2008 (ratified by Law 2/2009) authorizes a financial intervention by the state to increase the capital of fundamentally sound banks. In this case it is not a question of rescue operations, but of a measure to strengthen the system and, in a macroeconomic environment that has deteriorated sharply, to avert a perverse spiral between loan defaults and credit restriction. The state intervenes by taking up financial instruments issued by banks. These can be counted for prudential purposes in core tier 1 capital, because both their remuneration and their value depend on the issuer’s profitability and capital adequacy, and they may therefore be used to absorb possible losses in all circumstances. Applicant banks must adopt a code of ethics, including with regard to executive compensation, and undertake to sustain the financing of customers, particularly households and small and medium-sized enterprises. This commitment has been appropriately defined, taking into account the level of the demand for loans and the need to maintain standards of prudent credit allocation. The measure has been made operational by a decree of the Minister for the Economy and Finance. The Bank of Italy has given banks the necessary technical guidance. The economic terms of the issues must comply with the guidelines established by the European Union; several alternative schemes have been defined, partly at the request of the Bank of Italy, to make adherence to the plan more advantageous for banks that intend to redeem their instruments within a relatively short time. The terms of the Italian instruments are in line with those offered by other European countries. I expect banks to make use of them in suitable amounts. The recapitalization law also provides for monitoring the transactions and their effects on the economy and institutes special observatories at prefectures, with the participation of the interested parties. The Bank of Italy will supply the Ministry for the Economy and Finance with data and analyses on the evolution of credit and borrowing costs on a regional basis, as an additional supplement to the ample geographically disaggregated data already released in its publications. The statistical information will allow any specific situations of tension to be identified. 6 BIS Review 38/2009 
It is essential that analysis of credit conditions at local level not stray into a role of pressuring banks, prompting them to relax the standards of sound and prudent management in the selection of borrowers. In my opinion, political and administrative interference in assessments of individual cases of creditworthiness must be avoided. Lending is and must remain an entrepreneurial activity, based on a prudent, professional evaluation of the validity of companies’ plans. Sooner or later, imprudent banks end up in distress and also cease lending. But the test posed by the crisis is severe and requires the ability to be good bankers even when the economy is doing badly. The inevitable deterioration in loan quality due to the recession calls for far-sighted choices: just keeping the accounts straight is not enough. Firm support for creditworthy customers prevents an excessive credit squeeze, which would aggravate the recession, thereby worsening the position of banks’ customers. As I have already said, every opportunity must be taken to strengthen the capital of banks, choosing the most appropriate form in each case: recourse to the market, retained earnings, or the instruments offered by the state. The restoration of confidence in the banking system is a global, not a national question. In my view, four conditions are essential. First, the uncertainty still surrounding the value of the most troubled assets on banks’ balance sheets must be dispelled; this must become an integral part of public interventions in support of the financial system. It is indispensable, especially in Europe, that similar measures be based on common principles, in order to avert competitive disparities between intermediaries of different countries and between banks exposed in differing degrees to the problem of impaired assets. Second, in determining recapitalization objectives, it is vital that the definitions of bank capital be the same at international level. Third, the authorities have made it clear that they intend to protect all systemically important institutions, endow them with the capital needed to face stress conditions, protect depositors and have the shareholders alone bear any losses. To all intents and purposes banks’ other creditors are protected against losses. This must be explained with absolute clarity; it is the only way to drastically reduce the risk premiums that the markets are still demanding on bank liabilities. Fourth, it is time to go beyond dealing with the problems inherited from the past and consider how to ensure the availability of credit from now on. Recapitalizing banks is necessary to this end, but it is not sufficient; there is a need to think about new, even unconventional instruments. This last point is especially pertinent for Italy, where neutralizing the complex financial instruments whose value has plunged is of limited relevance and finding instruments that directly affect the availability of loans for firms and households is more important. One possibility would be the issuing of public guarantees for the senior tranches of pools of new loans, with a view to reviving an important channel of financing, loan securitization, that has completely dried up today. If banks are able to sell part of their loans on an active and liquid secondary market, they can use the liquidity obtained to reactivate the supply of credit. A scheme of this kind would have to be carefully designed in order to ensure its effectiveness in terms of new lending, give banks a correct structure of incentives and minimize the costs to taxpayers. The originator bank should retain some of the risk, thereby still having the incentive to select creditworthy borrowers; it should pay a suitable fee for the issue of the guarantee, commensurate with the quality of the underlying loans. Limiting the public guarantee to the least risky portion of the pool of securitized loans keeps the state from being assigned an inappropriate role in the assessment of creditworthiness. Objective criteria could be established for selecting loans of good quality (for example, mortgages with a loan-to-value ratio not above a given limit and loans to small and medium-sized firms backed by the Guarantee Fund for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises), so as to encourage subscription of the entire pool of securitized loans by the market and limit the possible cost to taxpayers. BIS Review 38/2009 7 
Some features of the tax treatment of banks and other intermediaries in Italy that lack a clear economic logic and produce a competitive disadvantage with respect to other countries should be reconsidered. Value adjustments to loans are deductible from taxable income each year only up to 0.3 per cent of a bank’s total outstanding loans; writedowns exceeding that amount are deducted over a period of eighteen years. The limit and the rules on the writedown period have been tightened repeatedly in recent years. It is difficult to see the economic justification or to find comparable provisions in the other major European countries. In France, Germany and the United Kingdom, value adjustments are tax-deductible on a loan-by-loan basis, in line with those stated in the accounts; in France and Germany, flat-rate allocations to provisions are also allowed. The penalization of Italian banks is pro-cyclical, because the burden is greater during cyclical downturns, when loan losses increase; at present, the mechanism is exerting a disproportionate impact on the credit system. In banks accounts, the limit on the deductibility of value adjustments results in an advance payment of taxes, in essence a tax credit. At the end of 2007 this credit amounted to some €4 billion; for 2008 it comes to €1.4 billion. Writedowns are also non-deductible for the regional tax on productive activities (IRAP) and thus diminish profit. The total impact of these deduction limits on banking profit amounts to some €400 million yearly. A loss always becomes fully deductible when it is realized – if the debtor is in bankruptcy proceedings; otherwise, the revenue agency can object that the loss is not “certain and precise,” with the risk of an ensuing tax dispute. This risk affects the cost and availability of credit. In the present phase, during which loan losses will presumably increase, it would be advisable to diminish, as much as possible, the causes of regulatory uncertainty and hence the tax risks for the system. Starting with 2008, a portion of banks’ interest expenditure (currently 4 per cent) is no longer deductible from corporate income tax or the regional tax on productive activities. The ceiling also applies to transactions on the interbank market, thus constituting a drag on its operations. For a bank, interest expenditure is what the cost of raw materials is for any other business. Neither the United States nor the main European countries have any equivalent rule. Also starting last year, administrative expenses and depreciation are only 90 per cent deductible for purposes of IRAP, while dividends are exempt for 50 per cent of the amount received. These limits are specific to the financial industry and do not apply to other enterprises. Official estimates put the total cost of the non-deductibility of interest expenditure this year at €1.1 billion, a quarter of this due to interbank transactions. This year, the VAT exemption on auxiliary services provided within a banking group is abolished. The exemption reduced the cost to banks of the non-deductibility of VAT on purchases of goods and services and made up for Italy’s lack of the “group VAT” regime, which in many other European countries avoids the application of VAT to intra-group transactions. It is desirable that Italy institute the “group VAT” regime envisaged by the Community directive, thus coming into line with the other main EU member states. Considering that government estimates put the additional cost of the non-deductibility of VAT at €400 million a year, the overall reduction in banks’ net profits due to these specific direct and indirect tax measures will be nearly €2 billion this year. High taxes mean less self-financing, less capital, less lending capacity.  A bank’s good name, the basis of a solid relationship with customers, is always a precious asset, and all the more so in times of crisis. Safeguarding and enhancing the banking system’s reputation requires irreproachable conduct in practice, no less than strict rules. Transparent and correct relations with customers protect consumers. They spur competition, ensuring full comparability of products. They are an important part of sound and prudent bank management, because they reduce reputational and legal risks. They safeguard the stability of the system. 8 BIS Review 38/2009 
It is the responsibility of Consob to oversee the transparency and correctness of those who offer financial products and investment services to the public. For typical banking transactions, the law assigns such supervision to the Bank of Italy. This activity has been stepped up in recent years. We have set up a special unit to monitor banks’ relations with customers. We have drafted a radical revision of the regulations under our jurisdiction. Tomorrow, public consultation will begin, using the Internet, on two major proposals: one for the practical institution of the new procedure for out-of-court settlement of disputes between banks and customers; the other for new provisions, designed in part through discussions with associations of banks, other intermediaries and consumers, to make the protections for correctness in dealings with customers more effective. With these new rules we intend to make the documents for customers clearer, more concise and comparable. The instruments governing the most common products, mortgage loans and current accounts, will be especially incisive. For some time now we have intensified our controls. As far as it is within our power, we have directed them to substantial and not merely formal compliance with the rules. In the last three years we have performed checks at 452 intermediaries and more than 2,300 branches. Where we have found specific violations of the rules on notifying the public of the conditions offered, we have initiated sanction procedures (a total of 49, 11 of which have concluded with the levying of sanctions). In 206 cases, though the grounds for formal sanction were lacking, we called upon the intermediary to comply more closely in substance with the rules; we asked for the introduction of organizational arrangements and internal controls to guarantee better customer relations. Where necessary, intermediaries were required to refund sums of money unduly collected from customers and report on this to the Bank of Italy. Recently we have extended our controls to banks’ websites, in order to make sure that on-line customers have protection equivalent to that enjoyed by those using the traditional branch network. Bank customers often write to the Bank of Italy to report what they consider to be incorrect conduct. We receive nearly 6,000 letters a year. In every single case we respond to the writer and ask the bank involved to explain its position, providing a clear answer and reporting it to us. Where necessary, we take the appropriate supervisory measures. On mortgage loans, we have reminded intermediaries of the need to join in the interbank procedures for loan portability. Recent rules changes now allow sanctions for noncompliance. On current accounts, we conduct an annual sample survey of banks’ terms and conditions, whose results will be presented in our Annual Report.  * * * The crisis has highlighted the need to correct some significant features of the international financial architecture. More robust capital requirements for banks together with measures to counter their pro-cyclical effects; limits on excessive leverage for financial institutions; the extension of prudential rules to segments of financial business that in some countries have largely escaped coverage; strengthening the role of central banks in guaranteeing the macroeconomic aspects of stability – these are the most important elements of a radical and expeditious programme of revision that has been set in motion with a speed and a degree of international cohesion that would have been unthinkable a short time ago.  The need for strong global coordination is evident and universally recognized. The major emerging countries have taken a larger role in the governance of the financial system. This is not just a matter of fairness; it is a requisite for effective intervention.  I do not intend to dwell on these themes here. But I would like to stress that improved supervisory coordination is essential above all at European level, if we want to preserve the benefits of the single capital market. There is growing support in Europe for bold solutions involving the sharing of some regulatory and supervisory functions. The new European supervisory architecture will not dispense with the wealth of knowledge, expertise, and familiarity with the market built up by national supervisors: it will need to capitalize on these BIS Review 38/2009 9 
assets within an integrated framework. The experience of the European System of Central Banks shows that this route can be taken successfully. The recent report of the high-level De Larosière Group of experts points in this direction. In particular, I should like to underscore its attention to macroprudential supervision, to be assigned to a central body; the stress on the harmonization of rules and supervisory standards; and the call for Community coordination of the “colleges” that exercise supervision over the large European banking groups. The decision-making processes of the system, the powers and responsibilities of European and national supervisors, have to be designed with care. The European Commission’s intention to proceed with all necessary speed is commendable. 10 BIS Review 38/2009 
Barbro Wickman-Parak: What can monetary policy achieve? Speech by Ms Barbro Wickman-Parak, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at a meeting, Karlstad, 27 March 2009. *      *      * Economic policy can be divided up into two areas: fiscal policy and monetary policy. In Sweden and all other countries with independent central banks, there is as we all know a distinct difference between these two policy areas. The Government is responsible for fiscal policy and the central bank for monetary policy. The central bank is not allowed to receive instructions from any other party when carrying out its monetary policy tasks – it is to conduct its monetary policy in an independent manner. So what is the range of the policy area delegated to an independent central bank; that is, what can we expect a central bank to be able to achieve? This question is the theme of my speech today.  Economic policy ultimately concerns creating the best possible conditions for long-term growth and thereby a high level of welfare for the population. The given limit for growth is set by developments in the labour force and in productivity. To attain long-term growth the policies must be aimed at, for instance, educating the labour force, creating an incentive structure that stimulates people to work, creating a good innovation climate that promotes technological developments and so on. This is all common knowledge, but may be worth saying sometimes. And the reason I am doing so now is that it may be a good starting point for distinguishing what monetary policy may achieve in the short and long run. We can note already that the policy areas I recently mentioned concern politics in a broad sense and not monetary policy. It is thus not monetary policy that can affect these most fundamental conditions for long-term growth.  One illustration of monetary policy’s limited potential to affect employment in the long term is the disparate regional developments in one and the same country. In Sweden, for instance, there are large regional differences in employment levels, despite monetary policy being the same for all regions. These differences appear to be lasting, which might indicate that they are due to underlying, structural factors that are beyond the control of monetary policy.  However, monetary policy can affect the conditions for long-term growth on one very essential point, namely by keeping inflation close to the target and inflation expectations anchored around the target. If inflation deviates from the target the Riksbank’s aim is normally to bring it back on target within a couple of years. Depending on how large the deviation is and its cause, the time horizon may be extended. This flexibility makes it possible for the Riksbank to take into account developments in the real economy in its monetary policy considerations.  In the short term, monetary policy can contribute to reducing the fluctuations in production and employment that arise during an economic cycle. As I will discuss today, however, the possibility of achieving this type of stabilisation is also dependent on inflation expectations being reasonably stabile. If inflation expectations are stable, a change in the policy rate will have a direct effect on the real interest rate, which corresponds to the nominal interest rate minus expected inflation. As it is the real interest rate that determines aggregate demand, monetary policy may in the short term have an impact on the real economy. Today I shall take up the question of what monetary policy can affect in the short and long run. I shall use some examples to illustrate the balance that must be attained between the inflation target and developments in the real economy. Functioning financial markets are of vital significance for the functioning of the whole economy. The Riksbank’s other main task, beside monetary policy, is to safeguard financial stability. During the current financial crisis the Riksbank has taken a number of measures to safeguard financial stability. This has been parallel to taking monetary policy measures. BIS Review 38/2009 1 
Monetary policy and financial stability are closely linked. The possibility to conduct efficient monetary policy depends on the transmission mechanism functioning. I shall return to this question later in my speech. Finally, I shall make some concluding comments.  The influence of monetary policy in the short and long run – research  At the end of the 1950s the economist A. W. Phillips found a negative relationship between unemployment and inflation by studying data from the UK for the period 1861-19571, a relationship that is usually referred to as the Phillips curve. This shows that higher employment can be achieved at the cost of higher inflation. It was thus long believed that one could "buy” long-term lower unemployment by pushing up inflation. However this relationship was empirically proved not to hold in the long run. In the 1970s, for instance, there were periods with both high unemployment and high inflation, what is known as stagflation.  The relationship was also tackled from a theoretical angle. In a famous article from the late 1960s Milton Friedman discussed what monetary policy can and cannot achieve.2 His view was that in the long run monetary policy is unable to affect real economic variables such as unemployment and GDP. However, it can affect nominal variables such as the exchange rate and price level. In the long run there is a "natural” level of unemployment that is dependent on the functioning of the labour market. If monetary policy tries to push down unemployment below this "natural" level, it will only result in higher inflation. Monetary policy therefore risks becoming a disturbing factor in the economy. According to Friedman, it is therefore best for monetary policy to create the right conditions for a stable price level and to focus on the variables that a central bank can control, such as the money supply.  In the 1970s and 1980s a number of countries applied a monetary policy regime that was based on steering the money supply. However, research has shown that there is no stable relationship between the money supply and inflation. The rapid financial developments and the use of new, alternative methods of payment have contributed to the money supply not functioning well as a target variable for monetary policy in our present society. Nor is the rate of circulation of money constant; it can vary substantially. It is therefore more natural to focus on trying to directly steer inflation and allow the money supply to remain one indicator among many.  The past few decades’ research has pointed to the importance of inflation expectations. Although there is a relationship in the short run between unemployment and inflation, the central bank cannot make use of this in the long run, as companies and individuals will realise what policy is being conducted and adapt their expectations accordingly. For example, wage-earners may demand higher wages as compensation for coming inflation. This will in turn have a negative effect on employment. Monetary policy thus cannot have a lasting influence on real economic variables. But it can have a stabilising effect in the short run, particularly if inflation expectations are well-anchored so that temporary changes in inflation are not perceived as permanent.  However, this means that a conflict may arise between the short run and the long run. A central bank prefers inflation expectations to be stable and low, as this is best in the long run. The central bank may then prefer to conduct a policy that is perceived as sufficiently tight for inflation to remain low, as this creates low inflation expectations. But once inflation expectations are low, it may be tempting to allow the market to be ”surprised” by a more                                                  1  Phillips actually studied the relationship between wages and unemployment, but later studies indicated a similar relationship between inflation and unemployment, Phillips, A. W, (1958) “The relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of money wages in the United Kingdom, 1861-1957”, Economica, 25, s. 283-299. 2  Friedman, M, (1968). “The role of monetary policy”, American Economic Review, p. 58, 1–17. 2 BIS Review 38/2009 
expansionary policy that leads to lower unemployment, as it takes time before individuals and companies adapt their behaviour. In this way the central bank risks finding itself in a vicious circle of periods where inflation is allowed to soar, followed by periods where inflation expectations have to be brought down again at a large cost to the real economy. Independent central bank, inflation target and openness This time inconsistency problem which affects economic policy was first noted by Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott in the late 1970s.3 One proposal that was put forward to address this problem was to introduce independent central banks which build up credibility by succeeding in maintaining low inflation and having realistic ambitions with regard to stabilising resource utilisation. To do this, the central banks must be able to take quick and sometimes unpopular decisions. If a central bank succeeds in attaining credibility so that inflation expectations are stable, there is some scope for also taking into account developments in the real economy.4 It is thus also important from a stability perspective to find a means of attaining credibility and stable inflation expectations.  As one of the steps to achieving this many central banks, including the Riksbank, introduced explicit inflation targets in the 1990s. In practice, most central banks now conduct flexible inflation targeting to attain the inflation target and also stabilise resource utilisation. This means that the central bank is not prepared to attain the inflation target in the short run at any cost. The Riksbank’s aim is that if inflation deviates from target it shall normally be brought back on target within a couple of years. In the case of large deviations it may take longer before the target is attained so that the effects on the real economy are not excessive. Because monetary policy works with a lag, the decisions must be based on forecasts. It is therefore important to publish forecasts for inflation and the real economy, which the Riksbank does. We will never live in a world where it is possible to fully predict the future. Moreover, our knowledge of how the transmission mechanism works, that is, how an interest rate change works its way through the economy, is far from perfect. But given the available information and with the knowledge available we shall make the best possible forecasts and it shall be possible to evaluate our forecasts. When inflation deviates from the target it shall be possible to understand why this happened and to assess the deliberations that were held.  To publish a forecast for the repo rate on top of all this, which is something few central banks do, makes it easier for us to find the most reasonable balance between attaining the inflation target and stabilising the real economy. It also helps us explain our policy. We also do this by presenting a number of alternative scenarios for the economy and showing what consequences these would have for monetary policy. Popular and unpopular interest rate decisions In the long run it is the actual "delivery” of low and stable inflation that creates confidence in long-term stable prices. But the economy can be subjected to unforeseen shocks that affect inflation and monetary policy cannot have the precision required to constantly maintain inflation at the target level. Deviations from the inflation target have happened before and will happen again. The important thing is that they are temporary. The route back to the target must be consistent and credible. This is a necessary condition for inflation expectations remaining stable and in line with the target, which in turn provides us with greater opportunity to also take into account developments in production and employment.                                                   3  Kydland, F. E. and Prescott, E. C. (1977). ”Rules rather than discretion: The inconsistency of optimal plans”.

BIS Review 38/2009 3 
This brings me to the point that we as the central bank must be prepared to make unpopular decisions. We have recently cut the repo rate by an unusually large amount and in an unusually short time. Cutting interest rates is a popular decision that is welcomed by most. But the condition for these decisions has been that they do not clash with the inflation target. On the contrary, we have needed to make these decisions so that inflation would not be too low in relation to the target over a long period of time.  We are counting on the repo rate remaining at a low level over the whole of this year. But sooner or later we will need to begin raising the repo rate again. In this situation it is possible that unemployment will still be high, as changes in employment often occur somewhat later in the economic cycle than changes in other variables, such as growth. This is illustrated in our forecasts for the repo rate and unemployment presented in the February Monetary Policy Report. It is important to remember in such a situation that monetary policy is forward-looking and that its primary task is to create good long-term conditions for the economy by maintaining price stability. Let me illustrate this by means of two monetary policy episodes.  ”Too low” versus "too high” inflation The last time the repo rate was very low, with a lowest point of 1.5 per cent, was in 2005. Inflation was then below target and the Riksbank received criticism from various parties for not cutting the repo rate further. Sweden was on its way into an economic upturn, but the labour market was nevertheless relatively weak. There was a lot of talk about "jobless growth”, that is, growth that does not create employment. Some said that the reason more jobs were not created was that monetary policy was too tight. The Riksbank made a different assessment. The view of the Executive Board was that it was underlying factors on the supply side, such as productivity, increased competition in the food sector and low-price imports from emerging economies that were decisive for the low inflation and employment. None of these factors would have been affected by a repo rate cut. The Executive Board’s assessment was that monetary policy was sufficiently expansionary given the demand situation and they pointed to the fact that credit volumes and house prices were increasing at a rate that was not sustainable in the long run. They therefore began to raise the interest rate in January 2006, a little sooner than if they had merely given consideration to the inflation target. The Riksbank had no target for either credit volumes or house prices. But these were variables that might be expected to affect inflation and the real economy. If the credit volume and house prices had continued to rise rapidly this would have risked triggering larger adjustments further ahead. One reflection that can be made here is that if the interest rate had been cut even further in 2005, which was suggested by several outside of the Bank, the current situation might have been worse. There would probably have been a larger credit expansion and higher house prices that would have needed to be adjusted later. This could have put our economy in a much more vulnerable position and thereby worsened the current economic downturn.  Another experience is from autumn 2007, when energy and food prices increased considerably, which contributed to pushing up inflation. It is also an example of a supply side shock, as these prices are set in the world market. Swedish monetary policy cannot affect them. But at the same time, domestic cost pressures were relatively high. Productivity growth had slowed down, while wage costs were rising. We had experienced a long period of growth and the labour market had begun to tighten. Growth was still good, but we saw a slowdown coming, although it appeared that it might be fairly mild. We were facing a situation where the risk that high energy and food price increases would spread to other prices must be weighed against the risk of a weak real economy. There was much talk of the risk of stagflation, that is, a combination of an economic slowdown and rising inflation. We faced a situation in which reaching a decision became ever more difficult. This became clear when we Executive Board members made slightly different assessments in summer and early autumn 2008 of what kind of interest rate policy was required. However, the 4 BIS Review 38/2009 
economic downturn was much quicker and deeper than we had expected, partly as a result of the financial crisis which came to affect us more tangibly in the autumn. This was unfortunate for the economy, but it simplified our decision-making. We could see ahead of us that inflation would be far below the target for a period of time, and we wanted to avoid this period from being a long one. We have been able to cut the repo rate by 3.75 percentage points in less than six months, which means that the repo rate is now at a historically low level. Our forecasts show a substantial fall in demand and the lower interest rate policy is intended to contribute to softening the fall. When the circumstances have suddenly changed, monetary policy has been rapidly adapted to the new situation. The two cases I have taken up show the flexibility inherent in our monetary policy and which we have made good use of.  What is the driving force behind inflation? A fundamental question As monetary policy’s ability to influence inflation and ultimately economic developments depends on the type of shock to which the economy is subjected, we must analyse the driving forces behind inflation.5 When inflation is governed by supply factors that push up inflation, as in 2007-2008 when for instance energy prices rose, the initial effect cannot be prevented by monetary policy. When inflation became too low in relation to the target around 2005, this was largely because productivity rose more than expected. This is essentially a positive development that neither should nor can be prevented by monetary policy. However, it provided a possibility to hold the interest rate at a low level and to allow a higher level of demand than would otherwise have been the case. But the effects on employment were limited by the underlying productivity growth. However, the Riksbank might have needed to cut the repo rate further if one had at the same time observed a deterioration in demand or that the more long-term inflation expectations were far below the target. This was not the case; inflation expectations in the slightly longer term were fairly well anchored around 2 per cent. At the same time, the Riksbank’s forecasts showed that economic activity would remain strong. This period illustrates how important it is for monetary policy to analyse the driving forces behind inflation and for the policy to be forward-looking.  When inflation rose last year, this was also largely due to supply factors, such as the price of oil and other commodities, which could not be checked even in the short term by monetary policy. However, in the background was a long period of high growth and increased tightness in the labour market. At the same time, productivity growth was declining and wages were rising. This entailed increased cost pressures, which justified a higher interest rate. Monetary policy continued to tighten even when signs of weakening in economic activity began to appear.  When we look ahead we can see that prices measured in terms of the CPI will fall this year and inflation will thus deviate substantially from the target. The primary cause of this is that mortgage rates and energy prices are falling rapidly when calculated as an annual percentage change. If we exclude the effect of our own interest rate cuts and the effects of falling energy prices, prices are not expected to fall.6 I shall not go further into this, but merely wish to point out once again how important it is to analyse the driving forces behind inflation to be able to explain the monetary policy conducted. This means that we from time to time highlight different measures of inflation. In the current stage it is thus important to distinguish the effects of our own measures which we have implemented to alleviate the effects of the financial crisis on international growth and thus on growth in Sweden.                                                   5  For a detailed discussion of this, see “Should monetary policy stabilise resource utilisation?” Economic Commentary No. 1 2008, Sveriges Riksbank. 6  Inflation measured in terms of the CPIF, which disregards changes in mortgage rates, is around 1.6 per cent on average in 2009. If one also excludes energy costs, the average for 2009 is 2.2 per cent. BIS Review 38/2009 5 
Monetary policy is dependent on a functioning transmission mechanism Inflation is affected by the Riksbank’s changes in the repo rate through what is usually known as the transmission mechanism. This influence goes through several different channels, such as short and long real interest rates, the exchange rate and the supply of credit. The impact occurs with different degrees of delay.  The repo rate is the interest rate the banks pay when they borrow from or deposit money in the Riksbank for one week against collateral. Under normal circumstances there is a relatively stable relationship between the level of the repo rate and the level of the rates that companies and households face, as well as between interest rates and access to loans. The financial crisis affected these relationships. When, for example, the Riksbank cut the interest rate at the beginning of October the short market rates did not fall. The risk premiums increased as a result of the uncertainty and turmoil that followed in the wake of the financial crisis, so that the difference between the repo rate and the short market rates expanded. This meant that the interest rate cut did not have a full impact on interest rates paid by households and companies. Market rates thus became higher than would normally have been justified by the level of the repo rate.  Since the financial crisis worsened last autumn, the Riksbank, like many other central banks, has implemented a number of measures to safeguard financial stability. These measures have largely concerned the provision of liquidity to the banking system. This has improved the functioning of the short term markets and risk premiums have fallen. The interest rate channel in the transmission mechanism has thus begun to function more normally. The primary purpose of the Riksbank’s measures has been to safeguard financial stability, but they have also lead to monetary policy functioning more efficiently. The Riksbank’s two main tasks, managing monetary policy and safeguarding financial stability, are thus closely linked to one another. This has been clearly illustrated by the financial crisis.  There is concern that these measures, which also lead to an expansion in the central banks' balance sheets, entail an increased risk that inflation in future will be too high. The question is thus whether the economy will have a surplus of liquidity when the situation begins to normalise, and whether this could lead to increased inflationary pressures. The answer to that question is no. The measures taken by the central banks now can be regarded as a response to the tightening on the market. One can simplify and say that the central banks are trying to counteract or neutralise the markets' tightening so that the transmission channel can begin functioning more normally.  These measures will only continue as long as the markets cannot function on their own. Once the financial crisis has waned, the Riksbank will not renew the special measures required during the crisis. Our loans are relatively short-term, with maturities of between 3 and 12 months. The loans will therefore mature gradually when the special lending facilities are phased out. When the economy then recovers, monetary policy will be adjusted according to the circumstances prevailing at the time. The policy rate can be raised in large steps if this were to prove necessary. In the most recent Monetary Policy Report you can see that we are expecting a relatively rapid increase in the repo rate towards the end of the forecast period.  Concluding comments We have a historically low repo rate at the moment. Given the gloomy economic prospects, I and the other Executive Board members considered in February that a substantial repo rate cut was needed. We were expecting a rapid deterioration in the labour market situation, which together with rapidly falling energy prices meant that inflationary pressures had declined. In this situation there was thus nothing to prevent monetary policy being used in a forceful manner to alleviate the effects of the fall in demand that came in the wake of the financial crisis. On the contrary, the interest rate cut was necessary to attain the inflation 6 BIS Review 38/2009 
target in the long run. If the situation were to deteriorate, a first measure would be to cut the interest rate further. If the repo rate were to be cut to zero, or close to zero, and this was still not sufficient, other types of measure would be necessary. We are prepared to implement the measures that are necessary. If inflationary pressures were instead to increase, it may be necessary to raise the repo rate more quickly than we have assumed. A few years ago the Riksbank was criticised for not giving sufficient consideration to other variables than inflation, such as unemployment, for instance. Economic theory and experiences show, however, that monetary policy has only a very limited ability to lastingly affect real economic variables. On the other hand, the Riksbank tries to achieve a reasonable balance between attaining the inflation target and stabilising the real economy. But as it normally takes a while before an upturn in economic activity has an impact on employment, it is very possible that the Riksbank will need to raise the repo rate in a situation where unemployment is still high. This is also something we are assuming in our most recent forecast. There is then a risk that unreasonable requirements will be made of monetary policy. It will then be important to bear in mind that the primary objective of monetary policy is to create good long-term conditions for all participants in the economy.  It is important that we have an active discussion of the Riksbank’s policy. But for the discussion to be fruitful it must be based on realistic expectations of what monetary policy can and cannot achieve. Sweden is a small, export-dependent economy and when economic activity abroad suddenly falls, monetary policy cannot prevent negative effects from this on our economy. But we can alleviate these effects. As the financial markets are integrated, we cannot prevent an international financial crisis having effects here, too. Then we must use other tools, parallel to our interest rate policy, to make the financial system function in the best possible way given the circumstances. This is what we have done throughout the autumn and we will continue to do this as long as is necessary.  BIS Review 38/2009 7 
Lucas Papademos: How to deal with the global financial crisis and promote the economy’s recovery and sustained growth Speech by Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the European Central Bank, at the 7th European Business Summit organised by the European Business Forum, Brussels, 26 March 2009. *      *      * I.  Introduction  The European and global economies are experiencing the most severe and prolonged financial crisis since the 1930s. A few facts and figures highlight the magnitude and nature of the challenge we face. Since the beginning of the financial turbulence in 2007, the total reported write-downs and losses of banks globally have exceeded 888 billion dollars. Some estimates of the overall expected losses by banks and other financial institutions are in the range of 2.2 trillion dollars.1 Asset prices have plummeted worldwide, though the extent differs across countries and market segments. In the EU, the value of equity has fallen by 6 trillion euro,2 a decline of more than 50% from the peak reached in summer 2007. Economic activity decelerated sharply during 2008, especially in the last quarter; it is projected to contract significantly in the EU this year and to recover very moderately and gradually in the course of 2010. Importantly, the economic outlook is surrounded by exceptionally high uncertainty reflecting, among other factors, the low level of consumer and business confidence as well as the ongoing deleveraging of banks and other financial institutions. The economic and financial situation and prospects are characterised by two features: first, a synchronised decline or deceleration in economic activity in all economies which is associated with a collapse in world trade; and, second, growing signs of an adverse feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector. Although the sharp drop in the value of toxic assets has weakened many banks’ balance sheets, the weakening of economic activity has been impairing the quality of bank loans, adversely affecting their capital positions and their willingness to extend credit to the private sector. This, in turn, constrains the pace of economic activity and the ability of the private sector to service its debts, entailing a risk of a vicious circle. II.  Policies for economic recovery and sustained growth These observations have two general implications for economic policy. First, the economy’s recovery requires the simultaneous implementation of macroeconomic policies to stimulate aggregate demand and of measures that will help repair banks’ balance sheets and encourage the provision of credit to the economy. In this way, a potential vicious circle can be prevented. Second, concerted policy efforts in all economies, especially the large ones, are necessary so that world trade can be revitalised and financial capital flows stabilised. This will help support the emerging market economies and global growth. The policy strategies pursued need not be identical across countries and regions and the required size of the economic stimulus and the nature of the other measures taken need not – and should not – be the same, as structural and conjunctural conditions differ. Nevertheless, a similar orientation and consistency is warranted.                                                  1  See International Monetary Fund, Global Financial Stability Report Market Update, 28 January 2009, p.2. 2  Based on data available up for January 2009. BIS Review 38/2009 1 
Since the intensification of the financial crisis in September 2008, central banks and governments globally have acted in a decisive and concerted manner to contain the adverse effect of the financial crisis on the real economy and promote its recovery. In the euro area, the actions taken by the ECB and the Eurosystem are unprecedented in size and scope. Government support for financial institutions in the form of recapitalisations, guarantees on bank debt and, more recently, asset relief schemes, have been significant and the pertinent measures are progressively being implemented. And the fiscal stimulus packages of euro area governments are substantial, amounting to a total of about 2% of euro area GDP over this year and the next. The immediate priority of macroeconomic policies and bank support schemes is to promote the economy’s recovery and preserve price and financial stability. Yet, a fundamental policy objective should be that the recovery of activity and the repair of the financial system have to be achieved in a manner that will ensure a sustained growth performance and will prevent the recurrence of episodes of financial imbalances and market excesses that can threaten again financial stability and economic welfare. Put differently, it is important that the policies and reforms pursued today lay the foundations for sustained growth. Let me now elaborate on these issues by focusing on the role and contribution of central bank policy and of financial system reform. Central bank policy The ECB’s monetary policy and provision of liquidity have played a key role in containing the downside risks to price stability, supporting economic activity and stabilising the financial system. The extent of the monetary policy easing since last October has been unprecedented, with key ECB policy interest rates having been reduced by 275 basis points. At the same time, money market rates have declined even more from the peaks reached in October 2008 as a result of the reduction in the policy rates and the provision of unlimited liquidity to banks at a fixed interest rate (against an expanded range of eligible collateral) since last October. At present, Euribor rates of maturities up to three months are below or very close to the main refinancing rate (MRO) of the ECB and at historically low levels – ranging between 0.93% (overnight) and 1.56% (3 months).3 And these levels are comparable to the corresponding Libor rates in the US dollar and Pound sterling money markets.4 Thus, over the past six months, conditions in the euro area money markets have significantly improved and effectively are similar to – or even better than – those in other major money markets. In addition, the provision of liquidity by the ECB to the euro area banking system has been extraordinary in size and scope. The size of Eurosystem’s balance sheet in mid-February had reached 1.53 trillion euro (or 1.96 trillion US dollars), compared with 0.91 trillion euro before the eruption of the crisis. The expansion of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet by about 70% over this period reflects the various non-standard measures implemented by the ECB, including the provision of unlimited funding in euro at fixed interest rates over periods up to six months as well as the supply of liquidity in other currencies, notably US dollars, on the basis of a swap agreement with the Federal Reserve. The reduction in the policy rates and the increased supply of reserves were fully in line with the ECB’s primary objective of preserving price stability over the medium term, as inflation pressures eased and inflation risks diminished, and helped to alleviate pressures in the credit market and mitigate financial stability risks.                                                  3  Euribor rates for longer maturities (on 25 January 2009) are following: 6 months: 1.71%; 9 months: 1.78%; 1 year: 1.86%. 4  US Dollar 3-months Libor on 25 January 2009 were 1.48%; and Sterling 3-months Libor 1.79%. 2 BIS Review 38/2009 
Nevertheless, and although bank lending rates have been gradually falling, bank credit standards on new loans have been tightened and credit growth to the private sector has been decelerating. This partly reflects the impact of the decline in economic activity on the demand for bank loans, but it is also a consequence of the ongoing deleveraging process in the banking system and continued stresses in the funding markets.  Government support for the banking system Since last autumn, governments have supported the banking system through various measures: by injecting new capital, by providing guarantees on new bank debt issuance and, more recently, through asset relief schemes (involving the removal of impaired assets from the banks’ balance sheets or the provision of guarantees to limit the valuation losses of such assets). These measures have succeeded in stabilising the banking system, by reducing systemic risks and strengthening confidence. The support provided has been substantial, for example banks in the euro area have received 115 billion euro of capital injection from governments (of which 75 billion euro were provided to the major banking groups) and 217 billion euro of funding guarantees. However, these bank support measures are taking some time to implement. So far, only one third of the commitments for capital injections have been used and a smaller fraction – about 12% – of the commitments to guarantee new bank debt have been called upon. The participation of banks in the debt guarantee schemes is voluntary, and the very limited use of these guarantees may reflect a decline in the demand for credit and/or the desire of the banks to continue deleveraging their balance sheets. It is, however, important to ensure that other constraining factors are addressed, for example that the disincentives associated with the provision or pricing of these debt guarantees are promptly addressed, so as to help banks finance additional lending to the private sector. Possible further measures A relevant question is whether the tight financing conditions and the continuing stresses on the banking system require further measures by governments and central banks in order to help revive the extension of bank credit to the economy. The answer regarding the need and the nature of potential further measures depends on the causes or determinants of the prevailing financing conditions and on the structure of the financial system. To the extent that (i) financial market stresses, (ii) the deleveraging process, (iii) uncertainty about the economic outlook and about potential further bank losses, and (iv) low confidence impair the functioning of the credit and bank funding markets and the transmission of the effects of monetary policy, “non-standard” measures aimed at reducing funding uncertainty and enhancing the functioning of the credit market and, consequently, the monetary policy transmission mechanism, may represent possible courses of action. In the euro area, because the banking system has a more dominant role in the financing of the private sector than the capital market, compared with other economies, the implementation of such measures would be more focused on the banking system. Potential measures could include an extension of the maturity of the central bank liquidity provided to banks and purchases of private debt securities in the secondary market in order to improve its liquidity and reduce the cost of funding of the real economy, thus helping its recovery. Could a further easing of monetary policy contribute to containing potential disinflation risks and provide further support to economic activity? I would like to make two general remarks concerning the role of monetary policy in fostering the economy’s recovery and sustained growth at this juncture and more generally. First, as we have emphasised in the past, the ECB’s monetary policy should ensure that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim to keeping inflation below, but close to, 2%. This anchoring of inflation expectations supports sustainable growth, employment creation and contributes to financial stability. Second, the monetary policy stance should be determined so as to also contribute to a smooth exit strategy from the current exceptional circumstances of historically low rates and unlimited provision of central BIS Review 38/2009 3 
bank money to the banking system. Consequently, a monetary policy that aims to address potential disinflation risks and maintain medium-term price stability must be implemented in a manner that also ensures the preservation of price stability over the longer term.  Financial system reform And this brings me to two final points concerning two other essential conditions for sustainable growth: financial system reform and sound fiscal policy. It is by now generally agreed that there is both a great and urgent need to introduce reforms that prevent the recurrence of episodes of financial market excesses and corrections and that will make the global financial system more resilient to shocks. An extensive and impressive amount of work has been undertaken by national authorities and international bodies, under the auspices of the Financial Stability Forum and, more recently, the G20 process. Concrete proposals have been formulated – and others are currently being elaborated – on how to reduce the cyclicality of the financial system through various measures and reforms, including the enhancement of the scope and effectiveness of financial regulation and supervision. In the EU, the report of the de Larosière Group is a valuable contribution to this end. The forthcoming summit meeting of the Group of 20 in London can mark a further important step in the effective pursuit of this reform agenda globally. The prompt implementation of the proposed financial reforms will not only foster sustainable growth and financial stability in the long run, but it should also contribute to boosting confidence in the financial system in the short run, thus promoting economic recovery. Fiscal policy Last, and definitely not least, it is also essential for sustainable growth and prosperity that confidence in the long-term soundness of public finances is maintained. Government deficits and public debts are rising substantially in most countries as a result of the economic downturn, discretionary measures to stimulate the economy, and the funding of the bank support schemes. This is partly inevitable – due to the downturn – and partly necessary – to help stabilise the economy and the financial system – in the short run. But it is also imperative that fiscal policies are designed and implemented in a manner that strikes the right balance between the need to support the economy’s recovery and the need to preserve the confidence in the soundness and sustainability of public finances which is key for the long-term performance of the economy. III.  Conclusion I have used the word “confidence” several times. The severity and duration of the current economic and financial crisis is partly a consequence of the reduced confidence in the prospects of the economy and the soundness of the financial system. The recovery of the economy also hinges on the restoration of consumer and business confidence that can contribute to the revival of spending and investment, and the return to normality in financial markets and the banking system. The rebuilding of trust will depend on our ability to appropriately combine the policy actions needed to address the immediate challenges with the necessary reforms for establishing an economic, financial and institutional environment that is conducive to sustainable long-term growth. Thank you very much for your attention. 4 BIS Review 38/2009 
Masaaki Shirakawa: Provision of subordinated loans Excerpt from an address by Mr Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at a Meeting with Banks’ Top Management, Tokyo, 24 March 2009. *      *      * At the Policy Board meeting held on March 17, the Bank of Japan decided to explore a new framework for providing subordinated loans to banks. We have invited today representatives of banks which are subject to international capital standards to explain the background and the Bank of Japan’s view on the decision. The funding conditions for firms have deteriorated rapidly since last autumn due to the increased strains in global financial markets after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. While financial institutions have retained the financial intermediation function accordingly by increasing lending, the environment surrounding financial institutions has become increasingly severe due to the stock price plunge and the domestic economic downturn. Fund raising in financial markets for funds over the fiscal year-end has mostly been completed, but the firms continue to face difficult funding conditions. While the CP market has started to restore its function, funding in the capital market has been limited to the firms with high ratings. Looking ahead, while demand for funds to secure liquidity for the year-end and the fiscal year-end and demand for working capital due to the rise in raw material prices until last summer will decline, demand for funds to continue and to restructure business are expected to gain momentum. There might be a case in which the financial intermediation function will not be carried out smoothly from a macro perspective, if the strains in global financial markets increase and financial institutions become more conscious of possible capital constraints in the future. If financial institutions become more conscious of taking credit risk and all financial institutions take the same action simultaneously, the adverse feedback loop between the finance and the economy may intensify through financial institutions’ restraining from accumulating their assets, leading to the fallacy of composition, although the action is judged as rational for each individual institution. As a result, that might weaken the capital strength of each financial institution. From that point of view, concern is for the influence of a possible decline in stock prices. While the amount of stocks currently held by financial institutions is significantly reduced compared with the early 2000s, it remains unchanged that they hold substantial market risk associated with stockholdings. Although stock prices have recently somewhat rebounded, the financial systems in the U.S. and Europe have remained unstable. It should be avoided that each financial institution's consciousness about a possible decline in stock prices triggers the aforementioned fallacy of composition. Against such a backdrop, the Bank has decided to begin exploring specifically the provision of subordinated loans to the banks that are subject to international capital standards. This measure aims at ensuring the smooth functioning of financial intermediation and the stability of Japan’s financial system, by enabling Japan’s banks to maintain sufficient capital bases even in severe financial and economic environments. By the measure taken by the Bank, financial institutions are provided with three channels to raise capital; (1) capital raising by financial institutions through markets, (2) capital raising based on the Act on Special Measures for Strengthening Financial Functions, (3) borrowing subordinated loans from the Bank. Subordinated loans by the Bank will work effectively in conjunction with the other two measures to raise capital. In addition, providing such a safety-net measure would enhance the robustness of Japan’s financial system and the functioning of financial intermediation even under the stressed conditions. BIS Review 37/2009 1 
For a central bank, this kind of direct provision of quasi-capital funds is an extremely extraordinary measure. However, considering the future stress scenario of the financial system, the Bank has judged that, from the standpoint of a central bank, it is necessary to do its best to maintain the smooth functioning of financial intermediation and ensure the stability of the financial system even by conducting this extraordinary measure. The Bank expects financial institutions to grasp the thinking behind the measure and to strive to maintain the smooth functioning of financial intermediation with further efforts of boosting capital bases. Needless to say, risk management is extremely important for financial institutions, which cannot be emphasized too much. However, under the current circumstances, as I mentioned above, the surfacing of the risk stemming from the fallacy of composition should be avoided. To that end, it is important for the management of financial institutions, while conducting sound business operations, to boost capital bases with envisioning the consequences for Japan's economy. The Bank also expects financial institutions to pay due concern for the smooth communication with their client companies to convey business policies and lending stances. It is the basic premise that the stability of the financial system should be ensured in order to return to a sustainable economic growth path under price stability. From the standpoint of a central bank, the Bank is determined to make its best effort to secure the stability of the financial system. We would appreciate your continued support and cooperation. Thank you. 2 BIS Review 37/2009 
Svein Gjedrem: The outlook for the Norwegian economy and monetary policy assessments Speech by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at a presentation of the Monetary Policy Report 1/09 at Goldman Sachs, London, 26 March 2009. The address is based on the assessments presented at Norges Bank’s press conference following the Executive Board’s monetary policy meeting on 25 March, Monetary Policy Report 1/09 and on previous speeches. Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. *      *      * Introduction Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided yesterday to reduce its key policy rate by 0.50 percentage point to 2.00 per cent. The Monetary Policy Report, published yesterday, indicates that the key policy rate should be gradually reduced further to a level of around 1 per cent in the second half of 2009.  Financial crisis but active public measures In September 2008, the turbulence in financial markets erupted into a full-blown global crisis. Global economic growth was already slowing, but the situation has deteriorated in the past few months of 2008. The turnaround hit hard, with synchronised effects on virtually all financial and goods and services markets, not only in the US but also in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Oceania. We are now in the deepest downturn in OECD countries in the postwar period. GDP in the OECD area as a whole is expected to fall in 2009 for the first time since the Second World War.  The prospects for the world economy are now even weaker than we anticipated at the end of 2008. International trade is contracting markedly, and it will take time before growth rebounds. Our projections for growth among our trading partners have been revised down to -3 per cent in 2009 and ¾ per cent in 2010. Moreover, the Norwegian economy seems to be contracting more sharply than projected around the monetary policy meeting in December.   BIS Review 37/2009 1 
 A wide range of instruments is being used in Norway to counteract the effects of the financial crisis. In order to curb the fall in activity, government expenditure will be increased by over 10 per cent this year. Norges Bank’s bank lending survey shows that banks have been tightening credit standards substantially, particularly for corporate loans. To boost the credit market a separate government fund1 will buy private bonds.  The government has also provided loans and guarantees for exports and expanded lending limits for the Norwegian State Housing Bank and other special vehicles for government financing.2  Norwegian Banks’ equity capital makes up only 6 per cent of their assets, which is low from a historic perspective, but not low compared with banks in other countries.3 At present, our banks are financially sound, but they need to strengthen their core capital in order to be able to supply credit as normal. The authorities offer risk capital to the banks, including core Tier 1 capital without voting right through a newly established State Finance Fund.    Banks have become more vulnerable to distortions in the credit markets. Historically, our banks primarily obtained funds through deposits by households and enterprises.4 In recent                                                  1  Folketrygdfondet will manage the new Government Bond Fund. 2  The Government has increased the capital of Kommunalbanken Norway (the local government funding agency), it has increased the scope of GIEK (the central government export credit agency) and Innovation Norway, and has offered state loans to Eksportfinans Norway (the credit institution for export financing). 3  Figures for banks’ equity capital before 1918 are based on: Jan Tore Klovland (2007): “A reconstruction of the balance sheets of savings banks in Norway 1822-1875” and “A reconstruction of the balance sheets of commercial banks in Norway1848-1900” in Øyvind Eitrheim, Jan Tore Klovland and Jan F. Qvigstad (Ed.) (2007): “Historical Monetary Statistics for Norway – Part II” Norges Bank’s Occasional Papers, No. 38, Oslo. Statistics Norway is the source for figures from 1919 to 1995. Norges Bank is the source for figures from 1996. 4  Figures are taken from the sources in footnote 3 and Hege Imset Matre, H. I.

years, banks have borrowed in both domestic and foreign markets. When credit markets dried up, this proved to involve high liquidity risk for banks.    To facilitate the funding of banks operating in Norway, a swap arrangement was established allowing banks to exchange covered bonds for government securities for up to NOK 350 billion. A number of banks have made use of this facility, so far in an amount totaling NOK 80 billion. The arrangement provides banks with Treasury bills. Banks have used these as collateral for loans, sold them or kept them as liquidity reserves.  Norges Bank has also expanded its use of its ordinary instruments. We have supplied additional liquidity through our loan facilities and made arrangements for banks to furnish a greater range of securities as collateral for the loans. We have also provided loans with longer-than-usual maturities. The longest maturities have been two- and three-year loans, which have been geared to small banks.  Norges Bank has also supplied Norwegian kroner through currency swaps and offered USD loans to Norwegian banks. Norges Bank entered into a swap agreement with the Federal Reserve, authorising a loan of up to USD 15 billion. The measures have been effective. Money market rates, which for a period were above 8 per cent, are now approximately 3½ per cent. In this period Norges Bank reduced the key policy rate by 3.75 percentage points to 2 per cent on 25 March. Banks’ lending rates have decreased considerably. Credit flows have improved, but access to credit is still difficult for enterprises. Money market premiums have fallen. In the first quarter of 2009, premiums on three-month interest rates in Norway stood at 1.2 percentage points. Norwegian money market premiums are expected to edge down ahead in line with premiums in global markets. BIS Review 37/2009 3 
 The global downturn led to a marked fall in prices for oil and other commodities through autumn 2008. Oil prices have for a period now hovered around USD 45 per barrel. Oil futures prices have fallen and indicate an oil price of around USD 55 per barrel in 2010.   Other commodity prices that are important for the Norwegian economy have also fallen sharply. Metal prices are particularly sensitive to cyclical developments. Futures prices for a selection of raw materials indicate unchanged or moderately rising prices in the next few years. Many countries that have been hit by the economic setback will see an improvement in their terms of trade and growth in their disposable income.  4 BIS Review 37/2009 
  The current downturn followed a period of very high global and domestic economic growth, supported by favorable trading conditions. Few countries benefited more than Norway from the economic upturn, which drove up prices for oil, gas and other export commodities. At the same time, an increasing number of cheap consumer goods were imported from new EU countries and from Asia. Norway’s real disposable income increased by more than 40 per cent from 2002 to 2008, more than that of any other western country. But our terms of trade are now deteriorating. Some of the gains of the past few years have dissipated, and our disposable income might fall by close to 10 per cent in 2009.    In periods of substantial uncertainty, investors will seek to repatriate investments in foreign currency. The fragility of the Norwegian krone was illustrated when investors fled the currencies of small countries, and the krone weakened considerably. When speculators withdrew, daily fluctuations increased and hedging against exchange rate volatility became BIS Review 37/2009 5 
more expensive. The krone fell to a record-low level in December last year, but has appreciated since then.    Consumer price inflation reached a peak in October of 2008, and has slowed markedly thereafter and was 2.5 per cent in February. Underlying inflation is still above the inflation target, and stood at approximately 3 per cent in February. Even though inflation has been falling, the rise in prices has been somewhat sharper than expected recently, particularly for imported consumer goods. The depreciation of the krone last autumn has probably fed through to prices more rapidly than usual. Nevertheless, looking forward inflation will abate.    Norges Bank has over a number of years focused on anchoring inflation expectations around 6 BIS Review 37/2009 
the target of close to 2.5 per cent over time and given weight to predictability, with a recognizable response pattern.    The downturn has not affected long-term inflation expectations to any great extent. According to an expectations survey, inflation expectations five years ahead among experts in the financial industry, the social partners and academia were virtually unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009.    An indicator of inflation expectations in financial markets can be derived from the long-term forward rate differential between Norway and the euro area. Because of a higher inflation target in our country, this differential will normally be around ½-1 percentage point, depending on risk premiums in the bond market. The differential has been in this range in recent years, but has fluctuated somewhat since last autumn.  BIS Review 37/2009 7 
  After a prolonged upturn both output and employment are falling in Norway. The turnaround had already occurred just over a year ago, but in the period to autumn last year, it appeared that capacity utilisation would gradually decrease to a normal level. As the global economic outlook deteriorated, it became clear that the slowdown in our economy would occur more rapidly and be more pronounced than envisaged earlier. In November, regional network contacts reported an abrupt and marked turnaround in activity. They now report that the labour supply is no longer a constraint on production. The enterprises in the network are expecting output and employment to fall further over the next six months.    Unemployment has increased since autumn last year, but is still at historical low levels. Unemployment is projected to rise to 4 3/4 per cent at the end of the year. Wage growth is expected to come down this year from a high level in 2008. Lower corporate profitability, 8 BIS Review 37/2009 
rising unemployment and lower consumer price inflation will probably result in low negotiated pay increases this year.    The export sector has been particularly hard hit by the global downturn. Traditional exports have fallen markedly since autumn last year. A contraction in the world economy will result in a substantial decline in Norwegian exports ahead. Moreover, due to the marked fall in commodity prices, export prices are now very low.     Expensive and reduced access to credit, high interest expenses and uncertainty about developments ahead amplified the downturn towards the end of 2008. Private consumption fell markedly, the decline in housing investment accelerated and mainland business investment started to fall.

financial markets are expected to continue to mark the Norwegian economy ahead. Mainland GDP is projected to contract by 1 per cent between 2008 and 2009.   Norwegian government finances are sound with substantial net wealth, although the surplus will be reduced by the fall in oil prices. The automatic stabilisers in the national budget together with discretionary fiscal policy will stimulate the mainland economy by the equivalent of 5 per cent of GDP from 2008 to 2009.  Fiscal policy is assumed to become less expansionary between 2010 and 2012. Government oil revenue spending is expected to be brought back into line with the fiscal rule when cyclical conditions eventually normalise.    We assume that prospects for higher unemployment, a fall in house prices and a high level of debt will induce households to build up financial buffers and reduce debt. The saving ratio 10 BIS Review 37/2009 
is expected to increase considerably. Net lending is projected to be positive this year after being negative since 2004. As household borrowing has been considerable in recent years, deleveraging in the household sector is important to long-term stability in the economy. The outlook ahead, and monetary policy assessments   In Norway, inflation will be curbed by lower capacity utilisation. The marked increase in unemployment now envisaged will result in lower pay increases this year and next. Prospects of weaker growth and lower inflation imply a lower interest rate than presented in the interest rate projection from our last forecast in December. There is also a risk that the global downturn will be deeper and more prolonged than expected. If this proves to be the case, growth in the Norwegian economy will not pick up as quickly and inflation will fall more sharply than we currently assume. The objective of avoiding a pronounced downturn indicates in isolation that the interest rate should be rapidly reduced to a low level. On the other hand, we have already made substantial reductions in the key policy rate. With a low interest rate, households may save less and the turnaround may occur more rapidly than we assume. This indicates in isolation that changes in the interest rate should be gradual or that further interest rate cuts should be put on hold.  Overall, the outlook and balance of risks suggest that the key policy rate should be gradually reduced further to a level of around 1 per cent in the second half of 2009. This is about one percentage point lower than in Norges Bank’s forecast from 17 December last year. With the low interest rate added to the government fiscal measures, our analysis indicates that growth in the economy will be positive from the second half of this year. Growth will be driven by a rise in private consumption as a result of a low key policy rate, growth in real wages and higher government transfers. Activity in the economy will be underpinned by strong growth in government spending. The projections are based on the assumption that Norges Bank’s interest rate changes will translate into lower lending rates for households and businesses. At the same time, tighter credit standards in banks are making monetary policy somewhat less effective than normal.  BIS Review 37/2009 11 
 Inflation is projected to fall below 2 per cent in 2010, before gradually moving up towards the target towards the end of the projection period as the output gap gradually closes. There is a risk that the structural changes brought about by the crisis may result in persistently lower productivity growth. It appears that inflation will remain considerably lower in the years ahead than we expected in December. Both the objective of stabilising inflation around the target and the objective of ensuring stable developments in the real economy suggest that the interest rate should be low.  Interest rate setting can also be assessed using simple monetary policy rules that prescribe an interest rate path based on actual inflation and output. The calculations are based on projections for inflation and output in the current Monetary Policy Report. The different rules yield somewhat divergent results, but all of them indicate a decline in the interest rate. Rules do not capture possible restrictions in the supply of credit that may affect the monetary policy transmission mechanism.  12 BIS Review 37/2009 
   Norges Bank has estimated a simple interest rate rule based on the Bank’s previous interest rate setting.5 The rule includes developments in inflation, wage growth, mainland GDP and central bank key rates abroad. The interest rate in the previous period is also important. The key rate is now below the lower end of the interval projected. Norges Bank has given weight to staving off particularly adverse outcomes and therefore brought forward the decrease in the key policy rate last autumn.   The projections for the key rate, inflation, output and other variables are based on our assessment of the economic situation and our perception of the functioning of the economy and monetary policy. If economic developments are broadly in line with our projections,                                                  5  See Staff Memo 2008/3 from Norges Bank. BIS Review 37/2009 13 
economic agents can expect that the interest rate path will also be approximately in line with that projected. On the other hand, the interest rate path may shift if the economic prospects change, or if the effect of interest rate changes on inflation, output and employment differs from that assumed. In the Monetary Policy Report, we present two alternative scenarios where demand is higher or lower than presented in the baseline scenario. The yellow lines in the chart illustrate a scenario where growth in private consumption is stronger than expected and the turnaround occurs more rapidly. In this scenario, interest rates may decrease to a lesser extent and move up more quickly.  The red lines in the chart illustrate a scenario where the global downturn is deeper and more prolonged, with more pronounced effects than assumed. It will then be appropriate to set a lower interest rate in order to stimulate the economy and thereby prevent inflation from becoming too low.  The primary effect of a key rate close to zero will probably come via a weaker krone. It will then be appropriate to consider instruments other than the interest rate.  Monetary policy normally operates by lowering key rates to reduce the real interest rate when expected inflation and market risk premiums are stable in the short term. When the key rate moves close to its lower bound, the real interest rate can still be influenced through key rate expectations, influencing risk premiums and anchoring inflation expectations. The expectations channel will be particularly important if the current key rate cannot be further reduced.  For Norges Bank, the expectations channel is an established part of monetary policy in that we provide forecasts for the key policy rate.  To sum up, it is useful to decompose the factors behind the change in the interest rate path since 17 December 2008. The interest rate forecast in the Monetary Policy Report is lower than the forecast published in December last year.  The outlook for global growth has deteriorated further. The slowdown in the Norwegian economy appears to be more pronounced than expected in December. Lower global and domestic demand would suggest a lower key policy rate than projected in December.  Our inflation forecast, along with the stronger krone and lower key rate expectations abroad also suggests a lower key policy rate than projected at that time. 14 BIS Review 37/2009 
  Let me conclude. Monetary policy cannot fine-tune developments in the economy, but it can mitigate the largest effects when the economy is exposed to shocks. Overall, the outlook and the balance of risks suggest that the key rate should be gradually reduced further. The key policy rate should be in the interval 1-2 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 17 June 2009, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks.  Thank you for your attention. BIS Review 37/2009 15 
Jean-Pierre Landau: Bubbles and macro prudential supervision Remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Landau, Deputy Governor of the Bank of France1, at the Joint conference on “The Future of Financial Regulation”, organised by the Bank of France and the Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), Paris, 28 January 2009. *      *      * Looking at the future of financial regulation is specially challenging in the current juncture. Right in the midst of the crisis, we cannot be sure that we fully understand its ultimate causes, its roots, and its dynamics. Furthermore, we do not want to be fighting the last war. We need a vision on how the financial system will evolve in the future, something very difficult to figure out right now. And yet, there is a strong political demand for orientations and measures to fix the problems and make sure they never happen again. This demand is fully legitimate, considering the social costs that the crisis is imposing on our societies, and more specifically, the financial burden taken on by tax payers.  I have chosen to present some remarks on bubbles and macro prudential supervision. They should be seen more as a work program than a full-fledged answer to the many questions raised for the future. I will deal with three issues: what are we trying to achieve? What are the main challenges? Which are the proper instruments? What are we trying to achieve? Here, we have two certainties, and many questions. First, we know for sure that macro prudential supervision is preemptive by nature. It aims to avoid crises because crises are costly. Second, a macro approach to financial supervision must encompass the whole financial system as opposed to any specific or individual institution. Beyond that, things become more complicated. Macrosupervision is often assimilated to preventing systemic risk. These are closely related, but not identical concepts. Systemic risk refers to the internal dynamics of the financial system; whereas, macroprudential supervision is mainly concerned with its interaction with the real economy. Occurrence of systemic risk can harm the financial system; but not always, and not necessarily, the real economy. On the other hand, there are cases where a (temporarily) healthy system, with no obvious systemic problems, may behave in a way which in the long run, is very detrimental to the real economy: a typical example being the expansion of balance sheets and credit which, by itself, does not threaten the short term resilience of the system but is potentially damaging. Conversely, deleveraging from excessive levels of debt may be good from a systemic point of view, but, if done in abrupt manner, could create enormous pressures on the real side. So, while a healthy and resilient system may be a necessary condition, it is not clear that it is a sufficient one to achieve appropriate macroprudential objectives.  Should macroprudential supervision aim at avoiding or dampening volatility in the financial system? Financial stability is not an end in itself. It only helps if it is conducive to better macroeconomic performance. Volatility may be driven by fundamentals. Sharp movements in asset prices may help the financial system to serve as a cushion, an "absorber" for exogenous economic shocks. This is welfare improving since it avoids, or mitigates, adjustment in more rigid goods of labor markets.                                                  1 I am indebted to Benoit Mojon for many useful suggestions and remarks. All remaining mistakes are mine. Opinions expressed are purely personal and do not necessarily reflect the positions of the Banque de France. BIS Review 37/2009 1 
By the same token, not all procyclicality is bad. It all depends on the causal link: is the financial system the origin or the amplifier of destabilizing dynamics? Or does it simply react to cyclical evolutions in the real economy? We should only be concerned by "intrinsic procyclicality", which is created inside and by the financial system. Finally, cyclicality in the real economy can be beneficial to long term growth as it is one mechanism through which "creative destruction" can take place in the productive system.  Real and significant damages occur if and when financial imbalances are allowed to build for a long time with two consequences: first asset prices significantly deviate from their fundamental value, which creates distortions in the allocation of resources; and second, those imbalances unwind suddenly and abruptly, triggering major disruptions in growth and the economic cycle. This is what is happening right now. And this closely resembles the definition of a bubble. This clearly points to one possible mandate for macroprudential supervision that, it were feasible, would be both pragmatic and legitimate: to avoid bubbles. Bubbles are not always triggered within the financial system. They may have roots in productivity shocks, for instance. But they cannot develop unless permissive financial conditions prevail. There are good reasons to prevent bubbles. They impose significant costs on the real economy. They may place an undue burden on monetary policy. They raise important questions of fairness in the distribution of income.  Such a simple definition of the objective of macroprudential supervision is quite attractive. However, simplicity comes at a price. Avoiding bubbles present enormous challenges, to which I turn now.  The challenges of macroprudential supervision Analytical challenges The first – and most important – challenge is analytical.  Bubbles are difficult to detect. Asset price boom-bust cycles become clearly apparent only after the event. Moreover there is little regularity in the business cycle, which makes it difficult to identify with certainty long lasting deviations of asset prices from fundamentals. Looking at the path of asset prices, how do we know ex ante if we are confronted with an inflexion in the trend, a one-step adjustment in equilibrium levels, or the start of a bubble? There is no simple or mechanical answer to that question. This is one of the reasons why "early warning" mechanisms have not really worked.  While bubbles are hard to detect, we nevertheless know from the repetition of financial crises through history – including the current crisis – that the economy is always subject to the risk of a new bubble. Given this risk, we ought to reflect on the features of financial systems that may create bubbles and allow them to develop to proportions that threaten economic welfare.  We know a few things about the procyclical characteristics of the financial system. Our accounting and prudential regimes may have increased procyclicality in recent years. In a mark to market environment, asset prices movements quickly translate into changes in the capital base of financial institutions. This, in turn, triggers additional demand for assets and a further increase in their prices. This kind of "inverted demand curve"; where demand increases with prices, may create the conditions for a bubble. But it does not have to.  Strictly speaking, procyclicality refers to bigger amplitudes of fluctuations around a trend. But a bubble may induce deviations that are so long lasting that we start wondering about the trend itself. Whether wider fluctuations in prices will lead to lasting deviations is uncertain. We have good insights on the dynamics of a bubble, once it develops. But we do not know much about what actually starts a bubble, and this is a crucial point.  2 BIS Review 37/2009 
So there needs to be a rule guiding macroprudential decisions knowing that we have to live with this uncertainty. Actually, such a rule may exist, but implicitly. The prudential apparatus has worked in the past on the presumption that all movements in asset prices were based on fundamentals. The burden of the proof was on those who thought that something was going wrong. And, of course, it is impossible to prove the existence of a bubble until it is too late. And, at least in the initial phase of a bubble, there is no lack of rational explanations for observed movements in asset prices. It may be useful, in a macroprudential perspective, to consider some rebalancing in the burden of the proof. Significant and lasting departures from past levels or trends in key asset prices, risk premia or credit aggregates should systematically trigger a macroprudential review, with the implicit assumption that a bubble may be occurring unless proved otherwise. This seems to me justified when looking at the current social costs of previous hesitation. This is also a rational course of action. Bubbles develop because investors have an incentive to ignore the "tail risk" that the bubble may burst. Where does this incentive come from? Bubbles are mostly financed by credit, which makes it possible for investors to shift most of the risk to lenders, while keeping most of the profits for themselves (especially when those profits are booked, and distributed, in real time). This asymmetry in incentives is extremely difficult to eliminate ex ante. To make sure that bubbles never happen, one may need to impose permanently significant constraints on the development of credit or leverage, which would prove penalizing in normal times. A better – and less costly – approach would be, for supervisors, to closely monitor the financial system and preserve their possibility to intervene by establishing the kind of presumption I have just mentioned.  Two approaches to macroprudential supervision As in many matters of public policy, there is a choice between rules and discretion in implementing macrofinancial supervision. There are basically two possibilities, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  First, (the rule based approach), macrosupervision can be built through automatic stabilizers which would constrain institutions in their behaviour, regardless of their own individual situations. Examples would include contra cyclical capital requirements, for instance, as well as dynamic provisioning. As I will develop later, stabilizers should be constructed so as to act directly on the incentive to take risk and the rewards provided by risk taking. A second approach would consist on discretionary, "top down" interventions from macroauthorities. Prudential authorities would step in and impose (or relax) constraints whenever they come to the conclusion that dangerous imbalances are building up (or unwinding). We probably cannot dispense of this second approach. The difficulty to date cycles makes it dangerous to rely purely on automatic mechanisms, which cannot be precisely calibrated. Financial cycles, in particular, are driven by changes in risk appetite which are impossible to predict. Actually, one essential objective of macroprudential supervision may be to "regulate" (not in the legal sense, but economically) the aggregate level of risk appetite inside the financial system. This unavoidably involves some degree of discretionary judgement and intervention. Combining the two components of macrosupervision (systemic and macroeconomic) with the two approaches (automatic and discretionary) produces an interesting classification, which is presented in the table below:    BIS Review 37/2009 3 
       Mechanisms   Systemic risk   Adjustment to macroconditions   Purpose Automatic • buffers (capital and/or liquidity) • Loan to Value ratios • accounting framework • time varying capital ratios • dynamic provisioning   Discretionary    • stress tests • discretionary adjustments to capital ratios, provisions or margin requirements • pillar II of Basel 2   Institutional challenges  The discretionary approach to macrosupervision raises important institutional issues. First, who makes the judgment? And should that body be independent or not? There is a good case for putting Central Banks in charge. If one takes an historical perspective, it is striking that the mandates and missions of Central Banks have taken major turns following financial crises. Central Banks have an informational advantage (or at least no disadvantage) in judging the cyclical position. They have an incentive to act, because macroprudential supervision alleviates the burden on monetary policy, and because they need monetary transmission mechanisms to work. So they clearly should have a pivotal role in the process. But they are not alone in caring about financial stability. And experience has shown that price stability – their primary mandate – does not always coincide with financial stability and the avoidance of bubbles.  Furthermore, in an integrated financial system, judgments have to be made on a worldwide basis. Another alternative is the IMF. But the IMF is mostly controlled by governments and decisions are made according to voting shares. Implementing macrosupervision will involve delicate decisions (like strengthening lending standards in good times) to which governments may not spontaneously agree. A fully independent body would certainly be necessary.  Second, how is that judgment passed on to regulators and supervisors and translated into supervisory decisions. This is totally unchartered territory. I would just mention it as a matter for future research in the governance of the financial system.  The instruments  The most important instrument in our current toolkit are capital requirements put on some financial intermediaries.  Those capital requirements perform a dual function. They act as compulsory buffers imposed on banks and their shareholders. They also have an incentive function: to prevent 4 BIS Review 37/2009 
shareholders from taking too much risk with deposits. It has proven more and more difficult to reconcile those two objectives. In theory it could be done, just as taxes can be used both to raise revenues and allocate resources. But, in practice, they both may be lost into an increasingly complex system.  In addition, capital requirements may not be binding when they need to. If assets market are booming and perceived returns are high, banks will always find the necessary capital. Conversely, capital dries up during downturns, when it is most necessary. Introducing counter cyclical capital requirements will certainly help. But we may not have looked enough into the interrelated dynamics of stock and credit markets; or, put differently, on how capital flows in and out of the financial sector during different phases of the economic cycle and what are the consequences on credit flows. Finally, tailoring capital requirements to the definition of economic capital by banks themselves strengthens the incentive function. But from, a macroprudential perspective, by replicating closely private risk management methods and metrics, this encourages uniformity in behaviour, which, by itself, is a source of instability.  It is becoming increasingly clear, it seems to me, that if we want prudential supervision to effectively pre-empt the build up of imbalances, it has to act more directly on individual and collective incentives. This should push us to look more closely at the "accounting-compensation" nexus. When looking at revenues drawn from a financial investment, it is generally impossible to distinguish excess return from additional risk taking. Ignorance of tail risk fits perfectly in this framework. This points to a possible solution: regulatory systems should force the pricing of risk in all its dimensions, including liquidity risk. Again, there is a clear analogy with tax theory: "internalizing" the risk eliminates market failures. The conceptual challenges in quantifying, for instance, liquidity risk, are enormous. But we live in a world of second best, and even very approximate measures would do better than nothing at all.  I will stop here, knowing, once again, that I have raised more questions than I have provided answers. But looking at what is happening in this very moment, in our economies, it is necessary to think "out of the box" and look at all possibilities. Those in charge of macroeconomic policies are doing just that. Those responsible for financial regulation should not hesitate to emulate them, at least partially.  Thank you for your attention.

Glenn Stevens: Public policy and the payments system Text by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, of the Third Annual Ian Little Memorial Lecture, Melbourne, 25 March 2009. *      *      * Introduction It is a great pleasure to be here in Melbourne to deliver the Ian Little Memorial Lecture. I worked with Ian when we were both young recruits in the Research Department of the Reserve Bank in the early 1980s. I remember an easygoing young man with a cheerful disposition, and a mop of curly dark hair. Even then, Ian was a clear thinker with a strong commitment to good public policy. So it was not really surprising that, having left the Reserve Bank in the late 1980s and succeeded in the private sector, he returned to public service in the Victorian Department of Treasury. In that role, as many of you here know better than I do, he shone. I would occasionally run into Ian at conferences and he would always impress on me, a macroeconomist working in the central bank, the need to acknowledge the importance of microeconomic policy reforms in bettering economic performance. It is a simple, but important, point. While macroeconomic policies are to the fore right now around the world, as governments and central banks seek to foster recovery from recession, in the long term our living standards depend more on innovation and productivity, and less on the manipulation of interest rates or aggregate spending decisions by governments, than common discussion often admits. Real prosperity depends critically on the supply side of the economy – the realm of microeconomic policies. It is in that spirit that I wish to speak today about something that I have not addressed in public before, namely, the payments system. Although the Reserve Bank is best known for its macroeconomic policy responsibilities, it has, in fact, an important microeconomic responsibility, namely, the competitiveness and efficiency of the payments system, including at the retail level. This obligation was given to the Payments System Board of the Reserve Bank, as a result of the Wallis Committee process in the mid 1990s – hence, my topic this evening. Motivation We might begin by asking: why is an efficient payments system important? The answer is that the payments system facilitates all economic and financial activity, whether it be the day-to-day payments that you and I make, payments between businesses or transactions in financial assets. There are around 18 million transactions in Australia every day, with a value of around $230 billion. With so many payments, even relatively small inefficiencies can potentially have significant implications for the costs of the payments system. Part of the Reserve Bank’s job, therefore, is to promote efficient arrangements in the payment system in the interest of the broader economy. Earlier reforms to the high-value payment system improved efficiency and safety, but in the retail payment area, progress has been slower. In fulfilling its responsibilities over the past 10 years, the Reserve Bank has in some fairly high-profile instances ultimately resorted to regulation. This has not been because we have had a strong predilection for regulatory solutions. On the contrary, the Reserve Bank has usually first sought to achieve improvements in competition and efficiency without direct regulation. In particular, it has sought to encourage the players in the payments space to identify potential improvements and to undertake reforms to achieve these. But such BIS Review 36/2009 1 
industry-led reforms have sometimes been difficult to achieve, and so the Reserve Bank has ultimately been required to take a stronger role, including by regulating.  I want to examine why this is the case, both at a general level and by reference to a recent example. These observations are framed by the particular challenges the Reserve Bank has faced in promoting competition and efficiency in the payments system, but the conclusions apply to a number of other areas where regulators are working to spur improvements in efficiency and productivity. Co-operation and competition in networks In payment systems, as with other networks, a certain amount of co-operation between participants is needed to ensure that the system provides benefits to users. For example, when you or I purchase something at a retailer, it should not matter with whom the retailer banks, or with whom you or I bank. We expect to be able to rely on the banking system to transfer money from us to the retailer. We expect that, when we pull out our debit or credit card to pay, it just works. That requires a detailed set of co-operative arrangements between financial institutions to accommodate payments between each other’s customers. These same institutions are also competing with each other, however, to attract customers. A common way to compete is to offer products or features not offered by one’s competitors. But if the ability to offer that new product relies on competitors making changes to their systems, innovation may be stymied. Why would other banks be willing to incur the costs of developing the relevant systems in order to help customers of their competitors? The tension between these two separate dynamics – the need for co-operation and the impulse to competition – means that the industry may have difficulty taking decisions in the interests of the system as a whole, and of the community more broadly. In such circumstances, someone – an industry group or a regulator – may need to play a co ordinating role, to encourage improvements in the common infrastructure that benefit all, while still allowing competitive forces between the banks to ensure that the new products are priced competitively and packaged to meet customers’ needs. Of course, these issues are neither new nor unique to the payments industry. It is well accepted in the economic literature that in industries that rely on networks of infrastructure (so-called “network industries”) there is an incentive to co-operate in order to gain efficiencies, but a socially optimal level of co-operation might not be achieved.  One illustration of this point which has been cited in the network literature is the development of the rail network in the United States in the 19th century.1The early US railway system consisted of a large number of individual links between pairs of destinations, often on different track gauges and designs. There was a clear public (and private) benefit in linking these “networks” to allow goods or passengers to cross efficiently from one railway to another. But, nonetheless, railways were often designed to be incompatible, so as to prevent competitors from siphoning off traffic. Eventually, the commercial logic for some degree of co-operation was sufficient to ensure that standardisation occurred and this brought with it large productivity gains. For instance, in the space of a decade, the time for shipment of goods by rail from Philadelphia to Chicago was reduced from nine weeks to three days.2 Despite these pay offs, standardisation was                                                  1  Carlton DW and JM Klamer (1983), “The Need for Coordination among Firms, with Special Reference to Network Industries”, The University of Chicago Law Review, 50(2), pp 446-465. 2  See Carlton and Klamer (1983), p 455. 2 BIS Review 36/2009 
still not complete. In fact, the only way railways could reach an optimal level of standardisation was horizontal integration – merging competing railways. While all this sounds a million miles away from Australia’s payments system in the 21st century, the parallels are quite strong. For example, like the linking of the railways, the realisation that a single, interconnected EFTPOS system was more valuable than a number of individual EFTPOS systems that could not talk to one another drove co operation and standardisation quite early in the development of that system. But despite the benefits that brought, co operation, standardisation and innovation in Australia’s EFTPOS system have not progressed as far as is desirable. The EFTPOS system has essentially remained unchanged since its establishment in the 1980s. The fact that the system is built on bilateral links between all the major participants means that there is no one standardised communications protocol between the participants. Furthermore, co operative efforts to innovate or upgrade the system are complicated because they require all bilateral relationships to be renegotiated. This is, in fact, a difficulty with many of Australia’s payment systems – they are based on bilateral links, with no established mechanism to foster improvements and expansion in the network. So left to their own devices, networks may stop short of an efficient level of co-operation. Incomplete standardisation may result, and innovation or movement from one standard to a superior one may be difficult because of co-ordination problems, even where the benefits to society outweigh the costs. The literature points to several reasons for this potential outcome, some of which are evident from the example I have already given.  The first is the classic economic externality. Firms within the network may be concerned that if they agree a common standard with a competitor, that competitor may be able to capture some of the benefits of moving to that standard. Why would I pay all the cost of converting my railway line to a gauge that can connect with another railway, when my competitor will gain as much of my rail traffic as I will of his? The implication is that competitors in a network might not individually make decisions that are optimal for the network as a whole. The second is the ineffectiveness of voluntary strategies for achieving co-operation in a network industry owned by competing firms. Establishment of industry bodies to agree standards is a common approach, but the success of these bodies has been mixed. Agreement tends to be delayed where there are vested interests and, in some cases, non standardisation is used as a barrier to entry by competitors.3  Third, there is often a tendency towards “excess inertia” in standards.4 Problems with co-ordinating the movement from an old standard to a superior standard (such as the movement to new system architecture in a payment system) may mean that the movement does not occur, or occurs very slowly, even where the benefits to society outweigh the costs of switching. These co ordination problems may be caused by an uneven distribution of the costs and benefits of switching standards, or by uncertainty regarding the movement of rival firms to the new standard.5                                                 3  For example, see David P and S Greenstein (1990), “The Economics of Compatibility Standards: An Introduction to Recent Research”, Economics of Innovation and New Technology, 1(1), pp 3-41; Farrel J and P Klemperer (2007), “Co-ordination and Lock-in: Competition with Switching Costs and Network Effects”, in M Armstrong and R Porter (eds), Handbook of Industrial Organization, Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp 1967-2072; and for the Australian context, Lowe P (2005), “Innovation and Governance of Payment Systems”, Address to Banktech.05 Conference, Sydney, 16 September. 4  For example, see Farrel and Klemperer (2007). 5  There can also be, in some cases, a tendency towards overly rapid changes in standards (so called “excess momentum”), which can lead to the premature adoption of a new standard that is less efficient than the old standard. Further, those who benefit disproportionately from a change to a new standard will fail to consider BIS Review 36/2009 3 
A recent Australian example From first principles, therefore, we might expect that achieving agreement among Australian financial institutions on development of the payments system might not be easy. So it has proved. There are a number of examples of this, but a recent one is the efforts by the industry at reform of the ATM system. As you may be aware, there have recently been some changes to the way ATM transactions at machines not owned by your bank are priced and paid for. Instead of paying a relatively obscure “foreign ATM fee”, that was charged to your bank account at the end of the month, people are now presented with the cost of the transaction in real time. These changes will, in our view, allow competitive forces to come into play in a way that was previously impossible. But it is the process of achieving the reforms, more than the likely benefits, on which I want to focus this evening. In particular, it required changes in the bilateral links between all the major players in the system. In this sense, the problems were akin to those of the US railway system – how do we get all the competitors to agree to change their bilateral links in a standardised way?  Work by the industry on the reforms started as long ago as 2001. While some progress was made over the next few years, participants ultimately could not agree and asked the Payments System Board for guidance on the way forward. Finally, after much cajoling by the Reserve Bank, the new arrangements were implemented earlier this month – some eight years after discussions on the issue commenced. Ironically, the package implemented differs very little from the proposal put forward by the industry group itself in 2004, which was subsequently abandoned owing to irreconcilable differences between some of the parties. Moreover, despite a firm desire by the industry to implement the new arrangements without Reserve Bank intervention, the industry ultimately asked the Reserve Bank to use its powers to help finalise the process. This is not a unique example. Reforms to most of Australia’s payment systems including cheques, direct entry and EFTPOS faced similar challenges. As we have seen, this is not altogether surprising given the network nature of the payments system and the number of players which must co-operate, but also compete. The bilateral architecture that I have already mentioned is also a difficulty. Every large bank has an agreement with every other large bank about how to handle payments from one another’s customers. The more banks there are, the more agreements are necessary and the more complicated the system becomes. To use the railway line analogy, the more customised tracks are built, the more difficult the task of ultimately converting all tracks to a standard gauge. This has two implications. First, while these bilateral agreements can be helpful in getting a system started initially, and may subsequently work well for those already in the system, potential new entrants face the prospect of negotiating numerous different connections. This can act as a barrier to entry, inhibiting competition. Second, because upgrading the network requires participants to agree, since they all must make changes, each participant therefore can effectively veto, or at least delay, any decisions affecting the network. Because different participants have different technology cycles and different strategic interests, there is a high probability that some participants will be unwilling to proceed at any given point in time. If a participant thinks a particular change may provide another participant with a potential competitive advantage, it will probably attempt to delay. Indeed, if one participant sees a potential competitive advantage in a                                                                                                                                                       the loss of network benefits to those who are reluctant or late to change, and these participants may end up remaining on the old standard with a reduced network. See Farrel and Klemperer (2007). 4 BIS Review 36/2009 
change, it is almost guaranteed that another will see a disadvantage and, therefore, seek to block the change. This results in a significant co ordination problem for the industry.  The result is that, in the underlying architecture of the Australian payments system, very little has changed over the past 20 or 30 years, even though technology has evolved in the quarter of a century since the technology underlying the ATM and EFTPOS systems was first established. So while the payments system infrastructure has served Australia well, pressures for change are building. The network structure needs to be updated and services to customers are starting to fall behind those available in other countries. In the past, the Reserve Bank has identified real-time internet payments, business-to-business payments and online payment mechanisms as examples where progress has been made overseas but not, to date, in Australia. The resulting co-ordination challenges were very evident in the process of reform in the ATM system. With each of the parties having different objectives, consensus was hard to achieve. For example, small institutions would only consider a system that allowed them to form fee-free networks among themselves – otherwise they would be at a competitive disadvantage to the big banks with their large ATM networks. But larger institutions saw an opportunity to obtain a competitive advantage if smaller institutions could not form larger fee-free networks. There was also reluctance to liberalise access to the system. While improved access would serve to increase the benefits of the system as a whole and therefore the participants collectively, each bank tended to focus on the costs it would bear individually as well as the competition it would face. In short, there were problems because there was no participant in the system thinking of the benefit to the system as a whole with the power to effect change. Now in many countries, this role is handled by a single private sector entity that manages a system or systems. For example, the credit card schemes have a central body responsible for governance, innovation and promotion. Their incentive is to do things that expand the network, making its use easier and more attractive and increasing the number of participants. They have, in effect, internalised some of the externalities inherent in the network. While the credit card systems have had other elements that unduly limited competition in some respects, the centralised approach is arguably superior for network innovation and growth. That central body can determine standards and co-ordinate change. These arrangements are also more access-friendly in that a new entrant need only establish one, standardised connection to the system. Some private payment systems in other countries have such an entity – for example, LINK which manages the ATM system in the United Kingdom, Interac which manages the equivalent of the EFTPOS and ATM systems in Canada, and Paymark which manages New Zealand’s EFTPOS network. But that entity is missing in Australian payment systems. What role for public policy? These considerations all suggest that there is an important potential role for public policy in promoting change in the payments system. While the academic literature is divided generally on the role of regulation in network industries, there seems to be support for careful regulatory intervention in industries with competing network components where sufficient standardisation or a move between standards cannot be achieved in a timely manner. There also seems to be considerable sense in having an entity with responsibility to consider the interests of the system (and society) as a whole and the power to achieve reform to that end. Indeed, the need to have a body responsible for promoting the public interest through competition and efficiency in the payments system was recognised by the Wallis Committee over a decade ago. It led directly to the establishment of the Payments System Board at the Reserve Bank and the granting of its current statutory goals and powers. The fact that the central bank fulfils this oversight role in Australia is unusual internationally – in many countries, issues of competition in, and efficiency of, payment systems fall to competition authorities. But it is nevertheless common to find structures in place in network BIS Review 36/2009 5 
industries to assist in promoting access and the efficient setting of standards – whether this is a body that merely assists with co-ordination or one that has powers to enforce or perhaps set standards. We see this in network industries in Australia, such as telecommunications, electricity and ports, where there is frequently some sort of public body with oversight of the network, perhaps operating in conjunction with an industry body or bodies.  Of course, such bodies should not take a decision to regulate hastily. In most cases, a graduated approach to regulation in these areas is pursued, reflecting a reluctance to assume that a regulatory solution is necessarily superior, or that the government would necessarily be able to choose the best standard, particularly in a highly technical or rapidly changing field. The typical approach of network regulators is to prefer a co operative industry approach to standard setting, to provide some suasion where this process is unsuccessful, but ultimately to set standards if necessary. Where intervention is required, the academic literature suggests that we might look first of all to ensure compatibility between competing standards – for instance, by rules governing access and interconnection between competing networks – before setting detailed standards themselves. So there is not a presumption that a black-letter regulatory solution will be adopted. In fact, at the time that the current regulatory arrangements for Australia’s payment systems were established, there was an expectation that a co-regulatory model would be followed. In this view, industry would progress reform for the most part and the Reserve Bank’s powers would be used only occasionally, as a last resort, where reform could not otherwise be achieved. As it has turned out, however, the Reserve Bank’s powers have had to be used more often than I suspect was initially imagined. The Reserve Bank always explores ways that its statutory goals of competition and efficiency in the payments system can be achieved without resorting to its direct regulatory powers. But the history of the ATM reforms demonstrates how difficult it is for pure industry-based reform to move ahead without at least some push from a public policy body.  Possible approaches Reflecting on that experience then, and looking to the future, the question is how best to strike the balance and to facilitate reform most effectively. There are a few possible approaches – each one more interventionist than the previous one. First, the Reserve Bank could agree targets and timelines with the industry, but without any explicit regulation or penalty for failure to meet those targets. This approach is similar to the approach that the existing industry payments body, the Australian Payments Clearing Association (APCA), takes with many of its projects. Provided agreement on the need for change can be reached (no small achievement), APCA plays a co-ordinating role in organising a project plan, providing some resources and setting timelines and targets, though in the past these projects have tended to focus on technical issues rather than strategic directions.  In the absence of agreement on the need for change, however, industry-based projects – which, after all, rely on mutual agreement – tend not to proceed sufficiently quickly. That observation leads to the second option – the possibility of the Reserve Bank using overt regulation may be enough to forge agreement among industry participants. This is the path that was predominantly followed in progressing reform of the ATM system, and in a number of other reforms to the payments system. Where industry agreement on an issue was not forthcoming, the Reserve Bank has engaged the various sides to seek a solution with the clear possibility that it might regulate if agreement could not be reached. This approach was essentially behind the establishment of the Payments Council in the United Kingdom, and the 6 BIS Review 36/2009 
development of the UK’s “Faster Payments”6 – both of these initiatives were undertaken with the knowledge that, were something not done, there would be official intervention. While this can work, and emphasises the co ordination role that the Reserve Bank can play in the industry, the experience with the ATM system suggests that it still may be a drawn-out process. Individual participants with a preference for the status quo have no incentive to push the plan along and so it relies on the Reserve Bank setting a timetable for agreement and implementation – a timetable that is invariably argued to be “challenging”. A third, more intrusive, option is for the Reserve Bank to set explicit standards – what may be viewed as more traditional regulation. This is the approach that was taken when dealing with the credit card schemes, where the Reserve Bank set a number of standards dealing with the level of interchange fees and the imposition of surcharges. This approach could, however, also be used to achieve industry co-ordination around technical issues. For example, the Reserve Bank could set technical standards where the industry has been unable to agree on a common standard itself. Such an approach may yet become relevant in Australia’s electronic payments system, especially where co-ordination problems are inhibiting innovation. As an example, some have suggested that the Reserve Bank could play a role in the further development of the EFTPOS system. The system was designed originally to transfer money from consumer accounts to merchant accounts. These transfers are initiated when an EFTPOS card is swiped through a merchant’s terminal and the impact on the customer’s account is immediate. In recent years, however, there has been demand to use the system in a different way, to send payments into consumers’ accounts in real time. These demands flowed initially from the government looking to ensure benefit payments reach recipients as quickly as possible – for example, when providing emergency funds after a natural disaster. The EFTPOS system at present can accommodate these sorts of payments only in a limited way. While some participants in the industry have seen benefit in expanding the EFTPOS message format to enable such transactions, there has been limited progress. A requirement by the Reserve Bank that all participants in the industry be able to accept instructions conforming to a common message standard would facilitate access by new entrants, and thus competition. If the Reserve Bank chose to require use of an international standard, that could also facilitate more competition from overseas providers of payment related services. A mandate from the Reserve Bank that EFTPOS message formats must be able to support credit transactions might likewise lay the foundation for innovation in the EFTPOS system based on these transactions more quickly than the industry might be able to achieve by itself. Notwithstanding its regulations with respect to card payment systems, the Reserve Bank has in the past preferred the first two of the above options. This is particularly the case with respect to issues relating to technical standards and system architecture, where the Reserve Bank has on occasion raised the issues but left the industry to drive reforms. We remain conscious of the risks that public intervention itself may be an impediment to innovation. As we have said a number of times, our hope is that the industry will deal with these issues itself. But we also know that if the industry fails to push ahead with improvements to the system, Australians will be denied the full benefits of a modern retail payments system. To a large extent, the future approach of the Payments System Board depends on the behaviour of industry participants. If industry agreement on further reforms can be reached relatively quickly, then the need for the Reserve Bank’s co-ordinating role to be interventionist is limited. On the other hand, if, as on some past occasions, the industry is unable to carry forward reform and innovation by itself, the Reserve Bank would consider making more extensive use of the tools at its disposal.                                                   6  “Faster Payments” is a system to allow internet banking payments to be made in close to real time. BIS Review 36/2009 7 
Conclusion The economics of networks are complex, and the role of public policy is a delicate one. The aim is to ensure, as far as we can, that the correct balance is struck between the need for co-operation and the benefits of competition. Co-operation is required in order to ensure that the benefits of an extensive, and reasonably standardised, network can be enjoyed by the public, raising economic welfare. Competition is vital in the long run to make sure that costs are minimised and the incentive to respond to changing consumer preferences maximised. Policy has to recognise and fulfil its role in dealing with the externalities inherent in the set of decisions made by private market participants, while also respecting and maintaining the competitive dynamic. We recognise that the roles of the industry participants and the regulator are mutually interdependent. We trust that the industry does too. The Payments System Board is content to confine itself to encouraging industry solutions and being the occasional catalyst for agreement among the parties, where that achieves the goals the Board has been given. But it is and must be also prepared, if needed, to use regulatory powers more forcefully. In judging which approach is preferred, we will respond to the industry’s behaviour, just as they respond to ours. The approach we adopt in any instance has to be tailored to the circumstances and we will ourselves on occasion need to innovate. What will be constant is the set of statutory goals given to the Payments System Board – controlling risk, and promoting competition and efficiency in the payments system. The Payments System Board is committed to those objectives and will be pragmatic, but determined, in pursuing them. We look forward to effective engagement with the industry in the process. 8 BIS Review 36/2009 
Željko Rohatinski: Recent economic and financial developments in Croatia Address of Dr Željko Rohatinski, Governor of the Croation National Bank, at a press conference, Zagreb, 18 February 2009. *      *      * I am glad that you have responded to our invitation. At a similar gathering less than two months ago, we informed you about CNB's views of the then current economic situation and our preliminary expectations regarding trends in 2009. In the interim, some of our assumptions have proved to be correct and the CNB has taken, and will continue to take, appropriate measures. Now I would first like to inform you about the measures taken, putting them in the context of wider international and domestic developments. The slowdown in economic growth, evident in the second and third quarters of 2008, in the fourth quarter virtually turned into stagnation at an annual level, so that – despite the annual growth rate of about 2.3 percent for 2008 as a whole – the slowdown in economic activity is obviously continuing into 2009. The two key problems in the Croatian economy, deteriorating over the years, have been seriously aggravated under such circumstances: the problem of the current account deficit, estimated at about EUR 4.5bn or 11 percent of GDP in 2008, and that of external debt, standing at EUR 39bn at the end of 2008 and accounting for 94 percent of GDP. These two major problems will determine general economic trends in 2009 as they represent the main challenge for overall economic policy. This policy will have to address the issue of preventing the escalation of their negative consequences against a background of the global financial and economic crisis, which is, in both its aspects, affecting Croatia as well. This policy will be faced with several serious limitations. The first is related to a drop in export demand, estimated at about 3 percent in the goods and services sector. The second involves a sharp decrease in foreign direct investments, due to the fact that not much is left to be sold following the privatisation of a share in Ina. The third limitation relates to a halt in the growth of foreign borrowing by enterprises, caused by the capital market contraction, and is further exacerbated by concerns about to what extent it will be possible to refinance their existing debt in 2009. The fourth limitation is posed by the high repayments of total external debt falling due this year, approximately amounting to EUR 12.8bn in principal and EUR 1bn in interest, which is about one third of GDP. This amount includes an approximate EUR 6bn in outstanding principal of enterprise and government debt. In consequence of these external limitations, import financing will be impossible to keep at the present level. Accordingly, we estimate a decrease of about 8 percent in imports, and of about 5 percent in imports excluding oil, which would also result in the current account deficit narrowing from about 11 percent of GDP in 2008 to 6-6.5 percent of GDP in 2009. Such a situation leaves little room for maneuver when it comes to deciding on the economic policy to be implemented in this year, and probably in the following year. This policy should be aimed at halting the growth of domestic consumption, changing its structure and creating savings at all levels. The previously-mentioned external limitations and such economic policy will inevitably produce a negative impact on economic growth and on the society as a whole. The main concern in this regard should not be about whether the GDP rate will be reduced by 1 or 2 or 3 percent, but about maintaining a healthy core of the economy and ensuring its financing and operation under these aggravated conditions. It need not be emphasised that the financial sector and its stability play a major role in this process. There are two parallel objectives that need to be achieved in order for this stability to be sustained: one is to maintain the country's external liquidity and the other is to maintain the stability of the exchange rate. These two objectives are interrelated and inseparable. A BIS Review 36/2009 1 
failure to achieve them would result in the activation of all types of risks: currency risk, credit risk, risk of a rating drop, risk related to the price increase and halted inflow of foreign currency funds, in short, of risks leading to the collapse of the financial system. There is no doubt that the normal functioning of the financial system would be undermined and that all the participants that directly or indirectly constitute this system, and have a major impact on its functioning, especially banks, would be affected. It is a well-known fact that banks in Croatia had good financial results at the end of 2008 and that they even outperformed their parent banks. Their rate of return on capital exceeded 10 percent and the capital adequacy ratio stood above 14 percent, which enabled them, and continues to enable them, to safely conduct their business operations. However, it is also the fact that their operating conditions have considerably changed and that this change is reflected on the possible modalities of their operation in 2009. The changed conditions include a decline in external financing and an increase in its costs, a rise in domestic foreign exchange demand and an increase in domestic borrowing requirements of the government, which will, in this way too, have to refinance the repayment of a portion of its external debt. This change in the conditions has also resulted in banks' efforts to influence, through proposed arrangements with the CNB and some other channels, some aspects of the central bank's monetary policy. During the negotiations between the Ministry of Finance and a bank consortium on the granting of a EUR 750m loan, banks caused an unprecedented situation, conditioning the granting of the loan upon four major changes to be made in the CNB's policy. These requirements were as follows: to abolish the limits imposed on credit growth, or to monitor this growth on the basis of original currencies in which loans are granted, to reduce the kuna allocated portion of reserve requirements from 75 to 50 percent, to ensure sufficient levels of kuna liquidity in order to constantly keep the money market interest rate below 10 percent, and to harmonise the central bank's exchange rate control mechanism with banks. I would like to clarify the background to these requests, not with an intention to criticise banks, but to explain which elements the central bank takes into account in defining and implementing its measures. Let me start with the statement, coming not only from the banking circles, that under the deteriorated foreign borrowing conditions there is no point in insisting on curbing the growth of banks' credit placements, especially in a situation when banks themselves are planning for the growth in 2009 to remain below the prescribed limits. Some were also of the opinion that some banks have to altogether cease lending because of the imposed limits. However, banks' household and corporate placements increased by 11.2 percent at the end of January this year relative to December 2007, which was the basis for the calculation pursuant to the decision to limit banks' placement growth. With the limit for growth set at 13 percent, banks in January had sufficient room for normal credit growth. The "catch" was, however, in the foreign currency clause, which, each time when the exchange rate depreciates to a more significant degree, increases the nominal value of loans and lowers the limits for banks. This is not a problem with loans indexed to the euro, as the kuna has depreciated versus the euro by only 0.7 percent in the past 13 months. However, it has depreciated by 12.3 percent against the Swiss franc, so that banks having a large share of loans indexed to the Swiss franc have found the limits "too low", and have also had to slow down their placement growth in order to avoid purchasing CNB bills. In this regard, I would like to stress that on several occasions in 2006 and 2007 we publicly warned against risks connected with loans indexed to the Swiss franc, both for clients and for commercial banks. Deputy Governor Vujčić spoke of it in the Parliament, but our warnings fell on deaf ears. Interests on these loans were lower than interests on other loans so demand grew. In the meantime, even with such low interest rates, due to the appreciation of the Swiss franc, the kuna value and repayments of these loans sizeably increased. As a result came the banks' wish to solve their limit problems by removing restrictions on placements and monitoring loans on the basis of their original currency. As regards this issue, the CNB cannot and will not do anything. We warned against the risks, all market 2 BIS Review 36/2009 
players were aware or should have been aware of this. They opted for such loans and are now faced with the consequences. Thus, we do not see any restrictions on the growth of total bank placements arising from the effects of regulation. Provided, of course, that the exchange rate remains stable. However, some banks seem not to share these expectations. Therefore, I think that recent references to the exchange rate depreciation as being very likely were aimed at stepping up banks' requests for removal of limits on placements. True, against strong depreciation, maintaining these limits could lead to a credit crunch in the country. But this is an unrealistic scenario. The second and the third bank requests relate to the increase in kuna liquidity, while in the background lurks their wish to ensure additional sources of liquidity for continued growth of their placements through intensified CNB issuing activities. This is irregardless of the fact that experience has shown that high kuna liquidity creates direct depreciation pressure on the kuna exchange rate. The last request, having to do with harmonised efforts of banks and the central bank in maintaining the exchange rate stability involved a scenario under which the CNB would close out banks' short position under a previously agreed exchange rate at the end of each business day. In other words, the stability of the exchange rate would be maintained solely at the expense of the central bank's foreign exchange reserves. The CNB, of course, did not concede to such request. It is good that the Ministry of Finance managed to secure a credit arrangement worth EUR 750m without attempts to exert pressure on the CNB. However, these elements are still present. As for the functioning of the banking system under these new circumstances, everything we know tells us that the stability of the financial system is imperative for maintaining a normal economic situation in the country and for the functioning of the economy as a whole. This necessarily presupposes the stability of the exchange rate as the key factor for price stability. All market participants must give their contribution, including commercial banks, not out of altruism but in their own best interest. Rising inflation, rising interest rates, the risk of loan repayment defaults, disturbances in external payments, if it comes to that, would all have significant adverse effects on the operation of banks. One only needs to recollect what happened in other countries, such as Hungary, not to mention any others, and the problems banks were faced with because of such disturbances. For this reason, we feel that banks in Croatia, regardless of being foreign-owned, cannot operate without taking account of the state of the economy, their clients and the financial system of the country as a whole. It is their interest that must prevail despite the problems faced by their parent banks. In this regard, we explained to Mr Pröll, the Austrian finance minister, that the CNB would not look favourably upon attempts to withdraw capital, deposits or pay out total accumulated profits, because that would destabilise the domestic banking system. In such a case, the CNB would be forced to undertake protective measures, regardless of thus connected risks. We received assurances that there would not be any withdrawals. The second imperative relates to foreign currency assets at commercial banks, that is, liquid foreign currency claims of EUR 7.6bn (roughly the amount of the CNB's net foreign currency reserves), which under the circumstances must be used for maintaining the stability of the financial system. In October, we repealed the marginal reserve requirement in the amount of EUR 460m, we introduced two changes in the system of currency allocation of the reserve requirement (effect: EUR 1.1bn) and we have recently lowered the minimum rate of foreign currency claims from 28.5 to 25 percent, thus releasing EUR 840m. Today we lowered this rate from 25 to 20 percent, releasing a further EUR 1.25bn. Our further activities will be aimed at direct interventions in the foreign exchange market: today we already sold EUR 185m in the foreign exchange market at the average foreign exchange rate of 7.44 kuna for one euro, while the value of the previous intervention was EUR 328m, which means that in the past three weeks more than half a billion euros was sold to banks. These interventions BIS Review 36/2009 3 
were aimed at preventing sudden short-term exchange rate fluctuations. However, foreign exchange interventions cannot remain the CNB's only instrument. Indirectly, we will influence the stability of the kuna exchange rate through kuna liquidity: today, for example, out of the HRK 8.5bn bids submitted at the repo auction, a half was accepted. Hence, we do not intend to change the decision limiting banks' placements growth and we expect the fiscal policy to do its part in preserving stability. We are aware that restrictive kuna liquidity policy leads to the growth of money market interest rates, but this growth does not need to be automatically transferred in the growth of interest rates on household and corporate loans. Still, objectively speaking, it would be difficult to expect interest rates to decline. This, however, does not mean that the CNB is socially insensitive. We feel that debtors are better protected by preventing the foreign exchange rate from depreciating than by preventing interest rate growth. Interest rates have gone up by one to two percentage points, while depreciation is spoken of in two digit numbers. I would like us to remember the 1990s when it was said that inflation of 15 percent a month was not the greatest evil our economy could face and that it would be sufficient only to index salaries, the exchange rate, and interest rates for the system to work. But then inflation soon reached 40 percent a month and the system collapsed. A similar thing would happen with the exchange rate. Once the genie is out of the bottle it is hard to put it back. In a situation like this, the exchange rate is either defended or let go. There is no in between. We all know where depreciation would take us. This is our view of the situation in 2009. Whether we will succeed in all our plans, we cannot guarantee. Great many things do not even depend on us, not even on the market players in Croatia but on external factors. In any case, we will do everything that is in our power to come out of this situation alive and with as few wounds as possible. 4 BIS Review 36/2009 
Ben S Bernanke: American International Group Testimony by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, 24 March 2009. *      *      * Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate having this opportunity to discuss the Federal Reserve's involvement with American International Group, Inc. (AIG). In my testimony, I will describe why supporting AIG was a difficult but necessary step to protect our economy and stabilize our financial system. I will also discuss issues related to compensation and note two matters raised by this experience that merit congressional attention.  Reasons for our original lending decision We at the Federal Reserve, working closely with the Treasury, made our decision to lend to AIG on September 16 of last year. It was an extraordinary time. Global financial markets were experiencing unprecedented strains and a worldwide loss of confidence. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been placed into conservatorship only two weeks earlier, and Lehman Brothers had filed for bankruptcy the day before. We were very concerned about a number of other major firms that were under intense stress. AIG's financial condition had been deteriorating for some time, caused by actual and expected losses on subprime mortgage-backed securities and on credit default swaps that AIG's Financial Products unit, AIG-FP, had written on mortgage-related securities. As confidence in the firm declined, and with efforts to find a private-sector solution unsuccessful, AIG faced severe liquidity pressures that threatened to force it imminently into bankruptcy. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury agreed that AIG's failure under the conditions then prevailing would have posed unacceptable risks for the global financial system and for our economy. Some of AIG's insurance subsidiaries, which are among the largest in the United States and the world, would have likely been put into rehabilitation by their regulators, leaving policyholders facing considerable uncertainty about the status of their claims. State and local government entities that had lent more than $10 billion to AIG would have suffered losses. Workers whose 401(k) plans had purchased $40 billion of insurance from AIG against the risk that their stable value funds would decline in value would have seen that insurance disappear. Global banks and investment banks would have suffered losses on loans and lines of credit to AIG, and on derivatives with AIG-FP. The banks' combined exposures exceeded $50 billion.1 Money market mutual funds and others that held AIG's roughly $20 billion of commercial paper would also have taken losses. In addition, AIG's insurance subsidiaries had substantial derivatives exposures to AIG-FP that could have weakened them in the event of the parent company's failure. Moreover, as the Lehman case clearly demonstrates, focusing on the direct effects of a default on AIG's counterparties understates the risks to the financial system as a whole. Once begun, a financial crisis can spread unpredictably. For example, Lehman's default on its commercial paper caused a prominent money market mutual fund to "break the buck" and                                                  1  In addition, many of these same banks had borrowed securities from AIG's securities lending program for which they had given AIG cash as collateral. Upon an AIG bankruptcy, the banks would have taken possession of the securities instead of receiving back their cash, exposing them to possible losses on those securities. BIS Review 35/2009 1 
suspend withdrawals, which in turn ignited a general run on prime money market mutual funds, with resulting severe stresses in the commercial paper market. As I mentioned, AIG had about $20 billion in commercial paper outstanding, so its failure would have exacerbated the problems of the money market mutual funds. Another worrisome possibility was that uncertainties about the safety of insurance products could have led to a run on the broader insurance industry by policyholders and creditors. Moreover, it was well known in the market that many major financial institutions had large exposures to AIG. Its failure would likely have led financial market participants to pull back even more from commercial and investment banks, and those institutions perceived as weaker would have faced escalating pressure. Recall that these events took place before the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which provided funds that the Treasury used to help stem a global banking panic in October. Consequently, it is unlikely that the failure of additional major firms could have been prevented in the wake of the failure of AIG. At best, the consequences of AIG's failure would have been a significant intensification of an already severe financial crisis and a further worsening of global economic conditions. Conceivably, its failure could have resulted in a 1930s-style global financial and economic meltdown, with catastrophic implications for production, income, and jobs. The decision by the Federal Reserve on September 16, 2008, with the full support of the Treasury, to lend up to $85 billion to AIG should be viewed with this background in mind. At that time, no federal entity could provide capital to stabilize AIG and no federal or state entity outside of a bankruptcy court could wind down AIG. Unfortunately, federal bankruptcy laws do not sufficiently protect the public's strong interest in ensuring the orderly resolution of nondepository financial institutions when a failure would pose substantial systemic risks, which is why I have called on the Congress to develop new emergency resolution procedures. However, the Federal Reserve did have the authority to lend on a fully secured basis, consistent with our emergency lending authority provided by the Congress and our responsibility as central bank to maintain financial stability. We took as collateral for our loan AIG's pledge of a substantial portion of its assets, including its ownership interests in its domestic and foreign insurance subsidiaries. This decision bought time for subsequent actions by the Congress, the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve that have avoided further failures of systemically important institutions and have supported improvements in key credit markets. The Federal Reserve's ongoing involvement with AIG Having lent AIG money to avert the risk of a global financial meltdown, we found ourselves in the uncomfortable situation of overseeing both the preservation of its value and its dismantling, a role quite different from our usual activities. We have devoted considerable resources to this effort and have engaged outside advisers. Using our rights as creditor, we have worked with AIG's new management team to begin the difficult process of winding down AIG-FP and to oversee the company's restructuring and divestiture strategy. Progress is being made on both fronts. However, financial turmoil and a worsening economy since September have contributed to large losses at the company, and the Federal Reserve has found it necessary to restructure and extend our support. In addition, under its Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the Treasury injected capital into AIG in both November and March. Throughout this difficult period, our goals have remained unchanged: to protect our economy and preserve financial stability, and to position AIG to repay the Federal Reserve and return the Treasury's investment as quickly as possible. In our role as creditor, we have made clear to AIG's management, beginning last fall, our deep concern surrounding compensation issues at AIG. We believe it is in the taxpayers' interest for AIG to retain qualified staff to maintain the value of the businesses that must be sold to repay the government's assistance. But, at the same time, the company must scrupulously avoid any excessive and unwarranted compensation. We have pressed AIG to ensure that all compensation decisions are covered by robust corporate governance, 2 BIS Review 35/2009 
including internal review, review by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and consultations with outside experts. Operating under this framework, AIG has voluntarily limited the salary, bonuses, and other types of compensation for 2008 and 2009 of the CEO and other senior managers. Moreover, executive compensation must comply with the most stringent set of rules promulgated by the Treasury for TARP fund recipients. The New York Attorney General has also imposed restrictions on compensation at AIG. Many of you have raised specific issues with regard to the payout of retention bonuses to employees at AIG-FP. My reaction upon becoming aware of these specific payments was that, notwithstanding the business purposes that might be served by this action, it was highly inappropriate to pay substantial bonuses to employees of the division that had been the primary source of AIG's collapse. I asked that the AIG-FP payments be stopped but was informed that they were mandated by contracts agreed to before the government's intervention. I then asked that suit be filed to prevent the payments. Legal staff counseled against this action, on the grounds that Connecticut law provides for substantial punitive damages if the suit would fail; legal action could thus have the perverse effect of doubling or tripling the financial benefits to the AIG-FP employees. I was also informed that the company had been instructed to pursue all available alternatives and that the Reserve Bank had conveyed the strong displeasure of the Federal Reserve with the retention payment arrangement. I strongly supported President Dudley's conveying that concern and directing the company to redouble its efforts to renegotiate all plans that could result in excessive bonus payments. I have also directed staff to work with the Treasury and the Administration in their review of whether the FP bonus and retention payments can be reclaimed. Moreover, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury will work closely together to monitor and address similar situations in the future. Lessons learned from AIG To conclude, I would note that AIG offers two clear lessons for the upcoming discussion in the Congress and elsewhere on regulatory reform. First, AIG highlights the urgent need for new resolution procedures for systemically important nonbank financial firms. If a federal agency had had such tools on September 16, they could have been used to put AIG into conservatorship or receivership, unwind it slowly, protect policyholders, and impose haircuts on creditors and counterparties as appropriate. That outcome would have been far preferable to the situation we find ourselves in now. Second, the AIG situation highlights the need for strong, effective consolidated supervision of all systemically important financial firms. AIG built up its concentrated exposure to the subprime mortgage market largely out of the sight of its functional regulators. More-effective supervision might have identified and blocked the extraordinarily reckless risk-taking at AIG-FP. These two changes could measurably reduce the likelihood of future episodes of systemic risk like the one we faced at AIG. BIS Review 35/2009 3 
Elizabeth A Duke: Credit availability and prudent lending standards Testimony of Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, 25 March 2009. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website. *      *      * Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus and members of the Committee, I am pleased to appear today to discuss several issues related to the state of the banking system. First, I will discuss the condition of the banking system, credit conditions, and bank underwriting standards. Then I will describe Federal Reserve activities to enhance liquidity in financial markets and improve conditions in financial markets. Finally, I will discuss the Federal Reserve's efforts to ensure the overall safety and soundness of the banking system as well as promote credit availability.  As you are well aware, the Federal Reserve has taken significant steps to improve financial market conditions, and has worked with the Treasury and other bank and thrift supervisors to address issues at U.S. banking organizations. We remain attentive to the need for banks to remain in sound financial condition while at the same time to continue lending prudently to creditworthy borrowers. Fortunately, many banks continue to lend in this environment, but with the shutdown of most securitization markets and the evaporation of many types of nonbank credit, it is that much more important right now for the U.S. banking system to be able to carry out its credit intermediation function. Background The Federal Reserve has supervisory and regulatory authority for bank holding companies, state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System (state member banks), and certain other financial institutions and activities. We work with other federal and state supervisory authorities to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking industry, foster the stability of the financial system, and provide for fair and equitable treatment of consumers in their financial transactions. The Federal Reserve is not the primary federal supervisor for the majority of commercial bank assets. Rather, it is the consolidated supervisor of bank holding companies, including financial holding companies, and conducts inspections of those institutions. The primary purpose of inspections is to ensure that the holding company and its nonbank subsidiaries do not pose a threat to the soundness of the company's depository institutions. In fulfilling this role, the Federal Reserve is required to rely to the fullest extent possible on information and analysis provided by the appropriate supervisory authority of the company's bank, securities, or insurance subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve is also the primary federal supervisor of state member banks, sharing supervisory responsibilities with state agencies. In this role, Federal Reserve supervisory staff regularly conduct on-site examinations and off-site monitoring to ensure the soundness of supervised state member banks. The Federal Reserve is involved in both regulation – establishing the rules within which banking organizations must operate – and supervision – ensuring that banking organizations abide by those rules and remain, overall, in safe and sound condition. A key aspect of the supervisory process is evaluating risk-management practices. Because rules and regulations in many cases cannot reasonably prescribe the exact practices each individual bank should use for risk management, supervisors design policies and guidance that expand upon requirements set in rules and regulations and establish expectations for the range of BIS Review 35/2009 1 
acceptable practices. Supervisors rely extensively on these policies and guidance as they conduct examinations and assign supervisory ratings. Beginning in the summer of 2007, the U.S. and global economies entered a period of intense financial turmoil that has presented significant challenges for the financial services industry. These challenges intensified in the latter part of 2008 as the global economic environment weakened further. As a result, parts of the U.S. banking system have come under severe strain, with some banking institutions suffering sizable losses. State of the banking system  I would now like to briefly summarize overall conditions at U.S. commercial banks and large banking holding companies (BHCs). For U.S. commercial banks as a group, profitability measures deteriorated dramatically during 2008. Indeed, commercial banks posted a substantial and rare aggregate loss for fourth quarter of 2008, the first time this has happened since the late 1980s. This loss in large part reflected write-downs on trading assets, high goodwill impairment charges, and, most significantly, increased loan-loss provisions taken in response to deteriorating asset quality, higher net charge-offs, and weakening economic conditions. As of year-end 2008, loans delinquent 30 days or more or on nonaccrual status exceeded 4.5 percent of total loans, the highest level since the early 1990s. Moreover, nonaccruing loans – those most likely to result in additional charge-offs – reached almost two-percent of loans, a ratio more than double that of year-end 2007. Despite poor earnings performance, capital ratios held up relatively well, with reported tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios increasing over the course of the year. The performance of state member banks tracked that of the industry as a whole. The earnings performance of the 50 largest U.S.-based bank holding companies (BHCs) as a group, which together represent more than three-fourths of all assets at BHCs, deteriorated rapidly during the last two quarters of 2008. In aggregate, these companies reported a fourth quarter net loss of $42.7 billion – versus a $25.5 billion third-quarter loss – due mainly to elevated loan-loss provisions, very large goodwill impairment charges, and a continuation of heavy trading asset write-downs. For the year, these companies generated a $67 billion loss. Nonetheless, regulatory capital ratios actually improved during 2008 – supported by substantial private capital investments in these companies during the first half and by the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) investments by the U.S. Treasury toward the end of the year. As a consequence, these bank holding companies in aggregate continued to maintain capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. Conditions in credit markets As Chairman Bernanke noted in presenting the Board's most recent monetary policy testimony to Congress in February, the U.S. economy is undergoing a severe contraction. From past experience, we know that borrowing by households and nonfinancial businesses has tended to slow during economic downturns. Since 1953, the inflation-adjusted growth rate of debt owed by households and nonfinancial businesses has fallen, on average, about 2 percentage points at an annual rate in the year following a business cycle peak (as dated by the National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER). The inflation-adjusted slowdown in debt growth during the past year has been much more pronounced than in previous downturns: Annualized debt growth for households and nonfinancial businesses in the fourth quarter of 2008 (the most up-to-date reading) was, adjusted for inflation, about 7 percentage points slower than it was during the NBER-designated peak in the fourth quarter of 2007. The slowdown in debt growth has differed by type of borrower. For example, after increasing nearly 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 (unadjusted for inflation), home mortgage debt declined at an annual rate of 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. The decline in home mortgage debt has been sharper in this period than in any other recession for which 2 BIS Review 35/2009 
we have good data – dating back to the 1950s. Non-mortgage consumer credit also declined in the fourth quarter of last year – at an annual rate of 3.25 percent. The pull-back in consumer credit has also been somewhat sharper than the average experience during the previous nine NBER recessions. Among businesses, growth in debt for nonfinancial corporations slowed from a 12.5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 to a 1.5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year. The slowdown in debt growth for this sector is also more substantial than has been experienced in past recessions. This simple comparison of the current slowdown in credit market flows to those in previous recessions ignores the many important changes to the financial landscape that have occurred during the past half-century. Significant among those changes was the large increase in the flow of credit coming from nonbank sources. For example, holdings of household mortgages by banks, savings institutions, and credit unions decreased from a share of more than 50 percent in 1985 to a share of about 30 percent of the total at the end of 2007. Similarly, banks held about 70 percent of outstanding consumer credit in 1985, but only about 45 percent in 2007. Of course, banks remain vital financial intermediaries, as the current financial crisis demonstrates. The severe turmoil in markets for securitized assets has served to increase banks' importance. And the significance of banks in the provision of credit extends far beyond their direct loans. Banks supply credit indirectly by providing back-up liquidity and credit support to other financial institutions and conduits that also intermediate credit flows. In 1950, banks' share of financial intermediation was about 50 percent, it fell and then rose to about 48 percent in the mid-1970s, then declined to about 33 percent at the turn of the century. If one adjusts the data to include "credit equivalents" for the off-balance-sheet activities of banks, then the adjusted market share of financial intermediation for banks would remain above 40 percent in recent years.  In terms of direct lending, weekly data that the Federal Reserve Board collects from banks shows that total bank loans and leases increased almost 4 percent during 2008. The increase in bank lending for the year as a whole was below the roughly 10 percent pace of growth seen in both 2006 and 2007. Much of the increase in bank lending last year likely reflected households and businesses drawing down existing lines of credit rather than extensions of new loans. In addition, the freeze-up of the securitization markets likely contributed to banks' balance sheet growth. According to the Federal Reserve's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, banks have tightened lending standards sharply over the past 18 months. The January 2009 Survey found that respondents had tightened their lending policies for all major loan categories further in late 2008. Respondents also indicated that demand for loans from both businesses and households continued to weaken, on balance, over the survey period. With regard to commercial loans in particular, many survey respondents pointed to a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook as a reason for tightening their lending standards and terms over the previous three months. Most respondents indicated that a worsening of industry-specific problems and their bank's reduced tolerance for risk were also important factors in their decision to tighten lending policies for commercial loans. Among the few respondents that saw an increase in loan demand over the previous three months, all indicated that business borrowing had shifted to their bank from other bank or nonbank sources because the other sources had become less attractive. In addition, more than 30 percent reported that inquiries from potential business borrowers had decreased during the survey period. For commercial real estate (CRE) lending, 80 percent of domestic banks reported that they had tightened their lending standards over the previous three months, slightly less than the roughly 85 percent that reported doing so in the October survey. Of note, about 30 percent of the respondents indicated that the shutdown of the commercial mortgage backed-securities (CMBS) securitization market had led to an increase in CRE lending at their bank over the BIS Review 35/2009 3 
second half of 2008, whereas about 15 percent indicated that the shutdown of the CMBS securitization market had reduced the volume of their CRE lending. Survey respondents also noted continued tightening for consumer products, including residential real estate lending and revolving home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Notably, only four of the nearly 80 respondents reported making subprime mortgage loans over the previous three months. Stepping back, it is now clear that in recent years banking and financial markets experienced a period in which risk was generally under-priced and where credit was too freely available. The realization by many market participants that risks were larger than anticipated has contributed to the decline in prices for financial assets. As a result, some financial institutions – including some banking organizations – have experienced significant losses, leading to the need to raise additional capital or, in some cases, sell or shut down operations. It is apparent that all banking institutions have now been impacted in some way by the adverse conditions of the current environment. Federal Reserve actions since 2007 The Federal Reserve has responded forcefully to the financial and economic crisis and it will continue to do so. In discussing Federal Reserve actions, I will first summarize monetary policy actions and those related to liquidity provision, and then highlight our supervisory actions. Monetary policy and liquidity provision In terms of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve has been aggressive. As you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began to ease monetary policy in September 2007, and in December 2008, the Committee set a range of 0 to 25 basis points for the target federal funds rate. We have also employed additional tools to ease financial conditions, improve the functioning of credit markets, and thereby support economic activity. To improve mortgage market functioning and support housing markets and economic activity more broadly, the Federal Reserve has begun to purchase large amounts of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and we recently announced substantial additional purchases of such securities through year-end. In addition, the Federal Reserve announced plans to purchase up to $300 billion of long-term Treasury securities to help improve conditions in private credit markets. Since first announcing such purchases last November, the conforming fixed mortgage rate has fallen more than 1 percentage point. The Federal Reserve has also established new lending facilities and expanded existing facilities to enhance the flow of credit to businesses and households. In response to heightened stress in bank funding markets, we increased the size of the Term Auction Facility to help ensure that banks could obtain the funds they need to provide credit to their customers, and we expanded our network of swap lines with foreign central banks to ease conditions in interconnected dollar funding markets at home and abroad. Last fall, when money markets tightened considerably following the failure of Lehman Brothers, we established new lending facilities to provide liquidity to money market mutual funds and to support the functioning of the commercial paper market. The U.S. Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Reserve have taken a number of actions to strengthen the financial sector and to promote the availability of credit to businesses and households. This included injecting additional capital into banks, increasing FDIC deposit coverage, providing guarantees of selected senior bank obligations and noninterest-bearing deposits, and establishing new liquidity facilities to financial markets. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury recently launched the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses and anticipates that the range of eligible collateral 4 BIS Review 35/2009 
for this facility is likely to be expanded to other financial assets. The Federal Reserve expects to assist in the Treasury's Public-Private Partnership Investment Program, announced on Monday, by expanding the range of collateral eligible for the TALF program to include certain legacy securities. Supervisory activities and improvements to risk-management practices Many of the current problems in the banking and financial system stem from risk-management failures at a number of financial institutions, including some firms under federal supervision. Clearly, these lapses are unacceptable. The Federal Reserve has been involved in a number of exercises to understand, document and help address the risk-management lapses and shortcomings at major financial institutions, including those undertaken by the Senior Supervisors Group, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, and the multinational Financial Stability Forum.1  Based on the results of these and other efforts, the Federal Reserve is taking vigorous steps to improve risk-management practices at regulated institutions. Our actions have covered liquidity risk management, capital planning and capital adequacy, firm-wide risk identification, residential lending, counterparty credit exposures, and commercial real estate lending, among other areas. Liquidity and capital have been given special attention. The crisis has undermined previous conventional wisdom that a company, even in stressed environments, may readily borrow funds if it can offer high-quality collateral. For example, the inability of Bear Stearns to borrow even against U.S. government securities led to its collapse. As a result, we have been working to bring about needed improvements in institutions' liquidity risk-management practices. Along with our U.S. supervisory colleagues, we are closely monitoring the liquidity positions of banking organizations – on a daily basis for the largest and most critical firms – and are discussing key market developments and our supervisory analyses with senior management. We use these analyses and findings from examinations to ensure that liquidity and funding management, as well as contingency funding plans, are sufficiently robust and incorporate various stress scenarios. Looking beyond the present period, we also have underway a broader-ranging examination of liquidity requirements. Similarly, the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the capital levels of banking organizations on a regular basis and discussing our evaluation with senior management. As part of our supervisory process, we have been conducting our own analysis of loss scenarios to anticipate the potential future capital needs of institutions. These needs may arise from, among other things, future losses or the potential for off-balance-sheet exposures to return to institutions' balance sheets. Here, too, we have been discussing our analyses with bankers and ensuring that their own internal analyses reflect a broad range of scenarios and capture stress environments that could impair solvency. We have intensified efforts to evaluate institutions' capital planning and to bring about improvements where needed. Our efforts related to capital planning and capital adequacy are embodied in the interagency supervisory capital assessment process, which began in February. We are conducting assessments of selected banking institutions' capital adequacy, based on certain macroeconomic scenarios. For this assessment, we are carefully evaluating the forecasts submitted by each financial institution to ensure they are appropriate, consistent with the firm's underlying portfolio performance, and reflective of each entity's particular business activities and risk profile. The capital assessment program will permit supervisors to assess                                                  1  Senior Supervisors Group (2008), "Observations on Risk Management Practices during the Recent Market Turbulence", March 6; President's Working Group on Financial Markets (2008), "Policy Statement on Financial Market Developments", March 13; Financial Stability Forum (2008), "Report of the Financial Stability Forum on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience", April 7. BIS Review 35/2009 5 
whether institutions' capital buffers over the regulatory capital minimum are appropriate under more severe but plausible scenarios.  To sum up our efforts to improve banks' risk management, we are looking at all areas of risk management – both on an individual and collective basis – to ensure that all institutions have their risk-management practices at satisfactory levels. More generally, where we have not seen appropriate progress, we are aggressively downgrading supervisory ratings and using our enforcement tools. Maintaining balance in the supervisory process The Federal Reserve has long-standing policies and procedures in place to promote sound risk identification and management practices at regulated institutions that also support bank lending and the credit intermediation process. In fact, guidance issued as long ago as 1991, during the commercial real estate crisis that began in the late 1980s, specifically instructs examiners to ensure that regulatory policies and actions do not inadvertently curtail the availability of credit to sound borrowers.2 The 1991 guidance also states that examiners are to "ensure that supervisory personnel are reviewing loans in a consistent, prudent, and balanced fashion and to ensure that all interested parties are aware of the guidance." The 1991 policy statement covers a wide range of specific topics, including: • the general principles that examiners follow in reviewing commercial real estate loan portfolios  • the indicators of troubled real estate markets, projects, and related indebtedness  • the factors examiners consider in their review of individual loans, including the use of appraisals and the determination of collateral value  • a discussion of approaches to valuing real estate, especially in troubled markets  • the classification guidelines followed by the agencies, including the treatment of guarantees  • the factors considered in the evaluation of an institution's allowance for loan and lease losses This emphasis on achieving an appropriate balance between credit availability and safety and soundness continues today. To the extent that institutions have experienced losses, hold less capital, and are operating in a more risk-sensitive environment, supervisors expect banks to employ appropriate risk-management practices to ensure their viability. At the same time, it is important that supervisors remain balanced and not place unreasonable or artificial constraints on lenders that could hamper credit availability. As part of our effort to help stimulate appropriate bank lending, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies issued regulatory guidance in November 2008 to encourage banks to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers.3 The guidance was issued to encourage bank lending in a manner consistent with safety and soundness – specifically, by taking a balanced approach in assessing borrowers' ability to repay and making realistic assessments of collateral valuations. This guidance has been reviewed and discussed with examination staff within the Federal Reserve System. Earlier, in April 2007, the federal financial institutions regulatory agencies issued a statement encouraging financial institutions to work constructively with residential borrowers who are                                                  2  "Interagency Policy Statement on the Review and Classification of Commercial Real Estate Loans," (November 1991). 3  "Interagency Statement on Meeting the Needs of Credit Worthy Borrowers," (November 2008). 6 BIS Review 35/2009 
financially unable to make their contractual payment obligations on their home loans.4 The statement noted that, "prudent workout arrangements that are consistent with safe and sound lending practices are generally in the long-term interest of both the financial institution and the borrower." The statement also noted that, "the agencies will not penalize financial institutions that pursue reasonable workout arrangements with borrowers who have encountered financial problems." It further stated that, "existing supervisory guidance and applicable accounting standards do not require institutions to immediately foreclose on the collateral underlying a loan when the borrower exhibits repayment difficulties." This guidance has also been reviewed by examiners within the Federal Reserve System. More generally, we have directed our examiners to be mindful of the procyclical effects of excessive credit tightening and to encourage banks to make economically viable loans, provided such lending is based on realistic asset valuations and a balanced assessment of borrowers' repayment capacities. Across the Federal Reserve System, we have implemented training and outreach to underscore these intentions. We are mindful of the potential for bankers to overshoot in their attempt to rectify lending standards, and want them to understand that it is in their own interest to continue making loans to creditworthy borrowers. Conclusion The U.S. banking industry is facing serious challenges. The Federal Reserve, working with the other banking agencies has acted – and will continue to act – to ensure that the banking system remains safe and sound and is able to meet the credit needs of our economy. We have aggressively pursued monetary policy actions and provided liquidity to help repair the financial system. In our supervisory efforts, we are mindful of the risk-management deficiencies at banking institutions revealed by the current crisis and are ensuring that institutions develop appropriate corrective actions. It will take some time for the banking industry to work through this current set of challenges and for the financial markets to recover. During that recovery, the economy will need a strong and stable financial system that can make credit available. The challenge for regulators and other authorities is to support prudential bank intermediation that helps restore the health of the financial system and the economy as a whole. We want banks to deploy capital and liquidity, but in a responsible way that avoids past mistakes and does not create new ones. Bankers should operate prudently in the current challenging environment, but should not let fear drive their decisions. The Federal Reserve will continue to work with other banking agencies and the Congress to promote the concurrent goals of fostering credit availability and a safe and sound banking system.                                                  4  "Federal Regulators Encourage Institutions to Work with Mortgage Borrowers Who Are Unable to Make Their Payments," (April 2007).

José De Gregorio: Monetary policy and pass-through to interest rates Speech by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, before the Honorable Chamber of Representative’s Economic, Promotion and Development Commission, Santiago, 16 March 2009. The Spanish original prevails. *      *      * Mr. President. I wish to thank you and the Economic, Promotion and Development Commission of the Honorable Chamber of Representatives for inviting me to speak about how our monetary policy decisions affect the country’s financial and lending conditions. The global economy is enduring terribly uncertain times, which have implications on our country’s prospects for growth and inflation. Thus, we share your preoccupation for evaluating how monetary policy actions – one of the main stabilizing tools we have available as a country – ultimately affect the cost of borrowing faced by households and firms. Monetary policy, in the context of an inflation target and a floating exchange rate like the one operating in Chile since 1999, is an important mechanism for smoothing out the business cycle. Periods of weak output and demand performance, which reduce the medium-term inflation outlook, lend themselves to countercyclical monetary policy actions that cushion the negative effects on consumption, investment and employment. This is what the Central Bank of Chile is presently doing, acting resolutely to moderate the effects that the global crisis – the worst we have seen in decades – is having in Chile. The transmission of monetary policy The Central Bank of Chile’s monetary policy operates largely through its effects on the cost of lending, as it influences the cost of bank financing. The Bank’s main instrument is the monetary policy interest rate, or MPR. It is worth noting that the level which the Board chooses every month for the MPR represents an objective for the cost of overnight lending between banks. In other words, the Central Bank operates in the interbank market, seeing that the interest rate at which banks lend to and borrow from each other overnight approaches the MPR. Therefore, it is important to understand how this interest rate, which operates in a very specific and well defined market (among banks and for a term of one day only), affects the spending and investing decisions made by households and firms even over several years.  The explanation for this phenomenon is that, in normal circumstances, what matters is not only today’s level of the MPR, but the whole future path expected by the market for such interest rate. This is what ultimately affects the entire yield structure. In other words, for a five-year loan, for instance, it is more important for the potential borrower to have an idea of how the MPR will be behaving in the next five years that to know its current level.  The above has first-order implications on the conduct, implementation and communication of monetary policy. In fact, while obviously important, the decisions that we adopt as the Central Bank Board at the monetary policy meetings are not the only element shaping the credit conditions within the economy. Also of first order is the market’s perception of how the monetary policy will be managed in future months and years. This leads us to be extremely cautious in our communication, in order for the decisions we make to be perceived with the adequate persistence.  The monetary policy that the Board has been implementing in the past few months clearly illustrates this phenomenon. Despite the fact that the MPR was held constant at 8.25% in the last months of the past year, thanks to the way we communicate our decisions and to the BIS Review 35/2009 1 
incorporation of an explicit bias the MPR level expected by the market six months ahead dropped significantly, pulling down the deposit rate at longer terms. Subsequent reductions to the MPR that have been applied this year have gone beyond market expectations, reducing financing costs (figure 1). To succeed in communicating properly, transparently and credibly is then key for monetary policy decisions to cause the impact that is needed. This is what makes monetary policy effective, and it is why the Central Bank has maintained a systematic policy of communication and transparency, through the presentations we make as Board members, with our Monetary Policy Reports, and with the transparency mechanisms we have for our policy decisions. In the latter area we actually have made major innovations since our Monetary Policy Meeting last Thursday. We now upload to our public website the background information based on publicly available data before holding the meetings where we decide on monetary policy.  Today’s scenario: uncertainty and risks Monetary policy is one of many factors influencing the cost of borrowing faced by households and firms. Another factor that has gained significant importance is the perception of risk and volatility that has swept over every financial market. This increased with the worsening of the global financial crisis last September. In general, and despite efforts made by economic policy makers in the main economies around the world, we are still dwelling in an extremely uncertain scenario. This has a number of implications that ultimately affect the conditions and costs of credit to firms and households not only in Chile but everywhere.  To begin with, external lending standards for domestic banks have become more stringent. We see it in that, although our banks have been able to access foreign credit sources, these have been at shorter maturities and with larger spreads over external reference interest rates. This is a reflection of the difficulties that continue to haunt the main global financial institutions and their reluctance to embark in new businesses. This has not altered the liquidity available in the local money market, which has remained stable, aside from some transitory turbulence in early October that was addressed by the Central Bank through the implementation of new modalities in the provision of liquidity. Secondly, the meltdown of world output and trade is increasing credit risk globally. In turn, firms and households with a better financial situation tend naturally to postpone their spending and borrowing decisions, awaiting the normalization of the financial environment, thus shrinking the demand for credit. All of this results in increased average financing cost and tougher lending standards for those agents actually engaging in borrowing operations. We can see that the various risk and volatility indicators are substantially above their pre-September figures (figure 2). As we wrote in our latest Monetary Policy Report,1 the extra financial burden for the clients of Chilean banks has tended to reflect precisely the higher levels of global uncertainty and their impact on the Chilean economy. I must stress that these phenomena are occurring today in every economy in the world, sometimes with catastrophic implications on their levels of output and the solvency of their financial institutions. Because we prepared as a country for a long while to confront severe deteriorations of the international economic environment, Chile and our financial market have suffered limited effects, with no sudden stops but, on the contrary, with increases in credit supply and without a generalized process of insolvency. These same precautions have permitted macroeconomic policies – both fiscal and monetary – to be clearly countercyclical, helping to cushion the effects of the world crisis on our economy.                                                   1  Central Bank of Chile (2009). 2 BIS Review 35/2009 
The transmission of MPR reductions to lending interest rates One important element in the diagnosis of how this countercyclical effort is actually working is the evaluation we perform on a permanent basis to the way our decisions are affecting the borrowing conditions facing households and firms. This issue is not new, and was the subject of analysis several years back when the Central Bank’s monetary policy was on a sustained expansionary path.2 The evidence we gathered then can be summed up in that the Central Bank’s monetary policy decisions are reflected in the banks’ financial cost very quickly, but in the overall cost of credit only after a few months. This response pattern was similar to that in other economies. Lately, we have reviewed that information,3 and we have found that, even in moments of great uncertainty as we experienced in recent months, reductions to the MPR are translating into reduced borrowing costs for both businesses and consumers.  One good example is the trend of the interest rate on commercial loans at 30 to 89 days, which can be linked to the funding of working capital. This rate was very high in October last year, but this year so far it has fallen substantially. We estimate that if we had not cut the MPR by a combined 350 basis points (bp) between January and February, this rate would be some 250 bp above where it is today. A similar situation can be seen in the case of consumer loans. The cost of mortgage financing, meanwhile, has been less sensitive to the changes in the MPR precisely because those are long-term borrowing decisions. However, without the drop in long-term rates – which has partly originated in the monetary easing – mortgage rates would have stayed largely above their current levels (figure 3). We estimate, then, that the monetary policy decisions recently adopted have begun to pass through to the credit conditions faced by households and firms. This pass-through should continue in the near future, especially after the reduction in the MPR that the Board determined last week. We will keep monitoring these effects permanently, because for us it is essential that the MPR propagates to market rates smoothly. We certainly expect the latest MPR reduction last Thursday to result in additional decreases in the banking system’s lending rates. This type of exercises also permits to evaluate the impact of the higher degrees of uncertainty, volatility and risk we have been observing since last September. If we do the exercise of asking ourselves where would the lending rate be in a hypothetical scenario without the global financial crisis, we find that it would be between 50 bp and 350 bp below its present level, with the larger effect on the interest rates on commercial and consumer loans. In the specific case of mortgage loans, the increase in the interest rate occurred between September and December 2008 can be largely linked to the implications of the external conditions on the local perception of risk (figure 4). All the above is a clear illustration of how the severe uncertainty and high risks that were unleashed last September are affecting the domestic economy.  Non-bank financing sources Notwithstanding the key role played by domestic banks in funding households and firms, especially smaller ones, for the bigger companies there are other equally important credit sources. Thus, around 45% of total corporate borrowing is non-bank, with external debt and domestic bonds at the top of the list. Therefore, it is important to understand the behavior of the interest rates on these credits before offering a global outlook of financial conditions. The Central Bank of Chile has no direct effect on external financial conditions. Like banks, Chilean firms have seen their borrowing conditions tighten under the changed state of affairs. Still, our banks and firms continue to enjoy normal access to world financial markets, owing                                                  2  Berstein and Fuentes (2003). 3  Becerra et al. (2009). BIS Review 35/2009 3 
to a great extent to our policy framework that ensures the solvency of our economy and to our sound financial system.  As for the local bonds market, January stood out for its large corporate bond issuances. Meanwhile, the interest rate demanded from corporate bonds in the secondary market has been falling through all of this year, and is currently approaching its levels of last September. This drop owes exclusively to the decline in the interest rates on Central Bank documents, because the spread between public and corporate securities has increased significantly since September, reflecting the same global risk factors already mentioned (figure 5).  Conclusions The global financial crisis has hit hard credit markets around the world. In some unfortunate cases, economies that faced this debacle from a fragile initial position, with high indebtedness or with fast credit growth, have faced drastic adjustments in local asset prices, output, and employment, with dire consequences on their living standards. Thanks to the fact that we prepared for years as a country to confront deteriorations of the external environment, our monetary policy has been able to adopt a clear countercyclical stance to lessen the effect on our economy of the global financial meltdown.  We have seen that the aggressive reductions in the MPR implemented by the Board since January have begun to reflect on the borrowing conditions faced by households and firms. It is reasonable to expect this to continue in the coming weeks, especially after the MPR cut of last week. However, a full normalization of credit demand and supply will depend on the appeasing of the global financial environment, on more clarity about the definitive structure of the global financial system, and on economic growth prospects settling down in the larger economies of the world. Overall, it is important to note that this analysis has focused on the cost of credit for operations already materialized. The other central dimension of the financial system operation is clients’ access to credit. Lately loans have slowed down. It is difficult to figure out how much of this to blame on lower demand and how much on the financial institutions’ reluctance to lend. In any case, we believe it is important that financial institutions, provided good risk management, continue to lend to firms and households. We agree with the Superintendent of Banks and share the principle that through tough times the banks must stand by their clients and cooperate in the solution of their financial problems.  I would like to inform you that, as part of our process of increasing transparency, particularly regarding public dissemination of information about interest rates charged on credit operations, we have decided to extend the available data on credit conditions by maturity, indexation, and type of loan. Thus, starting today our website has increased the level of detail of interest rate information made available to the public.4 Part of said information was used in producing the results reported in this presentation. Just as we did a year ago, when we discussed the exchange rate conjuncture at the Honorable Chamber of Representatives, I want to state that we act with the conviction that we are making the best decisions to provide stability to our economy and widen its growth opportunities. We permanently and carefully monitor the situation and we incorporate it consistently in our monetary policy decisions.  To finish, I thank again the Economic, Promotion and Development Commission of the Honorable Chamber of Representatives and its President, representative Mr. Antonio Leal for letting me present our visions here. The serious management of monetary policy and its formulation on a solid technical basis is essential to ensure economic stability in such volatile                                                  4  Matus et al.

and blurred global conditions as we are now going through. I appreciate this opportunity to come and expose our vision of the relationship between market interest rates and the conduct of our monetary policy. Thank you. References Becerra, S., L.

Jean-Claude Trichet: Interview with the Wall Street Journal Interview of Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, with the Wall Street Journal, published on 23 March 2009. *      *      * WSJ: You’ve shown a bit of optimism recently, saying we could see a moderate recovery in 2010. Where will recovery come from? Mr. Trichet: I have not been alone in mentioning that in Europe 2009 will be a very, very difficult year. As regards 2010, I always mentioned not only our own diagnosis, but the fact that an overwhelming majority of observers, economists and international institutions would say that in the course of next year there will be a progressive gradual recovery. It’s neither an optimistic vision nor a pessimistic vision. It’s the present, realistic vision. WSJ: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke spoke recently about “green shoots” in the U.S. economy. Do you see similar green shoots in the euro-zone economy? Mr. Trichet: Again, we have to accept that in Europe as in the world 2009 is a difficult year and you have, in the present situation, elements that you could see as very negative. You have some that are a little bit reassuring on both sides of the Atlantic. But all taken into account, we are still in a situation where the trend is downward.  WSJ: What will turn the downward trend around?  Mr. Trichet: I see four main possible factors behind a progressive gradual recovery in 2010: first the expansionary effect of the fall in the price of oil and commodities; second the activation of the economies through discretionary fiscal policies and automatic stabilizers which are very substantial; third the extraordinary measures that have been taken to put the financial sector back on its feet: on this side of the Atlantic the commitments of the executive branches in the form of recapitalization, guarantees and other options represent around 23% of the GDP; fourth the policies of the central banks: as an example for the ECB and the Eurosystem the size of the balance sheet represents now 16% of the GDP when it was 10% before the crisis, namely an increase of 600 billon euros (approximately 800 billon dollars).  A number of other factors are also very important in the perspective of a medium-term recovery: the continued surge of technology, the considerable growth potential of the emerging economies. But as regards a relatively prompt recovery what is decisive is the confidence factor. What we are experiencing is a very sharp and abrupt disappearance of confidence. So it depends very much on us that 2010 could be, or not, a year of progressive gradual recovery. It depends on the capacity of authorities and private sector together, to re-inject in the economy of the world these elements of confidence that have disappeared mid September 2008. WSJ: Do you think the criticism that European governments have not done enough, in terms of fiscal stimulus, is justified? Mr. Trichet: I think it’s not. After the recent meeting of ministers and governors of the Group of 20 in London, I had the conviction that both sides of the Atlantic had understood much better each others’ situations. There is a mutual understanding that when you take all into account, you see that on both sides of the Atlantic, what has been done on the fiscal side corresponds to the gravity of the situation. To speak more directly of the euro area, you must take into account the combination of discretionary decisions that have been taken by all governments, plus the automatic stabilizers that are much more important on this side of the Atlantic; the level of public spending as a proportion of GDP, which is much higher on this side of the Atlantic; and the BIS Review 34/2009 1 
room for maneuver for each particular economy that existed before the crisis and exists today.  To be efficient in rebuilding confidence, you have to demonstrate that you are doing, immediately and audaciously, what is necessary today. But at the same time, you have also to reassure your own people that you have an exit strategy, to reassure households that we are not putting in jeopardy the situation of the children, and to reassure businesses that what is done today is not done to the detriment of their own taxation in the years to come. Activation of the economy depends crucially on confidence. And confidence today needs that we can prove to our own people that we have the right balance between the short-term and the medium- and long-term perspective.  WSJ: What do you think are the most urgent requirements for enacting global policy now? There are a number of measures that have been announced and not enacted. Are you, for example, concerned at the pace at which the U.S. financial restructuring is going?  Mr. Trichet: What I would recommend for us as for the US is to, now, as efficiently and rapidly as possible, do what has been decided. Nothing will really work until the financial sector is back on track and ready to lend on a sustainable basis. I would say exactly the same with the budget. Decisions have been taken; they are very important. Let’s do it! Quick implementation, quick disbursement is what is needed. Not embarking on useless and counterproductive quarrels which fortunately are over now.  WSJ: If recovery does not take hold gradually in 2010, does the Stability and Growth Pact give European governments room to do more? Mr. Trichet: The Stability and Growth Pact has been revised to cope with exceptional circumstances. It is our way to maintain appropriate cohesion in a single market with a single currency and with no single federal budget. Respect of the procedures and provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact is of the essence. WSJ: Ireland expects an 6.5% decline in GDP this year. Their deficit is projected to be 10% of GDP and they’ll soon introduce a budget that will raise taxes. Is that really the appropriate response in the teeth of a deep recession? Mr. Trichet: I am not speaking of one country in particular. In each case you have to see what your own room for maneuvering is. If the additional deficits are costing you both, a strong increase of the cost of your own refinancing and a loss of confidence of your people, you’re not better off! If your people have the sentiment that they will be not better off in an endless spiraling of deficits, they will not spend any money that you give them today!  WSJ: There are a number of countries that, absent the euro zone, would have made an adjustment in real wages through devaluation. How do you see adjustments in real wages now being made in the euro zone's less-competitive economies? Isn’t the inevitable consequence in certain countries falls in real wages and deflation, even if that doesn't occur in the euro zone as a whole? Mr. Trichet: The euro zone is a single market with a single currency and the various countries have to be considered exactly as the various States of the U.S.A. It goes without saying that the situation of the various States in the U.S.A. is not all alike. In a small number of euro-zone cases – this has nothing to do with the present crisis – there is a necessity to progressively catch up with a level of competitiveness which had been deteriorating over the past years. Germany is a good example of such adjustments: it entered the euro area with a level of relative competitiveness which was insufficient. It regained, in a very efficient fashion, competitiveness to offset its insufficient level in the entry.  WSJ: A number of other central banks, in words and in deeds, have suggested the risk of deflation is rising. You have maintained the risk of deflation in the euro zone overall is low. Why would the euro zone be different than other major developed economies of the world? 2 BIS Review 34/2009 
Mr. Trichet: All the international institutions that are looking at the situation say there is no substantiation of a significant deflationary risk in the euro area at the moment. That being said, we have to be alert and look at the risks permanently. We are certainly helped by our very clear definition of price stability, which is annual inflation at less than 2%, but close to 2%.  Surveys of medium-term euro-zone inflation expectations have oscillated between 1.7% and 2%. When you look at what has been extracted from financial markets and compare with the U.S., you see we are benefiting from more solid anchoring of inflation expectations. I have also to take into account a number of figures that are till now, significantly over the zero level: for instance compensation per employee over 12 months is +3%, negotiated wages +3.5%, M3 +5.9%, M1 +5.2%. But as I said, we remain permanently alert.  WSJ: If you saw the risk of deflation rising, would you still see difficulties with a policy rate near zero?  Mr. Trichet: There are a number of drawbacks associated with policy rates deliberately put at a zero level by the decision of the central banks. That’s the reason we do not think it would be appropriate. But what counts are the interest rates that are in the market and that the public gets. I will surprise you! Taking into account our unlimited supply of liquidity at our main policy rate and the fact that we have the deposit rate at 0.5%, we have, at the moment I am speaking, our six-month rates on the money market that are a little bit below U.S. six-month rates, and our one-year rates that are 13 basis points below the U.S. money market one-year rate.  WSJ: You’ve highlighted recently the differences in the euro-zone financial system that underlie the differences between the non-standard steps the ECB has taken and those of other central banks. Mr. Trichet: Yes indeed. We have 70% of the financing of the euro area which goes through commercial banks and 30% through securities other than stocks. And on the other side of the Atlantic, it’s exactly the contrary; it’s 30% or a little less for commercial bank financing and 70 percent for securities other than stocks. That is the reason why we have concentrated our bold non-standard measures – eligibility of collateral, unlimited supply of liquidity at fixed rates – on the commercial bank channel.  WSJ: Would that difference guide any future non-standard steps you might take?  Mr. Trichet: We will certainly continue to do whatever we think optimizes our own situation. In the next decisions that we could take, it’s pretty possible that we would continue to be non-conventional through the channel of bank financing. This channel remains for us essential.  WSJ: What is your assessment of the adequacy of bank lending in the euro-zone?  Mr. Trichet: I will continue to tell our banks that we expect them to pass on to the real economy what we have been doing ourselves in terms of reduction of interest rates and of supply of liquidity. It’s up to them, being the main channel of financing of the European economy, to pass along the decisions we have been taking. If I am shipping this message, it is because we trust that this is not yet entirely done. We do not scapegoat at all our banks; we rely upon them. We are encouraging them as much as possible to do their job, and their job is to lend.  WSJ: There’s been a concern in other economies about banks that are so weakened that they’re zombie institutions that exist but are unable or unwilling to lend. Is that a phenomenon reflected in Europe? Mr. Trichet: No. You have a large number of institutions in the euro area, which fortunately did not embark into massive toxic-assets investment, which were reasonably cautious and prudent and are continuing to be creditworthy without extraordinary help from authorities. We might have some quasi passive institutions, but it is not at all the generalized case. Again, in any case, putting the financial sector back on its feet and lending is the first priority.  BIS Review 34/2009 3 
WSJ: There remains a sentiment among some that the ECB is not as willing as other central banks to be as responsive to the economic downturn with its policy rate. Mr. Trichet: At times, I see some observes looking at central banks as if they were participating in a race. Who is the first to do this or that? It is true that the ECB was the first central bank to act decisively at the start of the crisis on 9th of August 2007. We had our own good reasons, it was not a race! Today it is true that the size of the balance sheet (16% of GDP) is bigger in proportion than the size of the FED balance sheet. It might change after last week decisions. But it is not a race! Today our six-month and one year money market interest rates are lower than in the dollar or sterling money market because of our lower risk premia and liquidity premia. But it is not a race! We are all doing what we judge optimal taking into account the different characteristics of our economies and our common will to solidly anchor inflationary expectations and, in so doing, improve confidence. As regards the future rate of our main refinancing operations, presently at 1.5%, I said clearly that we could decrease it again. I also said that at 0.5% our deposit facility interest rate was already at a very, very low level.  WSJ: Are there any obstacles to the ECB purchasing government assets, which is now a policy of central banks including the Fed and the Bank of England?  Mr. Trichet: Two remarks: As regards the private papers, our collateral framework has been very supportive since the beginning of the crisis: I have also noted that our corporate securities markets behaved properly in terms of volume since January. As regards possible outright purchases of securities in general I said that we are not pre-committed for any new decisions. One element which has to be taken into account is that the risks of the central banks and the risks of the governments are, in the euro area, clearly separated without combination of risks or blending of responsibilities. WSJ: Are you suggesting that by buying government assets, there would be a blurring of responsibility where there is so far a clear division, and that blurring would be undesirable? Mr. Trichet: It is an element which has to be taken into account.  WSJ: There is also a debate about whether, with the house still burning down, as it were, longer-term questions about the new global financial architecture can wait. What is your view?  Mr. Trichet: Confidence is of essence! If we want to succeed right now in this very grave crisis we have to take bold decisions now and be equally determined in reassuring our fellow citizens in the medium and long run. We have to fight against short-termism. We have to improve transparency. And we have to eliminate pro-cyclicality. Fluctuations are normal in a market economy. We have to accept fluctuations, otherwise we would have no market economy – we would be in the Soviet Union. On the other hand, it is extremely clumsy to amplify those booms and busts. We have to concentrate on augmenting the resilience of global finance. And finally we have also to improve surveillance of the macro policies of systemic economies in order to prevent the piling up of domestic and external imbalances. The Financial Stability Forum and the IMF have a decisive role to play in these respects.  4 BIS Review 34/2009 
Elizabeth A Duke: Enforcement of financial consumer protection laws Testimony of Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, 20 March 2009. *      *      * Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the Committee, I want to thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Federal Reserve Board's ongoing efforts to address and prevent mortgage-related fraud and abusive lending practices in the institutions we supervise.  While the expansion of the subprime mortgage market over the past decade increased consumers' access to credit, too many homeowners and communities are suffering today because of lax underwriting standards and other unfair or deceptive practices that resulted in unsustainable loans. The Federal Reserve is committed to improving consumer protections and promoting responsible lending practices through each of the roles we play as supervisor for safety and soundness and consumer compliance, and as rulewriter. I will discuss the Federal Reserve's ongoing efforts as a banking supervisor to ensure that the institutions we supervise are managing their mortgage lending activities in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with laws and regulations. I will also discuss the rules and guidance that have been issued over the past several years that address many of these issues. In addition to our own examination and enforcement activities, I will talk about our ongoing efforts to coordinate with other law enforcement agencies to hold those who are involved in criminal activities in our supervised institutions accountable.  The Federal Reserve's enforcement efforts begin with the examination of its supervised institutions. The Federal Reserve conducts regular examinations of state member banks for both safety and soundness and compliance with consumer protection laws. We also conduct regular inspections of bank holding companies. We examine the mortgage businesses of these institutions, including subprime residential portfolios, as applicable. Institutions with weaknesses are expected to take corrective actions that include improving their risk management and underwriting practices in the future. In those rare instances where the bank is not willing to address the problem, we have and use a full range of powerful enforcement tools to compel corrective action. To ensure that banks with performance deficiencies give appropriate attention to supervisory concerns, we may require them to enter into nonpublic enforcement actions, such as memoranda of understanding. When necessary, we use formal, public enforcement actions, such as Written Agreements, Cease and Desist Orders, or civil money penalties. Mortgage fraud and investigations In recent years, there has been a significant increase in suspected criminal activity with respect to mortgage fraud and other mortgage-related criminal activity. Mortgage fraud occurs in various ways. In many cases mortgage fraud is perpetrated against the financial institution by brokers, appraisers, and other third parties. In other situations fraud is perpetrated by insiders of the institution. As I will discuss further, there are other abusive practices that occur in mortgage lending that harm borrowers and the safety and soundness of financial institutions. BIS Review 34/2009 1 
The Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) that banking organizations are required to file reveal significant suspected mortgage fraud activity. As recently reported by FinCEN, there is a continuing upward trend of SARs filed by depository institutions involving suspected mortgage loan fraud.1 From July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2008, depository institutions filed a total of 62,084 SARs reporting suspected mortgage loan fraud. This represents an increase of 44 percent in SARs involving mortgage fraud compared with the prior year. During the reporting period, mortgage loan fraud was the third most reported activity in SARs. The top 25 filing institutions of mortgage loan fraud SARs submitted 82 percent of the total 62,084 SAR filings. SARs alleging mortgage fraud involve numerous varieties of conduct from large-scale multi-million-dollar "straw borrower" and property flipping schemes to single incidents of overstated income or assets by individual borrowers.  Federal Reserve staff regularly review SARs filed by the financial institutions the Fed supervises. When bank insiders may be involved, we initiate investigations, make referrals to law enforcement, coordinate with law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, and pursue enforcement actions against individuals, including seeking prohibition orders and, in appropriate cases, civil money penalties and restitution. We are pursuing numerous investigations involving insiders relating to possible mortgage-related fraud, both commercial and residential. The Federal Reserve has established a Federal Reserve System examiner group to share information on the detection of fraud and pending investigations. On the local level, Reserve Bank staff also interacts with representatives from law enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and other agencies in SAR "review teams" to review SARs and coordinate actions. These meetings provide an opportunity to share information about criminal activities, including mortgage fraud, occurring within the district. The Federal Reserve regularly coordinates with law enforcement in a number of ways. Staff participates in monthly interagency meetings led by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Fraud Section and attended by other law enforcement and regulatory agencies. This interagency group, the "Bank Fraud Working Group," discusses and shares information on recent cases, trends, and other issues, including mortgage fraud. Supervision examinations and enforcement In the Federal Reserve's regular safety and soundness examinations of state member banks and bank holding companies, we evaluate risk-management systems, financial condition, and compliance with laws and regulations. In assessing a bank's risk management systems for its mortgage lending activity, examiners evaluate the adequacy of the bank's practices to identify, manage, and control credit risk. This includes the appropriateness of the bank's underwriting standards, credit administration, quality control processes over its own originations and third-party originations, and appraisal and collateral valuation practices. To assist institutions in understanding our supervisory expectations, the Federal Reserve has supplemented its long-standing guidelines on safe and sound real estate lending practices by joining the other federal bank regulatory agencies in issuing additional guidance on mortgage lending practices.  Specifically, starting in 2005, the Federal Reserve and the other federal agencies observed that lenders were increasingly originating nontraditional mortgage loans that lacked principal amortization and had the potential for negative amortization. We were also concerned about the growing use of adjustable rate mortgage products with "teaser" rates that adjust to a variable rate plus a margin for the remaining term of the loan, in addition to other risky characteristics. These products could result in payment shock to borrowers, and present                                                  1  FinCEN, Filing Trends in Mortgage Loan Fraud, February 25, 2009. 2 BIS Review 34/2009 
heightened risks to lenders and borrowers. Moreover, the easing of underwriting standards and the marketing of these products to lower credit quality borrowers, including those purchasing investment properties, held the potential to create significant risks for institutions and for borrowers.  To address those concerns and prevent supervised institutions from making unaffordable mortgage loans, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies issued the Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Products Risks in 2006 and the Interagency Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending in 2007. The nontraditional mortgage guidance highlights sound underwriting procedures, portfolio risk management, and consumer protection practices that institutions should follow to prudently originate and manage mortgage loans with payment option and interest-only features. A key aspect of both statements is the recommendation that a lender's analysis of repayment capacity should include an evaluation of the borrower's ability to repay debt. The subprime guidance emphasizes the risks of stated income or reduced documentation loans in the subprime sector. Further, the subprime guidance outlines certain practices that are considered predatory in nature and stipulates that institutions should not engage in these practices regardless of loan features.  Also, in 2005 the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies issued the Interagency Guidance on Independent Appraisal and Evaluation Functions. This statement reinforces the importance of appraiser independence from the loan origination and credit decision process to ensure that valuations are fairly and appropriately determined. Independence has been a core principle in the Board's appraisal regulation and guidance, which have been in place since the early 1990s. When we examine a bank's real estate lending activities, examiners consider the adequacy of the appraisal function to ensure that it complies with the appraisal regulation and has appropriate risk management practices. A strong appraisal function is essential to combating the potential for mortgage fraud by protecting the collateral valuations from influence by individuals whose intent is to deceive the lender about the condition and value of the collateral. The agencies took steps to further strengthen their guidance in this area by proposing interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines last November.  More recently, the collapse of the global credit market, triggered by the end of housing booms in the United States and other countries and the associated problems in mortgage markets, has led to a deterioration of asset values and credit conditions. As a result, financial institutions have incurred losses that in and of themselves have caused financial institutions to tighten credit underwriting standards to ensure that borrowers have the capacity to repay. Furthermore, sweeping new rules issued by the Board under its authority in the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) will further ensure that mortgage lenders that offer high-cost mortgages have appropriate practices to ensure consumers can repay their loans. Consumer compliance examination and enforcement The Federal Reserve conducts regular examinations of state member banks to evaluate compliance with consumer protection laws, the fair lending laws, and the Community Reinvestment Act. These examinations are conducted by a specially trained cadre of examiners for the approximately 875 banks we supervise. The Board has a long-standing commitment to ensuring that every bank it supervises complies fully with federal financial consumer protection laws, including the fair lending laws. The scope of these examinations includes a review of the bank's compliance with the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), the Community Reinvestment Act, and other federal consumer protection laws. One objective of our consumer compliance examination program is to identify compliance risks at banks before they harm consumers and ensure that state member banks have appropriate controls in place to manage those risks. In conducting a consumer compliance BIS Review 34/2009 3 
examination at a state member bank, examiners review the commitment and ability of bank management to comply with consumer protection laws as well as the bank's actual compliance with such laws. Examinations follow a risk-focused approach tailored to fit the risk profile of the bank. This approach directs supervisory attention and resources to the products, services, and areas of the bank's operations that pose the greatest risk to consumers. Our examiners prepare a stand-alone consumer compliance examination report bearing a distinct consumer compliance rating for each state member bank we supervise. These confidential reports include an evaluation of the bank's compliance management program, a summary of the fair lending review, and a discussion of violations of consumer laws and regulations.  When examiners identify banks with weak and ineffective compliance programs, they document the weaknesses in the examination report and take appropriate supervisory action. Banks with a poor record of compliance are examined more frequently than those with favorable records. When necessary to obtain compliance with consumer protection laws, we can, and do, use our enforcement tools, ranging from nonpublic actions to public Cease and Desist Orders. However, most banks voluntarily address any violations and weaknesses in consumer compliance management programs that our examiners identify so we find public formal actions are not typically necessary. Important tools for examiners and financial institutions are guidance and examination procedures for enforcing the Federal Trade Commission Act's prohibition of unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices by State-Chartered Banks issued by the Board and the FDIC in 2004 outlines strategies for banks to use to avoid engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, to minimize their own risks and to protect consumers. Among other things, the guidance focuses on loan servicing and managing and monitoring creditors' employees and third-party service providers. The Federal Reserve's consumer compliance supervision authority extends to bank holding companies as well as to state member banks. In recent years, banking organizations have greatly expanded the scope, complexity, and innovation of their business activities. At the same time, compliance requirements associated with these activities have become more complex. To assist financial institutions in addressing these challenges, the Federal Reserve recently issued guidance in 2008 clarifying its expectations regarding firm-wide compliance risk management and oversight for both prudential and consumer protection supervision in Complex Risk Management Programs and Oversight at Large Banking Organizations with Complex Compliance Profiles. Further, Federal Reserve consumer compliance examiners routinely participate in the review and assessment of the adequacy of large bank holding company compliance risk management programs. In addition to its own supervisory efforts related to bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve, along with the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Trade Commission, and a number of state authorities, recently completed a pilot consumer protection compliance review as part of an interagency project to enhance the supervision of subprime mortgage lenders. Under the pilot project, the agencies coordinated to conduct consumer-protection compliance reviews at selected entities with significant subprime mortgage operations. The reviews included independent state-licensed mortgage lenders, nondepository mortgage lending subsidiaries of bank and thrift holding companies, and mortgage brokers doing business with or serving as agents of these entities. These reviews included targeted evaluations of mortgage underwriting standards, risk management strategies, and compliance with certain consumer protection laws. We are currently assessing the results of the pilot project. The results will guide the Board's decisionmaking as to how it may supervise these entities in the future.  4 BIS Review 34/2009 
Focus on fair lending enforcement Although the Federal Reserve's fair lending enforcement program is not intended to detect mortgage fraud, it is a vital component of the Federal Reserve's efforts to ensure fair access to responsible credit. The Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that every bank it supervises complies fully with the federal fair lending laws, the ECOA and the Fair Housing Act. Every consumer compliance examination includes an evaluation of the bank's fair lending compliance program, as well as an assessment of the bank's fair lending risk across all types of lending, including mortgage lending. Examiners also test the institution's actual lending record for specific types of discrimination, such as pricing discrimination in mortgage lending. A specialized Fair Lending Enforcement Section on the Board's staff works closely with staff at the 12 Reserve Banks across the country to provide guidance on fair lending matters and to ensure that the fair lending laws are enforced rigorously. When examiners find fair lending violations, the Board takes appropriate supervisory action. If we have reason to believe that an institution has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination under the ECOA, the Board, like other federal banking agencies, has a statutory responsibility under the Act to refer the matter to the DOJ, which reviews the referral and decides if further investigation is warranted. A DOJ investigation may result in a public civil enforcement action or settlement. The DOJ may instead return the matter to the Federal Reserve for administrative enforcement. When this occurs, we ensure that the institution takes all appropriate corrective action. If a fair lending violation does not constitute a pattern or practice, we similarly ensure that the bank takes all appropriate corrective action. In carrying out our supervisory responsibilities related to fair lending, Federal Reserve examiners perform many reviews to detect pricing discrimination, redlining, and steering in mortgage lending. These illegal practices can limit fair access to responsible credit, and make it more likely that minorities will fall prey to potentially abusive lending practices. Several of these reviews have resulted in referrals to the DOJ. In the past three years, we have referred fifteen matters to the DOJ and four of these matters have involved illegal discrimination in mortgage lending based on race or ethnicity. The Board referred two nationwide mortgage lenders to the DOJ because we determined that Hispanic and African-American borrowers paid more for their loans than comparable non-Hispanic white borrowers. These reviews resulted from a process of targeted reviews for mortgage pricing discrimination that the Federal Reserve initiated when the mortgage pricing data became available under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. We also referred a lender for imposing a restriction on rowhouse lending that resulted in discrimination against African Americans. Finally, we referred a lender for redlining. The lender's marketing strategy was based on negative racial stereotypes and, as a result, excluded a cluster of minority neighborhoods from its lending activity. Rules banning unfair and deceptive practices In addition to our supervisory activities, the Federal Reserve Board in 2008 finalized sweeping new rules for home mortgage loans to better protect consumers and facilitate responsible residential mortgage lending. The rules, which amend Regulation Z (Truth in Lending), were adopted under HOEPA, and prohibit unfair, abusive or deceptive home mortgage lending practices and restrict certain other mortgage practices. Importantly, the rules apply to all mortgage lenders, not just depository institutions supervised by the federal banking and thrift regulators. These rules resulted from a series of field hearings conducted by the Board in 2006 and 2007 and a review of approximately 4,500 comment letters representing a broad spectrum of views that were received in response to the Board's proposed rule issued in December 2007. The final rule adds four key protections for a newly defined category of "higher-priced mortgage loans" secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. The higher-priced thresholds adopted by the Board would cover all, or virtually all, of the subprime market and a portion of the Alt-A market. For loans in this category, these BIS Review 34/2009 5 
protections will prohibit a lender from making a loan without regard to a borrower's ability to repay the loan from income and assets other than the home's value. Second, lenders are prohibited from making "stated income" loans and are required in each case to verify the income and assets they rely upon to determine borrowers' repayment ability. Third, the rules restrict the use of prepayment penalties in cases where the borrower could encounter payment shock. Finally, creditors are required to establish an escrow account for property taxes and homeowner's insurance for all first-lien mortgage loans. In addition to rules for higher-cost loans, the Board adopted other protections that apply to all mortgage loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling, regardless of the cost. The rules prohibit lenders or brokers from coercing, influencing or otherwise encouraging an appraiser to misstate or misrepresent the value of the property. The rules also prohibit, among other things, servicers from engaging in certain unfair practices. I note that the Board is working on another important rulemaking action with other federal agencies and state organizations to implement the registration requirements for residential mortgage loan originators employed by federally supervised institutions, as required by the S.A.F.E. Mortgaging Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act). The SAFE Act, when implemented, will provide for increased accountability and tracking of loan originators in a publicly accessible database. Under the SAFE Act, an individual is prohibited from engaging in loan origination without obtaining and maintaining annually a unique identifier and either a license and registration as a state-licensed loan originator or a registration as a federal loan originator. Prevention and future challenges The Federal Reserve will continue to take actions against institutions that violate consumer protection or fair lending laws, engage in unfair or deceptive practices, or otherwise engage in unsafe or unsound lending practices. We will continue to focus on strong supervision to prevent the occurrence of these practices and violations. In addition to our own examination and enforcement activities, we will continue our efforts to coordinate with other law enforcement agencies to hold those who are involved in our supervised institutions accountable for criminal activities related to mortgage lending. Again, I want to thank you for the opportunity to discuss what the Federal Reserve does to address and prevent mortgage-related fraud and abusive lending practices in the institutions we supervise.  6 BIS Review 34/2009 
Duvvuri Subbarao: Retail payments – perspectives and way forward Valedictory address by Dr Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Regional Seminar on Payment and Settlement Systems, organised jointly by the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank for International Settlements, Mamallapuram, Chennai, 19 March 2009. *      *      * Introduction It is a great delight for me to be here at the conclusion of this seminar on Payment and Settlement Systems aimed at improving our understanding of the way forward on this vital segment of central bank infrastructure. Here, at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), we have traversed a steep learning curve over the last several years, and come a long way in implementing an efficient and effective payment system. I am deeply conscious of the fact that we still have a long way to go. On the way forward, we are challenged by the fact that the unknown unknowns are larger than the known unknowns, which in turn are larger than the known knowns. Our task on the way forward really is to learn from the international best practices and adapt them to the Indian context. Seminars such as this are, therefore, very rewarding learning experiences for us. I hope, the foreign participants too found this seminar useful, rewarding and, may I add, enjoyable.  I am told you covered many important topics over the last three days, and I gather, there is greater clarity on various issues such as the growing importance of retail payment systems, the relative roles of banks and non-banks in the payment systems, the main principles governing oversight, prepaid cards, aspects relating to cross-border remittance services and even issues pertaining to branchless banking.  I want to use the opportunity of this valedictory address to share with you the significant changes in the payment systems in India, the Reserve Bank’s role in this area and to look ahead at some of the challenges going forward. But first allow me a small digression. I hope you have all had some time off for going round and enjoying the sights and heritage of this famed part of India. Mamallapuram bears testimony to the rich, ancient culture of this region, which was long forgotten, thanks to rapid developments in its vicinity, leaving this once-upon-a-time great trading port almost at the brink of extinction. Nature too, played a role in the erosion of this piece of history. The Great Shore Temple that we see is believed to be actually one of an original seven pagodas (spires, temples), the rest having been eroded or submerged. Nature, once again, lent her helping hand, and I am told that after the tsunami of 2004, parts of the submerged remaining temples were visible, albeit briefly, when the waters of the ocean receded temporarily. We now have more “concrete” evidence of the role played by this small town in India's ancient trading culture.  The payment system and central banks  Let me now try to relate this to the payment systems of today. Payment and settlement systems play an important role in improving overall economic efficiency. They consist of all the diverse arrangements that we use to systematically transfer money – whether using currency, paper instruments such as cheques, or a variety of electronic channels. It is something we use every day. Indeed the ability to make and receive payments with confidence remains the cornerstone of any commercial activity and it is at designing, implementing and running robust payment systems that our efforts are focussed.  There has been a phenomenal change in the architecture and technology of payment systems in the last decade. Until just a few years ago, payments systems in India were BIS Review 33/2009 1 
almost entirely based on paper, with currency and cheques being the dominant form of payment for both retail and wholesale transactions. With technological advancement, it is today quite a complex collection of disparate arrangements, with different participants, different rules, and different processes in each place, but which all ensure quicker flow of money. Payment systems, therefore, have implications for the play out of monetary policy, and, therefore, form an important part of a central bank's mandate. The main concerns in ensuring robust payment systems are efficiency and safety of the systems. Internationally, the nature and intensity of central bank supervision over the retail payment systems vary considerably. In many cases, the oversight is limited to only systemically important payment systems. Some do it with explicit legal authority as in Australia, some based on their regulatory power on banks as in the United States, and some, as part of the broader financial stability objective, as in the United Kingdom.  Apart from economic efficiency, payment systems have a social dimension too as an efficient payment system is an important prerequisite for financial inclusion. The focus of attention in payment systems worldwide has traditionally been on Systemically Important Payment Systems. Of late, however, with financial inclusion becoming a major objective, the existence of efficient retail payment systems is being perceived as a significant public good, which deserves increased attention.  The importance of Payment and Settlement Systems prompted the Governors of the central banks of the Group of Ten (G-10) countries to establish in 1990 a permanent central bank Committee viz., the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS), as a successor to the Group of Experts on Payment Systems, set up by them in 1980. The CPSS was established to monitor and analyse developments in domestic payments and settlement systems, as well as in cross-border and multilateral netting schemes. The Committee has done some pioneering standard-setting work in this area, including in the emerging area of e-money. It is no coincidence that the CPSS Secretariat is located at the Bank for International Settlements, our co-host for this seminar.  Evolution of payment systems in India  Payment systems in India – like in most parts of the world – began as cash-based systems. The evolution over time of commerce and trade triggered varied payment instruments came into use in India. Even though the cash system dominated, there were some early payment systems not denominated in cash – such as the primitive form of the bill of exchange – the HUNDI – which continues to be in use in some form, in some parts of the country even today! With the advent of banking, cheque clearing through a bankers' clearing house, conducted on a net settlement basis, was the most predominant form of clearing and settlement, despite the inherent risks associated with net settlement systems. The electronic era in India began in the early 1990s when the Reserve Bank developed technology-based payment and settlement systems, and also took on the oversight of these systems. Let me give you just a few significant figures to illustrate our rapid transition from paper to paperless systems. The share of cheques in the total value of economic transactions (including through cash) declined from 5.2% in 2001 to 3.9% in 2008. The value of funds transferred through electronic means in the entire payment systems increased phenomenally – from about 2% a decade ago to about 74% now. The number of transactions in the retail system, inclusive of cheques, electronic payments and cards, is also striking, with seven million transactions per day, accounting for more than 95% in terms of the number of total transactions. This underscores the importance of continued focus on retail payment systems in India.  The growth of non-conventional forms of retail payment systems in India reveals an interesting trend. We are all aware of the role of credit cards in our lifestyles and spending patterns. In India though credit cards had a somewhat lacklustre beginning. I still recall how, 2 BIS Review 33/2009 
in the late eighties, when a government owned bank – what we, in India, call a public sector bank – undertook this pioneering activity, there were few takers for this payment mode. The Indian culture is to save and then spend, not spend first and repay later. The task for the public sector bank in the early years was therefore not so much to market a new product but to bring about a fundamental change in the cultural mind-set and attitudes. More importantly, making the merchant establishments accept credit cards for payment of goods and services was not an easy task either. Banks had to use innovative strategies (such as providing free credit cards for their own account holders, cards to even non-customers of the bank, enticing merchant establishments with schemes of discounts and rewards, etc.). Similarly, in the early stages of development, a few banks got together to inter-connect and share their ATMs. The initiative failed to get off ground and had to be abandoned. Yet, today, the key words in the financial sector are inter-connectivity and shared payment system infrastructure. You will be interested to know that today we have a national-level ATM switch, which inter-connects nearly 35,000 ATMs of banks, across the country. With the opening up of the economy, many more banks joined the credit card band wagon. Soon, some banks began aggressively pushing credit cards even to unwilling customers and there were also concerns about the methods used by entities to which the recovery function had been outsourced by these banks. The Reserve Bank, which was not much concerned about the low level of penetration of credit cards in the initial years, quickly stepped in to ensure fair practices and customer protection. The Reserve Bank also took upon the task of assessing the existing retail payment systems and laying out a clear road map for the future. Legal reforms constituted the first step in this direction. The Reserve Bank’s role The rapid expansion of the economy and the phenomenal increase in non-cash payment transaction clearly defined the task and the challenge for the Reserve Bank. This led to the 2007 Payment and Settlement Systems Act, the draft tenets for which were formulated by the Reserve Bank. This legislation provides a legal basis and framework for most of the requirements of payment and settlement systems. It also provides clear definitions relating to the process of netting and settlement finality and ensures full and final settlement to participants, with no recourse to roll back or reversal of transactions. The Payment and Settlement Systems Act also mandated the Reserve Bank to regulate payment and settlement systems, encompassing not only the system providers – which are most often the commercial banks – but also intermediaries as well as technology providers. We have just begun the process of authorisation of payment systems. Hopefully this will instil greater confidence amongst the users of such systems, in addition to ensuring that the systems are robust and well designed, based on sound principles of optimal risk management. We also believe they provide for high levels of reliability of operations and are in compliance with international requirements for combating money laundering.  To aid the Reserve Bank in managing this task of payments and settlements, a Board for Regulation of Payment and Settlement Systems (BPSS), comprising both the RBI management and external experts, was established. International experts, who have reviewed our legal framework and implementation systems, have endorsed the scope and coverage of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act. Recent initiatives and innovations  Safety is at the heart of payment systems. Recognising its importance, the Reserve Bank took the early initiative for creating a guaranteed platform for systemically important payment systems. The result was the establishment of the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) in 2001. The CCIL is owned and managed by commercial banks, and the Reserve Bank has no BIS Review 33/2009 3 
direct stake. You will recognise that this arms-length relationship is in accordance with the principles of good corporate governance. The CCIL functions as a Central Counter Party (CCP) for select categories of transactions such as those in government bonds, inter-bank foreign exchange market, call money market, etc., thus effectively managing, and mitigating, the counterparty risks arising out of possible default by any constituent. The CCIL platforms are all fully electronic with high levels of operational security and provide Straight Through Processing (STP). This is a unique initiative and has been widely acclaimed as a success. This infrastructure has efficiently mitigated counter party risks in over-the-counter (OTC) markets – which, you will note, were at the root of the crisis in the credit derivatives segment in the current global financial turmoil.  The Reserve Bank was instrumental in establishing in 1999 the INdian FInancial NETwork (or INFINET). The INFINET, similar to the S.W.I.F.T., is a platform for domestic transmission of inter-bank messages in electronic mode. The Cheque Truncation system, implemented by the RBI in India, on a scale not seen anywhere else in the world, is yet another landmark in the advance of payments and settlements. The system will help customers accelerate realisation of their cheques, leveraging latest technology.  I can claim with pride that state-of-the-art technology is a characteristic of many retail payment systems in India. It may be of interest to note that we have been using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based security in electronic transactions using the INFINET since as early as 1999 – many years before the international network-based financial message transfer systems, such as S.W.I.F.T., migrated to this technology.  In developing payment systems, the Reserve Bank had to be sensitive to and conscious of India's low levels of literacy, and its economic and cultural diversity. Accordingly, we developed local language-based ATMs, ATMs using VSAT-based telecommunication for difficult geographical terrain, solar power-based systems, and multi-application-based smart cards for small-value payments.  Building on these multidimensional efforts, the Reserve Bank is now facilitating the process of setting up the National Payments Corporation of India, under the aegis of the Indian Banks’ Association which will, in due course, provide and operate retail payment systems with the objective of ultimate settlement in central bank money.  Challenges  As technology relentlessly advances, payment mechanisms will expand and proliferate. This will make the task of the central bank more complex and challenging. Let me take a few moments to highlight some of the major challenges the Reserve Bank faces and the manner in which we are seeking to address them.  • The first challenge relates to the multiple roles of the central bank. In its developmental role, the Reserve Bank is an operator as well as a settlement provider for the many electronic payment systems. These include the Electronic Clearing Service (ECS-Credit and Debit Clearing and the National ECS) which is akin to the ACH services elsewhere in the world, the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) for one-to-one electronic-based credit-push funds transfers, etc. The operations of these systems will eventually migrate to the proposed National Payments Corporation of India, but until that happens, our challenge is to also manage the operational aspects of these systems with adequate firewalls.  • The Reserve Bank is statutorily empowered to regulate and supervise commercial banks. But the non-banks and other entities too provide vital payment system services and there was a need to bring these too under a unified oversight function. Towards this end, the Payment and Settlement Systems Act authorises the Reserve Bank to also regulate and supervise these non-banks and other entities. The second 4 BIS Review 33/2009 
challenge, therefore, is managing a myriad of service providers, all of who play an important role in the smooth operation of such payment systems.  • Another challenge for countries like India, which receive a large number of remittances from migrant expatriates, is to ensure the availability of an efficient, low-cost payment system for transfer of funds. Here, central banks of different countries will have to take a view on the role of non-bank entities in the process.  • Fourth, the high rate of technological obsolescence demands that such systems are subject to regular and continuous upgrades, not only at the service / settlement provider end, but also at the customer end. The problems faced in replicating a high-technology requirement across a large number of users are well known. Migration of magnetic stripe based cards to chip-based cards and the need for token-key-based authentication devices instead of a PIN are some aspects that may be impacted by costs as well as implementation-related logistics. Fortunately, in the Indian context, these are relatively easier to address since we joined the user-based technology band wagon at a later point of time. Of course, we cannot, and indeed should not, count forever on the advantage of leap frogging in technology, and going forward, our challenge is to be at the frontiers of best practice.  • The final challenge, and one that is growing in importance by the day, is to ensure the integrity of these systems against money-laundering and financing of terrorism.  Perspectives on the way forward  Let me now look ahead to some emerging opportunities, in retail payment systems and the tasks they set for central banks. According to international estimates, the volume of retail payments in major countries far exceeds the number of large-value transactions. These volumes offer opportunities for potential entrants / service providers to vie for market share. Users will also be willing to try out new systems which provide them with more comfort, ease of operation and efficiency. That said, central banks worldwide will have to remain ever vigilant to ensure that the new systems conform to the critical minimum requirements. Second, one of the advantages of multiple systems and service providers widen choice for the user. Competitive forces will, of course, ensure that the products and services are continually upgraded. More importantly, risks will be dispersed across many units and not bundled in just one basket. The need to regulate and monitor the operations of multiple entities will be an important challenge for central banks.  Third, market dynamics will ensure operational efficiency especially when volumes are substantial. A case in point is the Indian mobile telephone industry. When they were first introduced about a decade ago, the average cost of a mobile phone call used to be Rs.24 per minute (roughly half a US Dollar) and that used to be charged on both the caller and the call receiver. Today, India boasts of some of the world’s lowest per call rate – most local calls are charged only to the caller, and the per call rate is just Re.0.50 paise per minute (just about one US cent). A reduction of as much as one-fiftieth in the original call charges in so short a span of time calls for revisiting the Moore’s law! An encore of similar dramatic reduction in costs in the retail payment systems is not beyond the realm of possibility. A beginning has already been made in the area of ATM-based payments whereby no charges will be levied on customers for use of ATMs not belonging to their own bank, from April, 2009. Fourth, as retail payments go into large-scale expansion, new issues will emerge. The demarcating line between the large-value and the retail-payment systems is getting blurred. This calls for increased efforts to set up bench marks even for retail payment systems. Considering the risks inherent in such systems, fresh initiatives are needed to address BIS Review 33/2009 5 
customer-protection issues. These assume greater importance in the context of the increasing spread of the concept of branchless banking.  By all indications, retail payments are going to be the drivers of the future payment and settlement architecture. The Reserve Bank will take proactive steps towards their operationalisation but within a regulatory framework that will mitigate the risks. My staff have advised me that they already have a cryptology for risk management – RISK, which would take into account the following:  R – Recognition – to identify any risk early on and take proactive steps before it gets out of hand; I – Improvisation – of new methods, techniques and tools to secure better monitoring, and providing for a feed-forward rather than a feed-back system;  S – Segmentation – to address smaller systems and sub-systems individually so as to address their unique features while also being mindful of the systemic impact; and K – Knowledge – to enable knowledge-based decisions in a knowledge-powered economy, resulting in scientifically-engineered and output-oriented action. All the above efforts are aimed at providing a better risk management framework. Retail payments hold the key to the value chain as economies achieve progress in today’s complex world. Innovation, risk management, effort and increased international co-operation will be the key to success.  I hope you all profited from your participation in this seminar, and more importantly, enjoyed spending the last three days here in Mamallapuram. For my part, I must say that I greatly enjoyed being here. 6 BIS Review 33/2009 
Mary C Nkosi: Creating an environment for banks to operate effectively in Malawi Speech by Mrs Mary C Nkosi, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi, at the official launch of Dedza Agency, Dedza, 31 January 2009. *      *      * Dr Charles Mataya, who is representing the Board of Directors of the Bank The Managing Director of MSB, Mr Joseph Mwanamvekha  Valued Customers of the Bank Management and Staff of the Bank here present Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen It gives me great pleasure to preside over the official launch of the MSB Dedza Agency this afternoon. Let me begin by congratulating and commending the Board, Management and Staff of MSB for their untiring efforts in getting the Bank to where it is today. It is not too long ago when we heard of similar functions as the Bank launched its new outlets in the just ended year, 2008. Today we are here to witness the official opening of Dedza Agency. This is no doubt a visible sign evidencing the growth and expansion of the Bank and the Banking Industry in general. I have no doubt that the Bank is now well poised to effectively discharge its responsibilities on savings mobilization and financing of investments both in the rural and urban sectors of our economy. The business and economic environment is looking good for Malawi as banks require a sound economic environment in order to operate effectively and efficiently. The Reserve Bank of Malawi is sparing no effort in ensuring that it creates an enabling environment for banks to operate effectively in the country. As a result, more banks have come on the market and are willing to serve the rural and semi-urban communities owing to the ever improving rural infrastructure and conducive fiscal policies.  Statistics indicate that nearly a very large population of Malawi remains un-banked. It is therefore commendable to note that MSB has identified itself with the rural communities for a very long time. Through its wide rural network the bank has been able to take banking to the door steps of the rural people who would otherwise not be able to access banking facilities. The Bank, therefore, needs to leverage this network which is one of its strengths, to roll out products and services that should be convenient and easy to use by its client base. Let me take this opportunity to urge the Board, Management and Staff of the Bank not to relax in dealing with the many challenges that the Bank faces; particularly in spearheading bank penetration into the rural unbanked population.  The Bank must improve further its strategies for nurturing the existing customer base as well as for attracting new ones and growing its book. Customers must be kept satisfied with the quality of service being offered. I have no doubt that you will succeed in this endeavour.  In conclusion, I would like to challenge the banking institutions in Malawi to come up with strategies and plans, particularly in the area of access to credit by rural communities and other banking services by the Malawian entrepreneurs so that jointly we all play our part in the process of transforming the Malawi economy. The Central Bank as a stakeholder will continue to support efforts by banks in improving their service delivery systems for the betterment of all stakeholders.

Daniel K Tarullo: Modernizing bank supervision and regulation Testimony of Mr Daniel K Tarullo, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, US Senate, Washington DC, 19 March 2009. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate this opportunity to present the views of the Federal Reserve Board on the important issue of modernizing financial supervision and regulation.  For the last year and a half, the U.S. financial system has been under extraordinary stress. Initially, this financial stress precipitated a sharp downturn in the U.S. and global economies. What has ensued is a very damaging negative feedback loop: The effects of the downturn – rising unemployment, declining profits, and decreased consumption and investment – have exacerbated the problems of financial institutions by reducing further the value of their assets. The impaired financial system has, in turn, been unable to supply the credit needed by households and businesses alike. The catalyst for the current crisis was a broad-based decline in housing prices, which has contributed to substantial increases in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures and significant declines in the value of mortgage-related assets. However, the mortgage sector is just the most visible example of what was a much broader credit boom, and the underlying causes of the crisis run deeper than the mortgage market. They include global imbalances in savings and capital flows, poorly designed financial innovations, and weaknesses in both the risk-management systems of financial institutions and the government oversight of such institutions. While stabilizing the financial system to set the stage for economic recovery will remain its top priority in the near term, the Federal Reserve has also begun to evaluate regulatory and supervisory changes that could help reduce the incidence and severity of future financial crises. Today's Committee hearing is a timely opportunity for us to share our thinking to date and to contribute to your deliberations on regulatory modernization legislation. Many conclusions can be drawn from the financial crisis and the period preceding it, ranging across topics as diverse as capital adequacy requirements, risk measurement and management at financial institutions, supervisory practices, and consumer protection. In the Board's judgment, one of the key lessons is that the United States must have a comprehensive strategy for containing systemic risk. This strategy must be multifaceted and involve oversight of the financial system as a whole, and not just its individual components, in order to improve the resiliency of the system to potential systemic shocks. In pursuing this strategy, we must ensure that the reforms we enact now are aimed not just at the causes of our current crisis, but at other sources of risk that may arise in the future. Systemic risk refers to the potential for an event or shock triggering a loss of economic value or confidence in a substantial portion of the financial system, with resulting major adverse effects on the real economy. A core characteristic of systemic risk is the potential for contagion effects. Traditionally, the concern was that a run on a large bank, for example, would lead not only to the failure of that bank, but also to the failure of other financial firms because of the combined effect of the failed bank's unpaid obligations to other firms and market uncertainty as to whether those or other firms had similar vulnerabilities. In fact, most recent episodes of systemic risk have begun in markets, rather than through a classic run on a bank. A sharp downward movement in asset prices has been magnified by certain market practices or vulnerabilities. Soon market participants become uncertain about the values of BIS Review 33/2009 1 
those assets, an uncertainty that spreads to other assets as liquidity freezes up. In the worst case, liquidity problems become solvency problems. The result has been spillover effects both within the financial sector and from the financial sector to the real economy. In my remarks, I will discuss several components of a broad policy agenda to address systemic risk: consolidated supervision, the development of a resolution regime for systemically important nonbank financial institutions; more uniform and robust authority for the prudential supervision of systemically important payment and settlement systems; consumer protection; and the potential benefits of charging a governmental entity with more express responsibility for monitoring and addressing systemic risks in the financial system. In elaborating this agenda, I will both discuss the actions the Federal Reserve is taking under existing authorities and identify areas in which we believe legislation is needed. Effective consolidated supervision of systemically important firms For the reasons I have just stated, supervision of individual financial firms is not a sufficient condition for fostering financial stability. But it is surely a necessary condition. Thus a first component of an agenda for systemic risk regulation is that each systemically important financial firm be subject to effective consolidated supervision. This means ensuring both that regulatory requirements apply to each such firm and that the consequent supervision is effective. As to the issue of effectiveness, many of the current problems in the banking and financial system stem from risk-management failures at a number of financial institutions, including some firms under federal supervision. Clearly, these lapses are unacceptable. The Federal Reserve has been involved in a number of exercises to understand and document the risk-management lapses and shortcomings at major financial institutions, including those undertaken by the Senior Supervisors Group, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, and the multinational Financial Stability Forum.1  Based on the results of these and other efforts, the Federal Reserve is taking steps to improve regulatory requirements and risk management at regulated institutions. Our actions have covered liquidity risk management, capital planning and capital adequacy, firm-wide risk identification, residential lending, counterparty credit exposures, and commercial real estate. Liquidity and capital have been given special attention.  The crisis has undermined previous conventional wisdom that a company, even in stressed environments, may readily borrow funds if it can offer high-quality collateral. For example, the inability of Bear Stearns to borrow even against U.S. government securities helped cause its collapse. As a result, we have been working to bring about needed improvements in institutions' liquidity risk-management practices. Along with our U.S. supervisory colleagues, we are closely monitoring the liquidity positions of banking organizations – on a daily basis for the largest and most critical firms – and are discussing key market developments and our supervisory analyses with senior management. We use these analyses and findings from examinations to ensure that liquidity and funding management, as well as contingency funding plans, are sufficiently robust and incorporate various stress scenarios. Looking beyond the present period, we also have underway a broader-ranging examination of liquidity requirements. Similarly, the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the capital levels of banking organizations on a regular basis and discussing our evaluation with senior management. As                                                  1  See Senior Supervisors Group (2008), "Observations on Risk Management Practices during the Recent Market Turbulence)," March 6; President's Working Group on Financial Markets (2008), "Policy Statement on Financial Market Developments," March 13; and Financial Stability Forum (2008), "Report of the Financial Stability Forum on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience," April 7. 2 BIS Review 33/2009 
part of our supervisory process, we have been conducting our own analysis of loss scenarios to anticipate the potential future capital needs of institutions. These needs may arise from, among other things, future losses or the potential for off-balance-sheet exposures and assets to come on balance sheet. Here, too, we have been discussing our analyses with bankers and ensuring that their own internal analyses reflect a broad range of scenarios and capture stress environments that could impair solvency. We have intensified efforts to evaluate firms' capital planning and to bring about improvements where needed.  Going forward, we will need changes in the capital regime as the financial environment returns closer to normal conditions. Working with other domestic and foreign supervisors, we must strengthen the existing capital rules to achieve a higher level and quality of required capital. Institutions should also have to establish strong capital buffers above current regulatory minimums in good times, so that they can weather financial market stress and continue to meet customer credit needs. This is but one of a number of important ways in which the current procyclical features of financial regulation should be modified, with the aim of counteracting rather than exacerbating the effects of financial stress. Finally, firms whose failure would pose a systemic risk must be subject to especially close supervisory oversight of their risk-taking, risk management, and financial condition, and be held to high capital and liquidity standards.  Turning to the reach of consolidated supervision, the Board believes there should be statutory coverage of all systemically important financial firms – not just those affiliated with an insured bank as provided for under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act). The current financial crisis has highlighted a fact that had become more and more apparent in recent years – that risks to the financial system can arise not only in the banking sector, but also from the activities of financial firms that traditionally have not been subject to the type of consolidated supervision applied to bank holding companies. For example, although the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had authority over the broker-dealer and other SEC-registered units of Bear Stearns and the other large investment banks, it did not have statutory authority to supervise the diversified operations of these firms on a consolidated basis. Instead, the SEC was forced to rely on a voluntary regime for monitoring and addressing the capital and liquidity risks arising from the full range of these firms' operations.  In contrast, all holding companies that own a bank – regardless of size – are subject to consolidated supervision for safety and soundness purposes under the BHC Act.2 A robust consolidated supervisory framework, like the one embodied in the BHC Act, provides a supervisor the tools it needs to understand, monitor and, when appropriate, restrain the risks associated with an organization's consolidated or group-wide activities. These tools include the authority to establish consolidated capital requirements for the organization, obtain reports from and conduct examinations of the organization and any of its subsidiaries, and require the organization or its subsidiaries to alter their risk-management practices or take other actions to address risks that threaten the safety and soundness of the organization.  Application of a similar regime to systemically important financial institutions that are not bank holding companies would help promote the safety and soundness of these firms and the stability of the financial system generally. It also is worth considering whether a broader application of the principle of consolidated supervision would help reduce the potential for risk-taking to migrate from more-regulated to less-regulated parts of the financial sector. To                                                  2  Through the exploitation of a loophole in the BHC Act, certain investment banks, as well as other financial and nonfinancial firms, acquired control of a federally insured industrial loan company (ILC) while avoiding the prudential framework that Congress established for the corporate owners of other full-service insured banks. For the reasons discussed in prior testimony before this Committee, the Board continues to believe that this loophole in current law should be closed. See Testimony of Scott G. Alvarez, General Counsel of the Board, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Oct. 4, 2007. BIS Review 33/2009 3 
be fully effective, consolidated supervisors must have clear authority to monitor and address safety and soundness concerns in all parts of an organization. Accordingly, specific consideration should be given to modifying the limits currently placed on the ability of consolidated supervisors to monitor and address risks at an organization's functionally regulated subsidiaries.  Improved resolution processes The importance of extending effective consolidated supervision to all systemically important firms is, of course, linked to the perception of market participants that such firms will be considered too-big-to-fail, and will thus be supported by the government if they get into financial difficulty. This perception has obvious undesirable effects, including possible moral hazard effects if firms are able to take excessive risks because of market beliefs that they can fall back on government assistance. In addition to effective supervision of these firms, the United States needs improved tools to allow the orderly resolution of systemically important nonbank financial firms, including a mechanism to cover the costs of the resolution if government assistance is required to prevent systemic consequences. In most cases, federal bankruptcy laws provide an appropriate framework for the resolution of nonbank financial institutions. However, this framework does not sufficiently protect the public's strong interest in ensuring the orderly resolution of nondepository financial institutions when a failure would pose substantial systemic risks. Developing appropriate resolution procedures for potentially systemic financial firms, including bank holding companies, is a complex and challenging task that will take some time to complete. We can begin, however, by learning from other models, including the process currently in place under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) for dealing with failing insured depository institutions and the framework established for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Both models allow a government agency to take control of a failing institution's operations and management, act as conservator or receiver for the institution, and establish a "bridge" institution to facilitate an orderly sale or liquidation of the firm. The authority to "bridge" a failing institution through a receivership to a new entity reduces the potential for market disruption, limits the value-destruction impact of a failure, and – when accompanied by haircuts on creditors and shareholders – mitigates the adverse impact of government intervention on market discipline.  Any new resolution regime would need to be carefully crafted. For example, clear guidelines are needed to define which firms could be subject to the new, alternative regime and the process for invoking that regime, analogous perhaps to the procedures for invoking the so-called systemic risk exception under the FDIA. In addition, given the global operations of many large and diversified financial firms and the complex regulatory structures under which they operate, any new resolution regime must be structured to work as seamlessly as possible with other domestic or foreign insolvency regimes that might apply to one or more parts of the consolidated organization.  In addition to developing an alternative resolution regime for systemically critical financial firms, policymakers and experts should carefully review whether improvements can be made to the existing bankruptcy framework that would allow for a faster and more orderly resolution of financial firms generally. Such improvements could reduce the likelihood that the new alternative regime would need to be invoked or government assistance provided in a particular instance to protect financial stability and, thereby, could promote market discipline. Oversight of payment and settlement systems As suggested earlier, a comprehensive strategy for controlling systemic risk must focus not simply on the stability of individual firms. Another element of such a strategy is to provide close oversight of important arenas in which firms interact with one another. Payment and 4 BIS Review 33/2009 
settlement systems are the foundation of our financial infrastructure. Financial institutions and markets depend upon the smooth functioning of these systems and their ability to manage counterparty and settlement risks effectively. Such systems can have significant risk-reduction benefits – by improving counterparty credit risk management, reducing settlement risks, and providing an orderly process to handle participant defaults – and can improve transparency for participants, financial markets, and regulatory authorities. At the same time, these systems inherently centralize and concentrate clearing and settlement risks. Thus, if a system is not well designed and able to appropriately manage the risks arising from participant defaults or operational disruptions, significant liquidity or credit problems could result.  Well before the current crisis erupted, the Federal Reserve was working to strengthen the financial infrastructure that supports trading, payments, clearing, and settlement in key financial markets. Because this infrastructure acts as a critical link between financial institutions and markets, ensuring that it is able to withstand – and not amplify – shocks is an important aspect of reducing systemic risk, including the very real problem of institutions that are too big or interconnected to be allowed to fail in a disorderly manner.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been leading a major joint initiative by the public and private sectors to improve arrangements for clearing and settling credit default swaps (CDS) and other over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. As a result, the accuracy and timeliness of trade information has improved significantly. In addition, the Federal Reserve, working with other supervisors through the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, has encouraged the development of well-regulated and prudently managed central clearing counterparties for OTC trades. Along these lines, the Board has encouraged the development of two central counterparties for CDS in the United States – ICE Trust and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, in 2008, the Board entered into a memorandum of understanding with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to promote the application of common prudential standards to central counterparties for CDS and to facilitate the sharing of information among the agencies with respect to such central counterparties. The Federal Reserve also is consulting with foreign financial regulators regarding the development and oversight of central counterparties for CDS in other jurisdictions to promote the application of consistent prudential standards. The New York Federal Reserve Bank, in conjunction with other domestic and foreign supervisors, continues its effort to establish increasingly stringent targets and performance standards for OTC market participants. In addition, we are working with market participants to enhance the resilience of the triparty repurchase agreement (repo) market. Through this market, primary dealers and other major banks and broker-dealers obtain very large amounts of secured financing from money market mutual funds and other short-term, risk-averse investors.3 We are exploring, for example, whether a central clearing system or other improvements might be beneficial for this market, given the magnitude of exposures generated and the vital importance of the market to both dealers and investors.  Even as we pursue these and similar initiatives, however, the Board believes additional statutory authority is needed to address the potential for systemic risk in payment and settlement systems. Currently, the Federal Reserve relies on a patchwork of authorities, largely derived from our role as a banking supervisor, as well as on moral suasion to help ensure that critical payment and settlement systems have the necessary procedures and controls in place to manage their risks. By contrast, many major central banks around the world have an explicit statutory basis for their oversight of these systems. Given how important robust payment and settlement systems are to financial stability, and the functional                                                  3  Primary dealers are broker-dealers that trade in U.S. government securities with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

similarities between many payment and settlement systems, a good case can be made for granting the Federal Reserve explicit oversight authority for systemically important payment and settlement systems.  The Federal Reserve has significant expertise regarding the risks and appropriate risk-management practices at payment and settlement systems, substantial direct experience with the measures necessary for the safe and sound operation of such systems, and established working relationships with other central banks and regulators that we have used to promote the development of strong and internationally-accepted risk management standards for the full range of these systems. Providing such authority would help ensure that these critical systems are held to consistent and high prudential standards aimed at mitigating systemic risk. Consumer protection Another lesson of this crisis is that pervasive consumer protection problems can signal, and even lead to, trouble for the safety and soundness of financial institutions and for the stability of the financial system as a whole. Consumer protection in the area of financial services is not, and should not be, limited to practices with potentially systemic consequences. However, as we evaluate the range of measures that can help contain systemic problems, it is important to recognize that good consumer protection can play a supporting role by – among other things – promoting sound underwriting practices. Last year the Board adopted new regulations under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act to enhance the substantive protections provided high-cost mortgage customers, such as requiring tax and insurance escrows in certain cases and limiting the use of prepayment penalties. These rules also require lenders providing such high-cost loans to verify the income and assets of a loan applicant and prohibit lenders from making such a loan without taking into account the ability of the borrower to repay the loan from income or assets other than the home's value. More recently, the Board adopted new rules to protect credit card customers from a variety of unfair and deceptive acts and practices. The Board will continue to update its consumer protection regulations as appropriate to provide households with the information they need to make informed credit decisions and to address new unfair and deceptive practices that may develop as practices and products change. Systemic risk authority One issue that has received much attention recently is the possible benefit of establishing a systemic risk authority that would be charged with monitoring, assessing and, if necessary, curtailing systemic risks across the entire U.S. financial system.  At a conceptual level, expressly empowering a governmental authority with responsibility to help contain systemic risks should, if implemented correctly, reduce the potential for large adverse shocks and limit the spillover effects of those shocks that do occur, thereby enhancing the resilience of the financial system. However, no one should underestimate the challenges involved with developing or implementing a supervisory and regulatory program for systemic risks. Nor should the establishment of such an authority be viewed as a panacea that will eliminate periods of significant stress in the financial markets and so reduce the need for the other important reforms that I have discussed.  The U.S. financial sector is extremely large and diverse – with value added amounting to nearly $1.1 trillion or 8 percent of gross domestic product in 2007. Systemic risks may arise across a broad range of firms or markets, or they may be concentrated in just a few key institutions or activities. They can occur suddenly, such as from a rapid and substantial decline in asset prices, even if the probability of their occurrence builds up slowly over time. Moreover, as the current crisis has illustrated, systemic risks may arise at nonbank entities 6 BIS Review 33/2009 
(for example, mortgage brokers), from sectors outside the traditional purview of federal supervision (for example, insurance firms), from institutions or activities that are based in other countries or operate across national boundaries, or from the linkages and interdependencies among financial institutions or between financial institutions and markets. And, while the existence of systemic risks may be apparent in hindsight, identifying such risks ex ante and determining the proper degree of regulatory or supervisory action needed to counteract a particular risk without unnecessarily hampering innovation and economic growth is a very challenging assignment for any agency or group of agencies.4For these reasons, any systemic risk authority would need a sophisticated, comprehensive and multi-disciplinary approach to systemic risk. Such an authority likely would require knowledge and experience across a wide range of financial institutions and markets, substantial analytical resources to identify the types of information needed and to analyze the information obtained, and supervisory expertise to develop and implement the necessary supervisory programs.  To be effective, however, these skills would have to be combined with a clear statement of expectations and responsibilities, and with adequate powers to fulfill those responsibilities. While the systemic risk authority should be required to rely on the information, assessments, and supervisory and regulatory programs of existing financial supervisors and regulators whenever possible, it would need sufficient powers of its own to achieve its broader mission – monitoring and containing systemic risk. These powers likely would include broad authority to obtain information – through data collection and reports, or when necessary, examinations – from a range of financial market participants, including banking organizations, securities firms, key financial market intermediaries, and other financial institutions that currently may not be subject to regular federal supervisory reporting requirements.  How might a properly constructed systemic risk authority use its expertise and authorities to help monitor, assess, and mitigate potentially systemic risks within the financial system? There are numerous possibilities. One area of natural focus for a systemic risk authority would be the stability of systemically critical financial institutions. It also likely would need some role in the setting of standards for capital, liquidity, and risk-management practices for financial firms, given the importance of these matters to the aggregate level of risk within the financial system. By bringing its broad knowledge of the interrelationships between firms and markets to bear, the systemic risk authority could help mitigate the potential for financial firms to be a source of, or be negatively affected by, adverse shocks to the system.  It seems most sensible that the role of the systemic risk authority be to complement, not displace, that of a firm's consolidated supervisor (which, as I noted earlier, all systemically critical financial institutions should have). Under this model, the firm's consolidated supervisor would continue to have primary responsibility for the day-to-day supervision of the firm's risk- management practices, including those relating to compliance risk management, and for focusing on the safety and soundness of the individual institution.  Another key issue is the extent to which a systemic risk authority would have appropriately calibrated ability to take measures to address specific practices identified as posing a systemic risk – in coordination with other supervisors when possible, or independently if necessary. For example, there may be practices that appear sound when considered from the perspective of a single firm, but that appear troublesome when understood to be widespread in the financial system, such as if these practices reveal the shared dependence of firms on particular forms of uncertain liquidity.                                                  4  For example, while the existence of supra-normal profits in a market segment may be an indicator of supra-normal risks, it also may be the result of innovation on the part of one or more market participants that does not create undue risks to the system. BIS Review 33/2009 7 
Other activities that a systemic risk authority might undertake include: (1) monitoring large or rapidly increasing exposures – such as to subprime mortgages – across firms and markets; (2) assessing the potential for deficiencies in evolving risk-management practices, broad-based increases in financial leverage, or changes in financial markets or products to increase systemic risks; (3) analyzing possible spillovers between financial firms or between firms and markets, for example through the mutual exposures of highly interconnected firms; (4) identifying possible regulatory gaps, including gaps in the protection of consumers and investors, that pose risks for the system as a whole; and (5) issuing periodic reports on the stability of the U.S. financial system, in order both to disseminate its own views and to elicit the considered views of others.  Thus, there are numerous important decisions to be made on the substantive reach and responsibilities of a systemic risk regulator. How such an authority, if created, should be structured and located within the federal government is also a complex issue. Some have suggested the Federal Reserve for this role, while others have expressed concern that adding this responsibility would overburden the central bank. The extent to which this new responsibility might be a good match for the Federal Reserve, acting either alone or as part of a collective body, depends a great deal on precisely how the Congress defines the role and responsibilities of the authority, and how well they complement those of the Federal Reserve's long-established core missions. Nevertheless, as Chairman Bernanke has noted, effectively identifying and addressing systemic risks would seem to require some involvement of the Federal Reserve. As the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve has a critical part to play in the government's responses to financial crises. Indeed, the Federal Reserve was established by the Congress in 1913 largely as a means of addressing the problem of recurring financial panics. The Federal Reserve plays such a key role in part because it serves as liquidity provider of last resort, a power that has proved critical in financial crises throughout modern history. In addition, the Federal Reserve has broad expertise derived from its other activities, including its role as umbrella supervisor for bank and financial holding companies and its active monitoring of capital markets in support of its monetary policy and financial stability objectives.  It seems equally clear that each financial regulator must be involved in a successful overall strategy for containing systemic risk. In the first place, of course, appropriate attention to systemic issues in the normal regulation of financial firms, markets, and practices may itself support this strategy. Second, the information and insight gained by financial regulators in their own realms of expertise will be important contributions to the demanding job of analyzing inchoate risks to financial stability. Still, while a collective process will surely be valuable in assessing systemic risk, it will be important to assign clearly any responsibilities and authorities for actual systemic risk regulation, since shared authority without clearly delineated responsibility for action is sometimes a prescription for inaction. Conclusion I have tried today to identify the elements of an agenda for limiting the potential for financial crises, including actions that the Federal Reserve is taking to address systemic risks and several measures that Congress should consider to make our financial system stronger and safer. In doing so, we must avoid responding only to the current crisis, but must instead fashion a system that will be up to the challenge of regulating a dynamic and innovative financial system. We at the Federal Reserve look forward to working with the Congress on legislation that meets these objectives.  8 BIS Review 33/2009 
T T Mboweni: Central banks and financial stability – some lessons for the future Keynote address by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the 48th ACI World Conference, Cape Town, 13 March 2009. *      *      * Introduction Honoured ACI members, organisers, moderators, guests, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for the invitation to speak at this illustrious event. It is indeed a privilege and a rare opportunity to share some ideas about the state of the global financial system with market practitioners from across the world. It is difficult in the current circumstances to give an optimistic address. Nevertheless, I will try to avoid to paint too dismal and depressing a picture and instead will focus on things that we can learn from our recent experiences, to contribute towards a better future. The mood in the global economy has changed from almost over-exuberance to the depths of a recession in less than two years. We are certainly experiencing unprecedented events and the actions taken to restore stability and trust in the global financial system are surpassing previous ones. Judging from the programme of your conference, we expect that these issues will be discussed in greater detail over the next two days. This presentation will also make, towards the end, some comments about the state of the South African banking sector. It remains difficult to understand how various role players, including supervisors, central banks, rating agencies, multilateral agencies, governments, risk managers and highly competent private sector participants, failed to fully comprehend these developments that, with hindsight, were bound to bring us at some time to this point. Yet, the important thing is not to apportion blame, but to try and understand how we can avoid repeating the same mistakes. There are many lessons to be learnt, and we are of the view that these lessons can be valuable not only from the point of view of supervisors and policy makers, but also that of traders, bankers and other financial market participants. Clearly, as the situation is still unfolding, one can at best only talk of “preliminary lessons”. Lesson number 1: The sum of perfectly rational individual decisions doesn’t equal a perfectly rational market With hindsight, it is clear that, although individual institutions hedged, transferred and managed their risk exposures in very sophisticated ways, at a systemic level a point is reached at which it becomes impossible to fully diversify or transfer risk. The global financial system is a finite entity, and although risk can be passed around, it does not disappear. We had probably underestimated the inter-linkages of financial systems across the globe, and the extent to which globalisation had created a complicated network of circuits for the contagion of financial risk. The lesson to take forward is that we should never lose sight of the systemic implications of individual institutions, transactions and events. Financial stability is a systemic concept, and it will play a much bigger role in future and should be taken much more seriously than was the case during the exuberant years prior to 2008. Issues such as macro-prudential analysis and supervision, crisis preparedness and stress testing of the financial system are likely to feature much more strongly in our collective endeavours for years to come. BIS Review 32/2009 1 
Lesson number 2: If something seems too good to last, it probably is The current crisis resulted from a specific combination of a number of causes. For years, liquidity in global financial markets was mispriced, and therefore generally taken for granted. Interest rates were low, and huge profits were locked in through carry trades where funding could be obtained at a minimal cost in overnight markets, and invested in high-yielding longer-term assets, be it emerging-market financial assets, equities, securitised mortgage loans or asset-backed securities. South Africa was a beneficiary of this trend: between 2004 and 2007, net inflows recorded in the financial account of the balance of payments totalled R391 billion. If the inflows that are included under “unrecorded transactions” are added, this figure would be well over R500 billion. Compare this to a combined net outflow of around R23 billion over the prior four years. The advantages of these inflows were significant: they allowed the South African Reserve Bank to restore a fragile foreign exchange reserves position to a more healthy one, they helped the country to finance its current account deficit, to build infrastructure, to boost economic growth and to increase employment. Overall, they made the country slightly more resilient against the adverse developments that we are currently experiencing. However, we have been abruptly reminded that portfolio flows are fickle, and cannot be relied upon as a source of external funding when the tide turns. Even though South Africa still maintained a positive net balance on its financial account for the first three quarters of 2008, there were significant net outflows of portfolio investments as global investors were forced to deleverage. In addition, funding in the international markets has become much more expensive. We have also been reminded that markets move in cycles, and the fallacy of some people who advocated a “decoupling of emerging markets” or that “the business cycle has been conquered” has been proven to have widely missed the point. What is the lesson to be learnt? The lesson is that prolonged periods of high asset growth that are not fully justified by trends in the real sector are bound to correct. For example, how can house prices continue to grow at double-digit rates if economies grow by two to three per cent per year? How can the balance sheets of banks consistently grow four to five times faster than the underlying economy? How can off-balance sheet activities of banks consistently outpace on-balance-sheet growth without signalling some sort of distortion? How can profit targets and bonuses keep on rising year after year, while the underlying real economy is still very much the same? It is human nature to be more tolerant of continuous rises in asset prices than of price declines. Perhaps we should be more careful in future: if growth rates and price increases are not justified by developments in the underlying activity in the real economy, asset bubbles develop, and the effects when such bubbles burst can be very serious. Lesson number 3: The seeds of the next crisis are sown in the solutions for the current one Without having much choice, central banks and governments in (mainly) the industrialised world have taken unprecedented actions in their attempts to restore confidence in the financial system. These actions included significant liquidity injections, lowering of collateral requirements, asset swaps, longer-maturity refinancing operations, intervention in foreign exchange markets, co-operation among central banks in their market operations, monetary accommodation, quantitative or credit easing, capital injections into banks and other financial institutions, substantial fiscal stimulus packages and, in some cases, nationalisation of banks. Looking at the instruments available to banks and governments, there really are only a few that have not been used in one way or another during this crisis. Actions being implemented now may be the lifeline for the world financial system, but we are also well aware that they may, inherently, have negative consequences over the long term. The major central banks will have to plan their exit strategies well. Governments will have to 2 BIS Review 32/2009 
manoeuvre themselves out of their heavy indebtedness, the potential crowding out of the private sector would have to be addressed and some reasonable limits to moral hazard will have to be restored. In a recent speech1, Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, noted that “the striking feature of central bank lending and other government financial support during the current turmoil is the extent to which it has extended well beyond the boundaries that previously were understood to constrain such lending”, and that “the scope of the financial safety net ultimately must be rolled back”. Although inflation is currently not an issue that many people are worried about, we all know that the measures currently taken are potentially inflationary, and at some point this will have to be attended to. As one of our colleagues has remarked when “the house is on fire, we need all the fire engines on the scene, the mopping up operations will come later”. Lesson number 4: Every good party needs a strong bouncer In financial markets, the bouncers are the supervisors. Looking at previous issues of the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report, the BIS Quarterly Reports, and various individual central banks’ Financial Stability Reports, it is evident that many of the causes of the financial crisis had been noted, but that they had not been acted upon. As pointed out by our colleague Jean-Claude Trichet2 in his capacity as chairman of the Global Economy Meetings of central bank governors at the BIS – meetings that we also attend on a regular basis – several policy makers had indicated to market participants that they needed to prepare for a significant correction. With hindsight, there were clear danger signs that supervisors could possibly have countered more decisively. To list but a few of these warnings, excessive leverage through securitisation and re-securitisation, excessive dependence on short-term wholesale funding, a complete under-estimation and under-pricing of risk, in particular liquidity risk, skewed incentive structures, an overreliance on mathematical and statistical risk models without a proper understanding of their assumptions, dynamics and constraints, a blind reliance on credit ratings without properly analysing and understanding their methodologies and caveats, and a proliferation of financial innovation that resulted in complex products that were not well understood by those selling or buying them. However, supervisors and advocates of financial stability seemed powerless to address these issues while the party was still going on. Only weeks before being nationalised, Northern Rock reported record profits and was hailed for its innovative business model and financial strength, including capital adequacy. It is very difficult for supervisors to spoil the fun while everything is going so well. Yet, if supervisors and financial stability functions in central banks have to take on the role of bouncers, they have to have muscle! Much attention is currently given in international forums to strengthening supervisory and regulatory frameworks and to giving more legal powers to financial stability practitioners. For example, some of the recommendations that have been made by the Financial Stability Forum are to strengthen the prudential framework for banks, including with regard to capital, liquidity, risk management and market infrastructure, to strengthen the framework for transparency and valuation, changing the role and uses of credit ratings, and enhancing the responsiveness of authorities to risks and cooperation in dealing with weak banks.3  Other issues being addressed in various forums are ways in which the pro-cyclicality of financial regulations could be reduced, how areas of regulatory arbitrage could be eliminated,                                                  1  Lacker, J.

and how cross-border supervisory and crisis resolution frameworks could be strengthened, for example through supervisory colleges. Lesson number 5: Common sense should prevail A comment was recently made that perhaps one good thing about the current crisis is that engineering students will in future actually do what they have been trained for: to be engineers. In the past decade or so, the financial world has been taken over by mathematicians, statisticians, engineers and scientists. These professionals have made breakthroughs in the development of sophisticated risk management and valuation techniques, which contributed vastly to financial innovation and the development of new products. But we have probably over-relied on these models. After all, engineering is a different field from banking, finance and business management, and in many instances a great divide was created between the business acumen of boards of directors of banks, and the models on which the banks’ operations were based. While financial and risk modelling should continue to play an important role in future, it should be better balanced by basic business common sense, which should challenge the underlying assumptions of such models and attempt to understand their inherent limitations and constraints. Some comments on the South African banking system We would like to conclude this address as promised earlier, by making some comments on the South African banking system, and why it appears to have weathered the storm relatively well up to now. To date, South Africa’s banking system has remained largely shielded from the direct effects of the global financial market crisis, although our banks have been somewhat affected by the general re-pricing of risk and increases in funding costs. South African banks have very limited direct exposure to the troubled toxic securitised debt market in the US, partly owing to prudential restrictions on the type of assets and on the extent to which domestic banks are allowed to invest offshore. In addition, securitisation activities of our banks have been moderate and prudent. As a result, the high leveraging observed in some other jurisdictions has not been evident in the South African banking sector and our banks have continued to follow a fairly traditional banking model. Even more significantly, South African banks are predominantly funded by domestic deposits, and not through internationally held structured products. As at the end of December 2008, the total foreign-currency denominated deposits of banks amounted to R78,3 billion, and other foreign-currency denominated funding to R86,7 billion, together comprising 6,7 per cent of banks’ combined total funding liabilities of R2,4 trillion. Even of this relatively small amount, only a portion is provided by non-residents. South African banks are well capitalised, with an overall capital adequacy ratio of 13,0 per cent of risk-weighted assets under the Basel II measurement, as at the end of December 2008, which is 3,5 percentage points above the minimum requirement of 9,5 per cent. Even on the basis of capital to total un-weighted assets, they are not highly leveraged. Also noteworthy is that Tier 1 capital adequacy stood at 10,2 per cent. This high level of capitalisation makes the banking sector more resilient to economic shocks. Although some deterioration in asset quality has been observed over recent months (for example, impaired advances to gross loans and advances increased to 3,8 per cent by December 2008), this was more attributable to the tightening of domestic monetary policy and slowing growth than to the global financial crisis. These trends are not out of line with what would be expected in the current stage of the domestic economic cycle, and impaired loans are adequately provided for. The foreclosure procedures in South Africa are also different from those in the US, for example, allowing banks to recover a greater portion of their non-performing loans. In this environment, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) will continue to focus its monetary policy decisions based on the inflation outlook, within the context of its inflation-targeting framework whilst taking full cognisance of the global collective efforts to avoid a 4 BIS Review 32/2009 
deep recession. An improved inflation outlook, against a backdrop of slowing domestic and global growth, allowed the monetary policy committee of the SARB to reduce the policy rate by 150 basis points since December 2008, to 10,5 per cent. The SARB continued to drain significant amounts of liquidity on a net basis in order to maintain a shortage in the money market as part of our monetary policy implementation framework. The domestic interbank market continued to operate, with no anomalies observed in either the volumes or rates of interbank funding. In general, financial market stability continues to be observed in South Africa. Far from being complacent, however, we are monitoring the situation closely. Crisis preparedness is a key consideration for the South African Reserve Bank. In fact, in partnership with the World Bank we are hosting a regional crisis preparedness simulation test for the SADC region next week, to be facilitated by the Toronto Centre. We are also very conscious of the potential impact of the global economic slowdown on our own economy, and are starting to feel the painful effects of this through job losses, rising insolvencies and lower volumes of exports. In this regard, fiscal and monetary policies have to play a much more central role. Conclusion There is a G-20 meeting of ministers of finance and central bank governors taking place in the United Kingdom on Saturday, 14 March 2009. Many issues similar to those you might discuss here are also on the G-20 agenda. Hopefully, the G-20 conclusions will assist in taking us forward. Time is of the essence. I wish you well in your deliberations. Thank you very much. BIS Review 32/2009 5 
Mary C Nkosi: Promoting the development and regulation of capital markets in Malawi Speech by Mrs Mary C Nkosi, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi, at the official launch of African Alliance, Blantyre, 14 January 2009. *      *      * The Chairman of Malawi Stock Exchange; Board Members of African Alliance; Chief Executive Officer of African Alliance Malawi & officials from African Alliance Group; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen. It is an honour to be at the official launch of African Alliance Securities Ltd. As you are all aware, the Reserve Bank of Malawi is the regulatory and supervisory authority and is therefore charged with the responsibility of promoting the development and regulation of capital markets, amongst others. This is done through exercising entry control, on-going supervision, policy development, enhancing competition and market development, consumer education and protection, and exit administration. In this connection therefore, we are very pleased to be here to witness the birth of a new baby (the media often refers to such new babies as “new kid on the block”). For the benefit of the audience, African Alliance Malawi was licensed in September 2008. Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, we have observed in the recent times the favourable macroeconomic condition in the country and this has been instrumental in spearheading the expansion of capital market operations. The financial market has experienced rapid growth of market intermediary businesses and public participation witnessed by oversubscriptions during initial public offerings (IPO). The Bank has received a number of enquiries and applications geared towards carrying out brokerage, asset management and advisory services besides banking. The recent developments are an indication of potential and existing resources that need to be channelled from surplus units to deficit units and this is therefore an opportunity and also a challenge to all intermediary market players to facilitate the movement of these funds.  Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, on the supervisory side, the Reserve Bank shall continue to carry out its responsibilities to achieve its mission of ensuring the existence of a fair, safe, sound and stable non-bank financial services industry in Malawi in line with international supervisory standards. Critical in this regard and in order to protect investors, the Bank shall only allow eligible market players to operate on the market. It is expected that the players will conduct themselves in line with expected professional standards and conduct. I want to assure you that the Reserve Bank will perform its work with professionalism, integrity, impartiality and in a friendly and cooperative manner without compromising its authority or mandate. Our core strategic objectives which represent essential elements of our mission shall continue to evolve around developing capital markets and enhancing stakeholder confidence; providing a quality, professional supervisory and regulatory service; ensuring the existence of an all inclusive and regulated financial sector; and fostering a competitive, cost effective environment in the financial industry. The aim is to safeguard the financial sector and facilitate economic development through broadening and deepening of the capital market. In order to enhance the regulation and supervision of capital markets in line with international developments and standards, the Reserve Bank initiated the formulation of a new legislation, the draft Securities Bill. The Bill intends to repeal the Capital Market Development Act No 17 of 1990 (CMDA) which is considered to be less comprehensive in terms of coverage. The Bill is currently awaiting enactment by Parliament. These legislative reforms including the BIS Review 32/2009 1 
“Retirement Funds Bill” will provide an opportunity for new and extra resources in the securities market that will require your expertise to tap them on. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, the coming in of an additional player onto the market will bring competition, increase trading activity and improve price discovery which is an important function of an organized stock market. African Alliance Securities Ltd brings with them a dimension of “research” on the listed companies, which appears to be one of their fundamental skills, which has been erratic on the market. Thus we believe that credible and high quality research will keep investors more informed about the opportunities on the stock market and therefore stimulate well informed trading activity. We expect healthy competition whose benefits will trickle down to the investors and consumers of financial services. Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, before I end my speech, let me take this opportunity to express a concern. Last year (2008), the Reserve Bank received reports of fraud relating to share certificates allegedly perpetrated by senior members of the brokerage houses. Clearly, the reports tarnished the image of the market. While the market did not suffer severe damage, we wish to advise all players to ensure that there are internal controls within your institutions, to adhere to best corporate governance standards and to ensure that procedures are followed when handling clients’ funds. Let me appeal to African Alliance and all other market professionals to continually invest in their employees to ensure high standards in the market. Lastly, but not least, I wish to advise all capital market professionals to timely comply with the requirements of the Capital Market Development Act and its subsidiary legislation. Mr Chairman, Ladies and gentlemen, with these few remarks, I wish to officially welcome African Alliance Malawi to the Malawi Capital market and wish them the best of success. I thank you for your attention! 2 BIS Review 32/2009 
Miguel Fernández Ordóñez: Overview of the Spanish economy in 2008 Address by Mr Miguel Fernández Ordóñez, Governor of the Bank of Spain, to the Governing Council of the Bank of Spain on the occasion of the presentation of the Annual Report 2008, Madrid, 16 June 2009. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen,  The year 2008, the subject of the Annual Report I submit today to the Council, saw strains on international ﬁnancial markets heighten and turn into a global ﬁnancial crisis which ultimately triggered a widespread loss of conﬁdence and an unprecedented worldwide economic recession.  The ﬁnancial tensions pushed a large number of banks from a broad range of countries to the brink. And they have caused losses in the global ﬁnancial system which, with all the due caution any estimate calls for, amount to trillions of euro. The crisis affected all ﬁnancial markets, with some such as the asset-backed securities and interbank deposits markets brought to a grinding halt. The habitual stress indicators surged to all-time highs around October and remain at high levels despite the improvement in recent months. Clearly, the globalisation conducive to the growth of ﬁnance in recent years has also been instrumental in the swift and simultaneous spread of tensions, seeing them extend further.  Testifying to the real impact of the ﬁnancial crisis in all its harshness was the contraction of over 6% in the world economy at end-2008, and the decline in world trade of more than 20%, both in terms of annualised rates, with most of the more advanced countries in full-blown recession and with growth in the emerging economies dwindling substantially. The picture worsened further in the ﬁrst quarter of 2009, marking what currently appears to have been the crisis at its height. The improvement in the latest indicators suggest contractionary forces are abating, and the danger of a continuous deepening of the recessionary spiral appears to have been allayed.  A real and ﬁnancial crisis on the scale currently attained reveals deep-seated weaknesses that affect the structural interlinkages of economic systems. In principle, the severity of the crisis depends on the magnitude of the shock that triggers it and on the strength of the economies on which it bears down. Evidently, from this perspective, the increase in US subprime mortgage defaults, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and any episode that may now be singled out could not alone have triggered a situation of the seriousness and on the scale that we have seen. Rather, such episodes preyed on economic and market structures that were fragile and that had incubated unsustainable trends which could not be detected or corrected in time.  With hindsight, it was clearly a mistake to assume that ﬁnancial markets had virtually unfettered capacity to improve risk management, and to have given excessive leeway to self-regulation. Further, the continuous expansion of spending in some advanced economies on the basis of growing private debt was a key component of the so-called “global imbalances”, about whose dangers many reports warned. But the detection of the problem did not sufﬁce either to properly diagnose its potential scope or to act accordingly. Indeed, economic policies – and monetary and ﬁnancial policies in particular – were, broadly speaking, clearly excessively lax during the upturn.  Economic authorities now face the challenge of designing appropriate mechanisms to strengthen institutions in their economies and, once the crisis is behind us, to prevent such trends from recurring.  This challenge ﬁrstly involves a far-reaching review of some of the basic principles underpinning ﬁnancial market regulatory and supervisory policies in recent years. A new BIS Review79/2009 1 
balance must be struck between regulation and self-regulation, providing both ﬁnancial institutions and other investors with appropriate incentives to curb the natural tendency of ﬁnancial systems to accentuate business cycles. It will also be necessary to extend the purview of regulators and supervisors, avoiding the presence of “blind spots” in ﬁnancial systems, and seeking a suitable response to the fact that markets and many market players are increasingly more global, both in terms of the geographical scope of their actions and of the products they trade. The crisis has also highlighted the advisability of designing and setting in place a macro-prudential supervisory framework concerned with overall stability and which thus complements individual bank-focused microprudential supervisory conduct.  Macroeconomic strategies should likewise be reviewed in light of the shortcomings they have evidenced, in order to detect and correct in time the imbalances I referred to earlier. In the case of ﬁscal policies, greater emphasis on the sustainability of public ﬁnances in the medium and long term would have provided a more powerful countercyclical component to offset excessive private-sector spending. As regards monetary policy strategy, careful analysis should be made of the role to be played by the identiﬁcation and appropriate coverage of risks to stability that originate, develop and, in the worst-case scenario, materialise in ﬁnancial markets.  Fiscal and monetary authorities also share the substantial challenge of designing “exit strategies”. These allow, once the crisis has been overcome, for the winding down of the various measures that central banks and governments have adopted in the face of the risk that this crisis might bring the world economy to the verge of a depressive spiral with grave consequences.  The raft of measures adopted has been wide-ranging, and many are based on common principles jointly agreed upon in different international fora. Multilateral cooperation is crucial for successfully tackling a global crisis. Further headway must thus be made along these lines, harnessing opportunities such as that provided by the G20 meeting in London last April. Not in vain, one of the lessons to be drawn from past experience is that economic redeployment behind national borders and protectionism are sure-ﬁre recipes for exacerbating and prolonging global crises such as the present one.  Among the measures adopted, central banks in the advanced economies reacted decisively by providing abundant liquidity to ﬁnancial systems and substantially cutting their key interest rates. These standard monetary policy measures were later complemented by other, non-conventional measures. The European Central Bank began very early to increase liquidity assistance and, from October, banks’ applications for liquidity began to be met in full, while the range of ﬁnancial assets accepted as collateral for these operations was widened. The main reﬁnancing rate has been cut by 325 basis points to an all-time low of 1% following the May meeting. And, as regards extraordinary measures, the term over which liquidity is injected has been extended to 12 months, and funds are provided in currencies other than the euro, thanks to cooperation agreements with other central banks; the European Investment Bank has been granted the status of eligible counterparty, in order to smooth the course of the loans this institution makes to European SMEs; and the decision has been taken to purchase covered bonds and other similar types of asset-backed bonds. At the same time, an expansionary monetary impulse of unprecedented proportions was set in train in Europe, commensurate with the seriousness of the contractionary trends experienced in the real and ﬁnancial domain.  At government level, measures were aimed, ﬁrst, at supporting ﬁnancial systems and, further, at stimulating demand. Among the former, selective bail-outs of banks of systemic importance in the opening months of 2008 were followed, after the heightening of tensions in markets as from the summer, by the raising of deposit guarantee scheme limits, government-backed bank issues, public injections of capital and the purchase or the safeguarding of the value of troubled assets held by banks. All these measures were under the umbrella of the 2 BIS Review 79/2009 
common principles for concerted action, at the level of the Heads of State and of Government in Europe, and at the G20 meetings more globally.  Among the demand-stimulus measures, and aside from the operation of the automatic stabilisers, which are pivotal in economies such as Spain, measures based on increased public spending and aimed, on many occasions, at the groups and sectors most adversely affected by the crisis, tended to predominate. The European Economic Recovery Plan approved in December provides the reference point here for the coordination of measures in Europe.  The Spanish authorities have also adopted a broad set of similarly geared measures. These include the raising of the limit on deposit guarantees, the creation of the Fund for the Acquisition of Financial Assets to purchase high-quality assets from Spanish banks, guarantees for bank bond issues, various special ﬁnancing facilities instrumented through the ICO (Ofﬁcial Credit Institute), and the introduction of new personal income tax deductions and the launching of the State Fund for Local Investment and of the Special State Fund for revitalising the economy.  In Spain, the international crisis has impacted the economy at a particularly delicate time. Already under way was a process of adjustment of the imbalances that had built up over a long growth phase in which Spain had shared some of the above-mentioned factors of fragility of the world economy, though not all of them and not to the same degree of intensity. Certain components were undoubtedly particular to Spain.  Starting with the shared elements, the expansion of Spanish household and corporate spending was based excessively on debt. True, the private sector was starting from relatively low debt levels. Admittedly, too, euro area membership provided a particularly valuable framework of stability and broadened ﬁnancing possibilities. No less true, however, was the fact that the single monetary policy stance proved overly lax during all these years for Spanish domestic conditions and that ﬁscal policy, even though substantial budgetary consolidation was undertaken, was not enough to offset the excessive monetary looseness. A greater containment of current spending in the upturn would have helped curb the imbalances and would have strengthened the underlying budgetary position.  Other features of our expansionary phase were, however, more speciﬁc. In Spain, productive factors and ﬁnancial resources were overly concentrated in the real estate sector. Further, some of the structural constraints of our economy, such as productivity and the functioning of the labour market, did not show sufﬁcient improvement.  Another singular factor has been the position of relative strength from which the Spanish ﬁnancial system has faced the crisis. Spanish banks continued to pursue a “traditional” business model during the entire upturn, focusing on retail ﬁnancial intermediation. This is certainly the main reason why, as is widely known, the role of Spanish intermediaries in the generation, acquisition and ﬁnancing of toxic assets has proven negligible. As the system’s supervisor, the Banco de España also contributed to entrenching this relative strength, through a policy that focused on the cyclical pattern of building up provisions and on the rigorous deﬁnition of the scope of consolidation of ﬁnancial groups.  The Spanish ﬁnancial system was thus able to ride the ﬁrst wave of the crisis – the nature and origin of which, let me remind you, were strictly ﬁnancial – and readapted its sources of funding to the new market situation. Loan securitisation therefore left centre stage to deposits, short-term commercial paper issues and bank resort to the new abundant liquidity provision policy implemented by the ECB for the whole of the Eurosystem.  Nonetheless, the transformation of the ﬁnancial crisis into a real recession has given rise to a second wave of risks to ﬁnancial stability, whose nature is this time eminently macroeconomic. The Spanish ﬁnancial system is facing this second wave with the relative advantage of having been less damaged by the ﬁrst. But that is no guarantee of immunity since the deterioration of the Spanish economy exerts pressure, through various channels, BIS Review79/2009 3 
on banks’ and savings banks’ income statements. I shall discuss this when I turn to the ﬁnancial system, after having analysed the situation of and outlook for the Spanish economy.  The Spanish economy did not escape unscathed from the global contractionary trends, and in 2008 it underwent a far-reaching adjustment. Declines in GDP were evident from the third quarter, leading the economy to post a 0.7% fall in output at year-end in terms of its year-on-year rate. This recessionary pattern became more visible in the ﬁrst quarter of 2009, when GDP decreased at a year-on-year rate of 3%, while employment was down 6% on its level a year earlier. As at world level, the improvement since in the latest indicators appears to point to some easing of the contractionary trends.  The adjustment of the Spanish economy is impacting particularly those domestic spending components which showed the greatest excesses during the long upturn. The origin of this behaviour lies in the overlapping of a series of differing shocks. Firstly, the correction of the real estate sector and of the high level of private-sector debt, which had started prior to the crisis, already entailed significant elements of spending containment. Further, however, the forceful effects of the international financial crisis and of the global recessionary trends compounded this situation, amplifying the contraction of domestic demand, eliminating any possible external support and exacerbating the loss of confidence. This latter factor was, moreover, particularly affected by the impact of the far-reaching deterioration of the labour market on income expectations, an important matter which I shall return to later.  As a result of these factors, there was a marked decline in Spanish household spending, both on consumption and on residential investment. In 2008, both items accounted jointly for 80% of the decline in the contribution of national demand to output, which stood at slightly more than 4 pp for the year on average. Naturally, the heightening of the ﬁnancial crisis in the ﬁnal stretch of the year, and the subsequent deterioration in macroeconomic expectations, saw the contractionary impulses spread to the other components of domestic spending, meaning that business investment ultimately collapsed in the second half of the year. Indeed, the sole prop of spending in 2008 was net external demand, which showed a marked increase with a contribution of 1 pp to GDP growth for the year as a whole and of 2.3 pp in the ﬁnal quarter. Set against the progressive weakening of the world economy, this improvement in the external contribution was due to the notable slowdown in imports, whereby the fall in GDP is proving more moderate than in other countries.  The decline in residential investment, along with the sharp pick-up in the household saving rate to 13% of disposable income, entailed an abrupt reduction in household net borrowing, insofar as households generated a net lending capacity for an amount equivalent to 0.6% of GDP over the year as a whole. The slowdown in household debt intensiﬁed to the extent that the debt/GDP ratio began to fall in the closing months of the year. In the case of businesses, the decline in productive investment also led to a sharp reduction in net borrowing, which was ultimately manifest in a slowdown in the rate of increase of the debt ratio, although the interest burden still continued to increase.  As a result of the change in the sign and intensity of foreign trade, there has been a reduction in the nation’s high net borrowing, which stepped up in the opening months of 2009, as shown by the 25% decline in the ﬁrst quarter when compared with the same period a year earlier. Foreseeably, the decrease in the external deﬁcit will continue apace in the coming months, and it may have halved within two years, evidencing the speed of the adjustment induced by the depth of the contraction in domestic demand.   On the supply side, the weakness in activity passed through to all productive branches, but with particular force to construction and industry. Employment was rapidly eroded following fourteen years of uninterrupted job creation. In late 2008 and early 2009, job destruction was most intense and, since the labour supply remained notably strong, the unemployment rate surged to 17.4% in the ﬁrst quarter of the year, bearing down most on the young and the lesser skilled.  4 BIS Review 79/2009 
Regrettably, this high unemployment ﬁgure shows that one of the risks I referred to when presenting the Annual Report for 2007 has materialised. I insisted then on the need to prevent the adjustment of the Spanish economy from falling predominantly on employment, as in previous recessions, since that would have signiﬁcant adverse multiplier effects on demand and activity, via disposable income and future income expectations. And as stated, this is proving precisely to be one of the most powerful channels for the propagation of contractionary trends. One of the traditional behavioural patterns of the Spanish economy is thus recurring, revealing the persistent weaknesses in its institutional framework and arrangements that must be corrected.  The high increases in labour costs witnessed last year, reﬂecting the rise in inﬂation in the ﬁrst half of the year, were not favourable to employment. Wage cost pressures have only begun to abate in 2009, in line with improved inﬂation expectations, following the declines in the rate of change of the CPI in recent months.  Indeed, after inﬂation had moved on a markedly rising trend in the ﬁrst half of 2008, prices slowed sharply in the closing months of the year as a result of the abrupt turnaround in oil and food prices and of the marked sluggishness of demand. This deceleration has become more pronounced in 2009 to date, with the annual rate of change of the CPI falling in March, April and May (-0.9% in this latter month). While the CPI trajectory reﬂects the correction of some price rises in the most volatile components in the opening months of 2008, the ongoing recession, which is severely affecting consumption, is prompting an adjustment in prices and margins that is beginning to impact services and the other less volatile components. And this means that the price growth differential with the euro area has turned negative, and will foreseeably remain so in the coming months.  The CPI is expected to continue to temporarily post negative rates of change in the coming months and, once the statistical effect linked to higher oil prices in the ﬁrst half of 2008 is stripped out, inﬂation should resume positive although very moderate rates of change. This price behaviour is in line with the improvements in competitiveness required to lessen the scope and costs of the recession, to prompt the necessary adjustments and to embark on a sound recovery.  The outlook for the Spanish economy points to declines in GDP over the rest of the year that should lead to a signiﬁcant fall in 2009, albeit slightly lower than is forecast for other European countries. It is highly likely that the worst of the contraction has already passed, and that the intensity of the restrictive impulses will begin to diminish in the second half of the year as the broad range of measures implemented progressively deploy their effects. As a result, the fall in activity in 2010 is expected to be less pronounced. The course of employment in this scenario, in any event, is a cause for concern; despite the somewhat more positive signals given by some recent indicators, linked in part to seasonal factors, job destruction may run for some time and the unemployment rate may continue further on its rising trend.  The imbalances built up during the long expansionary phase, in the form of the inﬂation differential and the resort to external ﬁnancing, are being swiftly reabsorbed, providing an unquestionable source of relief in the global outlook described. Yet this rapid correction is occurring on the back of an excessive brake on activity, entailing major costs in terms of job destruction, higher unemployment and the deterioration of the productive fabric. If the institutional features behind these developments are not reformed, there is a risk that, even after the most acute phase of the crisis is over, they will continue to hold back the Spanish economy’s possibilities of recovery and become a drag on further progress in real convergence with Europe.  To rebuild sound foundations for growth, economic policy should contribute to setting in place the appropriate conditions to revive conﬁdence, to return ﬁnancing ﬂows to normal and to reinvigorate spending plans. That will require headway in restoring health to the ﬁnancial position of the private sector and the banking system, the completion of the adjustment in the BIS Review79/2009 5 
real estate sector and, above all, improvements in productivity, competitiveness and job creation incentives.  The correction in the construction sector is proving most intense. And although there is still a sizeable stock of unsold housing, the reduction in interest rates and in house prices will no doubt make the residential market more accessible. Cheaper borrowing terms and the easing of credit restrictions will also help breathe new life into spending. But it will be the recovery in external demand, as we move out of the international crisis, that will act as the main support. And the more competitive national production is, the more powerful this effect will be. To this end, and as frequently indicated by the Banco de España, sustained increases in productivity must be attained and the pertinent cost, margin and price adjustments made.  The scale of the global recession called for the implementation of demand-side expansionary ﬁscal and monetary policies. And it is in this context that the substantial cuts in central bank intervention rates seen over the past year should be understood, cuts that have been conducive to a signiﬁcant decline in the cost of ﬁnancing and to a sharp expansionary stimulus. In Spain, the potential effects of this pass-through are particularly powerful as a result of the prevalence of ﬂoating interest rate loans. Spain, too, has moved to adopt demand-stimulating discretionary ﬁscal measures in order to bolster the expansionary impact of the substantial transfers of income to the private sector, especially to households, arising from the operation of the automatic stabilisers. The ﬁscal drive by the Spanish authorities is of a considerable scale and generally exceeds that of other developed countries. Its budgetary impact has been accentuated, moreover, by the sharp fall in tax revenue as a consequence of the economic recession and of the magnitude of the real estate adjustment; accordingly, the ﬁscal situation has deteriorated rapidly.  It should be recalled that the Spanish economy started from a healthy budgetary position, with a surplus of somewhat over 2 pp of GDP and a very low public debt ratio compared with our European counterparts. Indeed, at last year’s presentation of the Annual Report to the Council, I referred to budgetary policy as one of the main underpinnings of the Spanish economy in this phase of the cycle and I pointed out that the favourable ﬁscal position would allow the automatic stabilisers to operate to their full extent without jeopardising budgetary stability.  One year on, the ﬁscal results for 2008 and the projections available – which point to a budget deﬁcit approaching 10% of GDP in 2010 and to a public debt ratio that might exceed the threshold of 60% of GDP – augur a drastic change in outlook, with the possibilities of ﬁscal policy boosting spending having been exhausted.  Fiscal measures that call into question the commitment to budgetary stability in the medium term should be categorically avoided, since that would adversely affect the cost of raising funds and conﬁdence in the Spanish economy, and it could also generate expectations of future tax rises that might ultimately sterilise the expansionary effects of the measures adopted. Public-sector debt must be prevented from becoming an obstacle once the Spanish economy is better placed to grow. Accordingly, priority must be given to promptly deﬁning a credible strategy to reduce the deﬁcit to levels compatible with budgetary stability, once the exceptional circumstances that led to the rise in the deﬁcit have disappeared.  The demand-side expansionary ﬁscal and monetary impulses are proving very powerful and are contributing to the alleviation of the contractionary forces at play. Evidently, though, the possibilities of further using these types of policies have become notably constrained, both at home and abroad. It should also be borne in mind that, once the economic and ﬁnancial fragility beleaguering the world economy has been resolved, demand-side policies should adopt a more neutral stance.  All these considerations on the diagnosis of the Spanish economy in the current international crisis and on the limited leeway available to demand-side policies mean, rather, that 6 BIS Review 79/2009 
economic policy has a central role to play in implementing the reforms that help improve productivity and the behaviour of the factor and product markets. It is in this area that the authorities undoubtedly have effective room for manoeuvre, and also considerable responsibility.  Let me begin with the labour market, which is where the most pressing problems are to be found. The scale of job destruction has once more highlighted the existence of distortions that emerge with force in recessions and compound contractionary trends. And there is a risk that, as in the past, the surge and change in level in unemployment may stick and that this will delay subsequent recovery. Labour market dysfunctions are also closely linked to the discouraging behaviour of the economy in respect of gains in economic efﬁciency and in productivity, hampering the possibility of attaining genuine improvements in competitiveness and of raising growth potential. Economic recovery in Spain requires structural changes that will encourage technologically dynamic productive sectors with high growth potential to take up the baton from construction. For this to occur, the labour market must function so as reallocate resources, increase and adapt workers’ skills to new demands, and make productive processes within companies more efﬁcient.  Reform should focus on ensuring that labour conditions adjust to the economy’s different cyclical junctures and, in particular, to the speciﬁc circumstances companies or productive sectors face. That should prevent the adjustment coming about through pushing large numbers of workers out of the market. Changes are also needed in hiring arrangements. These must allow workers who have lost their jobs to return promptly to active working life, so they do not spend long periods unemployed, the consequences of which were so adverse in the past. Improvements in labour market intermediation systems and in mobility and training for the unemployed are also very important.  Resolute action here would help check business closures and lessen the risk of decapitalisation, which is admittedly very high at present. If, moreover, signiﬁcant progress were made in eliminating administrative formalities, the Spanish economy would be better placed to resume a high growth rate once the world recovery began.  To bring about a new productive pattern enabling high rates of potential growth to be regained, structural measures must span a wide range of ﬁelds. Improving the level of educational attainment of the labour force is vital for raising the quality and productivity of human capital. Decisive and effective action in boosting the knowledge economy should contribute to substantially increasing technological capital and to bridge the gap blighting the Spanish economy in this area. And improving the competitive environment in which businesses take their decisions is crucial if all these steps are to result in overall gains in efﬁciency and competitiveness. One key area for progress along these lines is liberalisation in the services sector, which encompasses some of the most dynamic activities with the greatest employment-generating capacity and where new forms of labour relations may be more successful. Further, the growing interaction between industry and services has increased the inﬂuence of the latter in determining international competitiveness. It is likewise necessary to continue pushing through liberalisation and competition in the network industries, so that the conditions in which inputs are provided to other productive activities allow Spanish companies to compete on an equal footing with other developed countries. The liberalising impulse must be regained, in particular, in the energy, telecommunications and rail transport sectors.  I shall devote the ﬁnal part of my address to analysing the situation of the Spanish banking system in greater detail.  An economic environment marked by a real and ﬁnancial global crisis poses a ﬁrst-order challenge to the normal pursuit of banking activity. As stated, the ﬁrst wave of shocks, conﬁned essentially to the ﬁnancial arena, did not have appreciable direct effects on our banks, and the indirect effects were absorbed in an orderly fashion. However, as from last BIS Review79/2009 7 
autumn a second wave of shocks was unleashed, resulting in a real global crisis which, naturally, is impacting Spanish banks.  The Spanish economy’s entry into recession has consequences for banking and bad debts. In particular, such repercussions include those arising from the high sensitivity of employment – and, therefore, of households’ ability to pay – to the deterioration in activity, and those from the adjustment of the real estate sector, the relative weight of which in bank balance sheets had become signiﬁcant.  The deterioration in the economic situation reduces the demand for credit of bank customers, whose spending plans and income expectations are normally revised downwards during economic downturns. Likewise, banks become more cautious about granting loans as a result of the subsequent upward revision of the risk proﬁle of borrowers. In combination, these two factors translate, as we have actually seen, into a substantial slowdown in bank credit. Based on the past cyclical behaviour of this variable, the growth rate of bank credit will tend to stand below that of GDP. This cyclical component of credit is currently being reinforced by the difﬁculties still besetting wholesale funding markets and by the need both in Spain and in the rest of the international ﬁnancial system to redress the high levels of leverage attained in the past.  The behaviour of banks’ bad debts also follows certain cyclical patterns. Defaults increase when, as now, the deterioration in activity weakens the ﬁnancial position of bank customers, particularly in the case of households whose members lose their job. Thus, following a long economic boom that brought doubtful assets ratios to historically low levels, the year 2008 saw a sharp rise in such ratios, and the persistence of difﬁculties in the real sector of our economy suggests that pressures have not yet dissipated. This is a risk that banks must be mindful of and manage appropriately.  The diminished pace of activity and the increase in bad debts, which are general trends across Spanish banks and savings banks, exerted pressure on their income statements already in 2008. The recurring income inherent in a traditional banking model, which is therefore less reliant on ﬁnancial market developments, explains why, despite the difﬁcult economic circumstances, bank results were positive, in clear contrast to those reported by many of the institutions in other developed countries’ banking systems.  But Spanish banks’ results will come under considerable pressure in the future. In the short term, as a result of the foreseeable increase in bad debts. In the medium term, because competition for funds will squeeze operating margins and this pressure will not be readily offset as it was in the past by the generation of higher volumes of business. And I do not believe that the ongoing deleveraging of the ﬁnancial sector, and of the economy in general, taking place both in Spain and globally, should be viewed as transitory. Nor does it seem feasible that further substantial contributions of private capital will be forthcoming if the tensions on international ﬁnancial markets do not subside.  From an overall perspective the Spanish system is in a position to overcome all these challenges, though as I have reiterated, talk of immunity is completely out of place. Indeed, not all banks are in the same position when it comes to coping with the tensions. This is because they have pursued different lending policies over recent years in terms of the rate of expansion of loans and of the degree of risk concentration. Even among banks that have followed similar strategies, notable differences can be identiﬁed regarding the selection of speciﬁc risks, their ability to manage them and the buffers, in terms of proﬁtability and solvency, available to them to alleviate the effects of any risks that may materialise.  For all these reasons banks should make the changes necessary to adapt to the new circumstances. These changes unavoidably involve stepping up efforts to rationalise operating costs and to correct the overcapacity in the sector which arises from a worldwide tendency towards lower levels of leverage.  8 BIS Review 79/2009 
This overcapacity in the banking industry should be tackled through restructuring processes that allow a sound and efﬁcient ﬁnancial intermediation system to take root. Such a system is a strength of the Spanish economy which should be preserved so that, once the crisis is behind us, a sustainable growth path underpinned by the efﬁcient allocation of all resources, including ﬁnancial ones, may be resumed.  This central role of a ﬁnancial intermediation system explains why the State has, in addition to other support measures I have previously discussed, shown its readiness, like other governments, to provide capital to viable credit institutions that need it. These contributions, or any other assistance, must nevertheless be conditional upon the restructuring of the institutions that receive these public funds, so as to seek both the lowest cost for taxpayers and maximum efﬁciency. This approach squares fully with the common principles agreed upon in the international fora of which Spain is a member, and which have been backed expressly by Parliament with a broad consensus. Hopefully, these principles and this spirit of cooperation in matters relating to the stability and resilience of our ﬁnancial system may soon result in a series of legal provisions that reinforce the ability to deal with potential problems, in line with the tradition of the Banco de España and in keeping with the speciﬁc nature of the tensions we are currently experiencing.  Cooperation, in this case among international authorities, will also be necessary to further the design of the new, globally applicable guiding principles for the working of markets and ﬁnancial – banking and non-banking alike – intermediaries. Earlier I referred brieﬂy to the signiﬁcant challenges emerging in this area. Allow me succinctly to review some of the work and recommendations under way in different fora to palliate the structural weaknesses highlighted so starkly by the current crisis and to lay the foundations for a new and more solid international ﬁnancial structure.  From the banking regulation perspective, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is entrusted with implementing the recommendations made by the Financial Stability Board, along with the plan of action that arose from the November 2008 G20 meeting, which was subsequently ratiﬁed at the April 2009 meeting. The work programme the Basel Committee has set itself covers various areas, including most notably the improvement of asset risk assessment and management by banks, the adjustments needed to the eligibility of capital instruments, the new requirements for liquidity risk, and matters concerning transparency and market reporting.  In the supervisory domain I should like to highlight the so-called Larosière Report, drafted by a group of high-level independent experts which was set up on the request of the President of the European Commission. Their mandate was to draw up proposals for improving supervisory arrangements in the European Union. Included in the group was an ex-Director General of our institution. The Report contains 31 recommendations whose ultimate aim is to reduce the likelihood of a crisis such as the present one recurring and, should it recur, to ensure its costs are minimal. I shall focus, however, only on those recommendations bearing directly on the structure of ﬁnancial supervision in Europe in its microprudential and macroprudential facets.  As regards microprudential supervision, the Report proposes the creation of a European Financial Supervision System. Under this system, the current Level 3 Committees for banking, insurance and securities would be transformed into three European supervisory authorities with the power to take binding decisions in certain ﬁelds.  As to macroprudential supervision, the creation of a European Systemic Risk Board was proposed. Its main purpose would be to detect general risks, apprising the competent European authorities thereof, where pertinent, so they might take the appropriate decisions.  These are some of the initial steps of a process which will no doubt be long, but which will profoundly affect the systems of each and every European country. It is thus important that Spain should participate actively in the work of these international fora. In this respect, it is most satisfying that Spain has been welcomed as a member of the Financial Stability Board, BIS Review79/2009 9 
the successor of the Financial Stability Forum created in 1999, in which we had not hitherto participated. To be sure, the Banco de España’s experience in the design and implementation of a regulatory and supervisory system that has proven most effective during this crisis has been one of the factors that have helped Spain merit this position.  And here I shall conclude, though not without ﬁrst thanking the Governing Council, the Executive Commission, the Directors General and all our staff for their work this year. I should like to single out two people to thank: José Viñals, who has been with me at the helm of this institution over the past three years, and Javier Aríztegui, who has replaced him and assumed the key post of Deputy Governor of the Banco de España. I can safely say that, thanks to everybody’s efforts, the Bank has been able to creditably perform the tasks entrusted to it. As stated in my address today, new major challenges will arise in the coming months, linked closely to the emergence from the exceptional situation experienced by the markets and ﬁnancial institutions over the past two years, and these will no doubt affect the core functions the Bank has to perform. I am sure I can count on the support of all of you to tackle them satisfactorily. 10 BIS Review 79/2009 
Njuguna Ndung’u: Financial sector performance in Kenya Remarks by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, on the occasion of the Silver Jubiliee Celebrations for Family Bank Limited, Nairobi, 22 June 2009. *      *      * Your Excellency Honourable Mwai Kibaki, President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kenya;  Honourable Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance; Mr. Titus Muya, Chairman, Family Bank Ltd.; Mr. Peter Kinyanjui, Chief Executive, Family Bank Ltd.; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen: I am delighted to be here this morning to join with Family Bank in celebrating twenty five years of providing financial services to Kenyans. Allow me at the onset to appreciate the presence of His Excellency the President. I also wish to salute the Board, Management and Staff of Family Bank for successfully serving Kenyans for the last twenty five years. For most of the twenty five years of its’ existence, Family Bank operated as a building society with a microfinance focus. In the last two years, the institution has operated as a commercial bank and has registered a commendable performance. In 2008, the institution recorded a profit before tax of Kshs. 530.7 million and opened 9 branches countrywide increasing its’ branch network to 43. This is a sterling performance, but there still remains room for further expansion and improvement. Your Excellency The banking sector continues to exhibit resilience in the face of various local and global turbulences. The sector has also continued to grow and now consists of 43 commercial banks, 2 mortgage finance houses and 123 foreign exchange bureaus. The first Deposit Taking Microfinance Institution was also launched last week. Allow me to mention some indicators of the financial sector performance that painted a rosy picture in the last 12 months to April 2009: • The Sector’s assets increased by 12% from Kshs. 1.09 trillion in April 2008 to Kshs. 1.23 trillion at the end of April 2009 as banks continued to expand their lending portfolio. • Deposits increased from Kshs. 880bn in April 2008 to Kshs. 940 bn on the back of deposit mobilization and expansion of branch networks by banks. • The Capital Adequacy Ratio stood at 19.8% above the statutory minimum of 12%. This is an indicator that the sector has a cushion against periodic shocks. • The sector’s average liquidity at end of April 2009 was 41.6% well above the statutory minimum of 20%. • The number of people employed by the sector increased from 24,911 at the end of April 2008 to 25,498 at the end of April 2009. • The number of branches at the end of April 2009 stood at 904 an increase of over 100 branches from the corresponding period in 2008. Your Excellency, the strength of the Kenyan banks is now being felt in the region. There is a growing trend by Kenyan banks to expand their operations regionally particularly within the East African Community. This is in response to the regional expansion by businesses resulting from the drive towards integration. BIS Review79/2009 1 
The five East African Central Banks therefore signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) early this year. The MOU will facilitate information sharing and supervisory co-operation amongst the Central Banks particularly for regional banking groups. This arrangement will serve to mitigate cross border risks that regional banking groups may pose to the financial sectors of the East African countries. On the domestic front, banks are also venturing into capital markets, insurance and the retirement benefits sectors. Supervisory co-operation and co-ordination is therefore also paramount for effective regulation and supervision of domestic financial conglomerates. The Central Bank is working with the other domestic financial sector regulators i.e. Capital Markets Authority, Insurance Regulatory Authority and the Retirement Benefits Authority to finalize an MOU that will facilitate information sharing and supervisory co-operation particularly for the emerging financial conglomerates. This domestic supervisory co-operation and coordination will mitigate the systemic risk posed by players operating in the different sub-sectors of the financial system. Your Excellency A stable and efficient banking system provides a safe haven for the savings for Kenyans. The banking sector is therefore well poised to tap into the vast reservoir of savings that remain outside the formal banking space. But this can only be done through cost effective and innovative products, as well as improving access to financial services. Savings mobilization will undoubtedly support investments in the economy. Such investments will increase employment and uplift living standards of Kenyans. This will be important in achieving not just Kenya’s Vision 2030 aspirations but also the Millennium Development Goals. The Central Bank will therefore continue to partner with banks and other market players to ensure that the sector plays its’ rightful role in Kenya’s development agenda. It is now my honour and singular pleasure to invite the Honorable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance to make his remarks. Honorable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, you have the floor. 2 BIS Review 79/2009 
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi: The world after the crisis – designing the future. A monetary order for the XXI century Speech by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Aspen Institute Italia, World Economy Conference, Villa Madama, Rome, 23 June 2009. *      *      * I would like first of all to thank the organisers for inviting me to participate in this panel discussion on a new Monetary Order for the XXI Century.1 The title seems to suggest that we had a monetary order in the previous century, but then we lost it in the course of this decade and we now need something new. In fact, we have been searching for a new monetary order since the fall of the Bretton Woods agreement, in the summer of 1971, and even that order was not so orderly, after all.  I will not try to define what a monetary order is.2 What we ultimately need is a framework in which payment flows between residents of different countries ensure smooth trading in goods, services and financial assets. It matters not only because international trade is an engine for growth but also because payments imbalances are a natural result of non-barter economies. Actually, the more developed the financial sector is, the easier it is to finance an imbalance between inward and outward payments, to the extent that the debt can be repaid or the credit can be cashed in. We could thus define a viable monetary order as one in which the credibility of the debtor and in the worthiness of the creditor can be maintained, while preserving the stability of the underlying real and financial markets. We know that a country’s purchases of goods and services from the rest of the world do not match at each and every point in time its sales, and therefore that its balance of payments is in fact unbalanced. Such an imbalance may be a good thing, and be fully consistent with economic fundamentals, for two reasons. First, countries, just like individuals, want to smooth consumption over time. Those that have a large productive potential and a young population tend to borrow so as to be able to invest in their future; those that are rich and have a middle-aged population tend to repay debt and save for when the population is older and less active.3 Thus, a functioning international monetary order allows countries to smooth consumption over time, just as a bank does for individuals. The second benefit of a well-functioning international monetary system is that it enables countries to insure against bad times. In particular, a country that is a net lender to the rest of the world – by exporting and saving more than it imports and consumes – is able to draw on                                                  1  I wish to thank Marcel Fratscher, Ettore Dorrucci and Arnaud Mehl for their contributions. The opinions expressed reflect only mine. 2  The terms “order” and “system” are here used interchangeably. It should be borne in mind, however, that Mundell (1972) and McKinnon (1996) made a distinction between international monetary “order” and “system”. According to their definitions, the order is the set of rules and the system the modus operandi of the order. See Robert Mundell, “The Future of the International Financial System”, in Acheson, J. Chant and Prachowny, Bretton Woods Revisited, University of Toronto Press, 1972. See also Ronald McKinnon, The Rules of the Game: International Money and Exchange Rates, MIT Press, Chapter II, 1996. 3  Referred to as the life-cycle hypothesis of consumption for individuals (F. Modigliani and A. Ando, “The Life Cycle Hypothesis of Saving”, American Economic Review, 1963), which was reformulated for the behaviour of countries by Modigliani (1970), “The life cycle hypothesis of saving and intercountry differences in the saving ratio”, in: Eltis, Scott and Wolfe, eds., Induction, Growth and Trade: Essays in honour of Sir Roy Harrod (Clarendon Press, Oxford), 197-226.

those savings invested abroad when it falls on hard times. Such a risk-sharing mechanism4 has indeed been an important reason for the economic stability we observed for much of the 1990s and 2000s in advanced economies. In fact, this benefit was for a long time during the last decade regarded as a major economic achievement. Yet the increased financial integration of countries, and precisely this insurance mechanism, may also have played a role in the spreading of the current financial crisis to virtually every open economy in the world.  A key point is that there is a limit to the extent to which the rest of the world can finance a country’s external imbalance. In a well-functioning monetary order, both policy-makers and markets should be able to assess the limits of the external funds available for a country to finance its payments deficit, before such a limit is reached and to take corrective action. We know that this limit is very difficult to assess, because it depends on the specific domestic and international circumstances. The more sophisticated the financial markets are, the more easily a country can finance its payments deficit; and the less urgently needed is a policy to adjust the domestic economy. I can still hear Alan Greenspan saying: “it is tempting to conclude that the US current account deficit is essentially a by-product of long-term secular forces, and thus is largely benign. After all, we do seem to have been able to finance our international current account deficit with relative ease in recent years.”5A key question, ultimately, is: who should decide what a sustainable payments deficit is? The answers to this question, both right and wrong, have marked the evolution of the international monetary system since the Second World War. Allow me a brief retrospective.  Under the Bretton Woods agreement, the availability of international liquidity, ultimately in the form of gold, was the binding criterion for fostering a country to adjust its external imbalances. The system broke up because the US did not have enough gold to finance its imbalances, and did not want to live within those constraints, as it had to finance the Vietnam war. The move to a flexible exchange regime in the early 1970s was expected to solve the problem. The thinking at that time was that a country’s balance of payments is by definition in balance in a floating system, because the exchange rate adjusts to ensure such a balance. Defining the limits of a sustainable payments deficit, beyond which financing would start to become problematic, was considered as a non-problem. The market would decide. That was the consensus at the time. Not many disagreed. I still remember my surprise when Robert Triffin – who chaired my Bachelor’s dissertation committee in Louvain in 1978 – asked me “Should the US adjust or finance their current account deficit?” I gave the textbook answer, but he didn’t look so convinced.  Financial markets are indeed expected to finance external deficits, until they decide not to do so any more, at least not at the prevailing price (i.e. exchange rate). And when such a decision is made, the adjustment can be rather violent. We had the experience of markets simply refusing to finance external imbalances in the 1980s and 1990s, producing major exchange rate adjustments leading to financial crises. However, this concerned mainly developing and emerging markets. Furthermore, the crises often happened in countries which refused to allow their currencies to fully float. In most cases, the crisis erupted because countries were trying to peg their exchange rates at overvalued levels. One of the lessons of the Asian crisis in the late 1990s, in particular, was that countries should either let                                                  4  For a comprehensive account of the functioning of risk-sharing across countries, see e.g. Lewis, K. (1996), “What Can Explain the Apparent Lack of International Consumption Risk Sharing”, Journal of Political Economy, 104(2), pp. 267-297. 5  Alan Greenspan: “International imbalances”, Remarks Before the Advancing Enterprise Conference, London, England, December 2, 2005. 2 BIS Review 79/2009 
their exchange rates float in order to avoid accumulating excessive external imbalances, or adjust their macroeconomic policies to ensure consistency with their peg.6We entered this century with a new consensus, in which policy-makers took a back seat and relied heavily on markets to allocate capital across countries, while the IMF was mandated to exert a strong surveillance role with a view to ensuring transparency and encouraging early adjustment. This was the consensus reached at the G7 Summit in Cologne, in 1999, which was later adopted by the G20.  The expectations have not been fully met, for several reasons. First, several emerging market economies have not let their currencies float freely, and have continued to peg their exchange rates, although at undervalued rates (instead of overvalued). The reason has not only been a fear of floating but also a desire to promote exports as well as to accumulate reserves as a self-insurance policy in case of a crisis. In turn, the accumulation of large surpluses, especially in emerging Asia and in oil-exporting countries, has made possible the financing of the US current account deficit. It has also influenced monetary conditions in the US, lowering long term interest rates and making monetary conditions more expansionary than would otherwise have been the case.  The second reason is that the IMF has not succeeded in convincing countries to pursue macroeconomic policies consistent with sustainable current account positions. Advanced economies, in particular the US, have not taken IMF advice fully into consideration in their decision-making. Emerging economies, partly following the example given by the advanced countries, have also attached less importance to IMF surveillance. The accumulation of external assets has made them less dependent on IMF funding and advice. For example, the IMF has not succeeded in completing an Art. IV surveillance programme with China since 2006. Furthermore, the IMF has been reproached by emerging market economies of lacking legitimacy, in view of their relatively low quota and representation.  What is the lesson to be learned from the experience of the last ten years and from the crisis? Either the recommendations contained in the consensus prevailing after the Asian crisis were wrong or they were not appropriately implemented. I tend to side with the last view. The lesson that I would thus draw from the crisis is that those recommendations which were not implemented over the last decade should now be strengthened. The fact that the crisis has restored the IMF to its place at the heart of the international financial system should provide some hope in this respect. However, over recent months the Fund has concentrated mainly on crisis resolution. On the other hand, if we are striving for an international monetary order in which crises are the exception, the Fund has to have a greater role in prevention. In this respect, the discussions that have taken place in most international fora after the burst of the crisis have focussed mainly on strengthened regulatory and prudential measures, not on macroeconomic surveilance. One could even see a risk that the way in which this crisis is being addressed could weaken the Fund’s preventive tools, at least with respect to macroeconomic policies. Let me elaborate. One element of concern is that, even after the crisis, the IMF has not been able to convince its members that large external imbalances constitute a serious threat to global financial and economic stability. The crisis is seen by several key players as unrelated to the accumulation of external imbalances, and thus unrelated to the way in which the international financial system works. The IMF itself seems to favour the view that the origins of this crisis are not to be found in the members’ policies, nor in external imbalances, but in insufficient regulation and supervision and in the improper behaviour of market participants.7 There is a wide range                                                  6  “Exchange rate regimes for emerging market economies”, ECB Monthly Bulletin, February 2003. 7  See IMF (2009): “Lessons of the Global Crisis for Macroeconomic Policy”, 19 February 2009; Blanchard, O. (2008): “The Crisis: Basic Mechanisms, and Appropriate Policies”, MIT Working Paper 09-01. BIS Review79/2009 3 
of literature, including that published by the IMF until 2007, showing how global savings–investment imbalances have played a fundamental role that must not be neglected.8 These imbalances were ultimately the symptom of the creation of excessive international liquidity by countries like the United States and of excessive savings by countries like China, and were associated with a reduction in the cost of capital and interest rates, in particular in the United States. This spurred an unsustainable boom in consumption as well as excessive risk-taking, both among consumers and financial institutions. These imbalances contributed to the large financial distortions and bubbles in global financial markets, which created the preconditions for today’s crisis. Neglecting imbalances as a source of risk is not the best way to improve the crisis prevention arm of the IMF. How can we expect the international monetary order to develop? And how can we strike a better balance between financing and adjustment? There is a risk that the forces favouring earlier and more effective adjustment of imbalances, and thus helping to avoid financing crises, have been weakened. In the current discussion on the reform of the international financial system, not many are suggesting that the IMF should play a stronger role in preventing the accumulation of excessive external imbalances and in fostering more disciplined domestic policies. Just to give an example, the Decision on Bilateral Surveillance over Members’ Policies, aimed at identifying fundamental exchange rate misalignments, has been modified to allow greater discretion in surveillance, especially exchange rates. This might look like a tactical choice, but I doubt that it will result in a tougher hand for the IMF. While emerging and developing countries are requesting a stronger voice in the IMF, they also seem to be suggesting that they would like this institution to be less intrusive, imposing less conditionality while at the same time providing more and cheaper financing. Advanced economies seem to be supporting this view, having inundated the IMF with funds, most of them available with very little conditionality or none at all. This might be appropriate in times of systemic crisis but cannot be sustainable in normal times. Some thought should perhaps also be given to the need for a strategy to exit from cheap and unconditional IMF financing.  Overall, most of the IMF’s shareholders seem to favour making IMF financing easier. The idea of enhancing the role of the SDR, or another world reserve currency, goes towards facilitating the financing needs of both deficit and surplus countries. For deficit countries, this idea aims to make it easier to borrow outside the markets, from international institutions, giving the issuer of such currency some form of international lender-of-last-resort function. For surplus countries, it aims to reduce the devaluation risk of those countries that want to accumulate reserves. It is not clear, under these circumstances, how the risk of excessive imbalances would be perceived by both creditors and debtors. The real risk is that the adjustment takes place even later, while imbalances are left to accumulate for a longer period of time.

post adjustment even harsher. That is the experience of the gold standard, the last world currency. In sum, a new world monetary order – that is, a framework for payments between residents of different countries which ensures smooth trading in goods, services and financial assets – requires a mechanism to keep imbalances in check. Key elements of such a mechanism include a prominent role for the IMF in two essential areas: strong and effective surveillance in crisis prevention, and responsible lending, with appropriate limits and conditionality, to countries in need. This was the consensus prevailing until just before this crisis. There is a risk that the short-term objectives pursued to resolve the current crisis will change this consensus. A new monetary order must first and foremost aim to prevent crises, not to postpone them. BIS Review79/2009 5 
Tom Alweendo: Announcement of the commencement date of the Financial Intelligence Act 2007  Speech by Mr Tom Alweendo, Governor of Bank of Namibia, at launching the awareness campaign on provisions of the Financial Intelligence Act 2007, Windhoek, 29 April 2009. *      *      * Distinguished Invited Guests; Members of the media; Ladies and Gentlemen; I would like to welcome all of you to the Bank of Namibia this morning. The occasion today is to officially launch the commencement of the Financial Intelligence Act and to also launch our public awareness campaign. As you are all by now aware, the Financial Intelligence Act was enacted in 2007. The Act empowers the Bank of Namibia, amongst others to receive suspicious transaction reports from reporting entities, to analyze such reports, and to disseminate the intelligence gathered to law enforcement agencies for further investigation and possible prosecution. The Bank is further required to conduct compliance audits with all reporting entities to ensure effective adherence to this Act. The key in combating money laundering through the reporting entities is to know who their customers are. If they know their customers well, they will be able to detect attempts at money laundering. In fulfilling this mandate, since 2007 we have been preparing ourselves to be ready with the implementation of the Act. In this respect, I am happy to say that we have managed to build the necessary capacity and that we are more than ready to implement the Act. Due to some legislative delays, the Bank was not able to commence with the implementation of the Act as early as we would have wished. However, I am happy to report that the commencement date for the Act is now set to be the 1st May 2009. In order to educate the public on money laundering, we are also starting with a comprehensive awareness campaign. This is necessary because we are only likely to successfully combat money laundering when the public in general understand as to what is at stake. Financial crime, of which money laundering is part, is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon. This is despite the enactment of laws designed to curb financial crime. This is not only a threat to the global financial sector, but if allowed to flourish money laundering has the potential to become a threat to society. It can lead to the accumulation of economic power to organized crime. This development has the potential of eroding our political and social systems based on elected representation as we know them today. In other words, the social consequences for allowing money launderers to operate unchecked could spell disaster for stability and the rule of law. Law enforcement agencies are overwhelmed by the sheer size and sophistication that criminals are now employing to perpetrate their illegal deeds. The efforts on crime prevention are now compounded by globalization that has created what one may say is a global economy in which organized crime groups and individuals can and do generate huge sums of money. Money laundering is therefore a global problem which requires a concerted global response. In order to protect our respective financial systems from the destabilizing effects of crime and money laundering, it is imperative that we act and respond to this scourge with unmatched resolve and commitment to combating it. Everybody has, therefore, a responsibility to combat money laundering, because its negative impact has a unique way of creating far ranging negative consequences. The financial sector, in particular the banking sector, more than any sectors, needs to operate in a crime and money laundering free environments. We all know that banks deal BIS Review 78/2009 1 
with other people’s money and therefore rely heavily on reputation for integrity. Without the public confidence from the law abiding citizenry it would be difficult for financial institutions to conduct business in the form they do now. It is also conceivable that money laundering, if perpetrated on a high scale, would complicate the ability of financial institutions to manage their operations and risks. Another consequence of money laundering on a grand scale is that it may erode the effectiveness and management of monetary policy, because of its potential of changing the demand for cash in the economy. Money laundering is also bad for the economy and development in that it undermines legitimate business, competition and reduces the tax revenue to national authorities as launderers would be operating underground outside the tax net. The combating of money laundering presupposes the existence of capacity and resources at national level. In many of developing countries, this is a real challenge in that there are competing demands with regards to the utilization of scarce resources. The scarcity of resources is more critical in the law enforcement spheres, since most national jurisdictions have less than efficient law enforcement agencies which are in most cases overwhelmed by the demands to enforce other national laws. In conclusion, I would like to urge members of the public to look out for information on combating money laundering, starting next week. I look forward to everyone’s participation in effectively combating money laundering. I thank you for your attention. 2 BIS Review 78/2009 
Elizabeth A Duke: Containing the crisis and promoting economic recovery Speech by Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Women in Housing and Finance Annual Meeting, Washington DC, 15 June 2009.  The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * When I joined the Board of Governors last August, the other Board members were already formulating monetary policy to limit the economy-wide consequences of a very substantial housing downturn and actively responding to a severe financial crisis.  In September, the crisis intensified when the collapse and subsequent bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers triggered a sequence of events that brought credit markets – and in particular, the commercial paper (CP) market and interbank funding market – to a near standstill.1 The enormity of these events – and their potential implications for the economy – should not be underestimated. Credit plays a critical role in the undertaking of almost all production activities in the economy and a large portion of expenditure activities as well. The breakdown of credit markets that followed the collapse of Lehman, if left unchecked, could have meant a very significant contraction in economic activity. Indeed, you may have heard the anecdote soon after the Lehman collapse about Chairman Bernanke being asked, "Well, what if we don't do anything?" To which he replied, "There will be no economy on Monday." Policymakers in the United States and the world certainly did not follow the course of "not doing anything," either with regard to the events of last September or more generally through the financial crisis. Policymakers in the Congress, the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Reserve – and their counterparts abroad – were well aware of the dire implications that a lack of access to credit would have had on economic outcomes. And they were extremely active in formulating policies aimed at alleviating pressures in credit markets so as to ensure that the economy continued to function. What I would like to do today – now nine months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the tumultuous events that followed – is to look back on the policies that have been implemented throughout the financial crisis and consider how well they have worked to lessen the broader impact of financial market disruptions. Of course, it is too early to gauge the influence of policy on the economy's evolution through the financial crisis. It is difficult to do this with precision in general, and it is especially difficult to undertake analysis so soon after the events have occurred with so little data since the policy implementation. However, what we can do is look at how conditions in specific financial markets, and credit volumes more generally, have evolved, and ask whether this information is at least suggestive that the policies that we have implemented have worked to avert a far more severe and detrimental outcome.  I will talk first about programs aimed at conditions in specific markets and the responses of those markets. I will then move to a discussion of credit aggregates more generally. I will use                                                  1  Losses on Lehman Brothers' debt securities that resulted from the investment bank's bankruptcy caused one money market mutual fund to "break the buck," with others also rumored to do so. This situation led to a rapid escalation in money market mutual fund outflows such that short-term funding markets for businesses and municipalities essentially froze. Interbank funding markets also stopped functioning, and overnight rates soared to extraordinarily high levels. BIS Review 78/2009 1 
the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds data for four major credit types – residential mortgages, consumer credit, commercial real estate lending, and commercial and industrial loans – to compare credit aggregates in the current cycle to previous recessions generally considered to be credit-crunch periods. In particular, I will compare credit in the current crisis to the 1990-1991 episode that, as you might remember, also included a financial crisis. To preview my conclusions, I confess that I was actually rather startled by the pattern of the data. I originally started to look at these data to determine how much worse the credit contraction in this episode was compared with previous episodes. Instead, the data suggest that the actual credit contraction in this episode has been quite subdued compared with what might have been expected. So I do think that policies have helped maintain the flow of credit to businesses and households.  How well have policies to contain the crisis worked? A market-by-market perspective The policy responses to the financial crisis have been substantial and have occurred on all fronts. Fiscal policy and monetary policy, as well as policies relating to government guarantees and safety nets, such as deposit insurance, have been used to improve conditions in the financial sector. In discussing these policies and how they appear to have worked (or will likely work in the case of more-recent policies), I will start with policies and programs implemented by the Federal Reserve before moving to policies implemented by the government generally.  Apart from traditional monetary policy, the goal of which is to strengthen aggregate demand, the ultimate goal of the other policies is to maintain credit availability to households and businesses. In the more immediate term, these policies are focused on relieving stresses in particular markets or strengthening the financial condition of specific, or classes of, institutions.  Traditional interest rate methods of monetary policy The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has responded to the financial crisis by aggressively easing short-term interest rates, beginning in September 2007. At its December 2008 meeting, the Committee reduced its target for the federal funds rate close to its lower bound, setting a range between 0 and 1/4 percent. With inflation expected to remain subdued for some time, the FOMC has indicated that short-term interest rates are likely to remain low for an extended period. By communicating this expectation, the FOMC reinforced market beliefs that its policy is likely to remain on hold, thereby putting downward pressure on longer-term rates, which have the greatest effects on spending behavior. This sort of communication can be very useful in stimulating borrowing and spending by businesses and households and promoting growth in economic activity. Balance sheet and credit-easing policies In addition to easing the traditional interest rate instrument of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve has been supporting credit markets through an expansion of the asset side of its balance sheet. This approach – described as credit easing – is conceptually distinct from quantitative easing, the policy approach used by the Bank of Japan from 2001 through 2006. Credit easing and quantitative easing both share the feature that they involve the expansion of the central bank's balance sheet. That said, the ways in which the policy approaches expand the balance sheet – and act to stimulate lending – are different.  Quantitative easing can be thought of as an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet with no intentional change in its composition. That is, the central bank undertakes more open market operations with the objective of expanding bank reserve balances, which the banking system should then use to make new loans and buy additional securities. However, when credit spreads are very wide, as they are at present, and the credit markets are quite 2 BIS Review 78/2009 
dysfunctional, it becomes less likely that new loans and additional securities purchases will result from increasing bank reserve balances.  In contrast, credit easing focuses on the mix of loans and securities that the central bank holds as assets on its balance sheet as a means to reduce credit spreads and improve the functioning of private credit markets. The ultimate objective is improvement in the credit conditions faced by households and businesses. In this respect, the Federal Reserve has focused on improving functioning in the credit markets that are severely disrupted and that are key sources of funding for financial firms, nonfinancial firms, and households.  Figure 1 graphs the asset side of the Federal Reserve balance sheet, which has expanded substantially since the end of the third quarter of 2008. Federal Reserve initiatives with regard to the expansion of the asset side of its balance sheet can be grouped by the markets those initiatives are intended to help: (1) targeted actions to prevent the failure or substantial weakening of specific systemically important institutions, which are shown by the red area; (2) liquidity programs for financial institutions, which are shown by the light blue area; (3) lending to support the functioning of key financial markets, which are shown by the green area; and (4) large-scale purchases of high-quality assets, which are shown by the pink area. 1. Targeted actions aimed at specific systemically important institutions. Targeted actions to prevent the failure or substantial weakening of specific systemically important institutions include the first Maiden Lane transaction in March 2008, which extended support to facilitate the merger of Bear Stearns and JPMorgan Chase. It also includes loans and facilities supporting American International Group (AIG). These actions were driven by concerns that the disorderly failure of a large, complex, interconnected firm would impose significant losses on creditors, including other financial firms, dislocate a wide range of financial markets, and impede the flow of credit to households and businesses.2 To be sure, in no sense were these actions taken to protect the affected firms' managers or shareholders from the costs of past mistakes. Although I was not present for the Bear Stearns transaction, I can tell you that the decisions regarding loans to AIG were extremely difficult and uncomfortable. But at the time, the Federal Reserve was the only government entity with authority to act, and the tremendous risks to the financial system and the real economy implied by the failure of a large, complex, interconnected firm made the option of not acting unthinkable. 2.  Liquidity programs for financial institutions.  Since the onset of the crisis, the Federal Reserve has also modified existing facilities and implemented a number of new ones to provide liquidity to sound financial institutions in an environment in which interbank funding markets and repurchase agreement, or repo, markets (for securities other than Treasury securities) are severely disrupted.  For example, the Federal Reserve has improved banks' access to short-term credit by temporarily relaxing the terms on the discount window and by expanding – through the introduction of the Term Auction Facility and the establishment of reciprocal currency arrangements (liquidity swap lines) with foreign central banks – the range of programs through which it can lend to depository institutions.3 Ultimately, the objective of liquidity                                                  2  Losses sustained by other financial firms could then erode their financial strength, limiting their ability to play their intermediation role or even cause them to fail, thereby reinforcing financial pressures. In addition, the disorderly failure of a large, complex, interconnected firm could undermine confidence in the U.S. financial sector more broadly, potentially triggering a widespread withdrawal of funding by investors and an additional tightening of credit conditions, which would, in turn, cause a further reduction in economic activity. 3  Specifically, the Federal Reserve has relaxed the terms on the discount window by lowering the spread between the discount rate and the target federal funds rate from 100 to 25 basis points and extending the maturity on discount window loans, which now have a maximum duration of 90 days. BIS Review 78/2009 3 
programs is to facilitate the intermediation of credit to households and businesses. The immediate goal of such facilities, however, is the reduction of stresses in the interbank funding market. The significant narrowing since the start of this year in important measures of stress in this market – specifically, Libor-OIS spreads, shown in the left panel of figure 2 – together with diminished usage of these facilities – shown to the right – suggest that some easing in this market has occurred in line with the implementation and expansion of these initiatives.  In a similar manner, the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) provide liquidity to primary dealers to allow them to perform their function of making markets to support their customers' needs to buy, sell, and issue securities.4 The immediate goal of these facilities was the reduction of stresses in repo markets for securities other than Treasury securities. The narrowing of spreads between repo rates on agency and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and Treasury general collateral repo rates – shown in the left panel of figure 3 – together with diminished usage of the TSLF and PDCF – shown to the right – suggest that stresses in this market have eased since November.  3. Lending to support key financial markets. Credit-easing policies have also been targeted at improving conditions in key financial markets – specifically, markets for commercial paper, asset-backed securities (ABS), and commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS).  Money market mutual funds have significant investments in CP. When Lehman Brothers failed, it caused at least one money market mutual fund to "break the buck," leading to a run on money market funds. Three facilities – the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility and the Money Market Investor Funding Facility – were created to restore the functioning of CP markets and allow money market mutual funds to manage through the volatility.5 Conditions in the CP market have improved markedly since the introduction of the various Federal Reserve facilities aimed at fostering market liquidity. CP spreads – shown in the left-hand panel of figure 4 – have declined sharply since these facilities went into effect. As with the bank and primary dealer-oriented facilities, when spreads narrowed, usage subsided, as shown in the right-hand panel. While usage has declined significantly, market participants tell us that the backstop provided by the facilities continues to bolster market confidence. The Term Auction Lending Facility (TALF) was created as a joint endeavor of the Federal Reserve and Treasury to support economic activity by making credit more readily available for consumers and businesses. The facility provides loans with maturities of up to five years                                                                                                                                                           The Term Auction Facility provides credit to depository institutions through an auction mechanism, and liquidity swap lines provide U.S. dollar funding indirectly to foreign banks whose liquidity demands ultimately affect U.S. financial markets. Both of these initiatives have been expanded several times during the crisis, most notably when market turmoil reached a peak in September last year. 4  The TSLF was established in March 2008 as some large investment banks faced increasingly severe liquidity pressures, which began to limit their ability to hold inventories of financial assets and thereby make markets. The TSLF allows primary dealers to borrow Treasury securities from the Federal Reserve for one-month terms against less-liquid collateral, which they can then use as collateral to borrow cash from private counterparties. The PDCF was established shortly after as a backstop source of liquidity for primary dealers. 5  The Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility finances purchases of high-quality asset-backed commercial paper by U.S. depository institutions and bank holding companies from money market mutual funds, and the Money Market Investor Funding Facility provides liquidity to U.S. money market mutual funds and certain other money market investors. Both facilities are aimed at assisting money market mutual funds that hold CP to meet investor redemption demands, thereby increasing these funds' willingness to invest in money market instruments. The Commercial Paper Funding Facility was set up to provide a liquidity backstop to U.S. issuers of CP through a specially created limited liability company, which could purchase three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper directly from eligible issuers. 4 BIS Review 78/2009 
to investors to help finance their acquisitions of certain ABS and CMBS. The program was announced in late 2008 at a time when ABS and CMBS markets had essentially shut down, which thereby threatened to limit credit availability to households and businesses. Initially, eligible collateral included newly issued triple-A-rated ABS backed by a variety of loans to consumers and small businesses. Recently, the Board announced that triple-A-rated newly issued and legacy CMBS would also be accepted as collateral.6  Conditions in the markets for consumer ABS have improved notably since the beginning of this year and more recently have improved in the markets for CMBS. Estimates of spreads on triple-A-rated consumer ABS have narrowed between 70 to 80 percent from peak levels in December 2008. Estimates of spreads on triple-A-rated CMBS have also moved down since March, although such spreads remain well above their levels observed a year ago.7 While the now familiar improvement in spreads is good news, the real story of TALF is in new issuance, shown in figure 5. Remembering that these securities are used to finance new loans, look at the virtual shutdown of securitization that occurred starting last fall in the credit card, auto, student loan, and commercial real estate markets. The TALF began operation in March. For the first two months, TALF lending and associated ABS issuance was fairly low, in part because investors were unfamiliar with the program, but investor interest picked up considerably in May and June and consumer ABS issuance has returned to levels near those seen before the disruption of ABS markets last fall. In addition, some ABS issues have come to market outside of the TALF, and these are taking place at greatly improved spreads. We hope to see similar improvements in the CMBS market later this summer when the first TALF loans collateralized by newly issued and legacy CMBS are expected. 4.  Large-scale purchases of high-quality assets. Credit-easing policies have also been implemented through the purchase of high-quality assets aimed at improving mortgage lending and housing markets as well as overall conditions in private credit markets. In November 2008, the Federal Reserve announced plans to purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency MBS and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year, and in March 2009, the Federal Reserve announced that it may also buy up to $300 billion of Treasury securities by the fall.8  The program appears to be having its intended effect. Yields on mortgages relative to Treasury yields have come down since November 2008. As shown in figure 6, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate relative to the 5-year constant maturity Treasury rate benchmark has declined about 1-1/4 percentage points since the first MBS purchase program was announced. Indeed, today mortgage spreads are a lot closer to their mean for 2000-2007                                                  6  The types of collateral eligible under TALF are: the highest investment-grade-rated tranches of ABS issued on or after January 1, 2009, for which the underlying credit exposures are auto loans, student loans, credit card loans, equipment loans, floor plan loans, insurance-premium finance loans, small business loans fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Small Business Administration, and receivables related to residential mortgage servicing advances or commercial mortgage loans; the highest investment-grade-rated tranches of CMBS issued on or after January 1, 2009; and certain high-quality CMBS issued before January 1, 2009. 7  The observed narrowing of spreads likely represents both direct and indirect benefits of the TALF to financial markets. The direct benefit is the increased demand for the specific types of securities that are eligible for the TALF, which has likely contributed to the observed reduction in spreads. The indirect benefits are the increase in the general level of confidence in the financial system, which has almost certainly contributed to the narrowing of risk premiums in a wide variety of markets, including cash markets – such as the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets – as well as markets for a range of structured products. 8  As of June 10, the Federal Reserve held $427 billion of agency MBS and $84 billion of agency debt (of which almost all was purchased since late November) and $622 billion of Treasury securities (of which $210 billion was purchased since March). BIS Review 78/2009 5 
than they were in November. That said, mortgage rates have recently risen with the increase in Treasury rates.  Fiscal policy: Emergency Economic Stabilization Act In October 2008, the Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA), which enabled a series of initiatives to provide confidence in the financial system and to strengthen market stability. The ultimate goal of all these initiatives was to increase the flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the U.S. economy.  Lending activities require both capital and liquidity. While the Federal Reserve had been providing liquidity, equity markets were virtually closed to financial firms last fall. Using authorities and funding provided by EESA, the Treasury's Capital Purchase Program provides government capital investments to banks in good condition. Since last fall, nearly $200 billion has been invested under this program.  Confidence in the U.S. banking system has also been supported by temporary extensions of government safety net policies. A component of EESA was the temporary raising of the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. In line with this change, the FDIC also announced the provision of full coverage of noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts under its temporary Transaction Account Guarantee Program. In addition, the FDIC began guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP).9 Since late April, some banks have issued debt outside of the TLGP, albeit with spreads of several percentage points higher than debt issued under the program. This activity suggests that the TLGP is providing an important source of support to the funding needs of banks, thrifts, and their parent companies.  The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program In February of this year, the Federal Reserve, as part of the Treasury's Financial Stability Plan, initiated the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) to evaluate whether large U.S. banking institutions would need to raise a temporary capital buffer to be able to withstand losses in a more challenging economic environment than generally anticipated. The SCAP determined the capital buffer by estimating losses and internal resources to absorb losses at the 19 largest U.S. banking institutions. The scenario used to estimate the buffer was more adverse than that expected by the consensus of private forecasters. The exercise was conducted by more than 150 examiners, analysts, economists, accountants, attorneys, and other professionals from the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC.  When completed, the assessment indicated that additional capital buffers – with a total value of $185 billion – were required by 10 out of the 19 institutions to maintain Tier 1 capital in excess of 6 percent of total assets and Tier 1 common equity capital in excess of 4 percent under the more adverse scenario. Of the $185 billion, the equivalent of $110 billion had already been raised or committed prior to the announcement of the results in early May. And since the announcement, these firms have raised about $50 billion from equity offerings, preferred stock conversions, and asset sales. I believe the early success shown by firms in accessing private capital demonstrates the improvement in market confidence provided by the SCAP exercise. With renewed access to nongovernment debt and private capital, many                                                  9  Since the TGLP went into effect in November 2008, $265 billion in debt has been issued by 30 parent companies and 37 firms, with spreads over Treasury securities in recent months remaining on the order of 1/4 to 3/4 percent, depending on the maturity. 6 BIS Review 78/2009 
institutions have announced intentions to repay the government preferred stock issued under the CPP. How well have policies to contain the crisis worked? An aggregate credit perspective So far I have discussed evidence that programs directed at dysfunction in specific markets has been successful in alleviating stresses in those markets. But the ultimate goal of those policies as well as those aimed at strengthening financial institutions is to improve the flow of credit to households and businesses. I now want to look at this ultimate goal by examining how credit volumes have evolved over this current business cycle downturn relative to previous downturns, as identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Business Cycle Dating Committee. I will do this using the Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds data. In most instances, I will focus only on those downturns associated with credit crunches.10  A credit crunch, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, "occurs when the supply of credit is restricted below the range usually identified with prevailing market interest rates and the profitability of investment projects."11 Judging whether a credit crunch is happening in real time – and, to some extent, even in hindsight – is not easy. It is extremely difficult to sort out the relative importance on the flow of credit of reduced demand due to weaker economic activity, reduced supply because borrowers appear less creditworthy, or reduced supply because lenders face pressures, such as a shortage of capital, that restrain them from extending credit. In other words, while demand considerations could certainly result in a decline in credit flows, a reduction in the supply of credit – caused either by bank balance sheet pressures or by banks being reluctant to lend to less-creditworthy borrowers – could produce the same result. Anecdotal evidence and some academic research suggest that the recessions that followed the business cycle peaks in 1969, 1973, 1981, and 1990 were credit-crunch recessions.12 Clearly, the current downturn – specifically, that following the December 2007 business cycle peak – is also considered a credit-crunch recession. How has credit evolved during this business cycle? Growth of the broad credit aggregates. In looking at the evolution of credit in both the current and past business cycle downturns, I will look at four major types of credit: home mortgages, commercial mortgages, consumer credit, and nonfinancial business credit. Figure 7 presents four-quarter growth rates for each credit type from 1952 to 2008, where the shaded areas denote NBER recession periods. As can be seen from the figure, credit growth typically declined prior to and during economic downturns, and this time-series pattern is readily apparent in the current downturn in all four panels.                                                   10  In these cases, however, accompanying charts (figures A.1 and A.2) that show the paths of credit over business cycle downturns in both credit-crunch and non-credit-crunch recessions are available online. 11  Council of Economic Advisers (1992), Economic Report of the President (Washington: Government Printing Office), p. 46. 12  More specifically, the business cycle peaks occurred in 1969:Q4, 1973:Q4, 1981:Q3, and 1990:Q3. Kaufman (1991) cites credit crunches that occurred in 1959, 1969-70, the mid-1970s, 1981-82, and 1990-91. See Henry Kaufman (1991), "Credit Crunches: The Deregulators Were Wrong," Wall Street Journal, October 9. Also see Albert M.

In the current downturn, the reduction in lending growth that stands out as being the most "out of the ordinary" is that of home mortgages, which is shown in the top-left panel. Home mortgage volumes actually contracted for the first time in the Flow of Fund's 50-plus year history over the four quarters ended 2008:Q4, after having always maintained growth above 4 percent. In terms of being an outlier relative to past business cycles, the current experience for home mortgages is similar to that of commercial mortgages in the 1990-91 recession, which is shown in the top-right panel.  In the downturn following the 1990 business cycle peak, commercial mortgage volumes contracted after having never contracted (in nominal terms) before that. This downturn also included a financial crisis, although then it was due to commercial real estate rather than residential real estate, as it is now. Given the similarities between these two business cycle downturns, it seems interesting to compare them. A comparison of the current downturn with the one that followed the 1990:Q3 peak. Figure 8, which shows the same credit types as figure 7, provides "butterfly" charts for inflation-adjusted levels of four different types of lending – home mortgages (top-left panel), consumer credit (bottom-left panel), commercial mortgages (top-right panel), and nonfinancial business credit (bottom-right panel) – over the current downturn and the 1990-91 recession. The series in the charts have been normalized to 100 at each business cycle peak, which is also marked with the vertical bar.13 Normalized lending data for quarters prior to and after each business cycle peak are color-coded to each peak. Data associated with the 1990:Q3 peak are shown using thick dark green lines, and data associated with the recent 2007:Q4 peak are shown using thick red lines. Activity to the left represents the 16 quarters leading up to the peak, and the activity to the right represents the 8 quarters following the peak. A steeper line to the left of the vertical bar implies higher credit growth prior to the peak; a more negatively sloped line to the right implies a larger reduction in credit during the downturn.  The right side of the chart considers commercial mortgages and nonfinancial business credit. Both of these lending aggregates expanded more rapidly in the lead up to the 2007 business cycle peak than in the lead up to the 1990 peak, and both also contracted (or continued to contract) immediately after the 1990 business cycle peak. Until recently, neither lending aggregate had declined in the current downturn, but in the first quarter of this year, nonfinancial business credit contracted quite sharply.  For consumer credit (in the lower-left panel), it matters – in the lead up to the most recent business cycle peak – how we measure it. Without home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans, the increase in consumer credit in the lead up to the 1990 and the 2007 business cycle peaks are broadly similar. If we include all HELOCs and home equity loans, which can be used in a similar way to consumer credit, then lending in the lead up to the 2007 business cycle peak – represented by the thin red line – increases more notably.14 Consumer credit contracted in the 1990-91 recession but has remained broadly flat in the current downturn, albeit with a slight downward drift in more recent quarters.  For home mortgages, shown in the top-left panel, lending expanded similarly in the lead up to both the 1990 and the 2007 business cycle peaks. In contrast to the other types of credit,                                                  13  The normalization of each series is also made so that the difference between the level of a lending series at any date and the level at the business cycle peak has a percentage interpretation. For example, if a line has a value of 80 at some date before or after the business cycle peak, it means that the level of the category of lending that the line represents is 20 percent below the level of lending at the business cycle peak. Likewise, if a line has a value of 110 at some date, it means that the level of the category of lending that the line represents is 10 percent above the level of lending at the peak of the business cycle. 14  Note that cash-out refinancing – like HELOCs and home equity loans – can also be used in a similar way to consumer credit, which is not included in the chart. 8 BIS Review 78/2009 
this type of lending did not contract in the 1990-91 recession but has contracted since the peak of this cycle.  Apart from home mortgages, the drop-off in credit in the 1990-91 recession was notably more severe than what has been experienced so far in the current downturn. There are two possible reasons why this might happen. One is that demand for credit turned down more sharply in the 1990-91 recession than in the current downturn, but I do not think that this is the reason. The slowdown in economic activity in the 1990-91 recession was nowhere near as severe (either in terms of depth or duration) as it has been to date in the current recession, which the NBER still considers to be ongoing. This difference in economic activity across the two recessions suggests that it is unlikely that credit demand contracted more sharply in the 1990-91 recession than in the current downturn. The other possible reason, which I think more likely, is that credit supply conditions have been a little more favorable – albeit still stressful – in the most recent downturn relative to those during the 1990-91 recession. I believe this difference does reflect policy. That is, all the facilities and programs laid out earlier have acted to shore up the financial sector and to prevent a notably more severe contraction in credit than we have seen.  Given the stark differences between the paths of credit in the current recession compared with those of 1990-91, I want to see if the same patterns hold true in comparison with other credit-crunch recessions. A comparison of the current downturn with other credit-crunch recessions that occurred within the past 40 years. Figure 9 provides butterfly charts for the same four inflation-adjusted levels of credit as shown in figure 8, now shown with the last five business cycle peaks that preceded credit-crunch recessions – specifically, the business cycle peaks in 1969, 1973, 1981, 1990, and 2007. Data associated with the most recent peak continue to be shown by thick red lines. Data associated with the 1990 peak are now shown by thinner dark green lines.15  Figure 9 indicates that, with the exception of housing, lending over the current downturn does not appear particularly weak or subdued relative to other downturns. Indeed, for all categories of lending other than home mortgage lending (shown in the top-left panel), there are at least two other downturns for which the paths of lending after the business cycle peak lie below that following 2007:Q4 (that is, the drop-off in credit was more pronounced). Even for home mortgages, the decline in lending is not tremendously large relative to the experience of past business cycle downturns. In contrast, over the 1990-91 recession, lending, with the exception of home mortgages, experienced either the largest or the second-largest contraction of all credit-crunch-associated downturns.  This feature is even more prominent when lending only by depositories is considered. Figure 10 has the same format as figure 9 but presents time-series data on lending by depository institutions only – that is, commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions.16 Figure 10 indicates that lending by depositories over the current downturn does not appear particularly weak or subdued relative to other downturns. Indeed, for all components of credit other than home mortgages, the path of lending in the current downturn lies toward the upper end of the range of outcomes for past business cycle downturns. Of course, some of the observed lending by depositories in the current downturn does reflect the safety-valve role played by financial intermediaries in the financial system – that is, households and, in particular, businesses drawing on existing lines of bank credit when alternative sources of finance have become more difficult to obtain. Finally, when home mortgages made by                                                  15  A set of charts (figures A.1 and A.2) are provided online that also include the paths of credit around the business cycle peaks preceding non-credit-crunch recessions. 16  Note that the data for depositories shown in figure  also use the Flow of Funds Accounts. BIS Review 78/2009 9 
depositories only is considered, the path of lending lies within the range of outcomes for past business cycle downturns (albeit toward the lower part of the envelope). Given the enormity of some of the events of the past year, the findings of these business cycle comparisons may seem somewhat surprising. However, as was evident from the facilities and programs discussed earlier, policy has been extremely active in the current credit crisis, especially with respect to the banking sector. Given the similarities between home mortgages in the current downturn and commercial mortgages in the 1990-91 recession, as well as the commonality that both recessions were characterized by a financial system crisis, the outcomes for lending in the 1990-91 recession could be thought of as a possible scenario for lending in the current downturn in the absence of any policy response. That said, the likely path of lending in the current downturn without any policy response would have been notably more contractionary than in the 1990-91 recession given that the earlier episode – while characterized by a financial crisis – did not face as extreme an episode as the one experienced last September. Conclusion  Today I have reviewed developments in specific financial markets following the introduction of Federal Reserve and other agency facilities and programs, and have considered the evolution of the major categories of credit in both the current economic downturn and past downturns. This assessment of the data suggests that these government programs have been broadly successful in relieving stresses in the key credit markets. This success is also reflected in aggregate credit data, which indicate that most categories of household and nonfinancial-firm lending in the current recession do not appear especially weak relative to past recessions. Given the enormity of events over the past year, this result is a surprising but reassuring early indication that the combined policies have been successful at shoring up credit despite these events.  A note of caution is in order however. In the past, economic downturns were deepened or prolonged by the premature withdrawal of monetary or fiscal stimulus. To the extent that the severity of the current downturn has thus far been mitigated by extraordinary credit support, a significantly weaker path of lending – and thereby economic activity – could very likely occur if policy support for the financial sector is withdrawn too soon. In this case, stigmatization of support tools such as liquidity programs, direct lending programs, or government capital injections that make participants unwilling to use such programs will have the same effect as a direct policy withdrawal of the programs. And while the path of credit in this cycle compared with others is encouraging, the downturn in credit evident in the most recent quarter provides a reminder that conditions are still far from normal. 10 BIS Review 78/2009

Jean-Pierre Roth: Recent economic and financial developments in Switzerland Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the half yearly media news conference, Berne, 18 June 2009. *      *      * Since the beginning of the financial crisis in August 2007, our monetary policy has passed through three distinct stages.  In the first stage, as the interbank market gradually dried up, we sought to protect the Swiss economy from a deterioration in conditions on the credit market. From the start of the crisis, we countered the forces pushing the level of the three-month Libor up by undertaking appropriate reductions in the repo rate. Between September 2007 and September 2008, we were able to stabilise the Libor at 2.75%. Thus we protected our economy from a rise in interest rates resulting from the increase in risk premia on the money market. Since we were confident that the economic downturn would have a moderating effect on prices, we refrained from adopting a more restrictive monetary policy, despite the fact that soaring oil prices caused inflation to rise and risked destabilising inflation expectations.  The second stage began in autumn 2008 with the emergence of the first indications of a swift downturn in the economy and the sharp deterioration in the financial crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers investment bank. We rapidly relaxed our monetary policy by bringing down our Libor target by 225 basis points to a level of about 0.5% within three months. At the same time, we had been charged with stabilising the financial sector, committing ourselves to take over a large portfolio of illiquid UBS assets. In addition, we concluded euro versus Swiss franc swap arrangements with the European Central Bank and the central banks of Poland and Hungary, to ease refinancing of banks that had granted mortgage loans in Swiss francs in these two countries. These swaps made it possible to counteract the rise in the Libor generated by an additional demand for Swiss francs outside our normal field of operation.  The third stage began in March 2009. By then, price stability was threatened, not by the temporary inflationary escalation of 2008, but quite the opposite – the risk of a fall in prices over the coming three years. Since, by that time, our room for manoeuvre in the area of interest rates was limited, we decided to turn to unconventional instruments in order to bring about a further relaxation in monetary conditions.  How has the economic and financial situation developed since our assessment in March?  Global economic outlook Global economic activity declined more sharply than expected in the first quarter of 2009, especially in Europe and Japan. However, recent financial and macroeconomic indicators have shown a few encouraging signs. Stock exchange indices have started to edge up. Oil prices, which had been falling since July 2008, have been rising again since March. Risk premia in the money and capital markets have declined. In addition, the indices of business activity and household confidence has clearly turned upward again, even if they remain at historically low levels. The combined effect of all these developments leads us to modify our risk assessment but does not substantially affect our scenario for the global economy. We still believe that positive growth could set in within the US in the second half of the year and in Europe at the beginning of next year. We continue to expect a modest global recovery, so that the considerable under-utilisation of production capacities will not be eliminated in the next few quarters. Consequently, unemployment is likely to increase further in the developed countries as a whole.  BIS Review 77/2009 1 
Swiss economic outlook As expected, the Swiss economic situation continued to deteriorate in the first months of the year. In the first quarter, GDP contracted by 3.2% in annualised terms. However, this figure obscures a much sharper drop in final demand. As in the preceding quarter, part of production was, in effect, absorbed by an increase in stocks. External demand again plummeted and the level of capacity utilisation fell substantially in the manufacturing sector. Final domestic demand by private entities stagnated, and is most likely to weaken in the months ahead, since companies will reduce their equipment investment and household expenditure will be checked by growing uncertainty in the labour market. The number of individuals affected by short-time working was rising fast at the beginning of the year, and unemployment is increasing at a regular pace. This trend is likely to persist in the next few months since the leading indicators of labour demand are falling sharply. Nevertheless, it is to be hoped that the signs of improvement observed abroad will be gradually transmitted to the Swiss economy. From the second quarter, the decline in exports is likely to slow down. However, growth figures will probably remain negative over the next few quarters due to the weakening in domestic demand as well as the reduction of inventory levels. For 2009 as a whole, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) continues to forecast a reduction in GDP of between 2.5% and 3%. These figures are still relatively moderate by comparison with other countries since Switzerland benefits from the broad diversification and relative flexibility of its economy. Even so, I wish to stress that the risks attached to our forecast are clearly skewed to the downside. Changes in monetary and financial conditions  How have monetary and financial conditions developed since our last assessment in March? Let us begin by looking at movements in interest rates on the money and capital markets as well as currency movements on the foreign exchange markets.  On the money market, three-month Libor moved down, but not as far as we would have liked. Its decline was checked by the level of risk premia, and it currently stands at around 40 basis points. As announced in March, the objective is still “to gradually bring the Libor down to the lower end of the new target range, i.e. to approximately 0.25%.” Progress will be slow, since monetary policy can only influence risk premia indirectly, for instance, by promoting a climate of greater confidence in the banking sector.  The capital market was affected by forces working in opposite directions. On the one hand, long-term rates of interest, which were affected by global developments, rose slightly. This increase reflects renewed optimism about an upturn in the economy, inflationary fears and increased capital requirements on the part of the public sector. On the other hand, risk premia have fallen somewhat. Nonetheless, they remain elevated, and – moreover – the reductions that have occurred have been varied, depending on the quality of borrowers, the maturity of the bond in question and the industry. The months from November 2007 to March 2009 saw a significant appreciation in the Swiss franc, by 10% in trade-weighted terms and by 11% against the euro. Although interest rates had been reduced between October and December last year, the strengthening of the Swiss franc had the unwelcome effect of tightening monetary conditions. In view of this development, we decided at our March assessment to prevent further appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro by purchasing foreign currencies on the foreign exchange market. We achieved our objective. Since then the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro has ceased and its volatility with respect to the European currency has diminished considerably. Let us now proceed to an examination of monetary conditions in terms of volume – in other words, in terms of credit and monetary aggregates. Overall, credit is still growing at an annual rate of more than 3%. However, this general figure is composed of a number of 2 BIS Review 77/2009 
different movements in opposite directions. Mortgage lending has been increasing more and more rapidly since November. The growth rate rose from 3.6% in December to 4.2% in April, an advance related to the fall in the Libor. Other credits for all currencies, by contrast, began falling in April (–0.8%), as might be expected in this phase of the economic cycle. Other credits granted in Swiss francs, however, continued growing at a rate of 1.2%, despite the fact that they were already at a relatively high level. Loans granted to private companies grew at a rate of 10.2% in the first quarter of 2009 as compared to the first quarter of 2008. Thus, we do not perceive the slightest indication of any credit crunch in Switzerland. Clearly, with the decline in the quality of certain borrowers during a recession, it is inevitable that a cyclical tightening of loan conditions will occur, but this cannot be termed a credit crunch.  This statistical information is confirmed by the quarterly survey on lending conditions which the SNB has been conducting with the 20 most important Swiss banks since the beginning of 2008. The survey shows that a third of the banks questioned tightened their lending conditions slightly. This proportion is a little higher for loans granted to large companies than those granted to small and medium-sized companies. To summarise, the situation on the bank lending market remains relatively relaxed and clearly better than that in the US or in the euro area. Nonetheless, deterioration cannot be ruled out for the future.  We now move on to monetary developments. For more than eighteen months now, the demand for liquidity on the interbank market has increased substantially and – as I mentioned before – the loss of trust among banks has brought the market to a standstill. The SNB has been forced to take the place of the lending banks and provide the market with generous amounts of liquidity through a major expansion of its repo lending. Moreover, additional liquidity has been created by purchasing foreign currency on exchange rate markets and bonds issued by private sector borrowers, and by making Swiss franc funding available through swap arrangements with the European Central Bank and with the central banks of Poland and Hungary. Consequently, in May, the monetary base was up by 132% within the space of one year and now amounts to CHF 105 billion. The medium and long-term inflationary threat of this large amount of liquidity is limited because we will be able to absorb it rapidly, by slowing our lending or by issuing SNB Bills, as soon as confidence returns to the markets.  However, liquidity accumulated by the banks could give rise to excessive creation of money through a massive expansion of bank credit. In May, growth in the narrow monetary aggregates, which are very sensitive to changes in the rate of interest, exceeded 40% for M1 and 30% for M2. In essence, this strong rate of growth reflects a preference on the part of the general public for the most liquid monetary assets over time deposits, due to financial uncertainty and the fall in interest rates. The M3 aggregate, which is not affected by these substitution effects, continued growing at a more moderate rate of 4.2% in May, which shows that, at present, created central bank money is confined at the interbank level and has not been transmitted to the rest of the economy. Monetary policy needs to ensure that the level of the monetary aggregates does not become excessive over a longer period. The indicators we are monitoring show that this is not currently the case. Inflation and inflation risks Inflation developed in line with our expectations. In the first quarter it was zero, while we were anticipating 0.1%. Overall, our forecasts are unchanged for the current year, with inflation remaining negative for the rest of 2009. This, in essence, is attributable to the prices of imported goods, which are down by comparison to their high levels in 2008. However, inflation for domestic goods and services, despite weakening during the year, will remain above 1%.  BIS Review 77/2009 3 
The outlook for the following years has been very slightly adjusted upwards. We shall return to this point in a few moments. Monetary policy decision At our monetary policy assessment in March, we identified a number of elements that led us to foresee negative inflation for 2009 and a risk of deflation for 2010 and 2011. In view of this threat, we relaxed monetary conditions by taking supplementary measures. We reduced the three-month Libor target range by 25 basis points to 0–0.75%, aiming for a rate of 0.25%. In order to achieve this, we granted longer-term repo credits and concluded foreign exchange swaps. To prevent the Swiss franc from further appreciating against the euro, we purchased foreign currency on the foreign exchange market; we also purchased bonds issued by private sector issuers to foster a decline in capital market risk premia. All in all, these operations achieved their objective. The situation is gradually normalising, although it remains very vulnerable. The risks are still clearly skewed to the downside and are major. Given these conditions, and in view of the inflation forecast, we consider that the time for a correction has not yet come, but that an additional relaxation of monetary conditions is not necessary either. We have thererfore today decided to continue our expansionary monetary policy, maintaining all of the measures we implemented on 12 March.  Inflation forecast chart How has our inflation forecast been revised? The dashed red curve on the chart represents the new forecast. It covers the period from the second quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2012, and maps the future development of inflation on the assumption that the three-month Libor remains unchanged at 0.25% over the forecasting period. For purposes of comparison, the dash-dotted green curve shows the inflation forecast of the March monetary assessment, which was also based on a three-month Libor of 0.25%.  The new forecast still shows negative inflation for 2009, but with a very slight adjustment upwards. This is explained by the recent upturn in prices of fossil fuels and of commodities in general. However, as an average for the year, inflation will remain negative, at an unchanged rate of -0.5%. In 2010, inflation is likely to return to slightly positive rates and could be a little above the figure forecast in March. This is due to the fact that although domestic inflation is falling it will still amount to around 1% at the end of the year while imported deflation recedes more rapidly. Finally, for 2011, the new forecast shows that inflation will accelerate a little at the end of the forecast horizon if the Libor remains at a level as low as that being aimed for at present. Thus, we see that the Libor cannot remain at 0.25% indefinitely. However, as our forecast also shows, it would not be advisable to increase the Libor now since the very weak inflation rates expected in 2010 (0.4%) and 2011 (0.3%) indicate that the deflation risk has not completely disappeared.   We continue to use an inflation forecast to guide our decisions. In this way, we will ensure that the unconventional measures currently in force do not compromise medium and long-term price stability.   4 BIS Review 77/2009

Thomas Jordan: Challenges for the SNB in extraordinary times Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the half-yearly media news conference, Berne, 20 June 2008. *      *      * Around the world, the effects of the financial crisis on the implementation of monetary policy and the composition of central banks’ balance sheets are becoming more and more apparent. On the one hand, conventional monetary policy has all but exhausted its options, and unconventional measures are being increasingly used. On the other hand, some central banks are having to manage the illiquid assets which they took over in an effort to stabilise the banking system. Both of these situations also apply to the Swiss National Bank. Therefore, after giving a brief assessment of the developments in the international financial markets, I will turn my attention to the unconventional monetary policy measures being taken by the SNB. I will then move on to discuss the SNB StabFund. To conclude, I will look at the risks facing the SNB that are associated with these activities.  Situation in the international financial markets Although the first few weeks of the year saw stock markets around the globe experiencing their lowest levels in many years, the surprisingly positive results from the US banking sector in mid-March prompted a turnaround in market sentiment. Stock markets have since been recording strong price gains. Other financial market segments also saw a significant recovery.  As a result, the downward spiral, which was triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September and which, for a short while, even threatened to bring the global financial system crashing down, has come to halt. After having climbed to unsustainable highs in recent years, the prices of many investments fell to extremely low levels during the turmoil this past winter. The rapid recovery in the financial markets since March must also be partly regarded as a correction of previous excesses. Furthermore, the extremely expansionary monetary policy being pursued worldwide is likely to have also contributed to calming the situation.  However, the recovery in the financial markets should not conceal the fact that uncertainty is still high. How sustainable the shift in market sentiment really is remains to be seen. The risk of suffering a setback remains correspondingly high.  The SNB’s unconventional monetary policy measures At our quarterly assessment in March, we were confronted by the need to once again significantly expand our monetary policy. Since the repo rates were already practically at zero, we had to resort to unconventional monetary policy measures. We decided to conclude longer-term repo transactions on the one hand, and to purchase foreign currencies and Swiss franc bonds on the other. By simultaneously intervening in the money, foreign exchange and capital markets when necessary, a strong and broad-based monetary policy impact can be generated, without leading to any major distortions in the markets concerned. Allow me here to add a few remarks on our foreign currency and bond purchases.  Purchase of foreign currency The aim of our buying foreign currency is to prevent an appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro. This is the key component of our unconventional monetary policy. It is important to emphasise that we do not engage in foreign exchange interventions in order to BIS Review 77/2009 1 
bring about a depreciation of the Swiss franc, but to prevent any further appreciation of the franc in its role as a safe haven currency. Therefore, the reproach we occasionally hear that the SNB’s policy is encouraging an international depreciation race is unjustified. A look at exchange rate movements shows a clear appreciation of the Swiss franc during the course of the financial market crisis (cf. chart 1). So there can be no question of the SNB conducting a beggar-thy-neighbour policy. We give ourselves a great deal of latitude with regard to our foreign exchange interventions. There is no fixed threshold beyond which we become active; we simply decide in accordance with the situation at hand. And markets should not become used to a certain level of intervention. We feel that this approach promises the highest possible impact, which in turn will allow us to phase out the strategy more easily when the time comes. Furthermore, we do not comment on the volume of our foreign currency purchases.  The purchases of foreign currency have fulfilled their purpose – and with these I am referring to our first unilateral interventions in the foreign exchange market since 1992. The appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro, which is particularly dangerous for the Swiss real economy in this crisis, has been halted, and the volatility of the EUR/CHF exchange rate has eased considerably (cf. chart 2). If necessary, we will continue to intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent an appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro. The SNB occupies a strong position in this regard. With interest rates at the zero bound and our policy of quantitative easing, we have an advantage over market participants who are expecting an appreciation of the Swiss franc. For our interventions, we neither have to take a specific rate of interest into account nor neutralise the expansion of money supply. Purchase of Swiss franc bonds With the purchase of Swiss franc bonds issued by private domestic borrowers, we want to lower the risk premia in the capital market and, in so doing, make it easier for private issuers to raise capital. Depending on the situation, we try to achieve the greatest possible impact on risk premia and capital market liquidity while deploying the least amount of capital. We do not want to give individual companies preferential treatment, instead we wish to ease the refinancing of companies in Switzerland overall. By also purchasing in the primary market, we are directly promoting the raising of new capital. Initially, we restricted our purchases to mortgage bonds (Pfandbriefe). Since the beginning of April, however, we have also been buying corporate bonds. In both of these segments, we hope to achieve the greatest impact on the market as a whole. In principle, we buy only marketable bonds and pay market prices. Apart from the mortgage bonds, we did not buy any bonds issued by financial institutes. As of mid-June, our total purchases amounted to around CHF 2.5 billion in mortgage bonds and roughly CHF 300 million in corporate bonds. For the time being, we plan to continue purchasing selectively. As regards volume, we have set no restrictions. The bond purchases also seem to have fulfilled their purpose. Risk premia have come down significantly (cf. chart 3). That said, we were able to benefit from the favourable mood in the financial markets. The fact that, in the past few weeks, several issuers found their way back to the issues market for the first time in a long time is further proof of the effectiveness of our strategy. SNB StabFund Developments in the market since the UBS package of measures was announced show that the transfer of illiquid assets from UBS to the SNB StabFund was both appropriate and absolutely necessary. Had these assets remained on UBS’s books and been valued at 2 BIS Review 77/2009 
market price, the bank’s existence would have been seriously threatened these last few months. The transfer of assets was concluded at the beginning of April. Ultimately, the total volume of assets transferred amounted to USD 38.7 billion, where the purchase price was roughly USD 1 billion below the book value of the assets at UBS at the end of September 2008. In addition, a substantial portion of the amount transferred includes liabilities in the form of derivatives which currently do not need to be financed by the SNB. The initial financing of the StabFund was therefore considerably lower than the purchase price. It comprised the SNB’s loan to the StabFund totalling USD 26.6 billion and UBS’s equity contribution in the value of USD 3.9 billion.  The fund’s portfolio contains several thousand positions. Table 1 gives an overview of the portfolio and the different investment segments. The portfolio management concept is based on a long-term risk/return assessment. For assets where the cash flow is expected to exceed the current market price, we are mainly pursuing a hold-to-maturity strategy. For assets where this is not the case, we will sell if the opportunity arises. The objective of our portfolio management is to repay the SNB’s loan in full if at all possible. Market developments to date have impacted strongly on the StabFund’s assets. As it stands, most of the assets do not have to be entered in the balance sheet at market value. Rather, they only have to be written down if the balance sheet value is no longer considered sustainable based on the results of an impairment test. However, despite this method of stating assets in the balance sheet at amortised cost, the StabFund had already used up its equity capital by the end of March. Up until that point, it had been necessary to make value adjustments amounting to roughly USD 5 billion. Nonetheless, it still looks as though the StabFund will ultimately be able to pay back the loan. This is because, on the one hand, markets can recover; the positive turn of events in April and May corroborates this. On the other hand, the assets have been generating relatively robust cash flows until now.  Owing to interest payments and loan repayments, the SNB loan has already been reduced considerably. By mid-May, it came to only USD 23.7 billion. In addition, the original size of the StabFund has declined by around USD 6.7 billion as a result of sales, maturities and the closing out of derivatives positions. In mid-May, the size of the StabFund, as valued at amortised cost, was just roughly USD 32 billion, of which around USD 4 billion comprised contingent liabilities from derivatives. The performance of the stabilisation fund’s assets is due to be reassessed at the end of the second quarter.  Approximately 80% of the SNB’s loan to the StabFund is denominated in US dollars. Originally, the SNB fully refinanced the dollar loan via the existing swap facility with the Federal Reserve. Now, less than 20% is refinanced thus, accounting at this stage for only about USD 3 billion. By contrast, the outstanding volume in SNB USD Bills – launched in February 2009 to refinance the SNB loan to the StabFund – is already at USD 15 billion. In addition to these short-term financing operations, the SNB concluded long-term deposit transactions amounting to USD 4 billion. We plan to further reduce the use of the swap facility with the Federal Reserve.  Risks The risks facing the SNB as a result of its commitment in the StabFund are substantial, yet owing to the bank’s strong balance sheet, these risks can be absorbed. I would particularly like to emphasise that the SNB’s commitment is actually considerably lower than the USD 60 billion which still gets quoted by the public quite often. The SNB does not consider its loan to the stabilisation fund as a hindrance – either to its risk capability or its monetary policy latitude. The unconventional measures also pose additional risks to the SNB’s balance sheet in the form of interest rate, currency and credit risks. However, our analyses show that, in terms of the consolidated balance sheet, these risks are relatively low.  BIS Review 77/2009 3 
The SNB is well aware of the fact that the unconventional monetary policy measures pose not only balance sheet risks, but also a whole series of other risks, including the difficulties connected with correctly assessing the monetary policy impact and with finding the best way to phase out the unconventional measures. As with the StabFund, we are convinced that – here too – we must take these risks in order to be able to avert other, even greater risks. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. The financial market crisis has confirmed our belief that the SNB must have a strong capital base and a broad range of monetary policy instrument to ensure its capacity to act at all times.

Lorenzo Bini Smaghi: Going forward – regulation and supervision after the financial turmoil Speech by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the 4th International Conference of Financial Regulation and Supervision “After the Big Bang: Reshaping Central Banking, Regulation and Supervision”, Bocconi University, Milan, 19 June 2009. *      *      * Introduction1Today, the European Council is expected to endorse significant changes to the institutional set-up for financial supervision and regulation in the European Union. Undoubtedly these are important reforms, particularly – but not only – against the background of the financial crisis that started in August 2007. While the ECB has an interest in all these reforms, in particular on the macro-prudential side, namely the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). Macro-prudential supervision has its origin in the phenomenon of systemic risk. A particularly illuminating account of the nature of and the need for a macro-prudential supervisory policy was provided in 2000 by Andrew Crockett, then the General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements and Chairman of the Financial Stability Forum.2 Crockett argued that we should “consolidate a shift in perspective that is already taking place, complementing the micro-prudential perspective with increased awareness of, and attention to, the macro-prudential facet”. He defined the objective of macro-prudential supervision as limiting the likelihood of the failure, and corresponding costs, of significant portions of the financial system (responding to systemic risk). In contrast, the micro-prudential objective can be seen as limiting the likelihood of failure of individual institutions (responding to idiosyncratic risk).  From today’s perspective the distinction seems as relevant as one decade ago. However, the experience of the present crisis and the history of past crises, as well as the transformations of modern financial systems, require us to go further. We should ask ourselves, for example, what is the scope of macro-prudential supervision. I would distinguish two dimensions. The first one is the analysis and monitoring of risk. The second one is the containment of the risks that have been identified, which requires specific instruments. This raises the question of the institutional set-up for conducting macro-prudential supervision. 1.  Monitoring and analysing risk The literature suggests three main considerations on the way in which systemic risks should be monitored and analysed.3 A first one is that macro-prudential analysis needs to capture all components of financial systems and how they interact. This includes all intermediaries, markets and infrastructures underpinning them. In this respect, it is important to consider that at present some of these components, such as hedge funds, private equity firms or over-the-                                                 1  I would like to thank Philip Hartman, Fabio Recine and Lorenzo Cappiello for their contributions and comments. The views expressed represent only those of the author. 2  See “Marrying the micro- and macro-prudential dimensions of financial stability”, remarks before the Eleventh International Conference of Banking Supervisors, held in Basel on 20-21 September 2000. 3  See for example De Bandt and Hartmann (2000), “Systemic risk: A survey”, ECB Working Paper No. 35, November; De Bandt, Hartmann and Peydro-Alcalde, “Systemic risk: An update”, forthcoming in Berger et al.

counter (OTC) financial markets, are not subject to micro-prudential supervision. But they need to be part of macro-prudential analysis and risk assessments, as they influence the overall behaviour of the financial system. To gain a truly “systemic” perspective on the financial system, no material element should be left out. This includes, notably, large and complex financial institutions.  The failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and its consequences for the world financial system could not illustrate better how important the individual viability and the multiple connections to other intermediaries and markets of such large and complex institutions are for systemic stability and therefore for macro-prudential risk assessments and policies.4 At the same time, it illustrates well how micro-prudential and macro-prudential risk assessments and policies interact and should not operate in isolation from each other.5A second consideration is that macro-prudential risk assessment needs to cover the interactions between the financial system and the economy at large. Many systemic banking crises in history have been caused by macroeconomic downturns.6 The recent crisis shows the magnitude of adverse feedback effects between financial stability and real economic developments.7 Macro-prudential supervision needs to fully incorporate the two-sided interactions between financial and real sectors and the mutually reinforcing spirals between financial instability and real performance. This includes, but should in no way be limited to, the assessment of the pro-cyclical behaviour of financial systems and the potential reinforcing elements embedded in the regulatory systems.8 The framework for analysing the interactions between the real and financial dimensions requires a substantial modification of the traditional tools for assessing financial stability. A lot of work is required in this respect.9A third element to be taken into account is that financial markets are not static and are continuously evolving as a result of innovation and international integration. It is probably not a coincidence that the first published official document that I could find that used the term “macro-prudential policy” was actually a report dedicated to innovation in international banking.10 Several financial crises in history have been a result of financial liberalisations or innovations that were neither sufficiently understood nor managed. For example, one of the origins of the present crisis is to be found in the use of certain securitisation techniques, which were implemented in opaque ways.11 Again, determining the extent to which a fully                                                  4  For a much more wide-ranging interpretation of the financial system as a complex network with influential nodes and analogies to other sciences, like biology, computer science and medicine, see Haldane (2009), “Rethinking the financial network”, speech delivered at the Financial Student Association, Amsterdam, April. 5  See for example the European Commission communication on “European financial supervision” (27 May 2009). 6  See for example Gorton (1988), “Banking panics and business cycles”, Oxford Economic Papers, 40, pp. 751-781, and Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (1998), “The determinants of banking crises in developing and developed countries”, IMF Staff Papers, 45, pp. 81-109. 7  See for example the ECB’s June 2009 Financial Stability Review for a discussion of the adverse feedback effects from the ongoing global downturn to financial stability risks. 8  See for example Borio, Furfine and Lowe (2001), “Procyclicality of the financial system and financial stability: Issues and policy options”, BIS Papers, 1, pp. 1-57, Kashyap and Stein (2004), “Cyclical implications of Basel II capital standards”, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Economic Perspectives, 1st quarter, pp. 18-31, or Rajan (2006), “Has finance made the world riskier?”, European Financial Management, 12, pp. 499-533. 9  One example is the recently established new project and working group on transmission channels between the real and financial sector by the Research Task Force of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 10  See the so-called Cross Report on “Recent innovations in international banking” prepared by a study group of the central banks of the Group of Ten countries (April 1986). It featured also a full chapter on “Global integration of financial markets”. 11  See for example Ashcraft and Schuermann (2008), “Understanding the securitisation of subprime mortgage credit”, Foundations and Trends in Finance, 2(3), pp. 191-309, in particular the chart on “The seven “deadly” frictions of securitisation”. 2 BIS Review 77/2009 
developed macro-prudential function would have to take into account innovations shaping instruments, institutions and processes in the financial system would go beyond regular financial stability analysis. On the basis of the above considerations, a key output of macro-prudential analysis would ideally be a periodical graduated ex ante risk assessment measuring the amount of risk in the overall financial system and its implications for the economy at large. This assessment would also estimate the overall degree of instability that could result if certain unexpected adverse events were to materialise, including scenarios of extreme shocks, ultimately also assessing the resilience of the financial system and of the economy in general. Whereas macro-prudential (and micro-prudential) supervision is mainly concerned with extreme events such as financial crises (“tail risks”), the forward-looking approach required to prevent those extremes implies that careful assessments also be made in more tranquil times, establishing how far the system is from a crisis and which risks – if they were to materialise – could bring it closer to a crisis. What is needed to conduct such analysis and monitoring? The starting condition for implementing a comprehensive macro-prudential function is an adequate information basis. The first part of the information basis is a good system of continuous market intelligence, which gives a hands-on picture of current market developments and expectations through direct contacts. The second part consists of the regular collection of macro-prudential data and statistics, such as those relating to the macroeconomic environment, financial markets and related infrastructures, payment and settlement systems, regulated and unregulated intermediaries, non-financial corporations and households, as well as to the relationships between the main economic and financial sectors. The third part consists of the regular collection of firm-level information and data, in particular for large and complex financial institutions. This relates to specific items of information regarding on- and off-balance-sheet items, with appropriate breakdowns of exposures related to the asset and liability sides (geographical, sectoral, currency, etc.), including the identification of counterparties. For the identification of interlinkages between major intermediaries and the assessment of contagion risks, an international “risk map” – as proposed for example in the de Larosière Report – would be particularly helpful.12 Lastly, for the large and complex groups, micro-prudential information about liquidity and risk management models would be required.  The second instrument is a suite of analytical tools and models and a staff familiar with them. Although formal models have their limitations, they do help structure the qualitative and quantitative information that is collected for the regular risk assessments. Existing research offers eight broad groups of approaches and models: financial stability indicators, contagion and spillover models, early warning signal models, stress testing models, macro-financial risk-based flow-of-funds accounts models, macro-econometric forecasting models, calibrated general equilibrium financial stability models and other models (including models of firm and household vulnerabilities). These models have their pros and cons, but some are more promising or easier to implement than others. Each serves different purposes, but there are also overlaps. Since financial stability analysis in general and macro-prudential analysis in particular is much less understood than other policy areas, it is advisable to use a multiplicity of approaches. How many of the overall list can be used and how much will depend on the resources available to develop and maintain them. But the investment in the analytical toolkit is likely to be significant. I expect most authorities having to develop a macro-prudential supervisory function to extend or reallocate resources in order to meet these requirements.                                                   12  “High-level Group on Financial Supervision in Europe”, report, Brussels, 25 February 2009.

2.  Containing risks If risks to systemic stability have been identified, the next step is to contain them. I would consider three ways to achieve this. A first option is to communicate the risks and the sources of these risks to financial market participants, with a view to alerting them and inducing them to adjust their behaviour. A second option is to strengthen supervisory oversight over financial institutions and markets, with a view to avoiding excessive risk-taking. The third option is to achieve the same objective through the use of regulatory powers. The three steps can be summarised as follows: (i) alerting, (ii) supervising more closely and (iii) regulating. The choice of which instrument to use may vary, depending on the severity of the risk and on the circumstances.  A major challenge for macro-prudential supervision relates to the decision-making system capable of accommodating these three options. Let me provide some illustrations. First of all, addressing certain macro risks may require the adoption of regulatory measures across the board, applying in particular to financial institutions and markets. This may blur the responsibility between macro- and micro-prudential supervision. Alternatively, one can follow the suggestion by Crockett I mentioned above and distinguish the regulatory and supervisory actions between those conducted at the level of individual institutions and those affecting the whole markets. The supervisory and regulatory measures aiming at containing aggregate risk and externalities would be part of the macro-prudential toolkit, whereas measures aiming at the stability of individual institutions would be part of micro-prudential policy. Following this objective-oriented approach, the measures aimed at reducing pro-cyclicality of financial systems would be part of macro-prudential policy. Some concrete ideas are being discussed on how to reduce pro-cyclicality, such as adjusting capital requirements to the business cycle (making them less stringent in bad times and more stringent in good times), adding maximum leverage ratios or introducing dynamic provisioning rules (where reserves have to be accumulated in good times and are drawn down in bad times).13 Measures aimed at dampening pro-cyclicality may also affect compensation structures, transparency and accounting rules, internal governance (e.g. related to the risk management function), the design of certain financial instruments, and maturity mismatches.14  The macro-prudential toolkit would also include measures to reduce contagion and to limit other transmission channels of financial instability. Much progress has been made in the last two decades in the area of payment and settlement systems, but more needs to be done, as suggested by the recent debate on central clearing counterparties for OTC derivatives. New challenges have emerged as a result of the significant increase in wholesale funding of financial intermediaries, the emergence of new institutions (some of them highly leveraged and to which banks are very much exposed) and the increasing transfer of risks previously concentrated in the banking sector to other agents, such as insurance companies. A comprehensive framework for policy analysis is still lacking. A number of proposals for specific macro-prudential measures have been put forward, following the objective-oriented approach.15 But we need a broad framework for policy analysis and implementation. We have been working on this at the ECB for some time.                                                  13  On dynamic provisioning, see Fernandez de Lis, Martinez Pages and Saurina (2000), “Credit growth, problem loans and credit risk provisioning in Spain”, Banco de España Working Paper No. 0018, Madrid, and Jimenez and Saurina (2006), “Credit cycles, credit risk and prudential regulation”, International Journal of Central Banking, 3(2), pp. 65-98. 14  Most or all of them have already been identified in the Draghi Report prepared by the Financial Stability Forum (2008), “Enhancing market and institutional resilience”, Basel, 7 April, as the first regulatory and supervisory response to the experiences of the present financial crisis. 15  See in particular Brunnermeier et al. (2009), “The fundamental principles of financial regulation”, preliminary conference draft of the 11th Geneva Report on the World Economy, January, who propose to adjust bank 4 BIS Review 77/2009 
To be sure, many of the risks that have materialised during the recent crisis had been signalled earlier on, in the public communications by relevant policy authorities, such as the ECB (in its Financial Stability Review and in speeches by Executive Board members), the Bank for International Settlements (in its Quarterly Review of Financial Market Developments and Annual Report), the Bank of England or the International Monetary Fund (in its Global Financial Stability Report).16 With hindsight we can perhaps acknowledge that these communications were not effective in changing the behaviour of financial market participants, nor of the supervisory authorities. Furthermore, there has been an insufficient understanding of the force with which the different risk factors have materialised and combined. For example, had there been a much more developed monitoring system, covering also the non-regulated financial sectors and the so-called shadow banking system, as well as a more granular and frequent picture of the main exposures of and among the large and complex financial institutions, a better insight could have been gained into the scope for the crisis to erupt and to spread across financial systems. Had there been a more integrated assessment of the impact of financial innovation, the risks developing in credit risk transfer markets would have been better understood and monitored. However, the flow of information from the micro-prudential supervisors was insufficient to undertake such an assessment.  3.  The institutional framework Having set out the main objectives and tools, I would now like to address the issue of the institutional framework which should support the implementation of macro-prudential supervision. Such a framework inevitably involves two main actors: the central banks and the authority in charge of regulating and supervising financial institutions and markets. The latter has the information on individual participants and market developments, and is responsible for the stability of individual institutions, while the former has the analytical capabilities for assessing macroeconomic risk and global financial market developments. A properly functioning system requires a full flow of information: from the supervisory authority to the central bank, with a view to providing all the relevant information to monitor and analyse risk and, vice versa, from the central bank to the micro-prudential supervisor in order to provide the result of the risk analysis and ensure that appropriate measures are implemented. Also important are a clear allocation of responsibilities and proper accountability to ensure that the right incentives are in place for the achievement of results in a cooperative manner rather than inter-institutional fighting, which is a recipe for disaster.  To consider the options available let me refer for simplicity the Turner Review as a basis for the analysis.17 In extreme synthesis, the Turner Review attributes to the central bank the main responsibility for conducting the risk analysis, but when it comes to the policy implications, three models are considered: • In Model 1, the central bank identifies systemic risks and makes recommendations to the authority in charge of micro-prudential supervision, which sets out the main actions to be taken to address these risks.                                                                                                                                                       capital ratios for leverage, maturity mismatches and contagion risk, or Kashyap, Rajan and Stein, “Rethinking capital regulation”, for the 2008 Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas Jackson Hole Symposium, who propose a capital insurance mechanism. 16  Nier (2009), “Financial stability frameworks and the role of central banks: Lessons from the crisis”, IMF Working Paper WP/09/70, April, goes even further by stating that: “With hindsight, there has been a collective failure to address a key objective—mitigation of systemic risk” and “an expanded role of central banks that goes beyond the tools already typically at their disposal may enhance the overall effectiveness of financial regulation, allowing synergies to be exploited between existing and new regulatory tools to mitigate systemic risk”. 17  “The Turner Review: A regulatory response to the global banking crisis”, March 2009 (www.fsa.gov.uk). BIS Review 77/2009 5 
• In Model 2, the central bank is not only in charge of identifying risks, but is also able to take specific macro-prudential measures or to require the authority in charge of micro-prudential supervision to do so. • In Model 3, a joint committee, composed of representatives of the central bank and the supervisory authority, makes the final decision as to the appropriate policy response.  In my view, the third model is a third best, because it risks blurring responsibilities and does not ensure proper accountability of the central bank and the micro supervisor. Within the proposed committee, no public disagreements between the central bank and the supervisor could arise, as it would hurt the credibility of the process. This means that de facto the micro supervisor has a veto right on the central bank. If instead the two components of the committee are allowed to disagree in public, Model 3 would become quite similar to Model 1, where the differences are made public and the supervisor would have to explain why it disagrees with the central bank and does not take the suggested action. Another disadvantage of Model 3 emerges when the supervisory authority is not independent of the political authority. I will not elaborate on the need for such independence, but in my view the recent crisis, if anything, has strongly confirmed it. Looking around Europe, it would be interesting to verify the extent to which during the recent crisis bank solvency problems have emerged mainly in countries where the supervisory authority is outside the central bank and where the independence of the former (also in financial and institutional terms) is less well protected than that of the latter. In these countries, Model 3 would create a channel to influence the central bank. Furthermore, in the context of the European Union Model 3 would be particularly difficult to implement, as it would require agreement between a multiplicity of national authorities, unless we get to a situation in which the central banks and the supervisory authorities are represented by one European-wide institution. While in the current system the central banks can be represented by the ECB, the supervisors do not yet have a similar system. Models 1 and 2 ensure a clearer allocation of responsibilities, either to the central bank or to the supervisory authority. In assessing the two models, a key issue to consider concerns the conflict of interests, in particular within the central bank and within the supervisory authority, respectively.  Let’s consider first the conflicts of interest within the central bank, which would emerge in particular in Model 2, between the objective of price stability and the objective of macro-financial stability. A conflict would arise if the central bank would have to address the two objectives with only one instrument, i.e. the interest rate. The central bank could be pushed to use the interest rate not only to achieve price stability but also to counter macro systemic risks. For instance, it could have to increase interest rates prematurely, in order to stop a financial bubble from developing, while the underlying economic developments do not require it. The interest rate is not necessarily the most efficient way to prevent or to prick bubbles. The conflict of interest would vanish if the central bank had two distinct instruments to address the two objectives, with a clear assignment. The interest rate would be assigned to achieving price stability, while macro-prudential measures would be aimed at macro-financial stability. During the current crisis, the ECB has shown that such a separation can be achieved. On the one hand the interest rate has been used with a view to achieve price stability, while, on the one hand, liquidity-injecting measures have aimed at stabilising the money market. Each measure has been adopted and justified to the public in such a way as to keep separate the two objectives. Overall, the experience suggests that the interest rate and macro-prudential instruments are rather complementary and do not give rise to conflicts of interest. Let’s consider now the potential conflicts of interest for the supervisory authority, between the macro- and micro-prudential objectives. Supervisory authorities might have to make trade-offs to achieve both. For instance, it would be more difficult for a supervisor to decide to 6 BIS Review 77/2009 
tighten capital requirements and liquidity ratios in a booming economy if some banks are individually experiencing difficulties. There might be an incentive to address these difficulties with general, rather than specific, measures. In the European framework, given that the micro-supervisory authority is exerted at the national level, there is a problem of uniformity of action. In Model 1, in which the central bank can only make recommendations, it is not clear how the various national authorities would react and implement it. There could be a situation in which the implementation differs across countries, without clear justification. Ultimately, the incentive to safeguard the competitiveness of the national systems would induce the respective authorities to adopt a minimalist approach, which would be to the detriment of overall stability. On the other hand, national economies may develop in different ways, even in the euro area, and the macro risks arising in some countries may not be as relevant for others. For example, over the last ten years some euro area countries have experienced fast growth of domestic credit and rising asset prices, while in others financial dynamics have been more subdued. However, when looking at the risks taken by the banking system across countries, they have emerged both in fast- and slow-growing countries. This implies that in Model 2 the central bank should be able to adopt measures that take adequately into account different macroeconomic developments across countries. Overall, there seems to be greater conflicts of interest between the objectives of macro and micro prudential supervision than between price stability and macro-prudential supervision. This is the reason why I tend to consider that Model 2, in which the central bank is given two instruments in order to achieve two distinct objectives is more appropriate, especially within the European framework, and even more so for the euro area. This seems to be the model that will be implemented in the US. The US administration has proposed to give the Fed powers to address the build up of risks that threaten the financial system as a whole, with a focus on core institutions and markets. The creation of a Council of regulators has been proposed, but the Fed will not need to seek the council’s approval to act against systemic risks. The de Larosière Report opted instead for Model 1. It suggests the creation of a European Systemic Risk Council (ESRC), embedded in the ECB, corresponding to the General Council. The General Council of the ECB is composed of the governors of the national central banks of the 27 EU Member States, plus the President and Vice-President of the ECB. The Council would be open to a series of observers, like the Commission, the three authorities being created from the three Lamfalussy Committees (for banking, markets and insurance), and the 27 national supervisors. The ESRC will be able to issue recommendations aimed at identifying and correcting systemic vulnerabilities, while national supervisors would be responsible for the implementation. As I mentioned previously, this model raises the issue of uniformity of treatment across the single market. The experience over the last years has shown that national authorities tend to use at their own discretion the room for manoeuvre that is available in the transposition of European legislation. This would also be the case for the recommendations of the ESRC. Finally, the de Larosière Report did not foresee any separate arrangements for the euro area. We will thus be in the very peculiar situation in which those countries that do not participate in the euro will have two levels of discussion and decision on systemic risk, one at the EU level and one at the national level, while the euro area countries will have only the EU level. Unless, of course, the ECB decides to issue itself recommendations for the euro area. One key proposal contained in the de Larosière Report is the obligation for the national micro-prudential supervisors to provide all the necessary information to the ECB in order to support the latter’s risk analysis for the ESRC. From the de Larosière Report to the European Council Conclusions that will be adopted today, there has been a long discussion between the Member States, based on a proposal by the Commission. The main contents of the proposal have been maintained. The European BIS Review 77/2009 7 
Systemic Risk Board (rather than Council) has the powers to make recommendations but not to implement policies directly. It will be supported analytically and logistically by the ECB. The Commission will present legislative proposals this autumn that will further specify the new institutional arrangements. Indeed, further work is needed to elaborate in detail the institutional framework of the ESRB, as well as of the new European authorities for micro-prudential supervision. Conclusions The recent crisis has shown the importance of macro-prudential supervision in promoting financial stability. A lot of work needs to be done to equip the competent institutions with the analytical instruments to assess and monitor systemic risk and with the toolkit necessary to contain such risks. Some concern may arise on whether the decision-making process, in particular within Europe and even more so for the euro area, which is expected to be set up over the next few months will be effective in the context of the single financial market, also in comparison to the reforms which have been put forward in the US. Implementation will be key. Indeed, as time goes by, and financial markets show some signs of stabilisation, there is a risk that the sense of urgency for reform fades away and nationalistic tendencies and institutional jealousies re-emerge. The forces pushing towards maintaining the status quo are gaining strength. If these forces are not firmly counteracted, this crisis could turn out to have been a wasted opportunity. And the next crisis could move closer. 8 BIS Review 77/2009 
Mervyn King: Monetary policy developments Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London at the Mansion House, London, 17 June 2009. *      *      * My Lord Mayor, Mr Chancellor, My Lords, Ministers, Aldermen, Mr Recorder, Sheriffs, Ladies and Gentlemen, It has been quite a year. A year to remember, but not to repeat. Since we last met, a financial panic swept through markets in September, several major financial institutions failed, and a remarkable collapse of confidence around the world led to unprecedented declines in industrial production and national output. World trade fell by almost 15% in six months, a faster rate of decline than in the Great Depression. Faced with this crisis, the Bank of England took extraordinary actions. Bank Rate was cut virtually to zero, and the Monetary Policy Committee embarked on a programme of £125 billion of asset purchases. And in your own businesses you too have had to deal with what some have called a once-in-a-century event. Since the panic last autumn, overall output has fallen by around 3% in the United States and the United Kingdom, 6% in Germany, and 7% in Japan. The collapse of spending in these economies is having painful consequences. In less than a year, over 5 million jobs have been lost in the United States, almost 2 million in the euro area, and almost half a million here in the United Kingdom. Despite those unprecedented falls in activity, there are some signs that the British economy is beginning to stabilise, and financial markets have improved markedly. There are three solid reasons for thinking that a recovery in activity was likely to occur at some point this year.  The first I call the “Honda effect” – many firms, as Honda did last year at its plant in Swindon, cut back production and met demand from stock, resuming production this year once inventories had been reduced.  The second factor is the level of sterling which, despite its recent rally, is still some 20% lower than in the summer of 2007. That will encourage a switch in spending, at home and abroad, towards goods and services produced in the UK.  Finally, and perhaps most important, is the enormous policy stimulus that has been injected into the economy. Bank Rate was cut by four percentage points in four months. But the Monetary Policy Committee judged that even that was insufficient to prevent inflation falling below our 2% target, and so it embarked on a programme of asset purchases designed to increase the money supply and improve conditions in non-bank corporate credit markets. The programme will shortly be extended to working capital finance, which should be of particular help to smaller companies. But the Bank must not become the arbiter of the allocation of public credit to individual companies or sectors – such decisions are rightly and necessarily the province of government. So there is a limit to the scope of the Bank’s activities in this area.  The success of the policy is not to be judged by the increase in bank lending. Its aim is to increase the money supply. There are already tentative signs that the programme is beginning to have beneficial effects with the growth rate of broad money picking up.  So there are certainly grounds for believing that the rapid falls in activity are coming to an end. But there are some equally solid reasons for believing that the path to full recovery could be protracted. The most obvious is that the supply of bank lending to companies and BIS Review 76/2009 1 
households remains constrained. The stock of bank lending to non-financial companies has been falling in recent months, and household lending has been flat. Part of this undoubtedly reflects weak demand in the face of the recession. But the evidence from prospective borrowers, and the terms on which lenders are willing to extend credit, suggest that banks’ ability to finance a sustained recovery remains impaired by low levels of equity capital. Stress tests designed to assess the viability of banks are very different from tests of the capacity of the banking system to finance a recovery.  Investors continue to demand high returns to finance banks. Put bluntly, market data on credit spreads imply that some banks are viewed as a worse credit risk than some of their customers. As a result, companies that can bypass the banks to access capital markets directly are doing so. Indeed, in the first four months of this year, more finance was raised in debt and equity markets than is normally the case in an entire year. Most companies, however, especially smaller and medium-sized enterprises, rely heavily on bank finance. And with current market sentiment it may take further additions to equity capital before the banking system will be able to supply credit at a price and on a scale to finance a sustained recovery. That is likely to take time.  It is too soon to reverse the extraordinary policy stimulus that has been injected into the UK economy through monetary policy, the provision of liquidity support to banks, guarantees of bank funding, and fiscal policy. Nevertheless, it is not too early to prepare such “exit strategies” and to explain how they would work. The challenge facing the Monetary Policy Committee is straightforward in principle but difficult in practice. As activity returns to more normal levels, the outlook for inflation will pick up. And it is the outlook for inflation that will guide decisions on the pace and timing of a withdrawal of monetary stimulus. Reaching judgements on the outlook for inflation is never easy, and assessing their implications for policy will always be a matter of balancing risks. In contrast, the choice of instruments is simple. When appropriate the MPC will raise Bank Rate and gradually run down its portfolio of assets in a manner consistent with maintaining orderly markets. Just as no one should plan on the present degree of monetary stimulus persisting indefinitely, so too no bank should expect that the current extraordinary liquidity support will continue for ever. In due course, a strategy will be needed to exit from that temporary support, and from the extensive bank guarantees, to the permanent regime for liquidity insurance that the Bank announced last year. The Bank of England will talk with the banks about how to manage the transition.  As we emerge from recession, fiscal policy too will have to change. In taking the extraordinary measures to stabilise banks and the wider economy, some of the past build-up of debt has been transferred from the private to the public sector. And it was right to use a temporary fiscal stimulus to counter the depth of the downturn experienced last year. But five years from now national debt, as a proportion of national income, is expected to be more than double its level before the crisis. So it is also necessary to produce a clear plan to show how prospective deficits will be reduced during the next Parliament, so returning to a gradually declining path for the ratio of national debt to national income.  We must learn lessons from the events of the past two years. They cannot be final conclusions because the present crisis has some way to run. But two stand out. First, price stability does not guarantee stability of the economy as a whole. Second, the instruments used to pursue financial stability are in need of sharpening and refining. Setting Bank Rate to maintain price stability was successful in itself, but did not prevent a recession induced by a financial crisis. But let’s not throw out the baby with the bathwater. The period prior to the crisis was the most stable economic environment for generations. And, unlike most previous recessions, this crisis wasn’t preceded by an unsustainable boom in output. In the five years leading up to the crisis, overall GDP growth remained close to its long-run average and inflation differed from the 2% target on average by only 0.2 percentage 2 BIS Review 76/2009 
points. Diverting monetary policy from its goal of price stability risks making the economy less stable and the financial system no more so. To argue that monetary policy should be directed to counter inadequately priced risk is to argue that unemployment is a price worth paying to tame the banking system. Inflation targeting is a necessary but not sufficient condition for stability in the economy as a whole. When a policy is necessary but not sufficient, the answer is not to abandon, but to augment, it. Indeed, the overarching lesson from this crisis is that the authorities lacked sufficient policy instruments to take effective actions. Nowhere was this more evident than in dealing with Northern Rock in the absence of proper resolution powers. For domestic institutions that particular issue was settled by the Banking Act 2009, and the new resolution powers were successfully deployed by the Bank to deal with the Dunfermline Building Society in March.  What other powers are required? There is a broad consensus that our traditional policy instruments need to be augmented by a “macro-prudential” toolkit. But what are such “macro-prudential” instruments for? Are they to increase the resilience of individual banks, or are they to protect the economy from the banks? The former implies a sensible extension of the current regime of capital requirements for individual institutions. The latter goes to the heart of the problems caused by the financial sector as a whole for the rest of the economy. We need to reflect more deeply on the nature of the failures before designing a regulatory response – after all many financial markets continued to function well. But banks entered the crisis with historically low levels of liquid assets, and inadequate levels of capital with which to absorb losses. Moreover, in the United Kingdom, the financial sector became too big and too highly leveraged. First, the size of our banking system was, as a proportion of GDP, five times that in the United States, and the risks to the UK taxpayer correspondingly greater. Second, the process of reducing very high leverage is doing great damage to the rest of the economy. And the required adjustment still has a long way to run – few of the largest banks in the United Kingdom managed to reduce their leverage ratios through 2008, which remain at historically high levels. Third, interconnections between institutions create potential fragilities across the system, as we saw last September. Fourth, the risks associated with large-scale proprietary trading are probably harder to control in limited liability companies. So we need instruments to prevent the size, leverage, fragility and risk of the financial system from becoming too great. The resulting “macro-prudential” toolkit will contain a number of instruments to reduce risk, both across the system and over time. It must not be put together in a hurry. And I share the concerns of many of you that we are a long way from identifying precise regulatory interventions that would improve the functioning of markets.  As far as individual banks are concerned, we face some uncomfortable choices about the structure and regulation of our banking sector. If some banks are thought to be too big to fail, then, in the words of a distinguished American economist, they are too big. It is not sensible to allow large banks to combine high street retail banking with risky investment banking or funding strategies, and then provide an implicit state guarantee against failure. Something must give. Either those guarantees to retail depositors should be limited to banks that make a narrower range of investments, or banks which pose greater risks to taxpayers and the economy in the event of failure should face higher capital requirements, or we must develop resolution powers such that large and complex financial institutions can be wound down in an orderly manner. Or, perhaps, an element of all three. Privately owned and managed institutions that are too big to fail sit oddly with a market economy.  One important practical step would be to require any regulated bank itself to produce a plan for an orderly wind down of its activities. That would provide the information to the authorities the absence of which made past decisions about the future of institutions difficult. Making a will should be as much a part of good housekeeping for banks as it is for the rest of us. And it would be sensible for the various authorities to work across national boundaries to identify detailed plans for how each large cross-border financial institution could be wound down.  BIS Review 76/2009 3 
The Bank of England has a new statutory responsibility for financial stability. Bank Rate is the instrument we deploy to achieve monetary stability, and should be used exclusively for that purpose. To achieve financial stability the powers of the Bank are limited to those of voice and the new resolution powers. The Bank finds itself in a position rather like that of a church whose congregation attends weddings and burials but ignores the sermons in between. Like the church, we cannot promise that bad things won’t happen to our flock – the prevention of all financial crises is in neither our nor anyone else’s power, as a study of history or human nature would reveal. And experience suggests that attempts to encourage a better life through the power of voice is not enough. Warnings are unlikely to be effective when people are being asked to change behaviour which seems to them highly profitable. So it is not entirely clear how the Bank will be able to discharge its new statutory responsibility if we can do no more than issue sermons or organise burials.  Whatever the ultimate shape of the structure and regulation of the banking system – and, as many of you have said, we need to think carefully to get this right – change will be necessary. The costs of this crisis are not to be measured simply in terms of its impact on public finances, the destruction of wealth, and the number of jobs lost. They are also to be seen in the lost trust in the financial sector among other parts of our economy. For a generation or more, businesses and families up and down the country were told, not least by the City, that the disciplines of the market economy were essential, even if painful in the short run, for greater prosperity in the longer term. That belief in the merits of a market economy was embraced and for many years was not misplaced. But out of the blue – in this case the financial sector – came a crisis that did not stem from weaknesses in the real economy. It has wreaked havoc on those same businesses and families. Unemployment, as we saw in today’s figures, is rising sharply. And yet it is the banking system that has received financial support on an almost unimaginable scale. We who work in the financial sector have much to do to regain the trust of those who work outside it. “My word is my bond” are old words, but they were important. “My word is my CDO-squared” will never catch on. There is no support in this country, and no case, for excessively bureaucratic regulation. But change to the structure, regulation and indeed culture of our banking system is necessary. Blaming individuals is no substitute for acknowledging the failure of a system, of a certain type of banking. We have a real opportunity now to put that right, and regain the trust that has been lost.  Lord Mayor, as we prepare to toast the Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, we remember that the City is more than banking and that banking is much more than the trading of complex securities. So all of us here tonight would like to pay tribute to your work since you became Lord Mayor, to support your efforts to promote financial literacy, and to thank both the Lady Mayoress and yourself for the splendid hospitality which you have extended to us all this evening. So I invite you all to rise and join me in the traditional toast of good health and prosperity to "The Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress", Ian and Lin Luder. 4 BIS Review 76/2009 
José De Gregorio: Global confidence crisis – the value of waiting and the coordination failures revisited  Keynote speech by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, at the opening of the Post-Graduate Program of the School of Economics and Business Administration of Universidad de Chile, Santiago, 4 June 2009. I wish to thank Pablo García and Enrique Orellana for their helpful contributions and comments. *      *      * “When, as today, the unknown unknowns dominate, and the economic environment is so complex as to appear nearly incomprehensible, the result is extreme prudence, if not outright paralysis, on the part of investors, consumers and firms. And this behaviour, in turn, feeds the crisis.” (Blanchard, 2009). I want to begin by thanking you for inviting me to open the academic year of the Post-Graduate Program of the School of Economics and Business Administration at Universidad de Chile. Most of my presentations are for an audience that is primarily interested in learning about the Bank’s view on the economy, so my lectures tend to focus largely on the national and international junctures and their prospects. On this occasion, I will take advantage of the academic setting that brought us together, and the freedom I was given to choose the subject, to refer to a central aspect of the current global crisis, namely the confidence crisis, focusing on some key concepts that can help us understand what is going on at this global economic juncture. The natural question here is: what was the ingredient that led the financial events of mid-September of last year to end up the way they did? The developed world entered a severe recession, and output dropped simultaneously in most countries. The crisis spread around the world like a virus, with unprecedented and, of course, unforeseen strength and speed, making no distinctions among economies’ strengths or weaknesses (Figure 1).  What happened? Why was there no differentiation? How could such massive contagion occur? Why the synchrony? All of these are very important questions in understanding how the crisis was transmitted and how we will make it through. If there is one thing that is difficult to explain it is the intensity of its impact. In Chile, neither the path that the domestic economic cycle was experiencing nor the analysis of traditional transmission channels for an external crisis – that is, financial and commercial channels – are capable of fully explaining what happened (De Gregorio, 2009).  The hypothesis that seems to have most ground at the moment is that a deterioration in global confidence, understood as a worsening of expectations and increased uncertainty around the world, has amplified the response to the initial impact, pushing us into a more acute and synchronized crisis than we could envision at first. It helps to study the historical relationships among the data if cycles and patterns tend to repeat themselves on a regular basis. But in the current crisis, which has no precedents in many decades, to look at simple correlations based on normal periods can be very misleading. From my standpoint, it is more important to conceptualize what is happening today, in order to analyze the prospects of the economy and draw policy conclusions. To address this subject I will use some basic economics that will allow us to understand the synchrony and severity of the current crisis. These arguments have been present for many years in the profession and have gained enormous importance today. The first refers to the existence of multiple equilibria and the effect of failed coordination. The second deals with the effect of uncertainty on economic decision making. These two elements help us understand how the confidence crisis that swept the world aggravated the output contraction, hitting hardest the demand for industrial goods. In the next section I will describe the main BIS Review 76/2009 1 
ideas that clarify the impact of the confidence crisis, and then analyze the international scenario in the following section. Some basic ideas The objective here is to account for the basic ideas behind the coordination failures, multiple equilibria and how uncertainty affects aggregate demand. Coordination failures Let us assume a very simple economy1 with a large number of consumers. Each consumer demands D units of a manufactured good, which we can think of as a durable good (e.g., car, house, appliance, electronic device). We can also think of durable goods demanded by firms when they invest (e.g., machinery and equipment, warehouses, plants).  The demand of consumers and firms is a function of their expectations of future income, directly related with the expected value of aggregate output in the economy. Y will denote the level of output and EY its future expected value. We will also assume that the demand depends on the level of uncertainty which we will call σ and I will discuss later. For now, it is enough to consider that the demand falls when uncertainty grows. Thus, the demand for goods is represented by D(EY,σ). Firms, in this example, produce what is demanded from them.2 Normalizing the population of firms and consumers to 1, the equilibrium will occur when the demand equals the supply (Y=D). In equilibrium under rational expectations, product must be equal to expected product, or: Y=D(Y,σ) Now, with a couple more assumptions we can find the equilibrium (Figure 2). The equilibrium is unique in A. For this, the demand is assumed to be concave, that is, any additional demand for goods is smaller as income increases. To ensure a unique equilibrium we assume that, for EY=0, the demand for the good is positive. This can be understood as the individual having another source of income and expenses, and always wanting to devote part of the other income to consume this good. Another simple way of seeing it is to think that the individual will want to borrow to acquire this good, even if her income is very low, presumably because she always expects to have the funds available in the future to repay. As we will see, however, it is possible that multiple equilibria exist, with low and high output, as a result of coordination failures.  Uncertainty and the value of waiting Decision making under uncertainty has always been a complex thing to study. Often to simplify, we turn to quadratic specifications in order to use certainty equivalence. Surely this                                                  1  This exercise is based on an MIT class exercise which, despite having saved my notes and after a number of inquiries with friends, I have been unable to find. The original model was somewhat more complex because it assumed strategic interactions among firms, and here the demand is only taken as given. More formal models were developed in Cooper and John (1988). For a thorough review of this literature, see Cooper (1999).  2  Note that because this is only an illustration, many aspects were left out of the analysis. In this case we are assuming that there is some friction in the price-setting mechanism that prevents firms from selling all they want at a given price. This friction may come from firms deciding how much to produce before they know the demand, which would lead us to incorporate the producers’ decisions to this story. Analytically, however, it would not change much. 2 BIS Review 76/2009 
falls short of describing the much more complex reality; for example, when the analysis considers decisions to invest or consume (durables) in the presence of irreversibilities.3  When a decision is irreversible, there is no chance to back out; for example, an investment is made for which no secondary market exists to liquidate it. The purchase of a durable good is another case. We know, however, that in general there will always be some way to get rid of the good, but part of its cost is impossible to recover – it is a sunk cost. A firm can build a plant, for instance, but to get rid of it the firm will have to resell it below cost because of specific features that prospective buyers will not appreciate.  In an environment of certainty, expenses will be incurred whenever the benefits outweigh the costs. Therefore, the choice is between spending and not spending. But with uncertainty and irreversibility, the choice is no longer between spending and not spending, but rather between spending, not spending, and waiting. This option has a value, because as time goes by, uncertainty fades. Thus, the more uncertain a choice is, the more profitable it is to wait. Imagine the case of a firm having to invest. Such investment consists of enlarging its facilities and purchasing new capital goods. If things go right, the investment will be very profitable. If things go wrong, the benefits of investing will be very low, and the present value of the project will be negative. Hence, had the firm known that things were going to go wrong, it would have preferred not to invest. If the passing of time helps to know with more certainty whether things will go right or wrong, the firm may find it convenient to wait and see. Waiting permits it to keep the choice between investing and not investing open, which is not the case when the investment has already been made. Thus the investment can be analyzed with the theory of options. The firm must balance the cost of postponing the investment with the benefit of learning more about the situation and making a better informed decision. Then, the larger the uncertainty, the greater the benefit of waiting.  This same logic can be applied to a consumer that must decide on the purchase of a durable good, but is uncertain about his future income. If the probability of losing his job increases, it may be advisable to wait before making the decision. Although this analysis is very simple intuitively, it is not easy to formalize. A consumer can sell his car or an electronic device if he loses his income, but it will be at a cost. The higher this cost, the more irreversible the decision becomes.4This idea permits us to explain why the decision to wait and see can be optimal and permits us to justify why demand, D, depends negatively on uncertainty, σ. The increase in uncertainty and the fall in demand What is critical about this analysis is that it can be very important from a quantitative point of view. The decision is not marginal. An increase in uncertainty does not result in “some” decrease in spending. An uncertainty shock that is common to all will lead every firm and every consumer to paralyze spending, causing a collapse in demand.  The main point is that this fall can be so sharp that one can even have more than one possible equilibrium (Figure 3). This could be the case if households decide to increase their savings significantly, such that low-income families would rather not spend on durable goods. The same could be true if firms decide not to invest. Thus, households and firms would delay                                                  3  For the case of irreversible investment, Dixit and Pindyck (1994) provide a very thorough analysis. A simple example is presented in De Gregorio (2007), chapter 4. 4 Implications like the ones described here can be inferred from the precautionary savings theory. In order to avoid the cost in lost utility of extreme negative events, the consumer chooses to keep some buffer-stock savings. If uncertainty aggravates, for example by increasing the dispersion of future earnings, then precautionary saving will probably increase, which is done by postponing consumption decisions. BIS Review 76/2009 3 
their decisions to spend on durable goods, awaiting uncertainty to clear up. Households, however, would continue to spend on non-durables. Actually, the share of goods like foodstuff in the total consumption basket would increase. Durable and investment goods, meanwhile, are the ones subject to this wait and see strategy and, by their own nature, their purchase can be postponed.  Thus, there are two possible equilibria: B and C, both with output below the original level A. Furthermore, we can think that in case C the loss of confidence is very big, which magnifies the fall in demand that may result from a cyclical adjustment. In such a case pessimism dominates. Everyone thinks that economic activity will fall due to increased uncertainty and that is exactly what happens, so pessimism is justified. This point is more general: facing multiple equilibria, how do private expectations coordinate for the economy to converge to one or the other? Evidently there is no natural mechanism, so failed coordination can easily lead the economy to settle in the worst equilibrium. The exercise I have presented is pretty simple and it surely overlooks many relevant aspects, especially the dynamics that might allow us to analyze the loss of confidence. It is still helpful because it explains why the increase in uncertainty triggered by the deterioration in output and the financial crisis deepens the fall in output, whose effects can be substantial. Let me proceed, then, by showing you what has been happening in the world and in Chile and how we can observe the increase in uncertainty in agents’ expectations and its propagation around the globe. The global crisis of confidence I will start by listing the main aspects I will be focusing on: • The synchrony of this crisis is unprecedented. The drop in output made no distinction among economies’ strengths or weaknesses. • Global uncertainty and distrust were particularly acute towards the end of last year. • The severe drop in demand was concentrated largely in durable goods. Investment and consumption of these products collapsed by the end of 2008. To contextualize this episode, I will begin by recalling that a debate about the accumulation of strong global imbalances had been going on for several years, focusing on their implications and ways to correct them. The Central Bank of Chile identified them as a significant risk in many of its Monetary Policy Reports. Meanwhile, the world proceeded with very unusual dynamism. World GDP grew by an annual average of nearly 5 percent between 2004 and 2007, while commodity prices increased manifold. Copper, for instance, went from selling at about US$1.00 per pound in late 2003 to approaching and even briefly surpassing $4.00 during April and July 2008. Oil went from trading at around 30 to 35 dollars per barrel in late 2003 to close to 150 dollars last July. Meanwhile, in the United States, the subprime mortgage crisis had already erupted in mid 2007, and by March 2008 an important financial institution, Bear Stearns, had collapsed. An important point of this preamble of the facts of September 2008 is that the string of events I just mentioned had no significant effect on economic expectations, nor did it change the mean of expected growth or increase uncertainty. This, despite the fact that the Bear Stearns bankruptcy was a very significant occurrence for the international financial market. Actually, the volatility of stock markets went up a rung in mid-2007, but was pretty mild if compared with September 2008 (Figure 4). This stock volatility index (VIX), which is normally used as a 4 BIS Review 76/2009 
good indicator of uncertainty,5 shows how it increased several times during the peak of the crisis in September and October of last year. The latest figures show uncertainty declining, although it remains high.  Thus, according to market consensus, world growth for 2008-2009 posted no significant changes between March and September of 2008 (Figure 5). The situation in Chile did not differ much (Figure 6). During the whole of 2007, growth projections for 2008 fluctuated around 5 percent, even after the eruption of the housing crisis in the United States. At the time of Bear Stearns’ bankruptcy there had been some adjustment in expected growth for the year, but in September there was even a slight correction upwards. The Bank’s forecasts were similar. The growth projections for 2009 are not so different; actually the larger part of the correction was done after December 2008. In sum, since September a significant correction has been applied to the expected value for growth. In addition to a smaller forecast for future earnings, there has been an increase in related uncertainty (Figure 7). In the United States, in early 2008, the width of the distribution of growth projections for 2009 was 2 percentage points. In early 2009, the same width increased to 2.3 percentage points and, by May, with at least the data for the first quarter of the year available, the width was of 3.3 percentage points. In Chile, GDP projections taken from the Economic Expectations Survey depict a similar picture, that is, the level of uncertainty among those forecasting growth has been increasing, despite the fact that, as the year passes and new data are added, the projections should not only be better but also have a smaller degree of uncertainty. What began happening in September 2008 that changed so dramatically the economic scenario around the world, Chile included? As I said before, the simple observation of traditional transmission channels of an external crisis cannot explain the events. On one hand, financial conditions tightened significantly worldwide. The domestic financial system also suffered, although without any episodes that might compromise its solvency. However, the possibility of reduced access to external funds, plus the increase in global risk, put pressure on internal financial conditions, causing a significant increase in interest rates and lending standards. At the same time, when future earnings became more uncertain, households and firms significantly reduced their demand for new credit, as revealed by the Banking Credit Survey that the Central Bank conducts on a quarterly basis. Overall, the tightening of financial conditions was not so severe as to hinder banks’ access to external credit or their proper functioning domestically. This was possible also because of a set of measures adopted by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance to ensure the proper functioning of the financial system. Nonetheless, due to the higher uncertainty, the sensation that the world economy might enter into a significant depression with huge losses of wealth triggered an unprecedented erosion of global confidence. Growth forecasts began adjusting at great speed. Undoubtedly this hit the behavior of households and firms hard around the world, which stopped their spending plans, or put them on hold indefinitely.  Consumers’ and entrepreneurs’ expectations indicators showed a profound weakening in the last quarter of 2008 (Figure 8). A look at durable goods consumption indicators reveals the steep fall in sales levels (Figure 9). All this takes me back to the previous point in my presentation. The dramatic increase in uncertainty that began in September of last year altered people’s behavior substantially, leading to an abrupt and sudden paralysis of the demand for durable goods.                                                  5  Bloom (2009) presents evidence where the use of this indicator helps to understand the US economic cycle, precisely because firms temporarily put their decisions on hold regarding investment and new hirings.  BIS Review 76/2009 5 
At the world level, the situation wasn’t so different. Expectations of both individuals and firms suffered a severe decline (Figure 10). Stock prices around the world dropped dramatically, reflecting the worsened expectations (Figure 11). The prices of commodities also fell because of the reduction in demand expected for the future. The exception was gold, commonly used as a store of value at times when perceived risks increase (Figure 12).  The drop in demand was particularly steep in the manufacturing sector. This explains the severity of the corrections to growth forecasts in countries that export manufactured products such as Japan and Germany and the recently industrialized Asian economies, among others. These countries are expected to experience an average fall in GDP of around 5 percent during this year. The main effect of the reduction in world demand on the Chilean economy has been the drop in the prices of our exports, and those of many other countries. This pulled down the terms of trade and debilitated the national income prospects. However, as I have said a number of times before, the impact of reduced demand is milder in countries that export natural resource related goods, like Chile. Hence the drop in exports in countries selling raw materials to the world has had a relatively small effect on their output. Their demand has dropped, and so have their prices, but they have not experienced the collapse associated with postponing expenditures on goods of industrial origin. Although selling is tougher, export volumes have adjusted less than the world average, which is expected to fall around 10 percent this year, while the baseline scenario of our latest Monetary Policy Report foresees that the volume of Chilean exports will drop around 2 percent annually in the same period. This has been one of the factors explaining the milder impact of the crisis in Latin America. This crisis has been particularly harsh on industrialized economies, which have seen a steeper fall in demand for their products due to the great fall in demand for durable and investment goods (Figure 13). Final remarks Expansionary macroeconomic and fiscal policies can help boost economic activity when facing a deep drop in demand. However, their effects on confidence are not obvious. Thus, it is essential for measures taken to be sustainable and credible. If they lack credibility, their expansionary effect will be constrained by lack of confidence. Furthermore, it is conceivable that in the presence of deep macroeconomic weakness expansionary policies might exacerbate the loss of confidence. This explains why many countries need to raise their interest rates and make fiscal adjustments in the midst of an economic crisis, because their economic policies and financial systems lack credibility. This is obviously not the case in Chile today. In our country, the extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus should be very effective, because these efforts are sustainable and credible. This is visible also, to different degrees, in other economies in the region that are committed to foreign exchange flexibility, price stability, fiscal responsibility and financial soundness. Developed economies will need to correctly address the medium-term effects of monetary expansions and increased public debt. If the origin of the global loss of confidence is the financial crisis, then stabilizing the banking industry and restoring the payment system is not only a priority but a necessary condition for economic recovery. Hence the importance that developed countries have placed on stabilizing the financial system, which is timidly beginning to bear fruit.  No simple or rapid prescription exists to rebuild the confidence that has been lost. Some think that conveying optimism is a good idea. However, if such optimism has no ground, only a lack of sense of reality will be communicated. On the other hand, sending a pessimistic message can erode confidence even further. If there is one thing we know, not only about economics but about every walk of life, it is that people cannot be fooled forever, so the only way to act is realistically. 6 BIS Review 76/2009 
We are enduring a world recession, and nobody disagrees about the current hardships the world economy faces, so the discussion has shifted to when we will see the first signs of recovery. The scenario of global economic and financial catastrophe has dissipated, and confidence seems to be recovering. One piece of evidence that the “free fall” of the world economy may have stopped is the evolution of growth projections for the year (Figure 14). After the sharp deterioration post-September 2008, the downward revision to the growth expected for this year has moderated in magnitude significantly in most of the economic zones. In Japan, which has suffered one of the most intense revisions in the past few months, the latest forecast revised upwards the expected growth for 2009. GDP growth for 2010, which had posted small but systematic falls since September, is showing stability in the latest forecasts. Combined with this, perceptions regarding investors’ appetite for risk seem to be picking up. Sovereign premiums have declined, capital flows to emerging economies are returning, interest rates on Treasury bonds are increasing in many economies and the various expectations indicators are signaling some degree of recovered confidence. Extreme pessimism is withdrawing, but we cannot expect an accelerated recovery. The confidence crisis is one piece – an important one – of the explanation of the synchrony and strength of the shock that occurred at the end of last year. However, the distortions that motivated this confidence crisis will have persistent effects, even after the confidence is fully recovered. The loss of confidence explains the sharp and sudden downfall of the global economy, as well as its propagation to the other countries. However, the origin of the crisis is not this loss of confidence, but rather can be traced back to years of financial excesses that will take time to resolve.6 The big and, in the light of what we know today, unreasonable private overborrowing in many developed countries will have to be corrected, leading to significant de-leveraging mostly of households. They will raise their saving rates which will hold back growth in consumption and demand. The countries that grew fast based on credit booms will have to adjust. We cannot expect the world economy to go back to pre-crisis growth rates. These are normal stages of the business cycle, but the magnitude of the imbalances that formed in those countries now experiencing financial crises indicate that their recovery will be slower. This is why when the downturn of the economic cycle combines with a financial crisis, its costs are magnified. This can be understood and even quantified by using consumption theories, but that we will save for a future opportunity. Thank you very much. References Blanchard, O.

Christian Noyer: Economic and financial crisis – the post-G20 outlook  Speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, at a luncheon organised by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong, 11 June 2009. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to speak to you today. At a time when the regulation of the financial and banking sectors is being discussed in-depth, this meeting is a unique opportunity for exchanging our ideas and thoughts on the most topical issues.  I would like to raise three questions that seem absolutely essential today, a couple of weeks after the G20 summit and the Spring meetings of the IMF. These three questions are the following: • What is the economic and financial outlook? • What type of financial regulatory framework are we moving towards? • How can we strengthen financial stability at the international level? What is the economic and financial outlook? After the recession that has been affecting the world economy since September 2008, the first signs of a recovery are being examined very closely. While in the first quarter output data confirmed a further decline at a similar or stronger pace than by end-2008, survey indicators point to deceleration of the slowdown in the second quarter, which justifies cautious optimism. Indeed, I see several reasons for hoping that “the worst is behind us”.  The strength, the scope and the synchronisation of the crisis were exceptional and the risks that continue to weigh on the world economy should not be underestimated. The first wave of the crisis consisted in the drying-up of liquidity on financial markets, a collapse in confidence and world trade. Although this first wave has not subsided, a second wave could hit the world economy. On the one hand, the feedback effects between the financial sector and the real economy would curb the availability of loans. On the other hand, the rise in unemployment, which lags the contraction in activity, may affect household consumption. However, the factors that lend support to a recovery are also significant. They stem not only from a natural rebalancing of the economy but also from an exceptional fiscal and monetary stimulus.  Firstly, disinflation, which has been more rapid than expected, boosts households’ purchasing power and should partly offset the deterioration in the labour market. [In the euro area, disinflation could result in a 3.5-point year-on-year increase in purchasing power in 2009; the rise in unemployment could reach two points.]  Secondly, the automatic stabilisers have a strong effect in the euro area, thanks to unemployment benefits and a broad tax base. They are, by construction, temporary, appropriate and targeted, which guarantees their countercyclical impact. Thirdly, large-scale stimulus packages have been adopted and shall be implemented in 2009 and 2010. In the euro area, they are equivalent to 1.7% of GDP and are expected, according to the IMF, to contribute to raising growth by 0.9 point in 2009 and 0.3 point in 2010.  Fourthly, governments’ very strong commitment to guaranteeing the solvency of banks should prevent risks of a credit crunch. In France, the two structures set up, the Société de financement de l’économie française (SFEF) and the Société de prises de participation de BIS Review 75/2009 1 
l’Etat (SPPE), give the government considerable room for manoeuvre to recapitalise the banking sector and ensure its financing, and thereby that of the economy.  Last, but not least, the 325-basis-point decline in the ECB’s refinancing rate since July 2008 is unprecedented, both in terms of size and speed. In an environment characterised by fixed rates, the effects of this decrease shall spread progressively, but rates on new loans are already falling, in line with the cuts in policy rates. In addition, the ECB has embarked on a quantitative easing policy aimed at banks, which, by contrast with the United States, provide 80% of the financing of the economy. Since October 2008, the ECB has been providing unlimited liquidity and has eased collateral rules for its refinancing operation. At its May meeting, the Governing council has decided to extend the maturity of its provision of liquidity up to one year and to purchase euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area. As a result, the 1-year interbank market has converged to the level of the US 1-year market rate.  What type of financial regulation framework are we moving towards? The current crisis has highlighted certain failures in financial regulation and this is why, beyond the immediate measures I have just described, an ambitious agenda to reform financial regulation has been launched. This overhaul is crucial for laying the foundations of a more stable financial system. It should not be implemented in a hasty manner if we want to avoid hurting the recovery from the crisis. The G20 has laid down clear principles to guide the overhaul of financial regulation. They mainly cover three areas: the strengthening of prudential standards, the redefinition of the scope of regulation and the revision of accounting standards. Before bringing up these three dimensions, I would like to point out that the G20 Action Plan imposes a requirement for all stakeholders concerned with financial stability: how to better assess the risks facing the financial system as a whole? On this point, you will agree with me that systemic risk is THE risk that we need to take better account of. We have not been able to identify it, control it, or capture it in prudential terms. In many respects, systemic risk is the result of liquidity risk, leverage, compounded by financial innovation and high transformation risks. These factors are not easy to measure at the level of individual banks. They are even less so at the level of the financial system as a whole. This is nevertheless the challenge we have to face today.  Let me come back to the G20 action plan. This plan first recognises the need to strengthen prudential regulation in three areas. Capital requirements need to be strengthened and made more counter-cyclical by introducing a system of capital buffers. The quality of capital should be enhanced and its definition harmonised. We also may need to add to the range of instruments currently available a simple mechanism to measure leverage in order to complement the information provided by the solvency ratio. Another lesson that the G20 has learned from the crisis is that the current scope of regulation and supervision is inappropriate as it is too narrow. The current framework is based on the implicit idea that banks alone – because they collect deposits – are the source of risks for the system as a whole. This used to be the case. Yet, it is no longer true at all. It is now evident that all systemically important institutions and markets need to be regulated. In concrete terms, the G20 is widening the scope of regulation to include rating agencies, hedge funds and derivatives markets. The general principle is to abandon a silo approach to regulation, which was structured around institutions' legal character (e.g. banks, insurance companies, etc.), and to move over to a type of regulation based on the roles performed by different players in the stability of the system (liquidity provision, deposit-taking, market making, etc). Lastly, the G20 has set out a road map to improve accounting standards. Agreement on this point is not as broad as on the previous ones. The members of the G20 have sometimes divergent views about the role of accounting rules. In particular, one of the controversial 2 BIS Review 75/2009 
points relates to mark-to-market and the scope of application of fair value accounting. Nonetheless, I observe that the G20, by asking that the accounting standard setters take greater account of financial stability constraints, implicitly acknowledges that the impact of accounting choices on the latter are not neutral. In any event, the countries agreed on three objectives: reducing the complexity of accounting standards, increasing the harmonisation of standards internationally and introducing a more forward-looking system of provisioning. The discussions at the G20 summit find a strong echo in Europe. In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that the Europeans are a driving force in the international projects I have just described. In regional terms, the report by the high level group chaired by Jacques de Larosière is a cornerstone for the new financial regulation and supervision that will emerge in Europe after the crisis. These recommendations appear highly relevant to me. They reconcile efficiency and pragmatism. Whether it concerns developing a European system of financial supervision or setting up a Systemic Risk Council under the auspices of the ECB and the ESCB, these ideas are truly conducive to greatly strengthening the surveillance of risks both at individual institution level and for the European financial system as a whole. The reforms that I have just described should make it possible for the incentives of financial system players to be compatible with the stability of this system. The crisis has highlighted two types if not of incompatibility, at least of divergence that need to be corrected. First, within the financial industry itself. Financial innovation and developments in the business models of financial intermediaries have weakened credit discipline in favour of a strict return-oriented discipline. Regulators are working on correcting the regulatory sources of these incentives, which are dangerous for financial stability. I am thinking notably of the work aimed at reducing regulatory arbitrage and at countering the short-termism encouraged by certain prudential and accounting provisions. Second, we need to reconverge the incentives of private- and public-sector players. Their divergence is a natural phenomenon in periods of economic and financial boom. In these periods, regulators and supervisors find it harder to limit risk-taking when the risks to financial stability are unclear and competition is fierce. Maximising profit and competition considerations stand in the way of prudence and the prevention of financial imbalances. Countering these forces requires in particular the implementation of an independent macro-prudential policy. This is one of the main thrusts of the reforms proposed by Jacques de Larosière. How can we strengthen financial stability at the international level? The overall reform agenda that I have just outlined would not be complete without a component concerning the strengthening of the international financial architecture. Let me conclude my speech on this point. This strengthening currently has two very visible faces: the IMF and the Financial Stability Board. The IMF has once again become one of the key actors in the new international architecture. It is tasked, together with the Financial Stability Board, with monitoring the implementation of the G20 agreements on financial regulation. It also has a central role to play in the multilateral surveillance of financial risks: since late April, it has been conducting early warning exercises on financial and macroeconomic risks jointly with the Financial Stability Board; it will also extend its analysis of the resilience of domestic financial sectors as part of the Financial System Assessment Programs (FSAP) to include all systemically important countries. Indeed, one of the notable outcomes of the G20 is that all the member countries undertook to accept this assessment by their peers, including, for the first time, the United States. This broadening of the Fund's role is being supported by a trebling of its resources, which will increase its lending capacity to USD 750 billion. In addition, the instruments at its disposal were reviewed, with notably the creation of a new credit line facility aimed at BIS Review 75/2009 3 
countries with a proven track record and designed to avoid the stigma that up to now has too often been associated with the IMF's interventions. The Financial Stability Board is the other face of the new international financial architecture. As you know, this is the new name of the former Financial Stability Forum. In fact, it's much more than a change of name. The Forum is becoming a fully-fledged international body. It is gaining in firepower thanks to a reinforced and permanent administrative structure. It is also gaining greatly in legitimacy thanks to the broadening of its membership to all G20 countries. Moreover, it is acquiring new powers through its position as the supervisor of international standard setters. Lastly, it is strengthening its key role in the supervision of financial stability through its full participation in the exercise to identify vulnerabilities being developed by the IMF. Let me stop here. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. 4 BIS Review 75/2009 
BIS Review 75/2009 1 Shyamala Gopinath: Addressing the regulatory perimeter issues – Indian experience Remarks by Ms Shyamala Gopinath, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Ninth Annual International Seminar on Policy Challenges for the Financial Sector, co-hosted by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, The IMF, and The World Bank on “Emerging from the Crisis – Building a Stronger International Financial System”, Washington DC, 3-5 June 2009. *      *      * The regulatory perimeter or boundary issue has been engaging the attention of policy makers internationally for quite some time but it was not a central issue associated with the current crisis. Paradoxically the origins as well the severity of impact of the crisis were concentrated in the most heavily regulated institutions. However, in my view, the real issue lay in not recognizing and addressing the dynamic inter-connectedness between entities across regulated, unregulated and lightly regulated domains perpetuated through high leverage. It was a systemic crisis and attributing it to any single component of the system would only be an incomplete assessment. Borrowing from the field of natural ecosystems, sustainability of a complex flow system depends on the optimal balance between efficiency and resilience of its network. While the financial system was considered to be very efficient, the inherent elements for ensuring resilience were obviously inadequate. At the heart of this self-feeding financial ecosystem were entities which had access to liquidity, the banks, which acted as the fulcrum around which the system moved. It is therefore not surprising that the system collapsed once this fulcrum became vulnerable. The peripheral entities, though, were as much an integral part of the system and need to be recognized as such. The basic premise that I will be elaborating upon in my remarks today is that as far as systemic stability is concerned, it is more important to focus on the interconnected linkages amongst all major entities within the system, whether regulated or unregulated. Extending regulatory boundary is a very valid issue to be examined for its own sake, to address the specific contextual concerns. But once having decided the perimeter, it is extremely important to have a framework for hardwiring the perimeter. This is important as regulation creates incentives for certain activities to move beyond the boundary. One of the issues with just focusing on extending the perimeter, apart from issues clearly enunciated in the literature, relates to heterogeneity of regulatory foci across various segments. The boundary itself varies for different regulatory clusters – the focus of a banking regulator would be entirely different from that of a securities regulator, from that of an insurance regulator etc. and all of which may be different from the focus required for regulation of markets. If the entire financial system is looked as a single ecosystem, then inspite of the inherent differences between the various market players, it should be possible to identify the macro drivers of the whole system, the network flows. Using this perspective, it becomes evident that just focusing only on the perimeter would be missing an integral component that may need regulatory attention. Current crisis – perimeter issues As mentioned earlier, the origins of the current crisis lay within the heavily regulated institutions. The impact of the crisis, however, was exacerbated by dynamic interconnectedness between entities across regulated, unregulated and lightly regulated 
2 BIS Review 75/2009 sectors. As some of the recent reports have pointed out, the two concerns relating to “outside perimeter” entities that contributed to the current crisis were: (i) maturity transformation being undertaken by these entities, which traditionally used to be a function of banks; and (ii) the systemic leverage resulting out of the hugely leveraged positions of these entities, either through direct borrowing from banks or through the funding markets. The central issue in both the above is the interaction between the unregulated entities and the formal regulated funding channels, essentially banks and money markets. The maturity transformation primarily entailed heavy reliance by these entities on short term funds for funding long term assets. The prudential framework for banks placed a significant reliance on management of these ALM mismatches but the unregulated entities, such as SIVs didn’t have any oversight and as a business model, ran huge ALM mismatches. The model just broke down when the funding markets started seizing. Many of the entities, like hedge funds, were consciously left unregulated because of the fact that they managed only private capital pools where the issue of investor protection was not relevant. However, what was not appreciated was the systemic risks these entities were posing on account of the huge leverage positions these were carrying through either the formal banking channel or the funding markets, particularly repo markets. The seamless efficiency thought to be provided by close integration of the underlying asset markets and repo markets proved to be just a chimera. The disaggregated exposures of the regulated clusters at any point of time to the unregulated entities were not available and as the markets collapsed, such exposures became evident. Another critical aspect which was again brought forth during this crisis was the market behaviour and impact of entities, some of them unregulated, having huge trading books and dynamically hedging their huge portfolios. The market makers in the derivative and structured product markets need to normally hedge their portfolio risks, which has a direct impact on the underlying markets. In normal times, such individual action does not have a systemic impact. However, in times of crisis when the views become absolutely uni-dimensional, a large number of such big players tend to hit the market on the same side and the resultant impact on the underlying market is huge. It could, thus, be argued that the efficient markets enabled the unregulated cluster to acquire systemic proportions and reinforced its connectedness with the regulated cluster. The Indian experience India is unique in this regard as it has a formalized structure for generic non bank finance sector with heterogeneous sub-segments. There some 13000 non banking finance companies (NBFCs) whose assets comprise around one-tenth of the banking sector. The NBFCs in India comprises heterogenous types of financial institutions including All-India financial institutions, development finance institutions, non banking finance companies, etc, with each one of them having its roots at a particular stage of development of the financial sector. All-India financial institutions (AIFIs), and development finance institutions (DFIs), which were largely an offshoot of development planning in India, were created for long-term financing with some of them having sectoral/regional focus. Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), on the other hand, are mostly private sector institutions, which have carved their niche in the Indian financial system. The basic regulatory framework The Indian financial system is a predominantly bank intermediated system and accordingly regulation over banks has worked as the basic systemic lever. The non-banking space comprises of heterogeneous entities but not all are regulated by the RBI. Broadly speaking, the RBI regulates all such companies taking public deposits and those non-deposit taking entities involved in asset financing, providing loans and investments. Other non-banking 
BIS Review 75/2009 3 entities such as housing finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, stock broking companies, merchant banking companies, venture capital funds etc. are regulated by the respective sectoral regulator and are exempted from the NBFC regulations. Regulation of Non-Banking Finance Companies in India was considered necessary as far back as the sixties as an adjunct to the monetary and credit policy of the country and protection of depositors' interest. The emphasis of regulation was on protection of the interest of depositors and as such directions issued by RBI dealt with acceptance of deposits and matters relating thereto. The unfettered growth of deposits and institutions accepting them outside banking system in the nineties was a matter of concern. Further in the absence of any prudential norms or ceilings, several non-bank finance companies made poor investment choices, leading to high level of NPAs, liquidity crunch and consequent significant default in repayment of deposits. Therefore, some further regulatory action was taken including registration of these companies, for which the statutory powers were given to the RBI through the RBI (Amendment) Act in January 1997. The Act provided for registration of all NBFCs; nevertheless the RBI focused mainly on depositor protection and put in place stringent regulatory requirements for these entities. With the growth of the financial system, it gradually came to be realized that even non-deposit taking entities, which were mostly in asset financing and loan business, could pose systemic risks on account of their interactions with the formal banking system and market based financing. Moreover, many such entities in this lightly regulated segment were essentially indulging in regulatory arbitrage – what was not permitted for banks was happening through this channel. It was therefore decided in 2006 to put in place an elaborate prudential framework for such identified entities having systemic implications. A gradually calibrated regulatory framework was created to address the issue of systemic risk, which included prudential capital requirements, exposure norms, liquidity management, asset liability management, creation of entity profile and reporting requirements, corporate governance and disclosure norms for non banking finance companies defined as systemically important. It was recognized early on that mere acceptance of public deposits would not capture the systemic importance of the entities and hence the focus was shifted to acceptance of public funds in any form. So, any entity that is accessing public funds, whether through deposits, inter corporate deposits, debt instruments such as NCDs or CPs, or bank loans, was considered interconnected entity and hence treated as a source of potential risk. The ultimate objective was that such interconnectedness should not result in transmission of risk to banks or the payment and settlement system. In the Indian context, what has provided a huge systemic advantage is the fact that the regulation of key financial markets – money market, Government securities market, forex market and credit market – vests with the banking regulator i.e. the RBI. Thus the channels of interconnectedness between banks and other financial sector entities are not beyond the regulatory purview. From a financial stability perspective, the above framework has proved to be a sound model. Some of the specific provisions which illustrate the effectiveness of the above framework in addressing the inter-connected linkages are briefly mentioned below: • Prudential limits on bank exposures (funded and non-funded) to non-bank finance companies – individual as well as aggregate;  • Restrictions on bank financing to non-bank finance companies against collateral of shares or for on-lending to capital market intermediaries;  • Prudential limits on bank exposures to equity markets includes exposure to capital market intermediaries such as brokers;  • Prudential regulations on inter-bank exposures of banks to reduce systemic risk;  
4 BIS Review 75/2009 • Participation in the overnight unsecured money market limited to banks and primary dealers;  • Lending/borrowing by non-banks in the overnight market allowed only through repos or against collateral of government bonds;  • Securitisation guidelines issued to banks in 2006 which provided for, inter alia, credit enhancements to be deducted from capital, profit/premium from sale to be amortised over the life of the securities issued, liquidity support to attract 100 per cent risk weight.  Addressing the inter-connectedness – few pipeline issues The securities firms/investment banks are regulated by the securities regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) but such regulation primarily focuses on transparency and discipline in market practices. As these entities are normally not doing fund based business which would require prudential regulation, a decision had been taken that entities registered with SEBI need not normally be registered with RBI. While these entities form part of a separate regulatory cluster, their inter-linkages with the other regulated clusters or other unregulated entities may need to be examined particularly if such entities also undertake fund based business. Therefore a constant evaluation is required of the functioning of institutions under different regulators to address regulatory gaps. While mutual funds are regulated from investor protection angle by the securities regulator, the systemic implications of the inert-linkages became apparent in the post-Lehman scenario of severe risk aversion and liquidity crunch. RBI had to announce a special 14 day repo at for a notified amount of Rs.20,000 crore to enable banks to meet the liquidity requirements of Mutual Funds. The real issue was the over reliance of the money market mutual funds on short term funds placed by the large corporates and banks with redemption facilities on par with current accounts of banks. It has now been decided to jointly work with the securities regulator to identify and address the macro-prudential concerns arising from the current framework. Private Equity/venture capital activity is not a regulated activity per se. However, the issue of bank involvement with such funds has come into focus recently in India. The G30 recommends the large systemically important banking institutions should be restricted in undertaking proprietary activities that present high risks and serious conflicts of interest. Sponsorship and management of co-mingled private pools of capital should ordinarily be prohibited and large proprietary trading should be limited by strict capital and liquidity requirements. Keeping in view the reputational risk involved in such activities, the Reserve Bank had mandated maintenance of certain level of economic capital in some of the cases approved in the recent past. Importantly, all exposures of a bank to a venture capital fund are treated as capital market exposure and counted for the regulatory limit. A revised regulatory framework – key considerations The broad features of a possible framework to capture the above inter-linkages are outlined below.  (i) Specification of the nature of connectedness between entities that may be considered inducing vulnerabilities in the system; (ii) Identification, from the haze of the unregulated cluster, the class of entities considered to be either having significant direct connectedness with the regulated clusters or having a significant presence in any market segment where regulated entities are also present; 
BIS Review 75/2009 5 (iii) Putting in place a reporting system to capture the interconnected flows within the identified sub-system – the regulated clusters and the unregulated entities on a regular basis; (iv) Prescription of a prudential framework – and this is the key – for the regulated clusters to contain the risks arising from this connectedness. (v) For the unregulated entities, the most significant aspect would be to contain their leveraging capability in general across major market segments, particularly the funding markets. A simple quantitative limit would be the best suited. (vi) Some systemically significant entities, though, may still need a formal prudential regulatory structure, including capital adequacy requirement. From a policy perspective, the critical points would be the last two – having effective regulation over the regulated entities, while restraining leverage capabilities of the unregulated/lightly regulated entities. In our case, it proved to be an effective combination since banks’ exposure to such entities could be regulated through absolute exposure norms or even tweaking the risk weights applicable to such exposures. I realize the problem would be much more involved in predominantly market based financial systems where direct bank linkages are not very obvious. But even in such regimes, as has been clearly demonstrated, the indirect linkages of banks were enmeshed in the maze. That is why it would be important to ensure that the markets too should not provide leverage capabilities to such entities beyond a limit. Contingency liquidity provision The recent crisis has again brought to the fore the role of a lender of last resort (LOLR), the extent of central bank intervention and the entities to which such intervention can be extended. The question as to under what circumstances and to what extent should safety nets be extended to non-deposit taking institutions has been widely debated.  The basic underpinning of the LOLR philosophy internationally has been that any institution whose failure is conclusively decided to cause broader systemic instability needs to be supported in the interregnum. As long as banks were the only institutions fulfilling this criterion, the case was straightforward. However, with the development of global financial markets and growth on non-banks as alternate media of financial intermediation, the decisions were not so simple as the recent experience has clearly shown.  In India, while there is no provision for the Reserve Bank of India to lend directly to any non-bank entities, except a few specified ones, there have been specific instances of workable arrangements being devised in the interest of broader stability to provide liquidity support to some institutions/sectors indirectly. In respect of non-banking finance companies, in the post-Lehman fallout there was severe systemic liquidity crunch and even the non-banking finance sector were stressed. It was apprehended that in a scenario of asymmetrical information and general risk aversion of banks, the strains in non-banking finance sector could eventually pose a systemic risk. It was then decided to provide liquidity to those systemically important NBFCs facing temporary liquidity mismatches through an SPV. The key part was that the liquidity was provided to the SPV by the RBI through purchase of fully government guaranteed bonds. Further, this facility was only meant to tide over temporary liquidity mismatches and not for balance sheet expansion. The aggregate quantum for the facility was around Rs. 200 billion (USD 4 billion) and the interest rate was the LOLR rate for banks. Similarly in case of mutual funds, who were faced with severe redemption pressures, it was decided to have a facility for lending to banks through a 14-day repo to enable the banks to meet the temporary liquidity needs of mutual funds.  
6 BIS Review 75/2009 As regards protection of depositor interests, a comprehensive prudential framework is already in place for all deposit taking companies. Stringent capital adequacy and leverage requirements, exposure norms, and disclosure have been prescribed as part of a structured regulatory framework. Statutorily, such companies are required to invest at least 10 per cent of their outstanding deposits in unencumbered Government bonds. Further, NBFCs have to ensure that at all times there is full cover for public deposits maintained by them. All such companies accepting/ holding public deposits are required to create a floating charge on their statutory liquid assets in favour of their depositors through the mechanism of “Trust Deed”. Conclusion The issue of extending the regulatory perimeter has to be a balancing act and it needs to be carefully nuanced in terms of intended objectives. The thrust of regulation may need to be borne by the regulated clusters – particularly deposit taking institutions. However, for the unregulated cluster, the key issues would be to contain their ability for systemic leverage – both directly through banks or indirectly through funding markets and to subject them to an effective reporting arrangement for their inter-linkages with the regulated clusters. From a systemic stability perspective, it would be equally, if not more, important to focus on the interconnectedness of the regulated and unregulated/lightly regulated entities. 
Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell: Monetary policy challenges in light of the current financial market developments Speech by Ms Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at Alpbach Talks, Vienna, 15 June 2009. *      *      * Introduction Ten years ago, on 1 January 1999, the euro was introduced as the common currency of 11 Member States of the European Union. Today, the euro is used by around 330 million citizens in 16 countries and it has established itself as a stable currency, accepted in financial markets worldwide. Looking at the inflation performance over the first decade of Monetary Union with inflation averaging slightly more than 2% during this period, the ECB has fulfilled its mandate under the Maastricht Treaty, which is to maintain price stability for the euro area as a whole. Nonetheless, undoubtfully, we are currently facing the biggest challenge so far: The world is hit by a severe economic and financial downturn, the deepest since the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929. It poses grave challenges to the financial industry and central bank community, as well as to supervisory and regulatory authorities and national governments and to the citizens at large. The key challenges arising from the current financial market turbulence Since August 2007 the global financial markets have experienced extensive corrective realignments. The repercussions of the turbulence were initially visible in the financial market in the form of dramatic increases in risk premia and increased volatility in interest rate movements.  The outbreak of the financial market turbulence was not entirely unexpected, however. Both the ECB and other institutions had warned of macroeconomic imbalances and systematic undervaluation of risks in the years leading up to the crisis. Those years were characterised by an extended period of low interest rates, low inflation and sustained economic growth, both globally and within the euro area. At the same time, liquidity was abundant and default risks were considered by many to be very low. This environment strengthened investors’ risk appetite. In particular, with financial market participants expecting this environment to continue for quite some time, risks were systematically underestimated and the search for ever higher yields intensified. As a result, commercial banks readily granted credit for house purchases to households that otherwise could not have afforded it, and without adequately assessing their creditworthiness or credit default risk. At the same time, in an attempt to achieve higher yields, a number of innovative and increasingly complex financial products were offered, particularly in the United States. One prominent example of this was the bundling of mortgages in new and highly complex financial products and their resale as new securities to third parties via global financial markets.  It eventually became evident that this practice was viable only as long as house prices in the United States continued to increase. When the many years of increases in house prices came to an end and house prices started to fall, problems soon emerged, including in the euro area, as banks here were among the buyers of these securities. Investors suddenly began to doubt the quality of their assets. This led to a sharp correction in prices on the financial markets, accompanied by a withdrawal of funds from the markets, leading to corresponding liquidity shortages for banks, particularly in the money market. BIS Review 75/2009 1 
Response to the crisis From the very beginning of the crisis, the ECB has acted in a decisive manner. It has taken a number of measures unprecedented in nature, scope and timing. The ECB has provided large amounts of liquidity support to banks. By making changes to its operational framework, the ECB made sure that all solvent banks would have sufficient access to funding. When the crisis intensified in September last year, we introduced a number of new measures. Most importantly, we provided banks with unlimited access to liquidity at fixed rates for up to six months. The ECB also expanded its list of assets eligible for use as collateral in the Eurosystem’s credit operations. Moreover, we recently announced further measures, namely to provide longer term refinancing up to one year and to purchase covered bonds of up to EUR 60 bn. As a result of these new measures, the size of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet has expanded by a substantial EUR 600 billion and now stands at 16% of GDP, compared with 10% in mid-2007. The measures taken by the ECB have eased banks’ balance sheet constraints and thereby certainly helped to avoid a sudden collapse in the supply of credit and the emergence of a systemic crisis.  Moreover, in line with the substantial weakening of global demand and economic activity, inflationary pressures and risks have been diminishing. As a result, the ECB’s policy rates have been cut by 3.25 percentage points since the intensification of the crisis last October. These rate reductions, together with the liquidity management measures, have had a significant impact on money market interest rates. Since last October overnight money market rates have fallen even more steeply than the ECB’s policy rates. Money market rates in the euro area have now reached very low levels by international standards. Lower money market rates have also led to lower interest rates for private households and firms, although the decline in money market rates has so far been greater than the decline in interest rates on credit for households and firms.  The fiscal authorities in the euro area have also demonstrated their capacity to react rapidly to exceptional circumstances. In a coordinated effort, the national governments of the euro area have provided support to the banking system, most notably through recapitalisation and guarantees for liabilities and assets. The funds provided under the package announced to stabilise the financial sector through these types of measure amount to 23% of the euro area’s GDP. The overall fiscal stimulus – through discretionary policy measures and the effect of automatic stabilisers – amounts to 3.6 percentage points of GDP for 2009 and 2010.  Overall, during the ongoing financial market turbulence, the euro area and the EU as a whole have proved their capacity to act decisively and promptly under difficult circumstances.  Lessons from the crisis  The current financial crisis has pointed to a number of weaknesses that need to be addressed if we are to avoid a similar crisis in the future. Some weaknesses are rooted in the current design of the international financial system. This is particularly true with regard to the lack of transparency and accountability within the financial system. In this respect, much relies on financial players themselves taking responsibility for evaluating risk more effectively and increasing transparency as regards risk. In addition, various initiatives at national, European and international level aim, in particular, to improve the robustness of the financial system I would like to highlight three areas where I think change is necessary: there needs to be an increase in transparency, a dampening of pro-cyclicality and an improvement in institutional design in the field of financial supervision and regulation.  First, we need to undergo global regulatory and supervisory repair. The Basel Committee has already set some milestones in this regard including the publication of the principles for sound liquidity risk management and supervision and its current work on strengthening the 2 BIS Review 75/2009 
Basel II capital framework. Work is also underway concerning the development of measures to mitigate pro-cyclicality stemming from the regulatory frameworks, namely by building buffers in good times that can be withdrawn in less benign conditions. In this context, let me recall that the G20 Leaders approved the recommendations by the FSB to address procyclicality, which are to be implemented by the end of this year. To this aim, the Basel Committee is developing proposals for countercyclical buffers and ways to promote provisioning over the cycle, with the aim to come up with concrete proposals by year-end.  Second, regulatory gaps need to be closed. In that respect, the G20 Leaders endorsed last April the extension of the regulatory net to all systemically important institutions, markets and instruments. These include systemically important hedge funds, credit rating agencies and Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives markets. With the aim of preventing regulatory arbitrage, the IMF together with the FSB, have been requested to develop, by autumn, guidelines to assess systemic importance.  And third, macro-prudential supervision has to be strengthened. This includes in particular the global monitoring of systemic stability and the supervision of systemically important cross-border institutions, while properly addressing interlinkages among themselves, with other financial and non-financial institutions and markets. In this context, I fully support the broadened mandate and stronger institutional basis given to the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The G20 Leaders called on the re-established FSB to develop macro-prudential tools, together with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), to identify and take account of macro-prudential risks across the financial system and limit the build up of systemic risk for regulated entities. Moreover, the envisaged cooperation between the IMF and the FSB for the conduct of Early Warning Exercises will be crucial for the success of the global monitoring of systemic risks.  At the European level, the proposal of the De Larosière group to establish a European Systemic Risk Council should substantially improve the assessment of risks to financial stability at the EU level. In order for the new Council to perform its tasks in an optimal manner – in my view – three requirements must be fulfilled. First, the ECB must have timely access to the relevant information, including information concerning individual institutions. Second, risk warnings from the new Council should be translated into effective policy action. And third, for the new Council to be independent and effective in its decision-making, it is essential that it have a solid institutional and legal basis.  I also think the current crisis holds some lessons for monetary policy. The crisis has shown us that a stable financial system is a prerequisite for price stability. Monetary policy-makers should try to mitigate the risk of the build-up of financial bubbles by being aware of the effects their policy decisions can have on the financial system. Therefore, one could argue that asset prices should play a greater role in monetary policy considerations. As the build-up of an asset price bubble might have severe economic consequences in the longer term, central banks should try to deal with the bubble pre-emptively.  Nonetheless, the interrelation of financial stability goes beyond the pure consideration of asset prices. Analysing developments in borrowing and lending, particularly loans to the private sector, is helpful in extracting the relevant signals from monetary developments on potential financial imbalances. Consideration of these aspects must become more extensive and systematic in the future.  Strengthening the ECB’s role in financial supervision should contribute to ensuring that proper consideration is given to the possible build-up of financial imbalances when making monetary policy decisions. The current crisis has clearly demonstrated that risks to financial stability are accompanied by risks to price stability. Central banks must give even greater consideration to these risks in their analyses. BIS Review 75/2009 3 
The benefits of the euro in the current crisis As mentioned, the current crisis represents the greatest challenge for the euro so far. 2009 will be a very difficult year. According to the most recent macroeconomic projections by ECB staff, published in June of this year, the euro area economy is expected to contract by between 4.1% and 5.1% in 2009. This means, among other things, fewer jobs, higher unemployment, less investment and less exports.  That said, we should not forget how Europe would look today without the euro. In addition to the financial market turbulence, the problems in the financial sector and the economic downturn, we would be facing potentially large fluctuations between Europe’s national currencies. In fact, the currencies of some of the countries outside the euro area have experienced considerable fluctuations during the current crisis. This is an additional source of uncertainty for these countries. Therefore, the turmoil has confirmed one clear advantage of the euro, namely that, in stormy seas, it is better to be aboard a large ship than a small boat.  This seems to be also reflected in the fact that many central and eastern European countries have expressed the wish to join the euro area as quickly as possible. This is no surprise, given that many countries have already made progress towards adopting the euro. Nevertheless, all countries must first fulfil all of the relevant criteria before joining the euro area. Still, I would like to emphasise that the euro area is not a closed shop. Five new countries have joined since the start of Monetary Union in January 1999, with Slovakia becoming the newest member of the euro area in January of this year. The door is open to all those that meet the clearly stated and predefined criteria for membership of the Economic and Monetary Union. Conclusion Joseph Schumpeter coined the expression of the creative destruction to bring about entrepreneurial innovation and progress. Schumpeter certainly did not have in mind an economic and financial crisis of the severity and extent we are experiencing today. But having the concept of Schumpeter in mind, the current crisis also created a window of opportunity for change and reform. This window, however, will not remain open forever. Therefore, we have to act now in bringing forward the necessary reforms in the international financial system to strengthen the supervisory architecture. The ECB stands ready to take up its part on macroprudential supervision.  4 BIS Review 75/2009 
Jean-Claude Trichet: The financial crisis and the response of the ECB Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the Ceremony conferring the honorary title of Doctor Honoris Causa at the University of National and World Economy, Sofia, 12 June 2009. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen,  It is a great privilege for me to be here in Sofia today to accept an honorary doctorate from the distinguished University of National and World Economy (UNWE), Bulgaria’s most respected economics institute. To properly mark the occasion, I would like to talk about the global financial crisis and its roots, and the ECB’s response to the crisis.  The global financial crisis and its roots Let me start by briefly highlighting the origins and evolution of the current crisis. Imagine a neutral observer who looked at the financial sector about a decade ago and then didn’t look at it again until the eve of the current financial crisis. He would have found a completely different financial industry, one which over the past decade has undergone a dramatic shift of focus. He would have discovered a financial system that had moved away from its traditional role of supporting trade and real investment. He would have found a financial system in which speculation and financial gambling had run rife. He would have encountered a system transformed – a system no longer managing genuine economic risks but one actually creating and assuming financial risks – risks resulting from arbitrage and intentional exposure to asset price changes.  That same observer would have realised that financial liberalisation and innovation had made our economies more productive. The securitisation of assets, for example, had great potential to diversify economic risks and to manage them efficiently. But it also meant that financial institutions were able to sell loans or take them off the balance sheet, which weakened lenders’ incentives to conduct prudent screening and constant monitoring of credit risk. So underwriting standards and lending oversight declined, and contributed to the excessive credit growth in the second half of the 1990s.  In sum, the observer would have concluded that the factors that fuelled the credit and asset price boom of the past decade also created the conditions for a bust. In mid-2007 we started to see the backlash. The start of the financial turmoil was sudden but not unexpected. The financial system as it worked over the past decade – with its flawed incentives and its overly complex products and with global imbalances as its macroeconomic backdrop – was no longer sustainable. The asset cycle turned, the weaknesses were exposed and investors suddenly lost confidence. After years of exceptional risk appetite and high profits, the pendulum swung in the opposite direction, as markets became extremely sensitive to financial risk.  In September last year, the crisis escalated sharply, turning a large-scale crisis of confidence into a global financial panic. Financial intermediaries restored liquidity buffers, tried to economise on capital and to scale down their balance sheets. They sold assets and tightened lending conditions. Banks and other financial institutions drastically reduced their exposure to the risks that they had imprudently accumulated during the phase of financial euphoria. Financial intermediation and loans to companies were curtailed in the wake of a forceful process of “deleveraging”. BIS Review 74/2009 1 
This was the point when important spillovers of the financial crisis set in. We saw the almost immediate spillover from the financial sector to the real economy. The credit squeeze and loss of confidence started to take a toll on the real economy, and a negative feedback developed between the financial sector and the real economy, and has since become a major feature of economic and financial developments. Almost simultaneously, the crisis that originated in the advanced economies spilled over to the emerging market economies. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, virtually all economies – both those of the industrialised countries and the emerging markets – have faced synchronised business cycles in many parts of the world.  The ECB’s response to the financial crisis  Since the start of the financial turmoil, central banks around the globe face unprecedented challenges. We at the ECB and other central banks have reacted swiftly, flexibly and decisively. The ECB took the lead with some exceptional decisions as early as 9 August 2007. We have, since then, modified our operational framework and used an exceptional set of non-standard policy tools. These tools, combined with the bold action taken by euro area governments over recent months, have played an essential role in preventing a collapse of the financial system and in bolstering confidence. I would like to emphasise that despite this upheaval and our exceptional measures, our objective remains unchanged: to preserve price stability over the medium term, and that’s what guides our policy. In so doing, we support the conditions for financial and economic stability. The crisis has not changed this objective.  Interest rates As regards interest rates, the ECB’s Governing Council has reacted promptly and decisively to the intensification and broadening of the global financial turbulence. We have lowered our key interest rate by 325 basis points since October 2008. This is the largest cut ever decided over such a short period in Europe. These moves were fully in line with our strategy. The upside risks to price stability have indeed receded considerably over that period due to the sharp fall in oil and other commodity prices, and the abrupt slowdown in economic activity. As price stability is the needle in our compass, we took account of the easing of inflationary pressures and lowered interest rates.  In this context, I would like to underline that since the introduction of the euro in 1999, the ECB’s quantitative definition of price stability – an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2% in the euro area, over the medium term – has proved to be an invaluable asset. It has guarded against undesirably high inflation and against deflation. Long-term inflation expectations in the euro area, whether based on surveys or extracted from financial indicators, have been and continue to be firmly anchored at levels consistent with our definition of price stability. Inflation expectations have been exceptionally resistant to sudden upward short-term price changes, and we have ensured that is also the case with sharply falling inflation. Non-standard measures In addition to reducing interest rates, we have taken exceptional policy actions in response to the crisis – “non-standard” measures related to liquidity management. At the very start of the money market stress in August 2007, the ECB reacted within a few hours and temporarily provided additional liquidity to banks with immediate liquidity needs. We were in fact the first central bank to take non-standard measures. When in mid-September 2008 the crisis intensified and interbank trading came to a virtual halt, the ECB engaged in a new mode of liquidity provision. We started to provide refinancing 2 BIS Review 74/2009 
well above the levels that banks had absorbed to fulfil their reserve requirements in normal times. Our approach comprises three main “building blocks”. • We significantly adapted our regular refinancing operations. We now follow a “fixed rate full allotment” tender procedure and have significantly expanded the maturity of our operations. Banks have been granted access to essentially unlimited liquidity at our policy interest rate at maturities of, initially, up to six months. This is an exceptional mode of operation. In normal times we auction a given amount of central bank credit and let competition between the bidders determine the interest rate. This unusual mode of operation implies that we currently act as a surrogate for the market in terms of both liquidity allocation and price-setting. • Our second building block is the long list of assets that we take as collateral. This list was already very long before the crisis, but we have extended it even further and now accept an even wider range of securities as collateral.  • The first two building blocks offer unlimited refinancing against a very wide range of collateral. But they can only reach the financial system if they are coupled with the third building block, namely the very large number of counterparties that have always been able to take part in our refinancing operations. Even before the financial crisis, this number was higher than for the other major central banks. Following the changes to our operational framework in October last year, this number rose further. All these non-standard measures were supplemented by further exceptional steps that the ECB’s Governing Council decided in early May and June this year.  • We now conduct liquidity-providing longer-term refinancing operations with a maturity of 12 months. This will further lengthen the maturity at which we provide banks with liquidity at fixed rates and full allotment. This move is consistent with the operations we have undertaken since October 2008 and it recognises the central role played by the banking system in the euro area economy.  • The European Investment Bank (EIB) is becoming an eligible counterparty in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations. Access to the Eurosystem’s liquidity is a natural complement to the EIB’s financing initiatives and it will facilitate the accommodation by the EIB of additional demand for its lending programme.  • Furthermore, the Eurosystem will purchase euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area of about €60 billion. These purchases will target an important segment of the private securities market, which has been particularly affected by the financial market turbulence. We have outlined the specific modalities of implementation last week. Our primary concern when taking these decisions in recent months was to maintain the availability of credit for households and companies at accessible rates. I have described that as “enhanced credit support”. Furthermore, our very flexible liquidity management ensured that solvent banks did not get into difficulties because of liquidity constraints.  Our response to the crisis has been carefully calibrated to the financial and economic structures of the euro area. In particular, we needed to bear in mind that the euro area’s financial system is predominantly bank-based. Take the structures of private credit outstanding as an example: recourse to banks makes up more than 70% of non-equity external finance in the euro area. By comparison, in the US the equivalent proportion is only around 30%. This reflects the fact that the US financial system is primarily market-based. In the euro area, guaranteeing steady access to credit for households and companies largely means preserving the viability of the banking system. Banks play such a dominant role in our economy that it was appropriate to focus our non-standard measures on the banking sector. BIS Review 74/2009 3 
Conclusion  To conclude, I would like to call your attention to the following points. To start with, we are, for the first time, putting to the test the soundness and resilience of the globalised economy, which has become increasingly integrated over the past fifteen years. We now have to draw, systematically and without complacency, the lessons of the global crisis that we are fighting against.  Secondly, we have a duty. Our duty is to considerably reinforce the resilience of the global financial system and the soundness of the real global economy. We should not allow that, a few years from now, a new crisis would emerge that would be similar to the current one. That would be unforgivable. Thirdly, the international community has engaged in drawing all lessons from the crisis. We agree on the method, on the role of the G20, on the role of the Financial Stability Board, and on the role of international financial institutions, in particular the crucial role of the International Monetary Fund, and also of the Bank for International Settlements, which during the past years has shown remarkable lucidity in its analysis. As regards the global financial sector, we agree on the broad orientations to follow: to reduce procyclicality, to fight short-termism, and to impose transparency. Fourthly, we are still today in a very difficult and very unpredictable environment. We permanently need to remain alert, and there is no place for complacency. I would have two main messages in that regard. As concerns direct government support to the financial sector, today’s priority is “rapidity of execution.” Decisions that have already been taken should be implemented swiftly. This holds true, in particular, for recapitalisation, as currently only about 55% of funds earmarked for recapitalisation have been used in the euro area. In crisis times, rapid implementation is crucial. As concerns global governance, I insist on the absolute necessity to reinforce macroeconomic policy surveillance of systematically important countries and economies. The IMF has to play a fundamental role in such monitoring, coupled with responsible and active peer surveillance. Finally, central banks have a fundamental role in ensuring monetary and financial stability from a long-term perspective. The world economy can count on central banks to continue to act as anchors of stability, which are more needed than ever. The European Central Bank, for its part, will continue to be an anchor of stability and confidence.  Thank you for your attention. 4 BIS Review 74/2009 
Daniel K Tarullo: Large banks and small banks in an era of systemic risk regulation Speech by Mr Daniel K Tarullo, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the North Carolina Bankers Association Annual Convention, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 15 June 2009. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * The financial crisis and its aftermath have revealed fundamental problems in both risk management by financial institutions and supervision by government regulators. These shortcomings arose in no small part from a failure by both the private and public sectors to adjust to far-reaching changes in financial markets over recent decades. There is a growing, though certainly not unanimous, view that supervision and regulation must be substantially more oriented toward containing systemic risk and addressing the associated problems posed by institutions considered too-big-to-fail. The public policy agenda will thus rightly be dominated for some time by proposals for legislative and administrative measures directed at systemic risk. In a moment I will offer some of my own views on the subject. Even as we move into this era of systemic risk regulation, however, it is important to recognize that changes in the financial services industry have affected every bank in America, large and small. While smaller banks will not likely see the extensive supervisory changes that have been proposed for the largest financial institutions, they too must adapt their risk-management practices to new competitive and economic conditions. Only by doing so will they continue to play their distinctive role in providing credit to individuals and small businesses.  The changes in the financial services industry that preceded the crisis, the crisis itself, and the regulatory changes that will follow together carry important consequences for all banks. It seemed to me particularly appropriate to address the implications of these changes here in North Carolina, home to institutions that range from the very large to the very small.1Large banks If we have learned anything from the present crisis, it is that systemic risk was very much built into our financial system. This situation was the outcome of a decades-long trend, during which traditional bank lending, trading, and other capital markets activities were increasingly integrated. The most visible manifestations of this trend were the explosive growth of securitization and the increasing involvement of banks and their affiliates in all parts of the securitization process. And, as we learned during the course of the crisis, the universe of institutions whose potential failure was regarded as having systemic consequences extended well beyond banks, or even bank holding companies, to include financial firms not subject to mandatory prudential regulation.  More generally, the emergence of the so-called shadow banking system changed important features of the traditional banking model, particularly at the largest institutions. These banks became increasingly dependent on the wholesale funding provided by securitization, commercial paper issuance, and other sources – funding that was often poorly matched to the maturity of the firm's assets.                                                   1  The views presented here are my own and not necessarily those of other members of the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.

The result was the rising vulnerability of these institutions to non-traditional sources of risk. The new market-based liquidity problems arose from sudden, sharp movements in asset prices that led to enormous market uncertainty concerning the values of those assets. As now liquidity-strained institutions made increasingly distressed asset sales, they placed further downward pressure on asset prices, leading to margin calls for leveraged actors and mark-to-market losses for all holders of the assets. Since multiple firms were relying on similar marketable assets as a ready source of liquidity, extreme price declines could ensue, engendering a negative feedback loop that, if unchecked, would threaten the solvency of firms operating on the assumption of liquidity through asset sales or borrowings secured by such assets. These and other changes in the competitive environment both prompted and advanced the relaxation over the past few decades of many of the restrictions on bank activities and affiliations that had been established in the 1930s. As a result of these changes, which had taken place both through administrative action and by statute, banks could operate nationally, had few practical restrictions on their ability to pay competitive deposit rates, could conduct a much broader range of activities within their own operations, and could affiliate with virtually any kind of financial firm. In response to now-permissible bank involvement in more activities and affiliation with broker-dealers and other financial firms, regulatory agencies imposed more detailed capital requirements and insisted on better risk management. But there was no overhaul of financial regulation to take account of the impact of trading and capital market activities on both traditional banking and systemic risk. The financial crisis has focused the attention of policymakers on the need for just this kind of regulatory reorientation. I have recently set forth a fairly extensive explanation of the changes I believe should accompany this reorientation.2 I will not repeat this whole agenda today. Instead, let me simply highlight a few of these items to illustrate concretely what an era of systemic risk regulation would look like. First, within the Federal Reserve, we are adjusting our consolidated supervision practices to take greater account of the risks faced, and created, by affiliates principally involved in trading and other capital market activities. Recent supervisory practices had not moved quickly enough away from the traditional focus on bank holding company regulation as a way to protect the insured depository institution subsidiaries, and toward more attention to such factors as the common exposures of different affiliates within the consolidated entity. Second, we must strengthen existing regulations and supervisory guidance, particularly in areas in which bank involvement in trading and markets is most significant. The centrality of liquidity problems to the crisis requires considerable attention to adequate liquidity risk-management practices, particularly at firms substantially reliant on wholesale funding. While the most serious liquidity problems occurred outside traditional commercial bank lending and borrowing activities, the crisis revealed significant fragilities in financial institutions' extensive use of short-term repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements to finance large portions of dealer inventory and trading positions. On the other side of the balance sheet, capital requirements for assets in the trading book were revealed by the crisis to be seriously deficient, based as they were on only a 10-day trading horizon. Along with our colleagues in the other regulatory agencies and, indeed, with our international colleagues in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, we are working on proposals to address these problems. Third, we are augmenting our supervisory approach for bank holding companies to include a more explicitly systemic perspective. "Horizontal reviews" of risks, risk management, and other practices that are conducted across multiple financial firms and grounded in a uniform                                                  2  Daniel K. Tarullo (2009), “Financial Regulation in the Wake of the Crisis,” speech delivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C., June 8. 2 BIS Review 74/2009 
set of supervisory stress parameters can help identify both common trends and firm-specific weaknesses. We will incorporate into more routine supervisory practice some lessons learned from our recently completed Supervisory Capital Assessment Program of the nation's 19 largest bank holding companies.  Fourth, it is important to solve through legislation the so-called boundary problem in financial regulation. Last year there was a series of runs on nondepository financial institutions that raised systemic concerns. Institutions that may be considered too-big-to-fail, or at least too-interconnected-to-fail, must be subject to regulatory requirements and consolidated supervision. Of course, these are not the only steps I would recommend, either within the Federal Reserve or for the financial regulatory structure more generally. They should, however, give you an idea of the kinds of changes that will be necessary as we shift to a focus on systemic risk regulation. Small banks Let me turn now to the situation of smaller banks – here in North Carolina and around the nation. The financial crisis did not originate in smaller banks, but they have hardly escaped the fallout from the crisis itself, and from the serious recession that has followed. On average, commercial banks with less than $1 billion in assets reported a modest net profit during the first quarter of 2009, recovering from an average loss position in the fourth quarter of 2008. But this average figure hides the fact that nearly one in five of these banks lost money in the first quarter. As of March 31, nonperforming assets were twice the level of one year ago, and when measured against total loans and the category of Other Real Estate Owned, stood at an historic peak. Furthermore, capital ratios, although still strong for these banks as a group, have fallen since early 2008.  At the same time, the importance of traditional financial intermediation services, and hence of the smaller banks that typically specialize in providing those services, tends to increase during times of financial stress. Indeed, the crisis has highlighted the important continuing role of community banks. This seems an opportune moment both to review the virtues of community banking and to identify some of the difficulties faced by community bankers during this recession and beyond.  The dramatic changes in the U.S. financial services industry that I described earlier have also produced a new competitive environment for community banks. Consolidation has reduced the number of banking institutions (that is, commercial banks and thrifts) in the United States by nearly 50 percent since 1989. The number of community banks has declined by a similar percentage, leaving the share of all banking institutions that are community banks virtually unchanged.3  Even as the number of banking institutions has been declining, the number of banking offices (branches plus headquarters) has been growing. Not surprisingly, big banks have been the drivers of the increase in banking offices. Since 1989, the number of community bank offices has declined by about 14 percent. The number of offices per community bank did increase from 2.4 to 3.9, but even this 60% growth must be understood in the context of the changes in larger banks. In this same 20-year period, the number of big bank offices increased by about 42 percent, and the number of offices per big bank more than tripled, from just under 17 to nearly 55. The net effect was a decline of more than 25 percent in the share of banking                                                  3  Statistics in this paragraph and the next are based on a definition of the term "community bank" that includes independent commercial banks and thrifts with assets less than $1 billion and banks and thrifts that are subsidiaries of holding companies with total banking assets less than $1 billion, all in 2008 dollars. The term "big bank" is defined to include all other commercial banks and thrifts. BIS Review 74/2009 3 
offices operated by community banks. The shares of deposits, banking assets, and small business loans held by community banks have declined substantially as well.  These declines can be explained by a number of factors, including legal developments, technological advances, and changes in the business strategies of larger banks and non-bank financial service providers. For example, deregulation has allowed banks to expand their geographic reach, facilitating the formation of a number of large, geographically diversified banking organizations. These large banking organizations can now be found in many local markets, competing for business with the community banks that call those markets home. Here in North Carolina, the number of large banks with a branch presence in the state has more than doubled over the past twenty years, from 18 to 39.  At the same time, technological advances have made information about households and small businesses more readily available, allowing some (typically large) institutions to substitute credit scoring for more costly traditional techniques in the underwriting of some types of consumer and small business loans. This development has allowed larger banks to compete more effectively with community banks in providing these types of loans.  Another salient change in the competitive environment is that non-bank financial service providers have become increasingly important participants in the financial services sector, capturing a large and growing share of the retail financial services business. For example, while the number of credit unions has declined by 42 percent since 1989, credit union deposits have more than quadrupled, and credit unions have increased their share of national deposits from 4.7 percent to 8.5 percent. In addition, some credit unions have shifted from the traditional membership based on a common interest to membership that encompasses anyone who lives or works within one or more local banking markets. In the last few years, some credit unions have also moved beyond their traditional focus on consumer services to provide services to small businesses, increasing the extent to which they compete with community banks. These changes have posed significant challenges for community banks. Even so, many community banks have thrived, in large part because their local presence and personal interactions give them an advantage in meeting the financial needs of many households, small businesses, and agricultural firms. Their business model is based on an important economic explanation of the role of financial intermediaries – to develop and apply expertise that allows a lender to make better judgments about the creditworthiness of potential borrowers than could be made by a potential lender with less information about the borrowers.  A small, but growing, body of research suggests that the financial services provided by large banks are less-than-perfect substitutes for those provided by community banks.4 Consistent with this view, one study finds that the increase in competition from large, geographically diversified banking organizations has not affected the profitability of community banks in urban areas. There is some evidence of a profitability effect in rural areas, but it is actually more likely to be positive than negative.5 Thus, for most community bankers, the increased presence in their local markets of large, geographically diversified banking organizations appears not to adversely affect profitability. This circumstance may be due to the fact that a                                                  4  See, for example, Robert Adams, Kenneth Brevoort, and Elizabeth K. Kiser, (2007).

branch manager at a large depository institution typically does not have the same local connections and relationships as a community bank president.  Furthermore, although survey data indicate that small businesses have increased their reliance on large banks and non-bank financial service providers in recent years, the data show that these same firms have not reduced the average number of financial services they obtain from community banks. Rather, small businesses are, on average, using more financial services and types of services than they have in the past, and are obtaining these services from a greater number and wider variety of financial institutions, often including community banks.6  To remain successful, any business must adapt to a changing competitive environment. The adaptation of community banks over the past two decades is evidenced by the substantial changes in their balance sheets, on both the asset and liability sides. On the asset side, both the average ratio of total loans to total assets and the average share of lending comprised by commercial real estate loans have increased markedly. On the liability side, reliance on deposits of individuals, partnerships, and corporations has declined somewhat, and there has been a dramatic increase in the share of community banks that hold brokered deposits. In addition, community banks have become more reliant on non-interest sources of revenue.  These changes in business strategy, which undoubtedly helped to maintain community bank profitability over much of the past two decades, may in the current financial environment exacerbate the risks faced by community banks. In this difficult operating environment, Federal Reserve examiners are encouraging community banks to focus on maintaining sound loan quality and strong credit administration practices. In addition, they are working with community banks to ensure that they maintain appropriate capital planning, credit administration, and liquidity management policies.  For example, earlier this year, the Federal Reserve issued supervisory guidance (SR letter 09-4) that reemphasized the importance of capital planning and prudent dividend policies for bank holding companies (BHCs) and their bank subsidiaries. This guidance – which was directed at all BHCs, both large and small – reminded them to ensure that they remain sources of strength to their bank subsidiaries and to curtail dividends when their financial condition is under stress. A key part of any effective capital planning process is an evaluation of the risk posed by concentrations in specific portfolios of loans or other assets, and of the buffers necessary to offset potential losses on these holdings. In late 2006, the banking agencies issued guidance addressing concentrations in commercial real estate lending. This guidance set forth supervisory expectations for the management of risks stemming from these and other concentrations, including consideration of the effects of stressed market conditions on a bank's assets and capital. In the time since this guidance was issued, examiners report that many community banks have conducted rigorous and effective stress tests. But examiners have also visited many institutions that have only recently begun the essential step of ensuring that their management information systems are sufficiently detailed to support a robust analysis of bank concentration, and identifying where more work on stress testing is needed.  Funds management has also been an area that has received a renewed supervisory focus at banks of all sizes. As depositors and other funds providers have become more sensitive to bank risk, many banks have reinforced their contingency funding plans and developed sophisticated systems to more closely track their sources and uses of funds. These steps are particularly important for banks facing weaker asset quality.                                                   6  See Robin Prager and John D. Wolken, (2008).

Conclusion The differences in the business models of systemically important financial firms and community banks are obvious. Yet the financial crisis and ensuing recession have revealed deficiencies in risk management in institutions of both types. Changes in competitive environments require banks to respond with changes in their business strategies. But the financial crisis has also revealed the importance of banks adopting risk-management strategies appropriate to these strategic changes, and of bank regulatory agencies adapting their supervisory models to both these kinds of changes in financial institutions.  The characteristics of the financial services industry have changed enormously in the last 30 years. Along with the nature of the regulatory regime that will be effective, the key aim of prudential regulation remains what it has always been – to encourage the efficient allocation of capital to productive uses while protecting the system from the defects and excesses that are inherent in financial markets. As we recover from the crisis and the recession, we will likely be entering a new era in which systemic risk regulation assumes much greater importance for supervisors. But the role of bank management, and of risk management at banks, will also remain what it has always been – to allow these institutions to play an effective intermediating role in a safe and sound fashion.  6 BIS Review 74/2009 
Mark Carney: Rebalancing the global economy Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the International Economic Forum of the Americas Conference of Montreal, Montreal, 11 June 2009.  *      *      * The theme of this conference – "Adapting to a New World Order" – suggests that it is clear how global commerce and finance will be reorganized in the wake of the current crisis. However, the outcome is far from preordained. How we manage the rebalancing of the global economy could profoundly influence how open, equitable, and prosperous the New World Order will be.  Globalized product, capital, and labour markets1 lie at the heart of the New World Order to which we should aspire. However, the next wave of globalization needs to be more firmly grounded and its participants more responsible. In recent years, a belief in the power of markets has not always been accompanied by a commitment to build resilient markets. Moreover, at times, policy-makers and the private sector did not live up to their responsibilities.  In my talk today, I will outline an agenda to redress these failings in order to build a more responsible, more resilient globalization. But first I want to highlight the current challenges that stem from several key imbalances. Across economies, demand must rotate from deficit to surplus countries. Within our economies, major stock adjustments in inventories, labour, and capital will be required. Excessive levels of private debt must also be reduced. To offset the resulting shortfall in private demand, public demand must increase. The role of public demand is to bridge a gap. To do so successfully, it must be temporary, credible, and accompanied by measures to relaunch an open, resilient, and responsible global economy. The (newly) old world order It was not that long ago that we basked in the seemingly effortless prosperity of globalization. During the past quarter century, steady advances in transportation, communication, and information technologies, underpinned by the widespread adoption of liberal economic policies, shrank the globe and expanded its economy. Never in history has economic integration involved so many people, such a variety of goods, and so much capital.2  The pace and breadth of globalization were made possible in part by the onset of global supply-chain management.3 In effect, technology and globalization facilitated a more widespread application of two of the most powerful forces in economics: division of labour and comparative advantage. National economies became tightly linked, with demand in one country driving production and inventory cycles across several countries. From a price                                                  1  The globalization of labour markets is due mainly to information technology, which facilitates the global outsourcing of services, including medical and financial services. 2  The effective global labour supply quadrupled between 1980 and 2005. Merchandise exports grew to 20 per cent of global GDP, more than twice the level reached at the height of the last great wave of globalization a century ago. 3  Advances in information technologies, specialized production processes, and reduced communication and transportation costs all led to a whole new range of goods and services becoming tradable. For example, over the past 30 years, the share of imports as a percentage of manufacturing production has tripled. BIS Review 73/2009 1 
perspective, the net result was steady downward pressure on the prices of manufactured goods and steady upward pressure on commodity prices.4,5  The global capital market was similarly transformed during this period. Cross-border capital flows reached 15 per cent of global GDP, five times the rate at the beginning of the 20th century. By and large, these flows facilitated the diversification of risk, the transfer of technology, and the acceleration of global growth. At the same time, global markets became more interdependent. The actions of others mattered more, particularly during times of stress.  Globalization lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and created the potential for hundreds of millions more to share their destiny. For Canada, it contributed to the second-longest expansion in our nation's history – a period characterized by rising real incomes, surging employment, and low, stable, and predictable inflation.  In recent years, however, the global economy has become increasingly unbalanced. The process of rebalancing will profoundly affect the medium-term outlook for the global economy. Rotation of domestic demand from deficit to surplus countries  We are now experiencing the inevitable correction of global imbalances. These were characterized by misaligned relative prices, underdeveloped financial sectors, and excess savings in emerging markets. These were matched by rapid credit expansion, asset-price booms, and negative savings in many Western economies. These trends were encouraged by policies such as inflexible exchange rates and an overreliance on export-led growth in Asia and, in the United States, the promotion of unsustainable household spending in response to the bursting of the tech bubble. These measures collectively contributed to a low and stable interest rate environment, which fed enormous risk taking and leverage across markets and currencies.  These imbalances were most evident in current accounts. In a reversal of usual trends, emerging markets ran surpluses, and developed countries ran deficits. Poor countries in effect lent to rich ones. In 2006, the American deficit reached almost 7 per cent of GDP and the Chinese surplus more than 10 per cent. The net foreign liabilities of the world's most developed economy and the net foreign assets of its largest emerging market were both on explosive paths. That which could not go on forever eventually and brutally stopped. When the cavalier "search for yield" was replaced by a desperate "rush for shelter," leverage was viciously unwound across markets, sharply increasing risk premia around the world. In the real economy, the Bank expects that the U.S. current account deficit this year will fall by almost two-thirds from its peak. China's surplus will also narrow, although less dramatically (partly reflecting the offset from a sharp fall in commodity prices). The unwinding of global imbalances has highlighted the fundamental interconnectedness of the global economy. Virtually every financial asset on the planet was significantly re-priced as the crisis intensified. The reverberations of contracting U.S. consumer demand spread rapidly via global supply chains, and a global inventory glut developed virtually overnight. A 3  per cent decline in U.S. consumption of goods over the past six months fed a 20 per                                                  4  For Canada, the combination of lower prices for imports of manufactured goods and higher prices for our commodity exports drove an improvement in our terms of trade, which bolstered real disposable income per capita by about 8.5 per cent in the five years leading to 2008. 5  The rise in commodity prices was due to the rapid increase of manufacturing in emerging markets, where production is relatively more commodity intensive. 2 BIS Review 73/2009 
cent fall in Asian industrial production. A relationship that had been symbiotic became virulent. The recent narrowing of global current account imbalances reflects a collapse in demand, which is hardly desirable. A sustainable rebalancing of domestic demand from deficit countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, toward surplus countries, such as China and Germany, will take some time – and this will likely dampen the pace of global growth.  Reduction of debt, and the reallocation of labour and capital The second important correction in this period of transition to the "New World Order" will be characterized by significant stock adjustments in the financial and real sectors of major industrialized economies. A key lesson of Japan's lost decade is that an economy will not grow until the excesses that built up during the bubble have been removed.6 In Japan, these included commercial real estate, physical capital, and a highly leveraged corporate sector. Financial imbalances and losses from a deteriorating economy quickly overwhelmed the capital buffers of the Japanese banking sector. The resulting negative feedback loop between the real and financial economies took nearly a decade to break. There are some striking parallels in the United States. Earlier this decade, there was substantial misallocation of investment (much of which was financed from abroad) into private real estate. In addition, key industries such as autos invested in capital stock that became increasingly misaligned with prospective demand. There are also important differences. Unlike Japan, excess debt in the United States is concentrated in the household and financial sectors, and the deleveraging of the financial sector was a trigger rather than the result of the recession.  With U.S. banks now raising significant capital to cushion their losses, the negative feedback loop between the financial and real economies has been slowed, though not yet reversed. More capital will be required globally; the toxic assets in core banks still need to be addressed; and a host of vital financial markets, such as private-label securitization, must be relaunched. As a result, stabilization of the global financial system remains a precondition for a sustainable recovery, both globally and in Canada. This process of financial stock adjustment is mirrored by an adjustment process on the real supply side of the economy. In the last quarter of 2008, it became clear that levels of inventories, employment, and capital were not commensurate with the level of global demand. Each, in turn, fell roughly in the sequence one would expect, given relative adjustment costs: first, inventories; next, employment, which is quasi-fixed; and last, capital, as investment fell below the rate of replacement.  Although global demand and trade levels appear to be approaching bottom, and inventory and labour adjustments have already been substantial, there is still more to come. Unemployment will likely rise further across the G-7, with the sharpest increases still to come in those economies with the least-flexible labour markets. Uncertainty over the employment outlook will weigh on consumption in most major economies for some time. The capital stock adjustment process will take longer, and global investment growth is likely to remain negative well into 2010. This will serve as a significant drag on global growth and can be expected to reduce potential growth in most major economies.                                                   6  See "Way Out of Economic and Financial Crisis: Lessons and Policy Actions," Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, Speech at Japan Society, New York. 23 April 2009. BIS Review 73/2009 3 
Declining investment and stagnant consumption will mean that private demand, excluding that generated by tax stimulus, will remain weak until the middle of 2010. In the United States, China, and Japan, growth will likely be positive in the third quarter of 2009, but largely owing to massive fiscal expenditures and tax cuts. Self-sustaining private demand in most major economic areas is not yet imminent. The G-20 strategy is to enact extraordinary fiscal stimulus to offset financial headwinds and to bridge the gap until the end of the stock adjustment process and the restoration of private demand. Its success depends on three interrelated factors: the scale of the private savings response; the magnitude, duration, and credibility of the fiscal response itself; and the eventual rebalancing of risk between the public and private sectors. Let me address each of these factors in turn.  The evolution of private and public savings One of the biggest imponderables is the outlook for household savings rates. In the run-up to the crisis, households increasingly "saved" through capital appreciation rather than from current income. A decline of roughly 30 per cent in U.S. wealth has caused household savings rates to rise sharply from nearly zero between 2005 and 2008 to 4 per cent in the first quarter of 2009. The new equilibrium of household savings will depend on multiple factors, including wealth effects, risk aversion, the evolution of the financial system, and crucially, the credibility of fiscal policy itself.  The surge in private savings is being offset by a rise in public dissaving. The world is well on its way to spending an average of 2 per cent of GDP in discretionary fiscal measures. Simultaneous fiscal action means that spillovers across countries offset each other to some degree, thereby limiting net leakage and maximizing the overall impact. In addition, the current global concentration on infrastructure spending provides some support for commodity prices. But there are limits to everything, including fiscal policy. Across the G-7 this year, the average deficit will be 12 per cent of GDP. Global public borrowing requirements will be two times greater than last year. Compounding effects and the need to avoid an abrupt withdrawal of fiscal stimulus will mean that average public debt levels in many major economies could increase to 110 per cent of GDP before stabilizing. The composition of global savings will need to change radically. These dynamics could become self-defeating if the credibility of fiscal paths is called into question. A combination of substantial upward pressure on interest rates on investment or Ricardian effects7 on consumption would retard the recovery. It is therefore paramount that fiscal policy frameworks retain credibility. This requires both effective current initiatives and realistic exit strategies. In this regard, Canada's experience of the 1990s with the steady overachievement of near-term targets on the road to fiscal balance is relevant.  Ultimately, a return to sustained growth in private sector demand that can accommodate desired private savings is essential. An open, global economy centred on private risk taking is the best prospect for this. But before that can be assured, much needs to be done, starting with an orderly retreat of the public sector.                                                   7  Ricardian equivalence refers to the theory that increases in government spending are largely offset by reductions in private consumption, reflecting future anticipated tax increases. 4 BIS Review 73/2009 
Redistribution of risk between public and private sectors The financial panic required a bold response from the public sector. The loss of faith in the solvency of core banking institutions at times threatened the very functioning of the global financial system. While absolutely necessary, the response to the crisis has profoundly shifted risk from the private sector to the public sector. Since October, the G-7 has committed that no systemically important financial institutions will be allowed to fail. Across the world, bank financings have been guaranteed. With securitization markets still moribund, assets have been purchased and tail risks assumed by the public sector. Governments have even guaranteed warranties on certain car models. With these precedents, there will be further pressure for a host of new risk-sharing arrangements.8  We need to think carefully about where risks are best held as we emerge from this crisis. There are two considerations. First, risks that can be priced are best borne by the private sector, whereas uncertainties that have a wide and significant potential impact are best borne by the public sector. Second, risks are endogenous: Public policy and private decisions influence aggregate risk in the system. For example, the widespread private use of collateral to mitigate counterparty risk reduced credit risk but sharply increased liquidity risk. Similarly, the public sector's recent assumption of some risks creates moral hazard. If left unchecked, this will eventually promote private behaviours that will add overall risk to the system.  The expedient should not become permanent. Governments have assumed extraordinary tail risks and quite ordinary financial risks. They should decide whether to keep the former or to effectively shut down the activities associated with them (for example, some aspects of securitization). They should return the latter to the private sector.  A central bank agenda for renewed globalization  But how to do so, when animal spirits are so clearly moribund? Perceptions have changed. There is a better appreciation of the amorphous and endogenous nature of risk. There is also a welcome acknowledgement of uncertainty. Knowing that a black swan might be out there disciplines activity. Humility seldom goes before a fall. Unfortunately, a newly humbled private sector may only re-engage if it believes that the system is more resilient. To accomplish this, central banks, along with other public agencies, must promote both the necessary market infrastructure and responsible policy.  There are four priorities for renewed globalization.  First, transparency should be increased so that risk can be identified more effectively and priced more efficiently. The crisis laid bare important deficiencies such as the woefully inadequate disclosure on securitized products. The Bank of Canada used its collateral policy to improve the disclosure of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), creating a standard that should become commonplace. The current global initiative to transfer many over-the-counter derivatives onto clearing houses is motivated partially by the desire to promote standardization.  Second, core funding markets should be made more efficient and less susceptible to extreme price movements. The crisis was clearly exacerbated by the seizure of interbank and repo markets: Good collateral became unfinanceable overnight, firms failed, risk aversion skyrocketed, and the global economy plummeted. Promising avenues to break such (il)liquidity spirals include introducing clearing houses, standardizing products, implementing through-the-cycle margining, and ensuring more effective netting. As the ultimate provider of                                                  8  See "(Nearly) nothing to fear but fear itself," Olivier Blanchard, Chief Economist, International Monetary Fund.

liquidity to the system, the Bank is thinking through whether to adapt its facilities to support continuous private liquidity creation. Third, macroprudential regulations must be enacted to help smooth the credit cycle. A prominent example could be a new bank capital regime. It should be dynamic (with buffers and provisions moving through the cycle), simple (including Canadian-style leverage caps), and coherent (consistent with broader initiatives such as moving over-the-counter derivatives onto exchanges). Given where we are in the current crisis, it should also be Augustinian, that is, new requirements should be phased in over time to avoid deepening the recession because of procyclical deleveraging.  Fourth, all countries must accept their responsibilities for promoting an open, flexible, and resilient international monetary system. Responsibility means recognizing spillovers between economies and financial systems and working to mitigate those that could amplify adverse dynamics. It means submitting to peer review within the Financial Stability Board and external review by the International Monetary Fund. Fundamentally, it means adopting coherent macro policies and allowing real exchange rates to adjust to achieve external balance over time. This crisis was caused in part by failures to meet the same challenges that bedevilled the architects of the original Bretton Woods system. Given the current, deeply synchronous global recession, the costs of free riding should be obvious to all. Conclusion  I would like to conclude with a few words on the impact of this rebalancing for Canada. It appears likely that the global economy is entering a period of lower potential growth. The substantial capital misallocation and financial excesses of the boom years will take years to work off. Rebuilding globalization will also take time. Recognizing the scale of the industrial restructuring and the lower investment over that period, the Bank has lowered its estimate for Canadian productivity and potential growth. The shifting composition of global growth will also have important implications for Canada. The current pattern of U.S. activity, with its weakness in the housing and auto sectors, is proving particularly challenging for our businesses. We expect the U.S. recovery to be relatively subdued compared with historical experience, given the domestic rebalancing requirements in that economy.  More positively, the greater proportion of emerging-market growth in the overall growth of the global economy should create new opportunities, particularly by supporting commodity prices. Our research indicates that, even in the throes of the crisis, those emerging markets whose demand is most relevant to our exports are also generally the most resilient. These countries can be expected to make up an increasing proportion of global demand going forward.  Unfortunately, a smooth rotation of demand across economies is not assured. Overall, the orderly resolution of global imbalances remains an important risk to the outlook for growth and inflation in Canada. As we noted in our policy decision last week, the recent sharp increase in the value of the Canadian dollar, if it proves persistent, could fully offset recent positive developments in financial conditions, commodity prices, and confidence.  In the wake of a major shock to external demand and the financial crisis, the Bank has acted proactively and aggressively. We eased our policy rate to the lowest possible level – 1/4 per cent – to support private demand and to achieve our 2 per cent inflation target. Conditional on the outlook for inflation, the Bank expects the policy rate to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. The Bank retains considerable additional flexibility, including unconventional measures, as outlined in the principles-based framework in our April Monetary Policy Report.  6 BIS Review 73/2009 
With our domestic and international partners, the Bank is working actively to build more resilient markets and to create an open, global financial system. Success is not assured. Setbacks in managing through the recession could undermine support for open economies. More broadly, without credible policy frameworks and robust market infrastructure, private risk taking may not return to the extent required. However, there is every reason that Canada should be among the first to implement the agenda that I have described today. Through such leadership, we can do our part to create a more responsible, resilient globalization.  BIS Review 73/2009 7 
Caleb M Fundanga: Strengthening Zambia’s financial and private health sector Remarks by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the Second Private Health Sector Trade Fair, Lusaka, 5 June 2009. *      *      * The Chairperson, Banking on Health; Representatives from the Medical Council of Zambia; Representatives from The General Nursing Council; Representatives from the Zambia Medical Association; Members of the Zambia Union of Nurses Organisation; Members of the Zambia Alliance of Private Health Providers; Representatives from the Pharmaceuticals Society of Zambia; Distinguished invited guests; Ladies and Gentlemen. *      *      * It is with great joy and gratitude that I stand to address you at this important Second Private Health Sector Trade Fair. This occasion brings together many of our esteemed medical providers from the private sector and other important stakeholders in the delivery of medical services in Zambia like financial institutions, pharmaceutical distributors, and other commercial suppliers who support the medical industry. The Bank of Zambia as regulator of the financial system is committed to strengthening the financial sector and position it so that it is relevant to the country development agenda by providing finance to sectors like health and qualified private health providers. I believe this will lead to the improved quality of medical services provision in Zambia and contribute to the country’s economic growth. Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bank of Zambia, recognizes the important role that the private sector continues to play in providing health services to much of Zambia’s population. These service providers, whether they are doctors, nurses, midwives, clinical officers, dentists, or pharmacists offer their clients increased choices. More choices in health provision allow people to find the best care for their own particular circumstance and needs. The expanded choices and reach provided by the private sector is a wonderful complement to the existing public health services. Furthermore, the recent decision by the Zambian Government to designate Health and Education as economic sectors will undoubtedly, assist all investors in the health and education sectors. This entails that investors in these sectors can now enjoy the various incentives previously available only to investments in the real sector. Chairperson, In order for the private health sector to truly flourish in Zambia, it is vital that the government provides an enabling environment that will ensure that private providers of health services can obtain the financing they need to expand and improve their medical practices. Most micro, small, and medium enterprise firms in Africa, including health businesses, only receive 5 percent of their financing through banks, while larger firms get 22 percent of their financing needs from banks. In Zambia, a recent survey on financial inclusiveness indicated that only about one third of the population is financially served by banks and non bank financial institutions. Barriers to access to credits identified included; high interest rates, caps on loans and excessive collateral requirements. BIS Review 73/2009 1 
The importance of increasing access of banking services to a larger proportion of our population cannot be overemphasized. Financial services are a critical tool to help people step onto the economic growth ladder and create a brighter future by tapping their own creativity in creating jobs and incomes. It can also be instrumental for broader human development, by letting clients invest in themselves and seek protection from shocks and bad fortune. It is however, gratifying to note that following the survey, commercial banks and other non-bank financial institutions in Zambia have increasingly become receptive to lending to small and medium-sized enterprises and have in this regard established departments dedicated to small and medium enterprise lending and introduced financial products specifically designed to meet the financing needs of these businesses. In working with Banking on Health, banks have shown interest in learning about the private health sector, a sector whose business characteristics were largely unknown to banks. However, banks can still misunderstand the risks, overestimate the costs, and underestimate the potential returns of lending to sectors, such as the health sector. In addition to the structural barriers in the financial sector that limit access to finance, many private health care providers have limited financial and business-management skills and often struggle to prepare a bankable loan applications or business proposals. It is difficult for commercial banks to assess the credit risk of a loan without the financial statements and business plans to support the loan application. Chairperson, I am happy to state that “Banking on Health”, with support from the U.S. Government, has worked to address some of the barriers to credit by providing market research information on the private medical sector to commercial banks and microfinance institutions so that they can understand the business characteristics of the sector. The financial management training that Banking on Health provides to health businesses also lowers the risk of lending to these borrowers. Ladies and Gentlemen, let me end by pointing out that the challenges arising from the global financial and economic crisis are huge but surmountable. Major economies of the world are putting in place various stimulus packages, which are expected to take the world economy out of the crisis. Without doubt, these measures will benefit emerging and developing economies as well, provided that we remain committed to pursuing strong socio-economic policies. Although the global financial crisis has negatively affected the Zambian economy in many respects and presents serious challenges to maintaining the health of the economy, macroeconomic stability has been maintained. The Bank of Zambia has continued to monitor the global developments and take appropriate measures to maintain confidence in the banking system and avoid systemic risk. It is important to note that despite the crisis, there still remains investment confidence in the Zambian economy and one example of this is the number of new commercial banks that have commenced operations in Zambia in the last 12 months. The Bank of Zambia is also committed to ensuring the availability of finance to viable businesses including qualified health businesses. Doing so will help create a foundation for greater investment in the health of the nation. We appreciate the partnership and initiatives such as the “Banking on Health” in extending health services in Zambia and look forward to greater investment in the health sector of Zambia. I thank you. 2 BIS Review 73/2009 
José Manuel González-Páramo: Address for the 2008 Bernácer Prize Award Ceremony in honour of Markus Brunnermeier Speech by Mr José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the 2008 Bernácer Prize Award Ceremony in honour of Markus Brunnermeier, Madrid, 10 June 2009. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen,1  It is a great pleasure for me to be given the honour of addressing a few words to you on the occasion of this year’s award ceremony of the Bernácer Prize to Professor Markus Brunnermeier from Princeton University. Guillermo de la Dehesa asked me to share some thoughts with you about the importance of scientific research for the European Central Bank and its monetary policy. In this context, I would like to express my appreciation for the influential contributions made by this year’s laureate to the academic debate in fields which are of particular relevance for central bank policymakers. Markus Brunnermeier has to be particularly praised for helping us to improve our understanding of some of the main causes and mechanisms behind the current financial crisis, as well as for his scholarly advice to policymakers and the general public as to how the global financial system can be put on a more stable and solid footing through regulatory reform. But I will revert to this later. Let me first emphasise that research plays a crucial role for the Eurosystem as much as for other central banks. Research provided an essential input to the definition of the ECB’s price-stability monetary policy strategy as well as to the design of its operational framework. Besides, in order to conduct monetary policy on a regular basis, the ECB needs to accumulate knowledge and information on how the dynamics of the economy tend to evolve, how specific markets work, how its policy instrument influences price and output developments through the various transmission chains. Moreover, the ECB also performs core functions and tasks in supporting a smooth operation of payments systems and contributes to safeguarding financial stability which likewise requires substantial theoretical and empirical knowledge. It should go without saying that such detailed information about the financial markets and the economy as a whole mainly originates from research efforts, whether they are undertaken from within or outside the ECB.  Central banking will certainly always remain an art as much as a science in the sense that a clear rulebook prescribing the best policy action in all specific circumstances does not exist. Uncertainty is simply pervasive. For example, the quantitative knowledge of central banks on the monetary transmission process remains imperfect and fragile due to the preponderance of data, estimation and model uncertainty in macroeconomic model building, compounded by the constant risk of structural change in evolving economies and societies. Central bankers also regularly face situations which are unique and unprecedented, and where the alternative states (or their likelihood) are not really well known or understood. These situations of so-called Knightian uncertainty clearly defy measurement and thus pose challenges for empirically-validated policy advice. In the face of uncertainty, to arrive at a certain decision monetary policymakers need to combine knowledge derived from a variety of models with individual experience and judgement. Notwithstanding this, the way monetary policymakers filter the information they receive and the experiences they have made usually depends on some theoretical concepts adopted and internalised during their professional lives. It is the responsibility of a central bank as an institution to ensure that the fundamental ideas behind                                                  1  I am grateful to M. Hoerova and M. Kremer for their input into this speech and to P. Hartmann and F. Smets for comments. BIS Review 73/2009 1 
actual monetary policymaking reflect as far as possible the “state of the art” of the respective disciplines, and not invalidated or even falsified ideas of some “defunct economist”, to loosely quote from John Maynard Keynes’s famous conclusions to The General Theory. The ECB attempts to cope with this responsibility by fostering a very intense exchange of information and manpower with the academic world at all levels. Leading experts in economics and finance regularly visit the ECB to discuss their most recent findings at seminars, conferences or workshops, often co-hosted with other major central banks and research institutions, as well as to provide consultancy. The members of the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the ECB play an active part themselves in this regular exchange of views between the theory and practice of monetary policy. It should be emphasised that a close relationship between theory and policy making gives rise to cross-fertilisation. Scientific progress definitely improves the conduct of monetary policy and other central bank tasks over time; but it is likewise true that academics often benefit from practitioners´ deep knowledge of data and institutional detail as well as their broad experience in all aspects of real-world monetary policymaking.  Insights from research have been invaluable particularly in times of the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. Finding the correct policy prescriptions to alleviate the consequences and resolve the current crisis requires a thorough understanding of the underlying causes. Markus Brunnermeier’s research has played a prominent role here. For instance, his research on bubbles sheds light on how institutional frictions and strategic considerations can lead to significant mispricings of assets.2 While market participants may be aware of the flawed asset valuation, the lack of common knowledge can lead to a build up of the bubble and hinder its bursting. This approach departs from the conventional market efficiency view that rational traders will immediately stabilise prices by shortening overvalued assets and, by contrast, integrates important aspects of trading behaviour into the mainstream of economics and finance. When a bubble bursts and risk is re-assessed, financial institutions suffer losses. In the current crisis, uncertainty over the size and location of exposures of banks or bank-sponsored conduits to “toxic” assets translated into funding liquidity problems. A paper by Brunnermeier and Pedersen, “Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity” explains how such funding problems can affect market liquidity and lead to mutually reinforcing liquidity spirals.3 Balance sheet constraints of financial intermediaries can naturally lead to market illiquidity and the expectations of future liquidity risk can lead to panic and more asset price declines. Indeed, liquidity shortage was one of the key propagation mechanisms of the current crisis which illustrates a negative externality that fire-sales by individual institutions can impose on the financial system as a whole. It is also one of the factors that contributed to prolonged tensions in the interbank market as banks were reluctant to lend to each other to minimise counterparty exposures. These markets are crucial for banks’ liquidity managements and also for the transmission of monetary policy. The work on funding and market liquidity also offers possible mechanisms for the resolution of liquidity spirals. The key policy prescription is to improve the funding liquidity of financial institutions in order to prevent solvent institutions from being driven out of business by protracted illiquidity. This policy has been followed extensively by the Eurosystem over the recent past. Liquidity spirals also create an important pro-cyclical mechanism in the financial system. This issue is discussed in the draft notes on the next Geneva Report on the World Economy written by Professor Brunnermeier and co-authors on “The fundamental principles of financial                                                  2  Abreu, D. and M.

regulation”.4 The policy conclusions include both crisis prevention – with recommendations like the introduction of macro-prudential regulation or liquidity regulation – as well as crisis management with analyses of toxic asset purchases, asset guarantees or mortgage subsidies, for example. Notwithstanding the important theoretical advances to which Markus Brunnermeier contributed substantially, there is still much to be learnt about the root causes, the triggers and the propagation mechanisms of the financial turmoil, and how precisely it spread to the real sector, causing a deep financial and economic crisis arising from negative feedback loops between the two sectors. The severe challenges for policymakers posed by the existing knowledge gaps are reflected in the very controversial debates about the optimal responses to mitigate and resolve the current crisis and to prevent future crises from occurring.  Quick progress on these and related research topics is essential for the ECB both from a monetary policy and a financial stability perspective. While at present the ECB already performs certain tasks which shall contribute to safeguarding the stability of the financial system, it is foreseen that the range of tasks and responsibilities of the ECB related to financial stability matters becomes substantially enlarged. According to the recent proposal by the European Commission on the reform of financial supervision in the European Union, drawing on the recommendations of the de Laroisière High-Level Group, the ECB would play an important role in a new European Systemic Risk Council to be in charge of macro-prudential financial supervision in the European Union. For the ECB to effectively perform such tasks requires, among other, major investments into a supporting macro-prudential analytical infrastructure, for example the development and implementation of a suite of early warning signal models and the significant extension of existing macro stress testing models. But we also need innovative approaches on optimal policy responses once macro-prudential risks have been identified, since the European Systemic Risk Council will also have to issue policy recommendations. In contrast to the assessment of systemic risks where we have a basis to build on and where our staff has also made research contributions to the literature, macro-prudential regulation or policy is a relatively new concept for which a good analytical basis still needs to be developed. This is an area where brilliant scholars like Markus Brunnermeier can make an invaluable contribution. And he has already started to do so. I herewith extend my sincerest congratulations to you – Markus – for winning the 2008 Bernácer Prize, which you very much deserve.                                                  4  Brunnermeier, M., Crockett, A., Goodhart, C., Persaud, A.D. and H.

Rakesh Mohan: Emerging contours of financial regulation – challenges and dynamics Paper by Dr Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, for the Financial Stability Review of Bank of France, 10 June 2009. The assistance of Anand Sinha, Prashant Saran, P R Ravi Mohan, T Gopinath, and Muneesh Kapur in preparation of the paper is gratefully acknowledged. The paper has also benefited from the Report of the Working Group I of the G-20 on “Enhancing Sound Regulation and Strengthening Transparency”. *      *      * The world is currently in the midst of the most severe financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression. Although the crisis originated in the sub-prime mortgage market in the United States, it then spread to Europe and later to the rest of the world. The speed of the contagion that spread across the world is perhaps unprecedented. What started off as a relatively limited crisis in the US housing mortgage sector turned successively into a widespread banking crisis in the United States and Europe, the breakdown of both domestic and international financial markets, and then later into a full blown global economic crisis. Almost all governments and central banks of the world have been busy over the last 9-18 months in an effort to contain the effects of the crisis through both fiscal and monetary policy measures, respectively. Just as the global nature of the crisis is unprecedented, so is the global nature of the response, as exemplified by the coordinated action being committed to by the G-20. Along with the coordinated fiscal and monetary policy actions, a comprehensive re-examination of the financial regulatory and supervisory framework is also underway around the world.  Against this backdrop, this paper attempts to analyse the emerging contours of regulation of financial institutions with an emphasis on the emerging challenges and dynamics. The paper is organised as follows: Section I provides a broad overview of the global developments which contributed to the current global financial crisis. Section II presents the ongoing discussion and debate at the international level in the light of the shortcomings of the extant regulatory framework. Section III analyses proposals for reforming the regulatory framework, while Section IV discusses the difficulties in implementing the regulatory proposals. I.  Evolution of crisis: what went wrong? What are some of the identifiable sources of market failures that led to the current financial turbulence?  The current ongoing financial crisis is attributed to a variety of factors such as the developments in the sub-prime mortgage sector, excessive leverage, lax financial regulation and supervision, and global macroeconomic imbalances. At a fundamental level, however, the crisis also reflects the effects of long periods of excessively loose monetary policy in the major advanced economies during the early part of this decade. After the dotcom bubble burst in the US around the turn of the decade, monetary policy in the US and then in other advanced economies was eased relatively aggressively. Policy rates in the US reached one per cent in 2002, and were held around these levels for an extended period, longer than was probably necessary (Taylor, 2009; Yellen, 2009). Excessively loose monetary policy led to excess liquidity and consequent low interest rates worldwide; and the burst of financial innovation during this period amplified and accelerated the consequences of excess liquidity and rapid credit expansion (de Larosière Report, 2009). What is interesting about this episode is that, despite the persistent accommodative monetary policy, the accompanying strong worldwide macroeconomic growth did not result in BIS Review 72/2009 1 
measured inflationary pressures in goods and most services. Consequently, central banks in advanced economies, particularly in the US, did not withdraw monetary accommodation for an extended period. The excess liquidity worldwide did show up in rising asset prices, and later in commodity prices, particularly oil. It was only then that measured inflation did start rising and central banks began to tighten monetary policy, though belatedly. With significant increases in both investment and consumption, along with declining savings,1 aggregate demand exceeded domestic output in the US for an extended period, leading to persistent and increasing current account deficits, as the domestic savings investment imbalance grew. This large excess demand of the US was supplied by the rest of the world, especially China, which provided goods and services at relatively low cost, leading to corresponding current account surpluses in China and elsewhere. The surpluses generated by the oil exporting countries added to the emerging global imbalances.  Large current account surpluses in China and other EMEs and equivalent deficits in the US and elsewhere are often attributed to the exchange rate policies in China, other EMEs and oil exporters. Given the fact that the US demand exceeded output, it is apparent that the US current deficit would have continued at its elevated levels. In the event of a more flexible exchange rate policy in China, the sources of imports for the US would have been some countries other than China. Although the lack of exchange rate flexibility in the Asian EMEs and oil exporters did contribute to the emergence of global imbalances, it can not fully explain the large and growing current account deficits in the US, particularly since Europe as a whole did not exhibit current account deficits at the same time. Accommodative monetary policy and the corresponding existence of low interest rates for an extended period encouraged the active search for higher yields by a host of market participants. Thus capital flows to Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) surged in search of higher yields, but could not be absorbed by these economies in the presence of either large current account surpluses or only small deficits, largely ending up as official reserves. These reserves were recycled into US government securities and those of the government sponsored mortgage entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Thus, while accommodative monetary policy kept short term interest rates low, the recycled reserves contributed to the lowering of long term interest rates in the advanced economies, particularly the United States. Such low long term interest rates contributed to the growth of mortgage finance and consequent rising housing prices. Furthermore, the stable macroeconomic environment – relatively stable growth and low inflation – in the major advanced economies in the run up to the crisis led to sustained under-pricing of risks and hence excessive risk taking and financial innovation. It may be ironic that the perceived success of central banks and increased credibility of monetary policy, giving rise to enhanced expectations with regard to stability in both inflation and interest rates, could have led to the mispricing of risk and hence enhanced risk taking. Easy monetary policy itself may have generated a search for yields that resulted in a dilution of standards in assessing credit risk leading to erosion of sound practices (Mohan, 2007). Lower yields encouraged excessive leverage as banks and financial institutions attempted to maintain their profitability. Lacunae in financial regulation and supervision allowed this excessive leverage in the financial system. Assets were either taken off banks’ balance sheets to off-balance sheet vehicles that were effectively unregulated; or financial innovation synthetically reduced the perceived risks on balance sheets. The sustained rise in asset prices, particularly house prices, on the back of excessively accommodative monetary policy, and lax lending standards coupled with financial innovations, resulted in the high growth in mortgage credit to households, particularly to low credit quality households. Due to the “originate and distribute” model, most of these                                                  1  The US personal saving rate hovered only slightly above zero from mid-2005 to mid-2007 (Yellen, 2009). 2 BIS Review 72/2009 
mortgages were securitized. In combination with strong growth in complex credit derivatives and with the use of credit ratings, the mortgages, inherently sub-prime, were bundled into a variety of tranches, including AAA tranches, and sold to a range of financial investors looking for higher yields.  As inflation started creeping up beginning in 2004, the US Federal Reserve did start to withdraw monetary accommodation. Consequently, mortgage payments started rising, while housing prices started to ease. Low/negligible margin financing incentivised default by the sub-prime borrowers. Although the loans were supposedly securitized and sold to the off balance sheet special institutional vehicles (SIVs), the losses were ultimately borne by the banks and financial institutions wiping off a significant fraction of their capital. The uncertainty about the extent of the likely bank losses led to a breakdown of trust among banks. Given the growing financial globalization, banks and financial institutions in other major advanced economies, especially Europe, have also been adversely affected by losses and capital write-offs. Inter-bank money markets nearly froze and this was reflected in very high spreads in money markets and debt markets. There was aggressive search for safety, which has been mirrored in very low yields on Treasury bills and bonds. These developments were significantly accentuated following the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and there was a complete loss of confidence. The deep and lingering crisis in global financial markets, the extreme level of risk aversion, the mounting losses of banks and financial institutions, the elevated level of commodity and oil prices (until the third quarter of 2008), and the sharp correction in a range of asset prices, all combined, have suddenly led to the sharp slowdown in growth momentum in the major advanced economies, especially since the Lehman failure. Global growth for 2009, which was seen at a healthy 3.8 per cent in April 2008, is now expected by the IMF to contract by 1.3 per cent.  Thus, the causes for the current crisis reflect the interaction of monetary policy, the choice of exchange rate regime in a number of countries and important changes within the financial system itself (de Larosière Report, 2009; BIS, 2008), along with lax regulation arising from the belief in efficient markets and light touch regulation. To recap, low interest rates, together with increasing and excessive optimism about the future pushed up asset prices, from stock prices to housing prices. Low interest rates and limited volatility prompted the search for yield down the credit quality curve, and underestimation of risks led to creation and purchase of riskier assets. Central banks, focused on measured consumer price inflation and aggregate activity, while neglecting asset price movements, did not perceive the full implications of the growing risks until it was too late (IMF, 2009). II.  Shortcomings in financial regulation and supervision There have been calls for fundamental rethinking on macro-economic, monetary and financial sector policies to meet the new challenges and realities, which perhaps represent a structural shift in the international financial architecture demanding potentially enhanced degree of coordination among monetary authorities and regulators. A review of the policies relating to financial regulation, in a way, needs to address both the acute policy dilemmas in the short run and a fundamental re-think on broader frameworks of financial and economic policies over the medium-term (Reddy, 2008). A great deal of very active discussion is now going on internationally on the existing regulatory practices and the future of financial regulation and supervision. It is also perhaps correct to say that there is an emerging consensus on the directions that need to be taken on financial regulation and supervision. Among the most influential reports on this issue are: • Report of the High Level Group on Financial Supervision in the European Union (Chairman: Jacques de Larosière).  BIS Review 72/2009 3 
• The structure of Financial Supervision: Approaches and Challenges in a Global Market Place (Group of Thirty; Chairman: Paul Volcker).  • The Fundamental Principles of Financial Regulation (The Geneva Report).  • The Turner Review: A Regulatory Response to the Global Banking Crisis (Financial Services Authority of the UK); and finally,  • The Report of Working Group I of the G-20 on “Enhancing, Sound Regulation and Strengthening Transparency (G-20).  What is common among all these reports is the acknowledgement that regulation and supervision in the advanced economies was clearly too lax in recent times and that there needs to be considerable rethinking leading to much strengthened, and perhaps, intrusive regulation and supervision in the financial sector. There is clear recognition of serious regulatory and supervisory failures. The root of such re-thinking is really the questioning of the existing intellectual assumptions with respect to the functioning of markets, and the nature of financial risk. To quote the Turner Review:  “At the core of these assumptions has been the theory of efficient and rational markets. Five propositions with implications for regulatory approach have followed: (i) Market prices are good indicators of rationally evaluated economic value. (ii) The development of securitized credit, since based on the creation of new and more liquid markets, has improved both allocative efficiency and financial stability. (iii) The risk characteristics of financial markets can be inferred from mathematical analysis, delivering robust quantitative measures of trading risk. (iv) Market discipline can be used as an effective tool in constraining harmful risk taking. (v) Financial innovation can be assumed to be beneficial since market competition would winnow out any innovations which did not deliver value added. Each of these assumptions is now subject to extensive challenge on both theoretical and empirical grounds, with potential implications for the appropriate design of regulation and for the role of regulatory authorities”. (Turner Review, 2009, p.30) What were the specific developments in the financial system that arose from these broadly accepted intellectual assumptions that led to the ongoing global financial crisis? Financial and banking crises have a long history, which is as old as the existence of the financial sector itself. What is common among almost all crises is the build up of excessive leverage in the system and the inevitable bursting of the financial bubble that results from such leverage. What is interesting about the current crisis is that this excess leverage occurred over a period when greater consensus had developed through the Basel process on the need for and level of adequate capital required in banking institutions across all major jurisdictions. Furthermore, sophisticated financial risk management capabilities were also believed to have been developed within large financial institutions during this period of unusually high rapid growth in both the magnitude and sophistication of the financial system. With financial deregulation in key jurisdiction like the United States and the U.K., along with most other countries, financial institutions also grew in complexity. Financial conglomerates began to include all financial functions under one roof: banking, insurance, asset management, proprietary trading, investment banking, broking, and the like. The consequence has been inadequate appreciation and assessment of the emerging risks, both within institutions and system wide. What were the factors that led to this emergence of excessive system wide and institutional risk? Among the notable developments of the last decade has been the unprecedented explosive growth of securitized credit intermediation and associated derivatives (Yellen, 2009). The 4 BIS Review 72/2009 
assumption underlying this development was that this constituted a mechanism that took risk off the balance sheets of banks, placing it with a diversified set of investors, and thereby serving to reduce banking system risks. As late as April 2006, the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report noted that this dispersion would help “mitigate and absorb shocks to the financial system” with the result that “improved resilience may be seen in fewer bank failures and more consistent credit provision” (as quoted in the Turner Report, p.42). This assumption has already proved to be erroneous, although simple forms of securitisation have existed for a long time. Among the key functions of banks is maturity transformation: they intermediate shorter term liabilities to fund longer term assets in the non-financial sector. Banks are typically highly leveraged and hence trust and confidence is crucial to their functioning and stability. Traditionally, therefore, banks exercised sharp vigilance on the risk elements of their assets, which were typically illiquid, in order to ensure constant rollover of their shorter term funding liabilities. What securitization does is to turn illiquid assets into liquid ones, which in theory then disperse risks from the banks’ balance sheets and also reduce their requirements of banking capital. With assets themselves seen as liquid short term instruments, they began to be funded by ultra-short term liabilities, including even overnight repos whose volume increased manifold in recent years. Systemic risk increased because traded instruments are inherently more susceptible to price swings depending on changes in market sentiment. Furthermore, liquidity risks in such markets were also not understood adequately. It was assumed that these liquid markets would always exist, and hence securitized assets were assumed to be inherently less risky than illiquid long term credit assets. Financial innovation arising from the search for yields compounded this problem as second order derivatives proliferated and their valuation became increasingly dependent on model valuation and credit ratings, rather than observable and transparent market valuation, and hence inherently more opaque. Thus, when problems arose in these markets and prices were not visible, valuation of the assets of banks and the shadow banking system became unobservable. Consequently, trust and confidence evaporated and markets froze. Compounding these problems was the emergence of the shadow banking system that took off assets from the banks’ balance sheets, thereby reducing the latter’s capital requirements. The complexity and magnitude of intra-financial sector transactions exploded over this past decade, particularly over the past five years. Thus the financial sector increasingly served itself, exhibiting high profits and growth, while doing relatively little for the non financial sectors of the economy, which the financial sector exists to serve in principle. The debt of financial companies increased to levels exceeding the GDP of leading economies. Thus, in the process of taking risks off balance sheets through securitization, these risks returned to the extended banking system itself and the original rationale for securitization got belied. Rather than reducing systemic risk the system of complex securitisaiton and associated derivatives only served to increase systemic risk. Moreover, it became increasingly difficult to trace where the risk ultimately lay. The regulatory system was clearly behind the curve in taking account of these developments. The procedures for calculating risk-based capital requirements under-estimated the risks inherent in traded securitized instruments, thereby adding to the incentive for banks to securitise assets into traded instruments, which bore lower risks weights. The trading of these instruments has largely been in OTC markets that exhibit little transparency. As a result of this overall process, banks became effectively under capitalized, and the leverage ratios of the unregulated shadow banking system and investment banks reached unsustainable levels. With the existence of low interest rates, mispriced low risk perceptions, and inherent incentives to originate lending and distribute securitized instruments, household indebtedness increased to unprecedented levels, particularly for housing. Demand for housing assets rose and hence housing prices. Thus micro behavior led to increased BIS Review 72/2009 5 
systemic risk that was not adequately appreciated or understood, and hence not monitored by the authorities. Thus there are immense emerging challenges that confront financial sector regulators as a consequence of the ongoing global financial crisis. We can look forward to extensive debate at both the academic level and among practitioners. How will we change our view on the efficiency and rationality of markets, particularly financial markets? What will be the effect of such re-examination on financial innovation in the future? What will regulatory authorities do in the meantime while these debates are settled at the intellectual level? Will they overreact and restrict financial growth in the months and years to come? Will this affect global GDP growth as well? I now turn to the key proposals that are now being made for overhaul of the strong financial regulatory architecture. III.  Reforming the regulatory framework: the future perspective A great deal of discussion is going on at both the national and international levels on reform of the financial regulatory system to address the various weaknesses that have emerged. There is no question that financial regulation has to be strengthened all round. Hitherto unregulated institutions, markets and instruments will now have to be brought under the regulatory framework, and the framework itself will need to be redesigned to address the emerging needs at both national and international levels. As this new enthusiasm for financial regulation unfolds, it is important that we keep in mind the basic functions of the financial system, and how they can be strengthened so that the needs of the real economy are better served. We need to ensure that the financial system continues to play a vital role in intermediating savings for providing adequate levels of funding to the real sector, thereby supporting economic growth. It needs to be recognized that financial markets will remain global and interconnected, while financial innovation would continue to be important to foster economic efficiency. Hence, while strengthening financial regulation and supervision, an endeavour has to be made in this process to be careful not to stifle entrepreneurship and financial innovation. But the following question needs to be constantly asked: “Financial innovation towards what objective?” As long as financial innovation is seen to promote price discovery, greater intermediation efficiency, and hence, overall efficiency and growth, it must be encouraged, but with appropriate safeguards to maintain financial stability. Unproductive financial innovation, however, will need to be discouraged. Moreover, the debate on financial innovation and regulation has to be considered in terms of potential and systematic relevance of such innovations besides the capabilities for bringing them effectively under the regulatory umbrella (Mohan, 2007). Therefore, there is a need for reform of the regulatory framework to shield the financial system from potential crises, while identifying measures to mitigate the consequences of any future episodes of financial stress. The regulatory framework will need to keep pace with the associated risks in a more rapid and effective manner. Large complex financial institutions will continue to operate in multiple jurisdictions in order to meet the needs of their large global clients, and supervision will need to be better coordinated internationally with a robust global resolution framework. In order to avoid regulatory arbitrage, there is a need for greater consistency in the regulation of similar instruments and of institutions performing similar activities, both within and across borders. In addition, capital markets will require greater emphasis on reducing counterparty risk and on ensuring that their infrastructure allows them to remain a source of funding during periods of stress. The post-crisis period is likely to be characterized by a financial system which functions with lower levels of leverage, reduced funding mismatches (both in terms of maturity and currency), less exposure to counterparty risk, and greater transparency regarding financial instruments. After credit markets recover from the crisis, it will be 6 BIS Review 72/2009 
important to mitigate the inevitable pressure to expand profits through increased risk-taking. A more developed macro-prudential approach will be important in this context. The type, size, and cross-border exposures of institutions and markets that will emerge from this crisis are likely to be considerably different from before. As banks and financial institutions consolidate, policy makers will have to adapt prudential regulation to varying degrees of size and concentration. Similarly, competition policy will be important in ensuring healthy competition. Financial institutions, markets and instruments will therefore continue to evolve in ways that pose challenges for regulation, notwithstanding the retrenchment that is currently underway. Financial institutions, policymakers, supervisors and regulators will all need to become better equipped to manage the interconnectedness of markets, both domestically and globally, the effects of innovation, and the potential for incentives to become misaligned. It will be necessary to consider the appropriate timing for changes in the regulatory framework going forward. Recommendations should promote proportionate regulatory reaction when needed, acknowledging the possible limits of the self-regulation approach in some contexts. For example, while ultimately capital buffers for the system should be enhanced during the economic expansion in order to be drawn down as needed in downturns, changes in the current environment may have negative consequences on the real economy. A considered and comprehensive review of the consequences of reforms and harmonization, coordinated across jurisdictions, is necessary to increase the effective transition to a more stable financial system (G-20, 2009). In short, the overarching mandate of reforms is to make regulatory regimes more effective over the cycle. This is related to many other issues including certain aspects of compensation schemes at financial institutions, of margin requirements and risk management practices focused on Value-at-Risk calculations based on short historical samples, of the capital adequacy framework, and of valuation and loan-loss provisioning practices. In addition, there is a need to redefine the scope of the regulatory framework in order to establish appropriate oversight for the institutions and markets that may be the source of systemic risk. Risk management also needs to be enhanced to better evaluate vulnerabilities arising from low-frequency, system-wide risks, and to better mitigate these risks. Against this broad background, this section endeavours to focus on defining the priorities for action in so far as financial regulation and supervision are concerned. Macro prudential orientation As observed, the build up of micro institutional risks has resulted in the unfolding of massive macro risk, partly through the rise in unsustainable asset prices. As a supplement to sound micro-prudential and market integrity regulation, national financial regulatory frameworks therefore should be reinforced with a macro-prudential oversight that promotes a system-wide approach to financial regulation and supervision and mitigates the build-up of observable excess risks across the system. Prudential regimes should encourage behaviour that supports systemic stability; discourages regulatory arbitrage; and adopts the concept of “systemic” risk, factoring in the effects of leverage and funding. In most jurisdictions, this will require improved coordination mechanisms between various financial authorities, mandates for all financial authorities to take account of financial system stability, and effective tools to address systemic risks. It will also require an effective global table, which is now proposed to be the Financial Stability Board, to bring together national financial authorities to jointly assess systemic risks across the global financial system and coordinate policy responses. A number of policy institutions, particularly central banks, have enhanced their analysis of systemic risks in recent years – many of the systemic vulnerabilities that caused or enhanced the current turmoil had in fact been identified – but policy mechanisms to effectively translate these analyses into policy action have been lacking. The basic idea here is to multiply the BIS Review 72/2009 7 
capital adequacy ratios with a systemic risk factor. Better measures of macro-prudential risk are to be found. It is argued that leverage ratios, maturity mismatch and estimates of bank credit expansion should be taken into account. Highly leveraged and fast growing “systemic” institutions would be subject to higher capital requirements than the rest. The idea is that when there is increasing systemic risk, with increasing leverage, maturity mismatch, credit expansion and asset price increases during boom times, banking capital required should increase, and reduce during a downturn when deleveraging takes place (Geneva Report, 2009).  Potential macroprudential tools that could be explored further could include: • Complementing risk-based capital measures with simpler indicators aimed to measure the build-up of leverage, with enhanced sensitivity to off-balance sheet exposures;  • Capital requirements that adjust over the financial cycle;  • Loan-loss provisioning standards that incorporate all available credit information;  • The use of longer historical samples to assess risk and margin requirements; and  • Greater focus on loan-to-value ratios for mortgages.  Further, the challenge is to continually endeavour to strike a balance between macro and micro prudential regulation. Regulatory regime With the emergence of the shadow banking system and other leveraged financial institutions, the scope of regulation and oversight needs to be expanded to include all systemically important institutions, markets and instruments. Accordingly, the perimeter of the financial sector surveillance would have to be extended possibly with differentiated layers to allow institutions to graduate from simple disclosures to higher levels of prudential oversight as their contribution to systemic risks increases. Financial authorities will need enhanced information on all material financial institutions and markets, including private pools of capital. Large complex financial institutions require particularly robust oversight given their size and global reach. Consideration would also need to be given to put in regulatory disincentives for such institutions to not become too big to fail. The regulatory and oversight framework should strive to treat similar institutions and activities consistently, with greater emphasis on functions and activities and less emphasis on legal status. The main bone of contention here, inter alia, is whether and how to regulate private pools of capital, including hedge funds. There have been differences with regard to the role of these funds in the current global financial crisis. Nevertheless, there is a broad agreement that private pools of capital, including hedge funds, can be a source of risk owing to their combined size in the market, their use of leverage and maturity mismatches, and their connectedness with other parts of the financial system. The widespread reliance of market participants on credit ratings of market instruments led to inadequate risk analysis by themselves. Thus, credit rating agencies (CRAs) will have to be subject to a regulatory oversight regime. Further, there is a need for modifications to a rating agency’s practices and procedures for managing conflicts of interest and for assuring the transparency and quality of the rating process, particularly on the process underlying ratings of complex securitised instruments and derivatives. Given the global scope of some credit rating agencies, the oversight framework should be consistent across jurisdictions with appropriate sharing of information between national authorities responsible for the oversight of credit rating agencies. 8 BIS Review 72/2009 
Procyclicality Once conditions in the financial system have recovered, international standards for capital and liquidity buffers will have to be enhanced, and the build-up of capital buffers and provisions in good times should be encouraged so that capital can absorb losses and be drawn down in difficult times such as the current period. It will be necessary to develop a methodology to link the stage in the business cycle to capital requirements in a non-discretionary way and to accounting and prudential standards. Many questions have also arisen on accounting conventions and procedures that are perceived to have added to procyclicality in the financial system. It should be recognised that the clock should not be turned back on Fair Value Accounting just to address the issue of temporary market illiquidity. What is needed is to make clear the nature of price uncertainty, and to do so in a manner that speaks symmetrically to the potential for mispricing in illiquid markets as much as in booming markets. Enhancements could include better guidance and principles for mark-to-market valuation, information on the variance around the fair value calculations and data on history price. Prudential oversight There are three broad areas with regard to prudential oversight that require strengthening: capital adequacy framework, liquidity risk management and infrastructure for OTC derivatives. Capital adequacy framework There is a clear need for higher quantity and quality capital resulting in minimum regulatory requirements significantly above existing Basel rules. The emphasis should be on Tier I capital. The transition to future rules should be carefully phased given the importance of maintaining bank lending in the current macroeconomic climate. Capital required against trading book activities should be increased significantly. Published accounts could also include buffers which anticipate potential future losses, through, for instance, the creation of an “Economic Cycle Reserve”. A maximum gross leverage ratio could be introduced as a backstop discipline against excessive growth in absolute balance sheet size. Further, in the context of rapid financial innovation and risk-based regulatory capital requirements, a well constructed non-risk-based capital measure can at least partially address the problem of modelling deficiencies for the advanced approaches and ensure a minimum level of capital is retained in the banking system. Liquidity risk management A new element in the future regulatory approach is explicit recognition that liquidity regulation and supervision must be recognised as of equal importance to capital regulation. Individual institutions have demonstrated that their own internal incentive structure is such that liquidity risk may be procyclical due to its links with market and credit risk, and to accelerator factors, such as the mark-to-market effects of asset values and net worth. Structural reliance on short-term wholesale market funding, including via securitization, has increased the sensitivity of banks balance sheets and cost of funds to procyclical elements. Therefore, regulatory policies need to reflect appropriately the true price of funding liquidity on financial institutions’ balance sheets – ensuring that the market does not rely excessively on the central bank emergency liquidity support facility. Areas that could be considered include • Improved funding risk management by strengthening risk management and governance and control • Introduction of minimum quantitative funding liquidity buffers of high-quality liquidity assets BIS Review 72/2009 9 
• Introduction of regulatory charge for institutions that present a higher-than-average liquidity risk and pricing of access to central bank liquidity in order to encourage institutions holding better-quality collateral. An effective global liquidity framework for managing liquidity in large, cross-border financial institutions should include internationally agreed levels of liquidity buffers, and should encourage an increase in the quality of their composition. Such a framework needs to be comprehensive and take into account liquidity needs for the overall institution. Infrastructure for OTC derivatives The explosion of credit derivatives and their offshoots (CDOs etc) has demonstrated the clear need for oversight and transparency in this market. As noted earlier, the market for credit default swaps (CDS) operates on a bilateral, over-the-counter (OTC) basis and has grown to many times the size of the market for the underlying credit instruments. In light of problems involving some large players in this market, attention has focused on the systemic risks posed by CDS. There is a global consensus on the need for a central counter party (CCP) for all the OTC derivative products and accordingly efforts are on, both in the US, EU and elsewhere to implement CCP for CDS. The development of a CCP facilitates greater market transparency, including the reporting of prices for CDS, trading volumes, and aggregate open interest. The availability of pricing information can improve the fairness, efficiency, and competitiveness of markets — all of which enhance investor protection and facilitate capital formation. The degree of transparency, of course, depends on the extent of participation in the CCP. If needed, some incentives may be provided by national authorities, for example, by taking a higher capital charge for transactions not cleared through central counterparties. In order to foster transparency and to promote the use of CCP and of exchange trading for credit derivatives, public authorities should also encourage the financial industry to standardize contracts and to use a data repository for the remaining non-standardized contracts and promote fair and open access to central counterparty services. In order to mitigate systemic risk resulting from counterparty credit risk, in the short run, it would also be beneficial for there to be a competitive environment for central counterparties without imposing regulatory requirements that unduly fragment the market. Compensation and risk management Compensation Among the issues that have gained prominence as contributory factors to the emergence of the global financial crisis is the explosion of remuneration in the financial sector, particularly in comparison with trends in the rest of the economy. Much more attention is now being given to the development of sound practice principles by the international standard setters. It is important that reforms in this regard be done on an industry-wide basis, so that improved risk management and compensation practices by some systemically important firms are not undermined by the unsound practices of others. Along with the enunciation of such principles and practices, we need to look more carefully at the inherent market incentive structure that has led to the observed compensation practices in the financial sector. Acting on this flawed incentive structure is more likely to be effective than regulatory prescriptions.  Risk management The fundamental weaknesses in risk management practices revealed in the current crisis were the inability of financial institutions to adequately monitor risk concentrations across products and geographical areas, shortcomings in stress testing and inappropriate practices for managing risks arising from structured products. First and foremost, it remains the responsibility of the private sector to take the lead in strengthening firm-wide risk 10 BIS Review 72/2009 
management frameworks. Both management and the Board of Directors are responsible for putting in place adequate risk management and control systems. Generally, banks are expected to have in place effective internal policies, systems and controls to identify, measure, monitor, manage, control and mitigate their risk concentrations in a timely manner, and under various conditions, including stressed market situations. The supervisory authorities would have to oversee compliance of such best practices for capturing firm-wide risk concentrations arising from both on- and off-balance sheet exposures and securitization activities. Transparency In recognition of the serious problems that have arisen, there is a clear need for greater emphasis on greater market transparency about the techniques, data characteristics, and the caveats involved in the valuation of complex financial instruments, improved information regarding OTC derivatives markets and clearing arrangements and reporting of exposures in a format that permits regulators to aggregate and assess risks to the system as a whole. This would help investors to perform some of the due diligence currently outsourced to CRAs, while also helping the latter to do a better job measuring the tail risks. The fundamental issue here is two fold: standard setters should work with supervisors and regulators to reduce complexity in accounting standards to facilitate better assessment of uncertainty surrounding valuation and achieve consistency of valuation methods and a single set of accounting standards. Enforcement Through the expanded Financial Stability Forum, now renamed as Financial Stability Board, the International Monetary Fund and the international standard setters, international standards, including those for macro-prudential regulation, the scope of regulation, capital adequacy and liquidity buffers, should be coordinated to ensure a common and coherent international framework, which national financial authorities should apply in their countries consistent with national circumstances. The financial regulatory and oversight frameworks and their implementation in all G-20 countries should be reviewed periodically, validated internationally and made public. IV.  The challenges ahead The agenda that is being developed for strengthening of financial sector regulation and supervision is ambitious. Contentious issues will arise both at domestic/national regulatory levels and at the international levels on regulatory cooperation. Whereas the principles that have been outlined for this regulatory overhaul are being increasingly well accepted, many challenges will arise on their modes of implementation, and their practicality. The first issue is that the various proposals that will lead to increased levels of regulatory capital over the economic cycle, and extension of such capital requirements on bank like institutions that are currently unregulated or lightly regulated, will inevitably lead to lower profitability for equity investors. The bargaining power of banking institutions has become weak in the current circumstances and hence there is little observable protest regarding these proposals at present. As the financial crisis is resolved, and normalcy returns, we can expect the financial industry will do its utmost to resist the requirements for higher capital at that time. It will be a challenge for regulators and governments to resist demands for relaxation of the new capital requirements, both the enhanced minimum levels and the capital buffers proposed in good times. The lobbying power of the financial industry will be restored by that time and hence authorities will need to be prepared for such challenges. Lower systemic profitability levels will also be effective endogenously in limiting compensation levels in the financial sector. BIS Review 72/2009 11 
Second, the proposal for provision of contra-cyclical capital will face significant implementation issues. Regulators will need to do significant technical work in the understanding of business cycles so that turning points can be recognised. What would be the triggers for changes in these capital buffers in either direction? Would these changes kick-in in anticipation of business cycle turns or post facto? How formation or rule-based would these changes be so that regulated institutions know in advance themselves what they need to do? An additional issue in this sphere arises from the possibility of economic cycles occurring at different times in different jurisdictions. This would necessitate greater cross border cooperation between home and host regulators in terms of applicable capital requirements for different segments of the same international financial conglomerate. An additional problem for EMEs would be the lack of adequate data for business cycle identification. Third, there is general agreement on macro prudential regulations and the identification of systemic risks like the build up of asset bubbles. However, considerable technical work will need to be done at both national and international levels on identifying what such risks are, what is systemic and what is not, and what kind of regulatory actions would be effective. In the recent experience, for example, there was ample awareness of the build up of both global financial imbalances, and of the asset price bubble, but there was little agreement on what needed to be done. Even if adequate work is done on the identification of systemic risk, and on the regulatory measures necessary, what will be the enforcement methodology internationally. Within national regulatory systems, issues relating to inter-regulatory cooperation will also arise, who will be in-charge of issuing early warning systems and who will listen to them? Fourth, there is general agreement on the extension of regulation on all systemically important institutions, markets and instruments. Here again there is an issue of implementation. How do we decide what is systemically important? Considerable debate has ranged around the regulation of hedge funds, which come in all sizes, shapes and forms. Some are large, but not leveraged, others can be both large and leveraged, and yet others can be small and leveraged or otherwise. Whereas it may be that individual hedge funds or other equity pools are not systemically important, they may be so collectively. Furthermore, they could be collectively not important systemically in good times, but become so in times of extensive leveraging. Similar is the story for markets and instruments. Thus the work of national and international regulatory system is cut out in this regard. Excessive regulation could indeed snuff out entrepreneurship if not done carefully. Fifth, a great deal of debate has emerged around the issue of securitised credit and its offshoots. Very clearly, financial innovations in this area have been unproductive and dysfunctional and will need to be discouraged. Once again, however, securitisation is a time honoured methodology that has done much to lubricate the financial system and helped funding real economy needs at competitive costs. How these instruments are regulated and how “good” financial innovations will be winnowed from the “bad” will be a challenge. Sixth, as the current global crisis has shown, whereas many of the large complex financial institutions are global in nature, their regulation is national. Considerable discussion is now ongoing on how international regulatory cooperation can be enhanced. Apart from the regulatory problems associated with ongoing institutions, even more difficult are the problems associated with cross border resolution of failing institutions. The discussion on these issues has just began. Seventh, from the point of view of Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), at the macro level, the volatility in capital flows has led to severe problems in both macro management and financial regulation (CGFS, 2009). These capital flows have been influenced significantly by the extant monetary policy regimes in developed countries and hence their volatility is not necessarily related to economic conditions in the receiving economies. Excess flows, sudden 12 BIS Review 72/2009 
stops and reversals have significant effects on EME financial sectors, the working of their capital markets, and asset prices, and hence their economies as a whole. Management of this volatility involves action in monetary policy, fiscal management, capital account management, and also financial market regulation. This will remain a challenge since there is little international discussion on this issue. Finally, in response to the crisis, monetary policy has been loosened substantially in major advanced economies since the second half of 2007. Policy rates have been cut to near zero levels, even lower than that in 2003-04, and the financial systems have been flooded with large liquidity. Abundant liquidity, if not withdrawn quickly, runs the risk of inducing the same excesses and imbalances that were witnessed during 2003-07. Excess liquidity could also take the form of large capital flows to the EMEs and their likely recycling back to the advanced economies. As the global economy starts recovery, a calibrated exit from this unprecedented accommodative monetary policy will have to be ensured to avoid the recurrence of the financial crisis being experienced now. To summarise, the emergence of the global financial crisis has led to a new wave of thinking on all issues related to both monetary policy and financial regulation. Whereas considerable progress has been achieved on the principles governing this regulatory overhaul, very significant challenges remain on the implementation issues that will arise as we move into a new regime globally.

Jürgen Stark: The economic crisis and the response of fiscal and monetary policy Speech by Mr Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Austrian Industrial Organisation, Linz, 8 June 2009. *      *      * Introduction Following the default of Lehman Brothers in mid-September last year, the turmoil in financial markets which had started in August 2007 turned into a major financial crisis. Liquidity dried up, and credit flows to the economy slowed down. Problems in the financial system quickly spilled over to the real economy, and an adverse feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector emerged. This has led to the most severe and synchronised global economic downturn for 80 years. The euro area has not been spared. Economic activity has declined sharply, and inflation is at its lowest level since the launch of the euro.  Monetary and fiscal authorities across the globe have responded quickly and decisively to these extraordinary developments. In particular, against the background of rapidly receding inflationary pressures and risks, the Eurosystem has taken monetary policy and liquidity management measures that were unprecedented in nature, scope and timing. Since October last year we have reduced the interest rate on the main refinancing operations by 325 basis points. We have also provided unlimited liquidity support to the banking system in the euro area to maintain the flow of credit. Likewise, governments in the euro area have reacted swiftly to stabilise the financial system and to counteract the adverse impact of the financial crisis on the real economy.  Looking ahead, both monetary and fiscal authorities will need to remain credible and effective, and to fulfil their respective responsibilities. In so doing, they will lay solid foundations for future economic recovery and long-term economic growth and job creation. The crisis has shown how important it is to have an independent central bank firmly committed to the objective of price stability. At the same time, governments must make a strong and credible commitment to a path of fiscal consolidation and thus comply with the Stability and Growth Pact. But they must also resist the temptation to further increase the size of the stimulus measures, as this could erode trust in the sustainability of public finances and undermine the effectiveness of the measures already adopted.  In my presentation today, I would like first to analyse the economic outlook and then discuss in more detail the policy measures taken in response to the crisis. I will then consider their implications and the lessons to be drawn from the crisis for central banks and monetary policy.  Economic outlook a.  Global economic situation Let me begin with the assessment of the global economic situation. The turmoil in financial markets, which was triggered by a systematic under-pricing of risk, particularly in the US sub-prime mortgage market, has now developed into a fully-fledged financial and economic crisis at global level.  While the world economy continues to face a severe and synchronised downturn, recent international business confidence indicators suggest that the pace of the decline in economic activity is slowing down somewhat. Most forecasters expect that the global economy is likely to recover in 2010, albeit at a gradual pace. The June 2009 Eurosystem staff BIS Review 72/2009 1 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which have just been published, are in line with this overall assessment. They are based on the assumption that the global economy outside the euro area will contract by 1.6% this year grow and by 2.1% in 2010. Nonetheless, the economic prospects remain fraught with uncertainty. Compared with a few months ago, overall risks to global economic growth have become more balanced. A stronger positive confidence effect than expected triggered by the monetary and fiscal policy measures could lead to a more sustained recovery in global demand and in global trade, and a quicker normalisation of financial market and credit conditions. Of course, if global policy actions fail to strike an appropriate balance between economic stimulus and longer-term sustainability, financial market conditions could turn unfavourable again. Global inflation rates have continued to diminish rapidly. This is mainly due to lower commodity prices, weaker labour market conditions and greater global economic slack. Risks to global inflation seem to be broadly balanced in the short to medium term. Beyond that horizon, however, inflation risks depend on how efficiently the authorities withdraw the policy stimulus. b.  Euro area activity  In line with global developments, economic activity in the euro area has also contracted sharply since the second half of 2008. The euro area economy has shrunk by about 4% over the past two quarters, the worst decline since the start of Economic and Monetary Union.  For the current quarter, there is evidence that the economy has shrunk further, though at a slower pace. The economy is no longer in free fall; we are seeing the first signs of stabilisation. Indicators of consumer confidence and business sentiment have continued to improve somewhat. We are also seeing some encouraging signs of normalisation in financial markets.  Looking ahead, the euro area economy is likely to be very weak for the remainder of this year, before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. The Eurosystem staff projections for real GDP growth are broadly in line with the most recent forecasts from the IMF and the European Commission. Both institutions expect the euro area economy to contract by 4% or more in 2009, followed by a gradual recovery in 2010. Quarterly growth rates are expected to return to positive levels by mid-2010. The projected gradual recovery reflects the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way and the measures taken to make the financial system function normally both inside and outside the euro area.  c.  Euro area price developments Inflation in the euro area has declined rapidly since it reached its highest level, 4%, last summer. In May, euro area HICP inflation was down to 0.0%, according to the preliminary estimate from Eurostat. This is the lowest number registered since the launch of the euro. The rapid decline over this period is primarily due to the marked fall in global commodity prices, and particularly oil prices. If we exclude food and energy, however, HICP inflation over the past year has moderated only marginally. In April, the most recent month for which we have data, HICP inflation excluding food and energy was 1.8%. Inflation rates are likely to enter negative territory during the summer, but we expect them to turn positive by the end of 2009. This can largely be explained by base effects from energy prices. These effects are of no concern to the ECB, which aims to maintain price stability in the medium term. In other words, its monetary policy strategy aims to ensure that short-term volatility in inflation rates does not lead to volatility in long-term inflation expectations. It is important not to confuse the temporarily negative inflation rates we are likely to experience this summer with outright deflation. Let me remind you of the difference: a deflationary process is a persistent, broad-based and self-sustaining fall in the overall price 2 BIS Review 72/2009 
level. It is reinforced by the anticipation that prices will decline further in the future. As a consequence, inflation expectations become disanchored and negative, and firms and households may decide to postpone investments and major purchases. In fact, what we are experiencing at the moment can be described as a period of rapid disinflation. This is linked to transitory movements in relative prices and is in principle a welcome development. Provided that medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with price stability, low or negative inflation rates for a short period of time may help to sustain real income and may therefore stimulate spending. But even if we expect inflation rates to turn positive again by the end of this year, the weak economic outlook for the euro area is expected to keep domestic price pressures contained for some time. According to the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, HICP inflation in the euro area is likely to be very moderate, but above zero, on average this year. Inflation is expected to pick up, but remain at a moderate level in 2010. Forecasts produced by the European Commission and other international organisations paint a similar picture. The risks to this outlook are viewed as broadly balanced. However, in the longer term, it is important that the current policy stimulus is withdrawn in due course. d.  Monetary and financing conditions Let me now turn to the monetary analysis, which is particularly useful for assessing risks to price stability in the medium to long term. The latest money and credit data support the assessment of diminishing inflationary pressures in the medium term. The deceleration of broad money growth observed in 2008 increased towards the turn of the year and continues at a rapid pace. Developments in money and credit aggregates have been volatile over the past few months. This may be explained partly by the sharp reduction in the key ECB interest rates, which may have encouraged shifts in the allocation of funds. If we disregard this volatility, the continued deceleration in the pace of underlying monetary expansion and in credit growth seems to reflect the sharp deterioration in economic activity.  As regards financing conditions in the euro area, external financing costs have been declining since October last year, and particularly sharply since the start of this year. Following policy interest rate cuts, bank lending rates have fallen significantly. This indicates that the pass-through mechanism from policy rates to the real economy has continued to function in recent months, even though there is evidence that banks’ margins have widened. With credit spreads across all rating classes decreasing from their record highs and with stock prices rising, the overall cost of financing for euro area non-financial corporations is diminishing. In general, the recent positive signs from financial markets point to a gradual improvement in confidence among investors. Policy measures I will now turn to the policy measures taken in response to the current crisis. Both monetary and fiscal policy-makers have reacted in a forceful and timely manner, aiming to restore confidence. And indeed, as regards the Eurosystem’s monetary policy and liquidity management measures, it seems that our responses are bearing fruit. Confidence has returned to financial markets, and business surveys are picking up. I expect global and domestic demand to increasingly benefit from the significant economic stimulus and the measures taken so far to bring the financial system back to normal functioning. Monetary policy The ECB has acted in a timely, decisive and appropriate manner since the start of the financial market turmoil. We have cut our key policy rate by 325 basis points since last October, when the escalating financial crisis led to a rapid decline of inflationary pressures. BIS Review 72/2009 3 
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations now stands at 1.0%, its lowest level since the launch of the euro. This level is appropriate taking into account all information and analyses. Money market rates have fallen even further to record lows, and the loan interest rates charged by banks have declined. Our substantive monetary policy easing is already being felt in the real economy.  In addition to lowering the policy interest rate quickly and sharply, we have resorted to highly non-standard liquidity operations in order to provide the financial system with the liquidity that was so urgently needed. Last October, we adopted a “fixed-rate full allotment” procedure in all our open market operations. This gives banks as much central bank liquidity as they want at our key policy interest rate, against an expanded list of eligible collateral. Coupled with the fact that essentially all financially sound euro area credit institutions can participate in the Eurosystem's refinancing operations, these measures have significantly eased the banks’ balance sheet constraints, thereby avoiding a sudden stop in the supply of credit and the emergence of a systemic crisis.  At the Governing Council meeting in early May, we decided to extend the maturity range of these liquidity-providing operations from six to 12 months. Furthermore, we decided that the Eurosystem will purchase euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area. Last week we announced the details of this purchase programme. These decisions were taken to enhance credit support to the economy through banks. More specifically, all these measures aim to promote the ongoing decline in money market term rates, to encourage banks to maintain and expand their lending to clients, to improve market liquidity in important segments of the private debt security market, and to ease funding conditions for banks and enterprises. These measures take into account the central role played by the euro area banking system in financing the economy. This contrasts with the financial structure of other economic regions.  The above-mentioned measures led to a significant increase in the Eurosystem’s balance sheet: it reached a peak of 19% of GDP in December 2008 from 10% of GDP in mid-2007, up by €850 billion. This increase in the size of the balance sheet corresponds to a higher level of outstanding refinancing operations, and has consequently increased the amount of risk borne by the Eurosystem. Since its peak in December, the size of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet has declined by around €300 billion to 15% of GDP in May 2009. This decline suggests a gradual increase in money market activity, at least for very short maturities. The fact that we have taken on additional risk is no coincidence. Whenever liquidity dries up because market participants are reluctant to lend to each other, the central bank has to step in, but at the same time not put its reputation at risk.  To summarise, we have employed a wide range of measures to counter the effect of the financial and economic crisis. The approach we have followed has been tailored to the needs of the euro area, where the banking system plays a more important role in financing than in other major economies. These differences are important for the implementation and transmission of monetary policy, and therefore the Eurosystem’s reactions to the crisis cannot be compared directly with those of other leading central banks. Fiscal policy measures  Let me now turn to the fiscal policy reaction to the economic crisis. Fiscal authorities in the euro area have demonstrated their willingness and capacity to act rapidly and in a coordinated manner in exceptional circumstances. It is important to distinguish between measures intended to support the banking sector and fiscal policy measures aimed at stimulating demand.  4 BIS Review 72/2009 
Support for the banking sector Government support for the banking sector was necessary; it has safeguarded the stability of the financial system. The price of this success, however, is that governments have incurred substantial fiscal costs and credit risks that are ultimately borne by taxpayers. Following the adoption of a concerted European action plan on 12 October 2008, euro area governments announced national measures to support the banking sector. These measures consist of government guarantees for interbank lending, recapitalisation of financial institutions in difficulty, increase the coverage of retail deposit insurance and asset relief schemes. Overall, euro area governments committed about 23% of euro area GDP to financial sector support measures.  For the euro area, the various support measures adopted so far are expected to have only a small direct impact on government deficits, whereas the impact on debt is expected to be about 3% of GDP. Finally, contingent liabilities related to the financial rescue measures are expected to be about 8% of GDP, excluding government guarantees on retail deposits. These figures, however, do not reflect the very different developments taking place across euro area countries.  Between end-September and end-October 2008, concurrent to the announcement of the broad-based bank rescue packages, an adverse shift in market sentiment towards sovereign borrowers occurred. It became more expensive to insure against the default of euro area countries, and this change of mood was reflected in significantly higher sovereign CDS premia for euro area countries. This would suggest that the bank rescue packages brought about an increase in public sector credit risk.  At the same time, long-term government bond yield spreads vis-à-vis Germany have widened substantially for most euro area countries. These spreads mainly reflect perceptions of differing liquidity and credit risk among countries. The fact that developments in government bond yield spreads have mirrored higher sovereign CDS premia suggests that concerns about fiscal sustainability have become an important factor, affecting investors’ perceptions. In particular, government bond yield spreads seem to be higher in those Member States regarded as particularly vulnerable in the current environment. Among the relevant factors are current fiscal imbalances, but also external imbalances, and they could ultimately have repercussions on the general government budget. Past fiscal behaviour may also play a role.  Rising long-term government bond yields may only have a gradual impact on government borrowing costs, as changes in interest rates only affect the cost of newly issued debt and debt at variable interest rates. However, they may signal both a reduced willingness on the part of investors to provide long-term funding as well as difficulty in accessing capital market funds. So far, most euro area countries have enjoyed relatively low interest rates on new government debt issuance, despite facing considerably more difficult market conditions. Looking ahead, as the economy recovers and competition for financing increases, governments may face higher bond yields again.  Discretionary use of fiscal policy  In addition to providing financial support to the banking sector, euro area governments reacted forcefully to counter the negative impact of the financial turmoil on the real economy. Besides the operation of automatic stabilisers, which provide a significant cushion to the euro area economy by way of lower tax revenues and higher spending on unemployment benefits, the discretionary use of fiscal policy helped to mitigate the effects of the global economic downturn. However, fiscal stimulus measures need to remain temporary and be combined with measures that ensure fiscal sustainability over the medium run. This will preserve trust in the sustainability of public finances and support both the recovery and long-term economic growth. BIS Review 72/2009 5 
For 2009 and 2010, the European Commission estimates the overall fiscal impulse to the euro area economy, as measured by the change in the general government deficit, to be about 4.6% of GDP, 60% of which is due to the automatic stabilisers. While the recent coordinated fiscal loosening has been broadly accepted as a legitimate and necessary step in the short run, given the exceptional economic circumstances, it also entails a significant fiscal burden. The latest available economic forecasts (EC Spring 2009 Economic Forecasts) point to dramatic developments in euro area public finances. In addition to a rapidly deteriorating general government deficit, which is expected to be above 6% of euro area GDP in 2010, the euro area debt ratio will increase by about 15 percentage points to above 80% of GDP by 2010. In both 2009 and 2010 13 out of 16 euro area countries are expected to have a budget deficit above the 3% of GDP reference value.  These figures are very high, though they compare favourably with other major economic regions that have also provided a substantial fiscal impulse to their economy. The budget deficit in both the United Kingdom and the United States is projected to be about 14% of GDP in 2010, whereas in Japan it is projected to be about 9% of GDP.  Against this backdrop, euro area countries must reject calls for additional fiscal loosening. In the current environment, any further fiscal stimulus is likely to be counterproductive as it could hamper the economic recovery in two ways. First of all, even higher fiscal deficits could fuel market concerns about a country’s ability to meet its future debt obligations, thus putting upward pressure on interest rates. Second, increasing budget deficits would also raise concerns about a higher tax burden in the future, thus inducing consumers to save rather than spend any additional income.  Let me now turn to two important questions regarding the fiscal authorities’ response to the economic crisis. First, do the measures have the potential to restore confidence? Second, are those measures effective?  The financial sector support measures, combined with the Eurosystem’s enhanced credit support measures, were successful in safeguarding the stability of the financial system. Together, these initiatives have the potential to tackle the crisis of confidence at its root also by taking into account the fundamental role of the banking sector in the functioning of the economy. The restructuring of the banking sector is the top policy priority, and progress in this domain is the key to economic recovery. Given the challenges which lie ahead, banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen their capital base and, where necessary, take full advantage of government support and in particular recapitalisation measures. As regards fiscal policy response, let me first say that the merits of discretionary measures are less obvious than those safeguarding the functioning of the financial system. In principle, automatic stabilisers should represent the first line of defence during an economic downturn. However, under exceptional circumstances and if a country has room for manoeuvre, fiscal policy can contribute to macroeconomic stability also through discretionary actions. When assessing the merits of the different measures taken, we should differentiate between measures such as (1) expenditure increases and (2) tax cuts, and (3) measures like guarantees and loan subsidies to specific sectors of the economy. In fact, although support for credit-constrained firms could ease their access to credit and the restructuring of their balance sheets, it may also lead to an inefficient allocation of capital and the propping up of companies that would otherwise fail. Moreover, this type of support would be difficult to reverse and might act as a brake on long-term growth. Turning to the effectiveness of fiscal measures to stimulate demand (i.e. spending increases and tax cuts), it crucially depends on the behaviour of economic agents, and that in turn also affects the size of the fiscal multipliers (i.e. the GDP effect of fiscal stimulus measures). The expectation that higher government spending today may lead to higher taxation in the future would induce both households and firms to save rather spend any additional income, thus reducing the size of the fiscal multiplier. Therefore, the public perception of overall fiscal sustainability plays an important role in the impact of the respective national fiscal stimuli. 6 BIS Review 72/2009 
The effectiveness of fiscal stimulus measures also depends on the extent to which private investors respond positively to tax policy, with their investments likely to be more responsive in the case of “temporary” tax breaks, as they provide an incentive to bring forward future investment plans. At the same time, there is a risk that fiscal stimulus measures may crowd out private investment by putting upward pressure on interest rates.  As regards the size of the fiscal multiplier, empirical studies (e.g. Perotti (2002), Blanchard and Perotti (2002), IMF WEO (2008)) show that in the short term (i.e. after one quarter) public spending multipliers are larger than tax multipliers. By contrast, in the long term, revenue measures are associated with higher growth and faster recoveries. These results reflect the theoretical Keynesian prediction that some of the higher disposable income from a tax cut is saved, while government purchases of goods and services directly affect the aggregate demand. However, the evidence on the relative effectiveness of the different measures is mixed. For the euro area, the measures adopted by governments are estimated to have a short-lived impact on real GDP growth, limited to the year in which they are introduced.  Besides these factors, the effectiveness of any stimulus package will depend to a large extent on its design and implementation. Fiscal stimulus measures should be “timely, temporary and targeted”. “Timely” means that the measures take effect when they are needed; any delays in assessing the cyclical situation, in taking decisions and implementing the measures may fail to prevent a drop in output. “Temporary” implies that the fiscal impulse should only last as long as the recession in question. “Targeted” relates to the expected size of the multiplier effect. In addition to these “TTT” criteria, the measures should be consistent with other policy objectives such as fiscal sustainability, long-term economic growth and the functioning of the market mechanism. Implications of policy measures The current crisis has increased the role of the government in the economy. Some bank rescue operations have involved outright nationalisations, so governments now have significant exposure to the financial sector. Similarly, the large fiscal stimuli packages adopted by many countries have led to a large increase in the size of the public sector in the economy.  At the same time, the turmoil is being interpreted by some as a crisis of the market economy. It has encouraged critics of the market economy to speak out and demand a much larger role in the economy for governments. The financial system clearly needs a fundamental overhaul. Financial institutions have to take a different approach and adopt appropriate incentives. Risk-takers should be liable and not only reap the rewards of their actions but also bear responsibility for their consequences. We need to strengthen the regulation of the financial system, and in particular, we must improve the international cooperation between national supervisors of the financial sector. But let me hasten to add that policy-makers must not get carried away by recent events; they should act in a measured way, and not throw the baby out with the bathwater. While governments have had no alternative but to support systemically relevant financial institutions, they should, as a rule, keep their assistance to specific sectors or firms to a minimum. And when they do intervene, they should prepare clear and credible exit strategies. No matter how serious the current crisis is, the market economy remains the best way to organise our economic affairs. It is only 20 years ago since the breakdown of the socialist system in eastern Europe, which demonstrated the failures of central planning and heavy government involvement. Therefore, once we emerge from the current crisis, the role of government in the economy needs to be scaled back. Its presence in the banking sector must be gradually reduced as the restructuring of the sector starts to take effect. The stimulus measures must be reversed in due course. We have seen in the past how so-called temporary measures ended up being permanent. BIS Review 72/2009 7 
An exit strategy is a comprehensive programme to withdraw and neutralise measures taken during the financial crisis, without causing any harm to the economy. If they have no well-defined exit strategy, governments may get bogged down and the positive impact of the measures taken may be undermined. A well thought-out exit strategy is needed to reassure economic agents that a timely restoration of the level playing field in the different sectors of the economy is the ultimate objective. As such, an exit strategy needs to contain clear criteria about the timing of the withdrawal of the financial support and the reversal of the fiscal stimuli. In principle, the extra government debt incurred by asset acquisition should be covered by future sales of these assets. The state guarantees should serve to stabilise the banking system and would then not need to be called on.  As to the fiscal stimuli, euro area governments did not lay out clear exit strategies when they announced the stimuli. Some of their measures do not expire automatically or are not explicitly designed to be temporary. The possible difficulties of reversing the fiscal stimulus packages may hinder the return to sound fiscal positions in the short run. Under these circumstances, the peer pressure mechanism, on which the EU fiscal framework is based, may be weakened thus making more difficult a return to sound fiscal policies. As a matter of fact, countries with high fiscal deficits may be tempted not to put political pressure on their peers. Protracted excessive deficits may undermine the credibility of the EU fiscal framework, thus casting doubts on fiscal sustainability and jeopardising the Stability and Growth Pact.  In this respect, let me say that the current crisis has taught us an important lesson about the importance of preserving the public’s trust in the soundness of public finances. At the current juncture, euro area governments must make credible commitments to return to sound fiscal policies. Doing so in full compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact is the most credible exit strategy. This requires, first, a full reversal of the fiscal stimulus measures taken so far. This is necessary to ensure an efficient allocation of resources by minimising distortions in the incentives of economic agents and by avoiding a permanent increase in the size of the public sector. Second, governments must live up to their commitment to maintain fiscal discipline. This means that credible fiscal consolidation plans have to be implemented as early as possible, including a consolidation effort of at least 1% of GDP per annum where necessary. If euro area countries do not practise fiscal restraint seriously, the debt dynamics will be in danger of spiralling out of control. The current crisis has shown how important it is for countries to consolidate during good economic times and to build a “fiscal reservoir” from which they can draw in periods of “drought”. Many euro area countries failed to do so. They suddenly found themselves in this turbulent environment burdened by high fiscal deficits and debt ratios. Their room for fiscal manoeuvre was very limited, as was their capacity to adopt effective counter-cyclical measures when they were most needed. In addition, the developments in government bond yield spreads since last autumn have shown that, in uncertain times, financial markets increasingly discriminate between countries on the basis of their creditworthiness, including fiscal fundamentals.  We are seeing the first, timid signs of an economic recovery; investors are regaining their appetite for risk. It is critical that euro area governments boost confidence in the soundness of public finances as an element to support both the recovery and long-term economic growth. As regards monetary policy, it is equally important to draw up a strategy for withdrawing in due course the extraordinary measures that have been implemented or announced. The ECB obviously cannot maintain the current degree of support indefinitely. We are providing substantial short-term support to the financial system and the real economy, and thereby ultimately maintaining price stability. But what if macroeconomic conditions warrant a removal of monetary stimulus? 8 BIS Review 72/2009 
In fact, we are prepared to take appropriate actions once the macroeconomic environment improves. We will ensure that the measures taken can be quickly unwound and the liquidity provided absorbed. This includes, for instance, unwinding the increase in the average maturity of our refinancing operations. Being prepared to exit from our non-standard measures – as soon as the macroeconomic conditions justify such a move – helps to maintain price stability over the medium term and to ensure a firm anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations.  Any changes in the operational framework will of course be communicated in good time. The ECB and the Eurosystem remain committed to pursuing a timely and transparent communication policy.  Likewise, the financial sector needs to live up to its responsibilities and not to become dependent on long-term funding through the ECB’s refinancing operations. It is important that the financial sector also helps to restore confidence among banks. Japan, since the early 1990s, has exemplified the economic damage that can result from not promptly restructuring an ailing financial system.  Some earlier attempts by policy-makers to stimulate the economy during downturns were ineffective and only led to higher inflation. The 1970s come to mind, when the surge in oil prices led to persistently high inflation and lower economic growth. Unsurprisingly, some people have been wondering if the exceptional measures taken by central banks and fiscal authorities during the current crisis will result in another period of high inflation. But the situation today is very different from the 1970s. The Eurosystem’s objective is to maintain price stability in the medium term, and nothing else. All our monetary policy decisions since the financial crisis erupted have been taken in order to safeguard price stability in a symmetric way. Maintaining price stability will remain the only objective that guides our decisions. This implies that the very accommodative monetary policy stance we are pursuing now will be reversed once the economy starts to recover and upside risks to price stability emerge again. The people of the euro area can trust our commitment to deliver price stability because they know we are independent and not subject to outside influence.  Lessons for monetary policy from the crisis Let me now turn to the most important lessons I think we can draw from the current crisis with respect to monetary policy. I would like to raise three points.  First of all, the current crisis demonstrates, once again, how important it is for central banks to remain independent of political influence. Even if we are experiencing the worst economic downturn since the 1930s, long-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored in line with the ECB’s definition of price stability. This represents the strongest and most reassuring protection against a deflationary spiral, and it is the result of market agents trusting our commitment and ability to deliver price stability. Our independence, our clear mandate and our precise definition of price stability have been crucial factors in maintaining inflation expectations firmly anchored during these challenging times. Secondly, although central banks may be charged with additional tasks in the aftermath of the crisis, their primary objective must remain the maintenance of price stability. We cannot allow any conflicts of interest to arise. The high-level expert group headed by Jacques de Larosière, former Governor of the Bank of France and Managing Director of the IMF, has identified a number of weaknesses in the supervisory framework both inside and outside Europe that contributed to the build-up of the current crisis. One of the group’s proposals is to give the ECB more responsibility for so-called macro-prudential supervision. This means supervision that aims to limit the risk of distress in the financial system as a whole, but does not extend to supervision of individual financial institutions.  Building on the de Larosière report, the European Commission has recently proposed to establish a European Systemic Risk Council (ESRC), chaired by the ECB President. BIS Review 72/2009 9 
The ECB welcomes the Commission’s proposal. Establishing the ESRC will substantially improve the present institutional arrangements for risk assessment at EU level. Much of the work that will be done by the ESRC also be useful for assessing risks to price stability. But I would also like to stress that maintaining price stability must remain the primary objective of the Eurosystem. With only one tool at our disposal – the interest rate – we cannot achieve more than one objective. Therefore, it is particularly important for any risk warnings from the new Council to be translated into policy action by the responsible authorities as effectively as possible. The ECB cannot use its policy interest rate to mitigate risks that are not directly related to price stability. At the same time, price stability is the best contribution we can make to financial stability.  My third point concerns the important role played by monetary analysis – and in particular the role of asset prices – when assessing the risks to price stability over the medium term. Price stability is our primary objective, but this does not imply that we only focus on short to medium-term movements in inflation. Any build-up of financial imbalances which could pose risks to price stability in the longer term could be overlooked under a restrictive short-term approach. The ECB’s assessment of risks to price stability is well equipped to detect these types of risk as it is based on a comprehensive economic and monetary analysis – its well-known two-pillar strategy. The first pillar, the economic analysis, is common to most central banks. This analysis basically consists of identifying risks to price stability in the short to medium term by analysing the interplay between aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the economy. The second pillar, the monetary analysis, plays a more prominent role at the ECB than at other central banks. The ECB pays special attention to monetary developments in recognition of the fact that monetary growth and inflation are closely related in the medium to long term. Analysing developments in credit, and in particular loans to the private sector, is helpful in extracting the relevant signals from the monetary developments. This analysis also implies a regular monitoring of asset price developments and their implications. This analysis will become even more prominent in the future. The ECB has been a pioneer when it comes to monetary analysis, and with the benefit of hindsight, we can say that the monetary analysis served us well in recent years. Back in 2005, the monetary analysis was already indicating upward risks to price stability coming from strong growth in money and credit, driven by a rapid increase in asset prices, and house prices in particular. This led us to increase interest rates in a series of steps starting in December 2005, at a time when the economic analysis was providing more mixed signals. The decision to tighten monetary policy at an early stage may be one reason why financial imbalances in the euro area did not develop as far as in some other countries.  Conclusion  To conclude, let me summarise my main points. The world economy is in its worst recession since the 1930s, and the euro area economy is no exception. The fiscal and monetary authorities have responded forcefully and their efforts are slowly starting to bear fruit. The pace of the economic contraction appears to be slowing down, and confidence indicators have improved somewhat. The crisis has highlighted the importance of sound public finances. Governments need to consolidate during good economic times in order to have room for manoeuvre during not-so-good times.  With respect to monetary policy, the crisis has demonstrated the importance of having an independent central bank credibly committed to price stability. The pre-crisis years also showed the usefulness of the monetary analysis, the second pillar in the Eurosystem’s assessment of risks to price stability. In particular, it helped to maintain a medium-term perspective. 10 BIS Review 72/2009 
Looking ahead, the fiscal and monetary authorities have an important role in sustaining the economic recovery. Governments must devise and enact credible strategies to exit from the banking sector and to ensure that the discretionary policy measures adopted during the crisis will be reversed. Their full compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact is the best tool to solidly anchor market expectations. Furthermore, the ECB’s commitment to maintaining price stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make to sustaining economic recovery and long-term economic growth.  The ECB is well prepared to take appropriate action and also to exit from its non-standard monetary policy and liquidity management measures in a credible manner once the macroeconomic environment improves.  Most importantly, we will continue to deliver on what we are expected to deliver, which is to maintain price stability, and to provide an anchor of confidence in difficult times.

Ewald Nowotny: Austria’s role in the international financial system Speech by Mr Ewald Nowotny, Governor of the Austrian National Bank, to representatives of official Austrian institutions, New York, 28 April 2009. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, It is my pleasure to speak to such a distinguished audience tonight on Austria’s role in the international financial system. Essentially, I would like to give you a brief overview on the key figures of the Austrian financial market and elaborate in more detail on the historical chances Austrian banks have found in Eastern Europe since the fall of the iron curtain. Then I would like to talk about the consequences of the current crisis for Austria, and the policy measures which have already been taken to stabilize the situation in Europe in general and in my country in particular. Finally, I want to share some ideas with you on how we might prevent such a crisis in the future.   The most significant difference between the financial market in Austria and the U.S.A. – next to the difference in sheer size, which is hard to ignore – is the structural importance of banks for financing the private sector in Austria, whereas the financial system in the US is a lot more market-based. This difference is probably most visibly reflected in the volume of outstanding bank loans to the private sector, which currently amounts to 120% of GDP in Austria and to only 60% in the U.S.A. On the other hand, the market capitalization of the stock exchange is 140% in the U.S.A. and only 60% in Austria.  BIS Review79/2009 1 
 The assets of Austrian banks have been increasing steadily over the last decade, and in 2008 they exceeded 1 trillion euro for the first time; banks assets amounted up to 373% of the Austrian GDP. This expansion was supported by the increase in foreign assets, which accounted for 361 billion euro in 2008 or 128% of GDP. More than half of the foreign assets of Austrian banks were located in Central and Eastern Europe (some 200 billion), thereof ¾ in EU Member States. 2 BIS Review 79/2009 
Austrian banks in Eastern Europe   The end of communism in Europe in 1989 and the transition of Central and Eastern European economies provided Austrian banks with a historic opportunity. To that very moment, their business had been more domestically oriented, but all of a sudden the demand for banking services was increasing tremendously in their closest neighborhood. Over night, Austria changed from being a frontier state of the cold war and became a hub of European integration. To show you how close many of the newly emerging opportunities were located, let me give you some comparisons: Vienna is no further from Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, than Stamford1  is from New York; getting to Budapest, the capital of Hungary, from Vienna is like getting to Albany for you; Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is as far as Boston; and Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, as far as Washington. The proximity together with cultural similarities and a shared history gave Austrian banks some advantages on these new markets, and they did not miss their chance. Their strategy for the years after 1989 clearly was: Go east! The engagement of Austrian banks in the Central and Eastern European countries has been very successful, and it has been beneficial for all parties involved – and even for some uninvolved. For Austrian banks, the investments in the region proved to be highly profitable and contributed most favorably to their earnings over the past years.                                                  1  Stamford, Connecticut, is part of the New York metropolitan area and hosts a cluster of corporate headquarters, many of which moved from New York in the 1980s both to lower their tax bill and to be closer to the homes of their top executives. BIS Review79/2009 3 
  At the beginning of the transition in Central and Eastern Europe the domestic financial corporations in these countries were unable to fund the elevated rates of economic growth sustainably; in some cases, banks as we know them hardly existed. Even ten years after the beginning of transition, the ratio of private credit to GDP was much lower in these countries than in the mature EU economies. Therefore, foreign investors and financial intermediaries were highly welcome to fill the gap. After decades of centrally planned economic activities, domestic banks in these countries often lacked the experience or the corporate governance to support the establishment of dynamic markets. Foreign banks contributed to the necessary financial deepening in the region and thereby allowed for a smoother transition process. But in many Eastern European countries, access to financial intermediation is still far beyond the levels in OECD countries, and therefore the extension of financial activities in that region will offer an attractive business opportunity for Austrian banks and other international intermediaries in the future. 4 BIS Review 79/2009 
  This financial strengthening of transition economies provided positive spillover effects by raising the demand for imported goods and services from the mature economies which were already members of the European Union. Thus, the financial integration of Central and Eastern Europe fuelled the prosperity of the whole continent. Around 20% of all euro area exports went to the 10 new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe. The trade surplus of the euro area with those countries added up to 60 billion euro. As countries in that region on average have higher trend growth rates than the “old” EU Member States, because they are still in the process of convergence towards higher GDP per capita, Central and Eastern Europe will remain a driver of economic growth in Europe for the foreseeable future. I do not want to suggest that no mistakes were made. In some countries credit volumes were probably expanded too fast, and the capital inflows contributed to overheating; the wide-spread allocation of foreign currency credits made some countries rather vulnerable for macroeconomic shocks. But this happened only in a small part of Central and Eastern Europe, and above all the bigger economies experienced balanced growth over the past decade.  BIS Review79/2009 5 
    In this respect I also want to stress the very fact that Austrian banks have been prudently pursuing their cross-border financial intermediation: their exposure in Eastern Europe is the 6 BIS Review 79/2009 
largest in Europe, but it is also well diversified over the whole region with a particular focus on countries which are members of the European Union – or even members of the European Monetary Union – already. Only 15% of Austrian banks’ assets in Eastern Europe are located outside EU boundaries. Even a recent IMF Paper2 drew the conclusion that “Austria (…) has the most diversified loan portfolio among the major home countries”. The current crisis and its impact When the financial crisis started to unfold, it hardly affected the financial corporations in my country at all initially, as they did not hold lots of securities that originated from the U.S. mortgage market. Most of them were heavily engaged in Eastern and Central Europe, with little resources left to invest in assets which might turn out to be toxic ex post. But as the crisis spread around the globe and especially after the collapse of Lehman Brothers caused major disruptions on the interbank market, our banks were also suffering from the worsening conditions. The rising uncertainty on financial markets would in the end turn against every bank, regardless how prudent its business model might have been. In previous financial crises hot money flew out of certain countries or regions and made those economies suffer from an under-supply of capital, but this time liquidity evaporated globally. The financial stress caused asset prices to decline further as many financial institution tried to reduce their leverage by a kind of fire sale. Of course, the financial crisis had its consequences for the real economy. Non-financial corporation saw their access to needed funds dwindle as the liquidity of the markets dried up; households saw the present value of their savings decline as asset prices dropped. Together these factors caused the effective demand in most economies simultaneously to stay behind their productive potential, resulting in a major global recession. As the whole crisis had started with a bubble on the housing market, some countries have also been hit by a slump of their property prices; this is true not only for the coastal areas of the U.S.A., but also for some European countries like Spain or Ireland. The burst of a bubble, the financial market crisis and the recession of the real economy all at the same time make the current situation particularly challenging. We know from historical comparison that a recession which goes along with a banking crisis tends to be especially long and severe3; we have seen this phenomenon in Sweden, Norway or Japan. Therefore, governments all over the world are in charge to take the required measures and to do so timely and well targeted. If we want to adhere to the audacity of hope, we also need the audacity for change; therefore, new instruments are needed and brave steps are warranted. The neglect of risk and its consequences One of the main reasons for the mess we are in now has been a general misperception of risk. In the financial industries, many believed that innovations like structured asset-backed securities would improve the diversification of risks and thereby help to reduce the markets’ vulnerability to adverse shocks. However, the risks were never actually traded away, but stayed concentrated on the books of the financial corporations involved. There is nothing wrong with risk diversification, but obviously something is wrong with innovative products that are too complex to be understood by the very people who originate and distribute them. And there is something wrong with markets that are not properly understood by their participants                                                  2  Andrea M. Maechler and Li Lian Ong (2009) “Foreign Banks in the CESE Countries: In for a Penny, in for a Pound?” IMF Working Paper 54/09. 3  Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff (2008) “Is the 2007 U.S. Sub-Prime Financial Crisis So Different? An International Historical Comparison“ NBER Working Paper No. 13761. BIS Review79/2009 7 
and with participants who know the party must come to an end soon but keep on dancing just because the music is playing4. A second misperception with respect to risk was the belief that financial globalization would reduce country risks by the growing opportunities of international risk sharing. The core idea of risk sharing is that individual country risks should be negatively correlated, so if the home country is affected by a negative shock, some foreign countries face a positive shock at the same time, and the returns from those countries would protect internationally diversified investors from domestic income losses. But the increased financial globalization not only made it easier for investors to invest in different countries, it also made it easier for financial crises to spread across borders. If international investors have to recover from a crisis in country A, they might start selling assets from country B, which was until then in no way affected by any sign of crisis. This kind of crisis transmission, sometimes also referred to as contagion, has so far mostly affected emerging markets; now for the first time we witness this phenomenon on a global scale. As a consequence of the crisis, the global risk perception has shifted towards a more prudent assessment, and like so often in financial markets, the market has tended to overshoot, going from risk ignorance to a very high degree of risk aversion. Such overshooting is currently taking place with regard to the spreads on government bonds in Europe. Whereas the interest on German 10-year government bonds has been decreasing, several European countries now face higher interest rates, which can partially be explained by the soaring demand for liquidity, which is of course highest for German papers. The rather unusual increase of the interest spread of Austrian sovereign debt versus Germany has in addition been associated with the exposure of Austrian banks in Central and Eastern Europe.                                                   4  Widely quoted statement by Chuck Prince, then CEO of Citigroup, in a FT interview July 9, 2007 “When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.“ 8 BIS Review 79/2009 
In this respect I want to clarify again that Central and Eastern Europe’s economic potential is still intact, and that growth rates in that region will exceed those in Western Europe and the U.S. for the years to come, so these investments are still to be viewed as assets rather than liabilities. The euro as a shield in stormy times Referring to a particularly negative episode in Austrian and in world financial history, Paul Krugman correctly stated: “Smaller countries – like Austria in 1931 – may once have been at the mercy of financial tides, unable to control their economic destiny”5. Now, Austria has not become a bigger country than it was in those unhappy days, but something else has changed in our favor since then: we are now members of the European Union and part of the euro area. In contrast to previous crises, this time our efforts to fight the recession are part of a coordinated European macroeconomic recovery plan upon which the European Commission and the EU member states already agreed in November 2008. If we compare the situation with our last recession before entering the EU, which took place in the early 1990s, monetary union with our key trading partners is very helpful as it prevents competitive devaluations by some neighboring countries that harmed our economy back then. In that sense, the euro has worked as a shield for small open economies all over Europe. What needs to be done now? Policy makers are confronted with two main tasks at the moment. On the one hand they must restore stability in financial markets by bringing back liquidity, recapitalizing banks and getting toxic assets off banks’ balance sheets. In Europe, we have some examples that can serve as guidance for how to deal with a banking crisis, for instance the Swedish and the Finnish experience of the early 1990s. (If anything, our own Austrian experience from the 1930s would rather qualify as an example of how not to save banks.) In Austria we have already taken measures to establish confidence among savers, and our government has also presented a stabilization package for banks, to which it has allotted 100 billion euro, which is roughly 1/3 of the Austrian GDP; 15 billion euro are reserved for recapitalizing banks, 75 billion for bank guarantees and an additional 10 billion for insuring the domestic deposit protection. In terms of GDP, the Austrian banks’ stabilization package is among the biggest in the EU.                                                   5  Paul Krugman (2009) “The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008“, Norton, page 4.

    10 BIS Review 79/2009 
The second task we now face is to fight the global recession and prevent it from turning into a lasting depression. This is a challenge for both monetary and fiscal policy. The main objective of monetary policy in the euro area has always been to preserve price stability, in the current state of affairs means to prevent deflation. I can assure you that, at the Governing Council of the ECB we will take all available measures to stabilize the inflationary expectations in the euro area and keep them anchored in positive terrain. We will keep the interest rate very low for as long a time as is required, and we stand ready to use unconventional measures of quantitative easing to assure European firms and consumers access to credit at appropriate conditions. As for fiscal policy, the necessity of a large and timely stimulus package is most obvious. Olivier Blanchard and others from the IMF6 explained concisely late last year how such a stimulus package should look like. It should be broad-based as the crisis will hit each economy as a whole; it should be fairly long-term as this crisis won’t go away next quarter; and it should be supported by as many countries as possible as this is a global crisis and it is not the time for beggar-my-neighbor policies. Although the automatic stabilizers in most European countries help to adjust for the loss in effective demand, some additional discretionary spending is now needed. The crisis also highlighted differences between the EU and the U.S. in terms of fiscal policy. While the two regions are roughly comparable in economic size, the EU lacks a federal budget like the U.S. In times of crisis, when timely and targeted action is warranted, the EU with its budget of 1% of total GDP is rather shiftless compared to the U.S. Federal budget of more than 20% of GDP. In terms of fiscal policy, European countries are mostly on their own when fighting recessions. Like in the U.S., not all states within the EU are affected in the same way by the crisis; but those EU Member States which are hit most severely by the crisis now are also the ones which will amass high budget deficits very quickly and therefore find it harder to finance their stimulus spending. Some of the new EU Member States have been affected rather harshly by the crisis already, and unfortunately it has not been understood yet by all remaining countries that assisting those countries is not only an act of European solidarity, but that it is also in their economic interest to support those countries which have relatively high import demand for their products. Like in the so-called “tequila crisis” of 1995, it was not immediately understood by all politicians in Washington that helping Mexico was in the best interest of the U.S., but thankfully those in charge in the administration knew how to deal with the situation. It also took some time before policy makers in Europe did recognize that it was in the best interest of Europe to pave the way for a European initiative for economic stabilization and recovery. For instance, the European Council at the level of heads of state and government, has already decided to double the ceiling for the EU’s support facility for balance-of-payments assistance to 50 billion euro. What shall be done in the future? If macroeconomic policies work together in a well-coordinated way globally, I am convinced we will master this crisis and successfully prevent a global depression. But then we should also change the financial system in such a way that such a crisis will not occur again. Now in concluding, let me briefly point out some ideas how these changes in the global financial system should look like. First, we need more cooperation or even integration of international financial supervision authorities. That means an end to the formerly common practice of some institutions to shop around for the lowest level of regulation on the globe and hence minimize their degree of supervision. Next, I think we must increase the number of institutions subjected to                                                  6  Olivier Blanchard, Antonio Spilimbergo, Steve Symansky, and Carlo Cottarelli (2008). “Fiscal Policy for the Crisis,” IMF Staff Position Note, December 29, 2008. BIS Review79/2009 11 
regulations which are at the moment reserved for commercial banks. Putting it simple, every single institution that has the capacity to create the kind of trouble a failing bank may create should be regulated like a bank; I am thinking here of highly leveraged institutions such as hedge funds, the need to regulate which is now generally understood. Then we should take a close look at the functioning of the rating agencies. They were wrong on Enron, they were wrong on the subprime market and yet their ratings continue to be of enormous importance for access to credit for many firms and even governments. As this importance is based on the assumption of superior information held by these agencies, I really wonder how such an assumption can be sustained any longer. The crisis has shown the importance of international cooperation and the importance of financial institutions like the IMF, the EIB or the EBRD, as they have been able to help quickly and provide countries in need with appropriate credit lines. Whereas the European Union should consider establishing certain institutions of its own or at least funding the existing institutions more generously, on a global level the IMF has re-established its essential role. With respect to the conditionality of IMF loans we might as well question the wisdom of the market whether it is useful to contain public spending strongly in what has turned out to be the most severe crisis for generations. But the results of the G20 summit have shown that the willingness necessary for close cooperation among the big economies is there. The agreed upon increase in credit lines, the additional funding of the IMF and the creation of more Special Drawing Rights, all these measures will provide some stimulus to effective global demand, and the new approach to financial market regulation will help us to ensure financial stability and to control and trim the shadow banking system. Therefore, we can be confident that this crisis will be contained, and that recovery won’t take too long a time coming; and once prosperity is growing again, it will do so more sustainably and in a more balanced manner. 12 BIS Review 79/2009 
Rundheersing Bheenick: The role of international trade and trade finance Address by Mr Rundheersing Bheenick, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the Presentation on Afreximbank to the Mauritian Business Community, Port Louis, 16 June 2009. *      *      * Good morning ladies and gentlemen It is with great pleasure that I welcome you all today to this Presentation of the Afreximbank. I extend a particularly warm welcome to Dr Oramah and Mr Chafa. This is a critical element in what might be called our frontier expansion policy, creating extended links between the core role of a central bank and the wider pastures of trade and the real economy. Last month at about the same date, the Bank was co-hosting the first Seminar of the Islamic Financial Services Board in Mauritius. Today’s event is the fruit of the collaboration of our two institutions, Afreximbank and Bank of Mauritius.  On the occasion of a Board Meeting of Afreximbank held in Mauritius in December last, I had drawn the attention of the President and Chairman of the Board of Afreximbank, Mr Jean-Louis Ekra, on the lack of awareness about Afreximbank’s programmes and facilities by the business community and I had expressed my views on how a knowledge of Afreximbank’s products could represent a useful tool in the promotion of market and product diversification of our trade. I am extremely delighted that the President of Afreximbank has responded positively to my request and I convey my heartfelt thanks to him.  Today’s event gives me the opportunity to share with you a few thoughts on the role of international trade and trade finance, especially in the context of the current economic turmoil, and as Paul Krugman has put it in his seminal book “The Return to Depression Economics”; that “Malign neglect” of the “shadow banking system” that has led to the “Loss of traction” of the central banks in steadying the real economy in the storm.  International trade Over many years, we have seen that most countries have progressively opened their economies to international trade, either through the multilateral trading system, increased regional cooperation or as part of outward-oriented domestic reform programs. We have gone beyond the system with the third world being merely the exporter of raw materials and the importer of manufactures. International trade nowadays backed by the Internet has created the efficiency for raising standards and conditions of living. It has enabled all nations to produce on a higher efficiency scale. It has helped increase productivity. It has allowed the instant spread of knowledge and ideas so that the range of choices available to consumers has expanded continuously.  Trade and globalization have without doubt brought enormous benefits to many countries and citizens of the world. We might disagree on the exact modalities and the sequencing of trade and tariff reforms, but few of us would dispute that international trade has been a major driver of global economic growth since the end of the Second World War. Trade expansion boosted post-war economic recovery in the leading economies of today; Germany and Japan are notable examples that come to mind. It figures large in the “growth miracles” of the Asian Tigers, Mauritius, but also China! But this has not happened without those countries facing their own crises. BIS Review79/2009 1 
The impact of the crisis on trade finance Today we are facing the worst economic crisis in generations and this crisis is threatening to undo the economic development that many countries have achieved so far. Undoubtedly world trade has been one of the worst casualties in the global financial crisis. This is even threatening to “erode people’s faith in an open international trading system.” The negative impact on world trade finds its way through two main channels. First the credit crunch resulting from the financial market turbulences has led to a fall in the supply of trade finance, which has rightly been described as the oil of the wheels of international trade; and secondly the spillover of the financial crisis into the real economy has caused the worst recession since the Great Depression and fuelled a contraction of trade volumes. And those of us who believe in open trade almost as an article of faith, have watched with growing disbelief as the threat of protectionism started to rear its ugly head. As economic activity collapsed and unemployment soared in many countries, protectionist sentiment has risen along with the attraction of other trade-distorting policies. Many countries have implemented domestic stimulus packages aimed at protecting their businesses and industries, favouring domestic goods and services sometimes at the expense of imports. Policy-makers are perfectly aware that such policy actions have international implications – in the short term they can boost domestic demand but in the long term, they undermine the international trading system and global wealth and welfare. Outlook for world trade for 2009 If we look at the prospects for world trade for 2009, we see that the World Bank has predicted that the volume of world trade in goods and services will decrease by around 6 percent. According to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the collapse in global demand is expected to drive manufacturing exports down by roughly 9 percent in volume terms. International trade is thus forecast to continue deteriorating and there is even the emergence of a wide consensus arguing that in 2009 the global economy will shrink as recession strikes.  Against this bleak backdrop, I believe it is important to put things into the right perspective. Yes, trade can be a powerful engine to transmit shocks, whether positive or negative, from one part of the globe to another. But, no, it is certainly not the cause of the collapse in demand. The financial crisis, which transmuted into a global economic crisis, is what has driven the world economy to where it is now! Lessons from previous crises Crises are, without a doubt, challenging times but they bring along a wealth of lessons and opportunities for those willing to learn from past mistakes. As US President Obama has recently put it: we must not waste the opportunities this crisis presents.  The destructive protectionist streak in the aftermath of the Great Depression serves as a stark reminder about the dangers of reverting to the beggar-thy-neighbour policies of the past. We have learnt the lesson that the scarcity of trade finance is unavoidable during crises. The experience of South East Asian countries at the time of the Asian Financial crisis a decade ago; of Russia during 1997-98; of Turkey in 2000-01; and of Brazil and Argentina during the Argentine crisis of 2001-02, still resonates in our minds. Another lesson learnt is that multilateral cooperation can also help make trade finance more affordable and resilient in times of crisis. WTO has advocated cooperation among all stakeholders in the trade finance market to keep the flow of trade finance going. Among the measures proposed at the G20 Summit is the injection of some USD250 billion to support trade finance. Here in Mauritius, despite the resilience of our domestic banking sector, on the first signs of difficulty last November, the 2 BIS Review 79/2009 
Bank of Mauritius acted pre-emptively and created a line of credit of USD100 million for trade financing purposes.  Doha Round Reviving the Doha Trade Talks – which were not so long ago considered to be as dead as our dear departed Dodo – is now increasingly seen as vital for global economic recovery. Political leaders and policy-makers of the G20 have committed to expedite the conclusion of the Round. This view is shared by WTO Director-General Lamy, who, underscoring the importance of concluding the Doha Round, warned that “the stress test of the multilateral trading system is still to come”. I align myself with the view that the mutual benefits of trade are too important not to be preserved and it is in the interest of one and all to maintain and enhance trade openness at all costs. Indeed I strongly believe that, protectionist sentiment notwithstanding, trade continues to function as the hand-maiden of economic growth and will support global economic recovery.  Regional cooperation/economic integration In Mauritius, our trade policy has always been one of openness, whether it is to the world economy or to the region. We have of course, never been averse to drawing benefits from preferential trade arrangements.  We are a member of various important international organisations such as WTO and of regional blocks such as COMESA and SADC. More importantly, we have been in the front line of African countries to benefit from the African Growth and Opportunity Act. For little Mauritius, Africa represents a sizeable market for our products and services and has untapped potential. Many local companies are exporting to SADC and COMESA countries and they envisage extending their export network to other parts of the continent.  The Mauritian Banking Sector has been quite resilient to the financial market turbulence, but the interconnectedness that comes from living in a highly integrated world means that our banks are not immune to contagion effects. In the words of Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the managing director of the World Bank, we, in the emerging economies, are "innocent bystanders" in the global recession created by developed countries. But we are determined to avoid becoming victims of the credit crunch. We do recognize the need for collective action in order to get through these harsh economic times.  This gives me the opportunity to articulate my position regarding the strong lobbying of some of our exporters in favour of the continued depreciation of our currency. Export lobbies have been clamouring for a depreciation of the Rupee to ensure their competitiveness, if not to guarantee their very survival. But we need to look at the other side of the coin – consumer and producer price inflation arising from pass-through of higher import prices. At a time when one of our main concerns is protecting people and their purchasing power, intervention by the Bank of Mauritius to keep the Rupee at a depreciated level would not only be inappropriate, it would also be irresponsible! And to put to rest, once and for all, the Rupee depreciation mantra, I need to add that a recent IMF mission has proposed to re-classify our exchange rate regime from managed float to freely floating. I am reminded here of the French writer, Jean Baptiste Poquelin – many of you probably know him under his more famous name, Molière. Molière had one well-known play, “Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme”. Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme in Molière was surprised to discover that he had been speaking prose all his life! We are surprised to discover that for the last year or so, we’ve been a free floater, not a managed floater. And the Fund has offered to re-classify us in the light of our past performance as a free floating BIS Review79/2009 3 
regime. This puts us in the top category of countries in the likes of UK and the US. This is not an opportune time to embark on a drastic overhaul of our exchange rate regime; this proposal however does offer food for thought about the shape of things to come under the emerging new economic order. Financial mercantilism, whether at the level of countries or institutions, is simply not a viable way to national economic competitiveness. The Additional Stimulus Package and the Budget Speech has made it clear that life support for moribund enterprises is not on the agenda. “Preparing for recovery” is!  In addition to the inescapable “regulatory soul-searching”, the financial crisis and the global recession also warrant a revolution in the ways we think about and conduct business. Going down the well-trodden path of pessimism while waiting for the tide to turn is certainly tempting, but ultimately our ability to harness the potential of the new internationalism will depend on how willing we are to move away from established “comfort zones”. Afreximbank – opportunities for Mauritius Today’s event with Afreximbank is intended to serve as a reminder of the vast possibilities that beckon for enterprises and financial institutions that choose to view this crisis as an invitation to do things differently; to do things better! The initiative of the Bank of Mauritius to lend its platform for Afreximbank to market its products is one more step in the direction of regional cooperation and economic integration. I know our local investors are looking forward to receive Afreximbank’s support for their trade with African countries and other countries in the region as well as with the rest of the world.  The Bank of Mauritius has always favoured an approach geared towards opening up the banking sector to other players. We firmly believe that healthy competition always results in more choices, coupled with a better service for the users of financial products.  Traders around the world rely on a high level of trust and confidence in the counterparty to a trade operation. One of the things that traders look for in their exchange with buyers in other countries is the assurance that they will indeed receive their payments. The 2009 Budget Speech has proposed the setting up of an Export Credit Insurance Scheme. This reminds me of the major role played by the Bank of Mauritius in the 1980’s in setting up the Export Credit Guarantee Scheme and in providing financial backing in setting up the Export Credit Insurance Scheme. This scheme was meant to protect Mauritian exporters against credit risks – both commercial and country risks. Both schemes were managed by the Development Bank of Mauritius but it was the Bank of Mauritius that guaranteed settlement of all claims in respect of the two schemes. The two schemes did not meet with much success and were short-lived. I hope we’ll have better luck with the new version now on the drawing board. Afreximbank is bringing to us today years of experience and know-how in providing insurance and guarantee services covering commercial and non-commercial risks associated with African exports. The experience and expertise of Afreximbank in this area could be quite useful. REPSS As you know, the developing COMESA system, the Regional Payment and Settlement System – REPSS will facilitate cross-border payment and settlement between Central Banks in the COMESA region; it is presently in the final stage of testing and will be launched soon. The system will stimulate and increase intra-regional trade by working in local currencies, thus reducing costs and saving time. I extend an invitation to Afreximbank to join our clearing system. 4 BIS Review 79/2009 
I now leave you in the able hands of Dr Oramah who will make a presentation on the range of products of Afreximbank. Those of you who have booked slots with the delegation from Afreximbank for one-to-one encounters will be able to attend the bilateral meetings in the afternoon and tomorrow morning. I hope and wish you to make the most of this presentation by Afreximbank. Thank you all for your attention. BIS Review79/2009 5 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Supporting the financial system and the economy – key ECB policy actions in the crisis Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at a Conference organised by the Nueva Economía Fórum and The Wall Street Journal Europe, Madrid, 22 June 2009. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the organisers for inviting me today to talk about the ECB’s policy actions in these times of truly unprecedented challenges – for our financial system, for the businesses large and small that drive our economy and for the citizens of Spain, the euro area and beyond. As some of you might remember, I was here in Madrid five years ago to give a speech on “The challenges for the European economy in 2004”. At that time one important issue was whether the economic recovery that had become apparent in the second half of 2003 would gather momentum. Another important issue was the need for economic policies that would make the euro area economy more resilient to sudden and sometimes unexpected events and to foster its potential for sustainable long term growth.  Needless to say, the challenges the euro area currently faces are of a different order of magnitude than in 2004. Yet, at a fundamental level, the key issues are similar, namely how to pave the way for a robust recovery and how to increase the long term growth potential in a sustainable manner. In my view these two questions – the cyclical and the structural – are closely entwined. To restore confidence in the near-term and the long-term future, policymakers in the euro area and elsewhere must maintain an appropriate balance between bold short-term action and the return to a path that is sustainable in the medium term. As I will explain, the ECB’s policy actions since the onset of the financial crisis have been at the same time very bold and strongly anchored in the medium-term framework of our monetary policy strategy. We were the first to act when signs of financial stress emerged back in August 2007. We stepped forcefully into the breach when the collapse of a major financial player abroad threatened global financial stability last autumn, embarking in a full allotment mode with fixed rates for the supply of liquidity. And in recent months, we have further deepened the set of measures that we call our policy of “enhanced credit support”.  All the measures we are using share two crucial features: first, they are designed to be effective in preserving the functioning of the money market, the appropriate financing of the economy and taking into account the very significant rebalancing of inflationary risks; second, they can be easily unwound once the financial crisis attenuates and when we see any risks of a future rise in inflation. These two features ensure that all measures taken are fully consistent with the ECB’s primary objective, which is to preserve price stability in the euro area over the medium term.  Beyond monetary policy, I see two policy priorities going forward. First, governments need to spell out how they envisage unwinding the crisis-related fiscal stimulus measures to return to sustainable fiscal positions in the medium term. This is particularly important as substantial support for the financial sector might still be needed. While this support often does not directly affect fiscal balances, it creates contingent liabilities that may have to be catered for. Second, the urgent need for reform of the global financial architecture should not distract from the need for further progress with labor and product market reform in the euro area. Rigorous implementation of the Lisbon reform agenda remains as pressing as ever, as increased productivity and efficiency will not only foster the development of the private sector, but also facilitate the return to sustainable fiscal positions. BIS Review 78/2009 1 
In my remarks today, I would like first to recall the origins of the crisis. I will then explain in detail the various actions the ECB has taken to support the euro area economy and the financial system. Before concluding, I will also say a few words on the specific challenges currently facing the Spanish economy. The roots of the financial crisis and its propagation Over the past ten years, we have witnessed a dramatic shift of focus in large parts of the financial sector – away from facilitating trade and real investment towards unfettered speculation and financial gambling. To be clear, I do not deny that financial liberalisation and financial innovation over the past two decades have made important contributions to the overall productivity of our economies. For example, the securitisation of assets – the transformation of bilateral loans into tradable credit instruments – had tremendous potential for the diversification and efficient management of economic risk.  But the way securitisation was implemented also meant that banks and non-banks were able not only to sell loans, but also often to place them fully off-balance sheet immediately after they had been extended. This weakened their incentives to conduct prudent screening and constant monitoring of loans. This is true only for the most recent product innovations in the field of securitisation. It is not true for a financial innovation that is more than two hundred years old: covered bonds. I will return to this asset class and give you a detailed assessment when I describe the ECB’s recent policy actions. The credit boom was exacerbated by three multipliers. First, incentives: ill-designed compensation schemes for loan managers and traders reinforced the shortening of their time horizons. Second, complexity: increasingly complicated and opaque financial instruments made it difficult for holders of securities to assess the quality of the underlying investments. And third, global macroeconomic imbalances: a chronic shortage of savings in some industrialised economies was made possible by an excess of savings in other parts of the world. This acted as a multiplier that was exacerbated during the years immediately preceding the crisis by the sharply rising prices of oil and other commodities.  In mid-2007, suddenly though not unexpectedly, the interactions of perverse incentives, excessive complexity and global imbalances threw the credit boom into reverse. The asset cycle turned, and many of the missing links in the financial chain were exposed. The collapse in mid-September last year of a major financial player, turned a large-scale crisis of confidence into a global financial panic. As the intensity of the crisis became evident, financial intermediaries restored liquidity buffers, scaled down their balance sheets and tightened lending conditions. Financial institutions dramatically reduced their exposure to the risks that they had imprudently accumulated during the phase of financial euphoria. Collectively, they engaged in a large-scale process of “deleveraging”. Banks’ intermediation was reduced in the aggregate, and loans to companies were curtailed. The credit squeeze and the toll on the real economy set in.  ECB policy actions in the financial crisis  As I have said, the ECB has taken swift and forceful action to mitigate the effects of the crisis as events have unfolded. We were the first to act back in August 2007, temporarily providing on day 1 of the turmoil unlimited liquidity to preserve as normal as possible the functioning of the money market. Allow me to stress that our measures together with the support measures of euro area governments have yielded one very important result that sometimes seems to be overlooked: there has not been a single failure of a systematically relevant financial institution in the euro area. This is an achievement whose importance cannot be overstated.  2 BIS Review 78/2009 
The ECB’s policy actions have at all times been carefully calibrated to the structure of the euro area economy. This relates in particular to its financial structure, which differs profoundly from that of the United States, for example. The euro area has a largely bank-centred financial system, whereas that of the United States is primarily market-based. A few numbers illustrate these differences. At the end of 2007, the stock of outstanding bank loans to the private sector amounted to around 145% of GDP in the euro area. The corresponding proportion of bank loans to GDP in the United States was only 63%. This means that the banking sector is more than twice as important in the euro area as it is in the United States. It also means that to be effective, ECB policy must focus first and foremost on the banking sector.  The euro area financial structure I have just described provides the background for our policies. These policies are guided by our monetary policy strategy, a key element of which is the quantitative definition of price stability. We aim at an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The precise quantification of our policy objective has proved an invaluable asset, a fail-safe mechanism against excessive swings in inflation expectations, downwards as much as upwards. Long-term inflation expectations in the euro area, whether based on surveys or extracted from financial indicators, have been exceptionally resistant to sudden short-term price changes. We will ensure that inflation expectations remain impervious to short-term changes in inflation, even in the face of sharply falling inflation. The ECB’s responses to the financial crisis are in line both with the euro area financial structure and with our medium-term objective. Since the intensification of the financial crisis in September of last year – and against the background of rapidly receding inflationary pressures –, we have taken monetary policy measures that are unprecedented in nature, scope and magnitude. These measures fall in two categories: first, conventional measures in the form of interest rate changes; second, what have become known as “non-standard” measures. The latter measures taken together constitute what we call the ECB’s policy of enhanced credit support. These are specific actions we have taken to sustain the flow of credit above and beyond what could be achieved through interest rate reductions alone.  Interest rate action Before explaining in detail the core elements of our policy of enhanced credit support, I would like to talk briefly about interest rates – the conventional indicators of monetary policy. Since October of last year we have cut our key policy rate by a total of 325 basis points. It now stands at 1%, a historical low not only for the ECB but also for the national central banks that were its predecessors.  Money market yields at longer than overnight maturity have fallen even more strongly than the policy rate. This is important because it means that a crucial element of the monetary policy transmission mechanism is intact. Borrowers in the euro area directly benefit from the low level of six-month and twelve-month money market rates because these are widely used by banks to set floating rate loans to households and companies. This is particularly true for Spain where floating rate loans are widespread, for example with respect to mortgage loans.  Enhanced credit support  Let me now turn to the exceptional policy actions that we have taken in response to the crisis – the so-called “non-standard” measures. As already mentioned, when the very significant stress in interbank markets first manifested itself in August 2007, the ECB immediately stepped into the breach and accommodated the temporarily elevated liquidity demand from the banks through a fixed rate operation with full allotment, providing €95 billion to the market within a few hours. Overnight lending of the same kind continued to be provided albeit with BIS Review 78/2009 3 
lower volumes during the following three days. So we can say that the ECB was the first central bank in the crisis to engage in non-standard measures. Liquidity management measures When in mid-September 2008 interbank trading came to a virtual halt, the ECB had to engage in a new mode of liquidity provision. We started to provide refinancing well above the levels that banks had absorbed to fulfil their reserve requirements in normal times.  Let me explain to you how and why we did this. There are three main building blocks to our new liquidity management approach. 1) Our primary concern was to maintain the availability of credit for households and companies at accessible rates. We significantly adapted our regular operations in the crisis. Since then, we have followed a new “fixed rate full allotment” tender procedure and we have significantly expanded the maturity of our operations. Banks have been granted access to essentially unlimited liquidity at our policy interest rate at maturities of up to six months. On 7 May we decided to lengthen further the maturity of our refinancing operations, introducing a new one-year operation, the first of which will take place the day after tomorrow.  To appreciate fully what these changes mean, let us step back for a moment and look at what we do in normal times. In normal times, we auction a given amount of central bank credit, mainly in refinancing operations with a one-week maturity, and let competition among bidders determine the interest rate at which that credit will become available to the banking system as a whole. This means that the liquidity injection is restrained by a policy decision. Last autumn, we changed that. As the demand for liquidity by individual institutions expanded abnormally and markets dramatically ceased to allocate liquidity, we have turned that practice around. We have been determining the lending rate – at a very low level – and we stand ready to fill any shortage of liquidity that might occur at that interest rate for maturities of up to six months. This means that we currently act as a surrogate for the market in terms of both liquidity allocation and price-setting.  2) The second building block of our new liquidity management approach is the list of assets that we take as collateral. This list was already very large before the crisis, but we have enlarged it even further and now accept an even wider range of securities as collateral. Government securities account for only 44% of the nominal value of securities on the list. The rest are private securities. In contrast to many other central banks, the ECB already intermediated private paper before the crisis and we have even strengthened this aspect in the crisis by accepting an even wider range of private paper.  The total value of these eligible securities is currently €12.2 trillion, equivalent to 130% of GDP in the euro area. This very ample eligibility of collateral has dramatically eased banks’ liquidity constraints during the crisis and, ultimately, it has encouraged them to extend new credit or continue rolling over maturing loans. 3) The first two building blocks offer unlimited refinancing against a very wide range of collateral. But they can only reach the financial system if they are coupled with the third building block, namely the very large number of counterparties that have always been able to take part in our refinancing operations. Even before the crisis, 1,700 counterparties fulfilled all relevant criteria. This number was higher at the time than for the other major central banks. Following the changes to our operational framework in October 2008, this number rose even further. Our measures to safeguard the banking system’s access to liquidity have resulted in a considerable expansion of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, which reached a peak of 19% of GDP at the height of the crisis around the turn of the year. Since then, we have seen liquidity flows moving back from our balance sheet to the money market. This is a sign of improving 4 BIS Review 78/2009 
confidence and more favourable conditions. We therefore see some indication that the functioning of the money market is improving. Covered bond purchases Another unconventional element was added in May: outright purchases of covered bonds. This measure complements the liquidity management measures I have just described. Covered bonds are debt securities issued by banks, which give them access to funding of a longer-term nature than the ECB’s refinancing operations. Covered bonds thus allow banks to manage the maturity mismatch between their assets and liabilities. Why did we decide to engage in purchases in this particular asset class? Several reasons guided our decision. First, as I have already stressed, in the euro area measures to support the flow of credit to the non-financial sector need to operate first and foremost through banks. Covered bonds were a major source of funds for banks in the euro area before the intensification of the financial crisis last autumn, when the covered bonds market virtually shut down. The Governing Council came to the conclusion that the Eurosystem could help in reviving this market, in terms of liquidity, issuance and spreads, by engaging in outright purchases of covered bonds. Already after the announcement of 7 May, and before we carried out any purchase, there has been a wave of new issuances of covered bonds and a degree of compression of spreads. This is true in particular for Spanish banks, which traditionally have been significant issuers, but also for banks from countries where covered bonds were much less widespread. The effects on liquidity are expected to take place when the actual program will be conducted. Let me stress that our purchases – like all our other policies – target the euro area as a whole and not any particular country. Our purchases will benefit not only banks that issue covered bonds but also banks that are holding these assets. More importantly, beyond banks, our purchases will benefit the real economy, which obtains funds through the banks. Second, covered bonds are different in nature from the variety of asset-backed securities that had become so popular before turning sour with the financial crisis. Importantly, covered bonds do not involve a transfer of the credit risk of the underlying assets from the issuer to the investor. The credit risk stays with the originator, preserving the incentives for prudent credit risk evaluation and monitoring. We could thus say that covered bonds are incentive compatible while many asset-backed securities were not, at least in the way the concept was implemented before the crisis. In the years preceding the crisis, banks tended to favour the issuance of asset-backed securities over the issuance of covered bonds, because this form of finance appeared cheaper in an environment characterised by heavy underpricing of credit risk. Given that the financial crisis clearly exposed the dire consequences of this underpricing, the usefulness of more conservative asset classes such as covered bonds, which have proved to be safe assets over time is obvious. I believe that covered bonds and asset-backed securities will both contribute to a thriving capital market, each catering for a different set of investors and issuers. Last but not least, the ECB’s measures for enhanced credit support were designed in full respect of the euro area macroeconomic framework, which is founded on a clear division of tasks and policy responsibilities between the ECB and the national authorities. Financial support measures potentially involving a significant transfer of credit risk from financial institutions to the taxpayer clearly fall into the realm of fiscal policy. The decided outright purchases of covered bonds are fully consistent with this fundamental principle. While they are expected to be effective in supporting credit, these purchases do not burden the Eurosystem with excessive credit risk and therefore do not limit our flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy. BIS Review 78/2009 5 
Before concluding, allow me a few words on the challenges facing the Spanish economy. Over the last decade the Spanish economy has shown a very strong performance in terms of output and in particular employment growth. Spain disposes of some world-class companies in important sectors including energy, communications and banking. Spain has been hard hit by the reassessment of risks in the financial sector and the overall change in economic sentiment since the intensification of the global crisis last autumn. The Spanish economy also faces some specific challenges, stemming in part from macroeconomic imbalances which have developed over many years and the related sharp reversal of the housing and construction boom. For many years strong growth in domestic demand led to relatively high inflation. The persistent inflation and labour cost differential with the average of the euro area during the expansion has hampered competitiveness which will have to be regained. The present situation suggests a need for labour market reform and wage moderation in particular by discontinuing wage indexation. Appropriate structural reforms will support a sustainable economic upswing and also the consolidation of public finances, which will be crucial not only in Spain but in the entire euro area, for confidence to be restored. Conclusions  As I noted at the beginning of this speech, the current environment is clearly much more challenging than it was five years ago. At that time the question was whether economic recovery in the euro area was sufficiently robust. Currently, we are still in the downturn phase – a downturn that globally is proving to be the deepest since the Second World War. While there are first signs that the pace of economic weakening is decelerating, we must remain alert. We are in uncharted waters, and there are still risks of a sudden emergence of unexpected financial turbulence. This being said, the overarching aim must be to restore confidence, to take measures that will solidly anchor the expectations of households and companies, and to lay the groundwork for a return to sustainable prosperity.  This calls for a bold yet solidly grounded response. We must maintain the balance between the need to take immediate action commensurate with the gravity of today’s situation, and the equally undeniable obligation to return to a path that is sustainable in the medium term.  The ECB for its part will do all that is necessary to continue to be a very solid and reliable anchor of stability and confidence in these challenging times. I thank you for your attention. 6 BIS Review 78/2009 
Thomas Jordan: Low interest rates – blessing or curse? Summary of a speech by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Delegiertenversammlung des HEV Schweiz, Säntis, 19 June 2009. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * Monetary policy uses low interest rates to try and stimulate demand as a way of combating the economic crisis. The property market is an important transmission channel in this regard, as low mortgage rates provide direct relief to home owners and tenants in the form of lower interest payments and rents. This provides households with greater room for manoeuvre in consumption and investment. This in turn boosts overall economic demand and economic growth. However, despite these direct positive effects, a low level of interest rates can also pose medium-term risks for the stability of the Swiss property market, and hence the financial system. The past has repeatedly shown that prolonged periods of low interest rates can lead to speculation on property markets, and to declining standards in mortgage lending. The challenge in today’s difficult environment is how to boost the economy through low interest rates without creating medium-term risks for the stability of the financial system and the property market. Responsible behaviour on the part of home owners, combined with bank discipline when granting loans, can contain these risks. Households should buy property only if they would also be able to afford it if interest rates increased. Moreover, they should finance their house purchase with a sufficient proportion of equity. Equity acts as a cushion, absorbing movements in property prices. In addition, banks should use discipline in lending practices, even in an environment of low interest rates. The prime considerations when granting loans should be the observance of maximum loan-to-value ratios and a conservative valuation of property. BIS Review 78/2009 1 
José Manuel González-Páramo: Beyond the financial crisis – some issues on the future of central banking Speech by Mr José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Inaugural Conference of “Cátedra Fundación Ramón Areces de Distribución Comercial” at the University of Oviedo, Oviedo, 19 June 2009. *      *      * 1.  Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to participate in the Inaugural Conference of the “Cátedra Fundación Ramón Areces de Distribución Comercial” here in Oviedo. I am very grateful to the organiser – Alfonso Novales – for giving me the opportunity to address this audience today and to share with you some reflections on the current financial crisis and the role of central banks in responding to it.  We are currently experiencing one of the deepest and most complex crises witnessed by the world for many decades. The turmoil stemming from a relatively small segment of the US mortgage market (the sub-prime segment) has developed over time into a global crisis affecting a number of economies and markets all over the world. The global dimension of the crisis as well as its complexity have posed a number of challenges for policy makers, forcing them to introduce exceptional measures and use innovative modalities of intervention.  In particular, increasing awareness that the current crisis has the potential to jeopardise systemic financial stability and undermine macroeconomic stability worldwide has led to public authorities developing a common understanding of the causes of the crisis and of the concerted actions needed to address them. Thus, a high degree of cooperation among public authorities both at national and international level has become a hallmark of public interventions throughout the current crisis.  A highly symbolic episode of international policy cooperation during the crisis was the announcement of a coordinated interest rate cut by the ECB and five other major central banks (the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve, Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank) in October 2008. This coordinated interest rate cut was unprecedented by historical standards and was interpreted as a sign of the strong commitment of the international central banking community to addressing the macroeconomic implications of the financial market turmoil.  International cooperation among central banks has also been remarkable in the area of liquidity management. First, through enhanced information sharing and collective monitoring of market developments and, later on, by means of coordinated steps to provide liquidity, central banks have cooperated from the start of the crisis to guarantee the smooth functioning of global money markets and provide support to the international banking system. The first initiative in this direction was the agreement in December 2007 between the Eurosystem and the US Federal Reserve to grant loans in US dollars to euro area counterparties in connection with the Fed’s Term Auction Facility.  The need to strengthen liquidity provision in order to address the global liquidity squeeze and ease pressures in international money markets has also led to central banks adjusting their operational frameworks in order to increase their effectiveness and expanding their ability to reach markets under stress. This has resulted in a certain degree of international convergence of the operational frameworks. As part of the adjustments to their operational frameworks, some central banks have extended lending to institutions other than depository banks, including non-bank financial institutions and even directly to the real sector.  BIS Review 78/2009 1 
Direct lending to the real sector represents a significant deviation from the traditional central banking practice of using banks as the main channel of transmission of central bank liquidity. But this is not the only area in which the crisis has prompted central bankers to reconsider their existing practices. The issue of the optimal response of monetary policy to asset price bubbles is also being re-examined, with the prevailing view – postulating that a central bank’s policy interest rate is too blunt an instrument to address bubbles – coming under much stricter scrutiny that it has being subjected to in the past decade. Finally, the need to strengthen the role of central banks in preserving financial stability has also become the focus of the policy debate as efforts are made to address the causes of the crisis. The recognition that market failures as well as regulatory and supervisory deficiencies are at the root of the crisis has prompted the relevant public and private fora to make significant efforts to identify weaknesses in the international financial sector and develop measures to restore its smooth functioning. In the case of Europe, there is increasing concern that the current prudential framework based on national regulatory and supervisory regimes cannot address the many challenges arising from the activities of large, complex and highly interdependent financial institutions operating across borders. To sum up, the current crisis is likely to bring important changes for the future of the economic and financial systems in which we live. These include changes in the nature of the relationship and degree of coordination among the different policies and public authorities, revisions to the regulatory and supervisory domains as well as reforms of the international financial architecture. Therefore, we are likely to witness a number of institutional changes that will bring about a new environment for policy-making in a number of areas related to central banking.  2.  A new environment for central banking? I should like to share with you some thoughts on this potential new environment. In order to do so, I will organise my intervention around six specific issues among those that in my view deserve particular attention: 1. Should we increase policy coordination at the domestic level? 2. Should there be more international monetary policy coordination? 3. Should we see more international convergence in liquidity frameworks? 4. Should central banks increase direct lending to the real economy? 5. Should asset prices being given more weight in monetary policy considerations? 6. Should central banks be more involved in supervision? 2.1  More domestic policy coordination? As we have seen, policy responses both at the global and the European level have been characterised by an increasing degree of coordination. A natural question, therefore, seems to be whether in the future greater policy coordination at the level of the euro area or the EU should be warranted. Given the existence of the single currency in the euro area, I will first focus on the coordination among national fiscal policies. On the fiscal side, a key challenge for the future is to prevent the financial crisis from eventually undermining the sustainability and credibility of public finances. What can we do to prevent this from happening? At this point, let me reiterate that the Stability and Growth Pact already provides a coordination device for fiscal policies and, in particular, provides peer pressure mechanisms for sound and sustainable public finances. It provides the appropriate framework for the conduct and coordination of fiscal policies in good times and also in bad times. 2 BIS Review 78/2009 
The challenge at times of crisis is, thus, to use this existing mechanism to the best effect. To put it rather bluntly, we should not tinker with the keel just because the wind is strong; the Pact is already flexible enough to allow room for the policy to adjust without undermining the foundations for a sustainable path. Indeed, EU countries are already facing considerable long-term challenges from the costs associated with population ageing that should be borne in mind when considering short-term demand policies. If the starting position is less strong, an inappropriate short-term response may make us literally “age faster” by exposing even more strongly the need for adjustments to cope with the long-term challenges. Countries with large deficit and/or debt levels may be particularly vulnerable in this regard. Unfortunately, many euro area countries entered the financial crisis and the economic downturn with unnecessarily weak fiscal balances, having missed the opportunity presented by past years’ revenue windfalls to consolidate their budgets. While this is never a popular message even in normal times, it still deserves mention so that the mistakes can be avoided once the crisis has passed. Indeed one of the fiscal policy errors prior to and including 2000-01 was to mistakenly interpret budgetary improvements in good times as evidence of structural improvements, which were often used to motivate spending increases or tax cuts. On a positive note, we can say that while compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact during its first ten years has been somewhat uneven, the EU’s overall fiscal performance in terms of avoiding high budget deficits and the build-up of government debt was much better than in the decades preceding the Pact.1 Indeed, some of the EU countries that comply with the Stability and Growth Pact can now take advantage of their relatively large automatic stabilisers to do much of the work. These accomplishments should be a guiding beacon. Sound fiscal policies with a strong keel provide the basis for stability and the necessary conditions for good long-term growth in the challenging seas ahead. One additional dimension of policy coordination in the euro area is that between the single monetary policy and the national fiscal policies of the Member States. In this respect, the institutional set-up of European Monetary Union consists of a clear and efficient assignment of objectives and instruments to the different authorities, together with a strict division of responsibilities. The ECB must focus on its primary mandate of delivering medium-term price stability under conditions of full independence. Fiscal policy must focus on its traditional objectives related to allocation, redistribution and stabilisation (to varying extents), while contributing to maintaining an environment of macroeconomic stability. Of course, in setting monetary policy the ECB takes into account the fiscal policy stance, as one of the factors which contribute to the outlook for price stability over the medium term. It goes without saying that an open exchange of views and information among the different authorities is welcome if it enhances a common understanding of desirable objectives and strategies to pursue them. However, there cannot be any scope for active ex-ante coordination of fiscal and monetary policies. Indeed, a commitment to ex ante coordination between fiscal and monetary policies may blur the responsibilities of the various authorities at the expense of accountability and may ultimately reduce their incentives to pursue their objectives. Thus, the current macroeconomic policy framework in the euro area based on a separation of responsibilities is the most appropriate to ensure sustained and non-inflationary economic growth. 2.2  More international monetary policy coordination? While cooperation in the field of liquidity management on an unprecedented scale has been certainly one of the hallmarks of public responses to the current turmoil, another example without precedents of central bank coordination was the decision by the ECB and five other                                                  1  See the article entitled “Ten years of the Stability and Growth Pact”, ECB Monthly Bulletin, October 2008. BIS Review 78/2009 3 
major central banks to ease global monetary conditions on 8 October 2008. Commentators and observers have wondered whether this concerted policy decision may be the beginning of a new era of increased international monetary policy coordination in response to economic and financial globalisation. It is important to stress that this coordinated interest rate cut was taken in a specific context and with a specific objective. There was extraordinary uncertainty at the time about the economic outlook and strong evidence that upside risks to price stability had diminished at the global level. The coordinated cut addressed the need to respond to a common shock that was being transmitted around the globe almost simultaneously. Through the joint communication, the international central banking community provided a signal of its strong commitment to responding to the macroeconomic implications of the financial market turmoil. There is no doubt that over the past three decades the trade, economic and financial linkages among the different regions of the work have grown tighter, and of course policy-makers take this into account in the design of their policies. However, when talking about international policy coordination, it is important to define clearly what we mean. Policy coordination does not mean, of course, that all central banks need to adopt the same policy stance for the entire world and certainly it cannot be a surrogate for domestic macroeconomic prudence nor weaken the commitment of each central bank to its institutional objective. Indeed, differences in cyclical positions, structures of the economies (e.g. in terms of market rigidities and frictions, sectoral leverage, financial systems, etc.), monetary policy institutional frameworks as well as shocks hitting the economy almost necessarily lead to differences in deciding the appropriate monetary policy stance. Thus, systematic monetary policy coordination may eventually come at the cost of weakening a central bank’s commitment to its institutional objective. For central banks, international policy coordination is better understood as the continuous cooperation and exchange of information at both staff and decision-making levels, shared experienced and mutual understanding and trust, which very much lies on the consensus among central banks that monetary policies geared towards domestic price stability, sound public finances and flexible economic structures do create the conditions for long-term economic growth and financial stability. 2.3  More international convergence in liquidity frameworks? Since August 2007 central banks have responded in a variety of ways to the financial market disruptions, reflecting differences in the extent to which markets have been hit by the turbulences, and differences in the design of their operational frameworks. However, in general all major central banks stepped up their intermediation role with a view to addressing the liquidity squeeze and, in doing so, they showed a certain degree of convergence in operating procedures. In particular, central banks: • Pursued more active reserve management, reassuring banks of their orderly access to overnight funds and increasing the frequency of their operations. • Increased the supply of funds (notably long-term); expanded to varying degrees the definition of collateral accepted in collateralised lending operations; provided access to collateralised lending to a large number of counterparties. • Adapted tender procedures for open market operations in the direction of price rather than quantity-based schemes, akin to those used for standing facilities. • As the turbulence developed, central banks strengthened their cooperation through enhanced communication and collective market monitoring and coordinated actions to provide liquidity. In this respect, a significant number of swap lines between central 4 BIS Review 78/2009 
banks have been set up to facilitate the distribution of foreign currency liquidity to domestic counterparties. Overall, one lesson we can draw from the turmoil is that there are certain key operational features that facilitate the implementation of monetary policy under stress. In particular, central banks are better positioned to distribute reserves effectively — when the interbank lending is impaired — if they are capable of providing access to collateralised lending operations on a large scale to a wide set of counterparties and against a broad range of collateral. Yet, a very important issue, on which I myself have no clear answer, is how – not so much whether but rather how – this convergence in the understanding of the “optimal” features of the operational framework under stress, should be reflected by the design of the operational framework in the steady state. For this, we need, in particular, to develop a better understanding of the optimal mix between private market and central bank intermediation and we need to carefully liaise with supervisory bodies. I should clarify that when I say “optimal” in this context, I do not mean “uniform”. To the extent that monetary policy strategies, central banks’ status vis-à-vis governments, and certain specific features of domestic financial systems persist, the optimal liquidity frameworks of each country or monetary union should reflect such country or area-specific factors. 2.4  More scope for direct lending to the real economy? An additional issue that has come to the fore during the present crisis, especially in the last few months, concerns the extent to which central banks may engage in direct lending to the real economy. This is not a purely theoretical subject, as the recent establishment by the Federal Reserve System of several liquidity facilities directed to non-banks shows (for instance, those directed to money market funds and issuers of commercial paper). In principle, the scope for direct lending by the central bank to the real economy should depend on the extent to which the malfunctioning of the money and credit markets distorts bank lending and prevents aggregate households and businesses from obtaining credit. In that sense, some central banks have decided to bypass the banking system and start lending to households and firms directly for the sake of preserving the orderly functioning of the economy. In practice, even abstracting from possible legal constraints (e.g. prohibition of monetary financing to the state in the European Monetary Union), there are several issues that central banks must consider before deciding on the appropriateness for their “own” economies of providing direct financing to the real sector. I stress the term “own” because this is one of those cases in which there is no unique answer. Whether or not a central bank engages in direct lending will very much depend on a number of considerations referring to structural features of the economy, the gravity of the crisis, the state of the financial system and a number of institutional factors, notably those governing the relationship between the central bank and the government. For instance, one apparently straightforward observation is that the need to provide direct credit to the economy at times of dysfunctions in banking activity is likely to depend on the relative importance of the banking sector for financial intermediation. Following this argument, one may argue that in a bank-based economy there may be relatively less need to provide credit to agents other than banks than in a market-based economy. Indeed, by focusing on providing support to the banking sector, the central bank may increase its chances of sustaining the economy as a whole. However, under extreme circumstances (notably, when the banking sector is no longer able to fulfil its institutional role as the main engine of financial intermediation), a central bank may reach the opposite conclusion: exactly BIS Review 78/2009 5 
because of the banking sector’s predominance in financial intermediation, its dysfunctional state might prompt a central bank to intervene before the entire economy comes to a halt. If so, the central bank will need to decide which sectors to target. Once again, this is not an easy choice. It may imply the need for the central bank to take decisions on the optimal allocation of resources in the economy which, historical experience shows, are better left to the private sector. Other concerns may relate to the risk of political pressure and government interference, especially if the scale of the financing programme requires support from the Treasury. If financing is ensured through the expansion of the central bank’s liabilities, this may give rise to more general concerns about the fiscal costs of actions taken by the monetary authority.2 Finally, but related to the previous arguments, direct lending to the real economy may imply an increase in the financial risks taken by the central bank, potentially exposing the latter to risks to its financial independence and, ultimately, to its institutional independence. The purpose of these remarks is certainly not to suggest that central banks should abstain from direct lending to the real sector, but rather to point out that the number of aspects to consider before doing so are so many and of such complexity that no central bank would ever take such a decision with a light heart. This is why, before embarking on such a policy, some central banks may prefer to provide indirect support (i.e. through banks) to the real economy.  Based on the considerations, the Eurosystem has chosen to make full use of the possibilities provided by its operational framework to support the economy, using the banking sector as an intermediary agent. Indeed, the euro area’s financial system is still predominantly bank-based, despite despite significant changes in the area’s financial landscape in recent decades (as a result of a number of structural developments, including the introduction of the euro). Just to illustrate this point, in 2007 aggregate bank lending to the private sector amounted to 145% of GDP in the euro area, compared with 63% in the US. By contrast, the ratio of outstanding debt securities issued by the euro area private sector relative to GDP (81%) was less than half than in the US.  Thus, banks play such a dominant role in the euro area economy that, guaranteeing steady access to credit for households and companies in the euro area to a large extent means preserving the viability of the banking system. The Eurosystem does so by providing banks with unlimited access at fixed rates to its refinancing operations (of course, against adequate collateral).  More recently, the Eurosystem has announced plans to purchase euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area to provide further support to credit provision by the banking sector. These purchases will target an important segment of the private securities market, which has been particularly affected by the financial market turbulence and will contribute to achieve the objective of maintaining the availability of credit for households and companies at accessible rates.  2.5  More weight given to asset prices in monetary policy? Another interesting debate that has gained – for obvious reasons – renewed interest and strength over the past year is the role that asset prices should take in the monetary policy design. Indeed, as we are experiencing at present, large volatility in asset prices can jeopardise the stability of the financial system and potentially undermine macroeconomic stability. The repetition of boom-bust cycles and the potentially very high costs for                                                  2  See Cukierman, A.

macroeconomic stability associated with the typically abrupt reversal of asset price bubbles beg the question: should monetary policy give more weight to asset prices? There are various arguments that must be carefully weighed in order to answer this question. First, we know that bubbles are extremely difficult to identify in real time. Assessing whether or not asset prices are being driven by fundamentals is surrounded with so much uncertainty — perhaps sometimes uncertainty in the “Knightian” sense — that central banks should refrain from targeting asset prices. Moreover, some hold the view that, while monetary policy actions can influence asset price developments, the magnitude of the swings in policy rates that would be needed to curb boom and bust cycles in asset prices at times of “irrational exuberance” could be so large as to have adverse implications for macroeconomic stability in the short term.3Based on these arguments, which are broadly shared in the central banking and academic community, one policy view (perhaps, the predominant view in the past years) postulates that it is better to wait for the bubble to burst on its own and then ease monetary policy aggressively to provide support to the banking system and to the economy. This is the so-called “mop up after” approach. In this case, sharp monetary policy easing after the bursting of the bubble is supportive of both price stability and financial stability, though at the possible expense of creating moral hazard and excessive risk-taking in future boom times.  An alternative approach consists of “leaning against the wind”. According to this approach, monetary policy should be conducted in a “symmetric” manner over the financial cycle. In other words, it should be accommodative at a time of falling asset prices, but restrictive during a financial market boom. For instance, the central bank should conduct a slightly tighter monetary policy than warranted by its price stability objective, when the build-up of a potentially detrimental asset price boom is identified. By doing so, the central bank would buy insurance against the risk of a harmful asset boom-bust cycle, with its potential costs in terms of macroeconomic and financial stability.  The main argument against this approach is that the insurance premium associated with such policy may be excessively high. In fact, a contractionary policy response to asset price increases may end up destabilising the economy if the asset price revaluation is driven by fundamentals. This risk is related to the difficulty that I have just mentioned concerning the identification of asset price misalignments in real time. This risk, however, should not act as a perfect alibi for policy inaction. As the recent literature on early indicators4 started by researchers at the BIS shows, there are indicators based on money and credit developments that can provide guidance on the nature and the consequences of extraordinary asset price developments, and thereby help to define the need for policy action. As the current financial crisis illustrates, the macroeconomic costs of financial instability and the challenges that it poses for the maintenance of price stability provide support to the case for a flexible “leaning against the wind” strategy. More generally, a lesson from the current crisis seems to be that central banks should assign a greater role to asset prices in monetary policy considerations and should aim to pre-empt the emergence of asset price bubbles.                                                   3  See Papademos (2009) for a review of recent arguments challenging the view that monetary policy is too blunt a tool to lean “against the wind” (“Monetary policy and the “Great Crisis”: Lessons and challenges”, Speech at the 37th Economics Conference “Beyond the Crisis: Economic Policy in a New Macroeconomic Environment”, Vienna). 4  See for instance Detken, C. and F.

BIS Review 78/2009 7 
How can one implement such a policy approach in practice? The answer very much depends on the monetary policy framework specifically adopted by a central bank. Central banks following inflation targeting, the most commonly adopted strategy among developing and emerging countries, may find it relatively difficult to make this approach fit in their policy framework. Indeed, inflation targeters tend to concentrate on the pursuit of price stability at specific horizons and generally assign low weight to the need to monitor asset prices or other indicators (notably, monetary and credit variables) that may signal the building up of financial imbalances.5In response to these concerns, some inflation targeters have specified further information, not included in macroeconomic forecasts, which should be taken into account in order to formulate monetary policy decisions. Such information includes, inter alia, the monitoring of credit and property price conditions. In addition, some inflation targeting central banks have relaxed the strict focus on a specific forecast horizon for monetary policy, by explicitly referring to a “medium term” horizon or by enlarging the horizon of their macroeconomic projections, also to take into account challenges stemming from asset price developments.  I should like to stress that the ECB’s two-pillar monetary policy strategy is well suited to cope with the challenges brought about by asset price developments.6 More precisely, there are two features of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy that may provide a suitable framework to implement a “leaning against the wind” approach: • First, the ECB’s definition of price stability objective – an inflation rate below, but close to, 2% in the medium term – allows the conduct of a more restrictive monetary policy during a period of booming asset prices, even in an environment of relatively subdued inflationary pressures. In this case, “leaning against the wind” would likely result in lower inflation over the short term, but would be expected to be more effective in maintaining price stability over the longer term, by helping to prevent the materialisation of deflation risks when the asset bubble bursts.  • Second, the ECB’s analysis of monetary and credit developments7 aimed at identifying longer-term inflation risks can also provide signals of growing financial imbalances, which could in principle be used to implement a policy of “leaning against the wind”. This is because there is a close link between monetary and credit developments and evolving imbalances in asset and credit markets.8 By exploiting this link, our monetary analysis (consisting of a comprehensive assessment of liquidity and credit conditions) may provide early information on developing asset price imbalances and, therefore, allow for a timely response to the implied risks to price and financial stability.  Thus, the ECB’s two-pillar strategy may represent a practical way of mimicking the “leaning against the wind” approach.                                                   5  Christiano et al. (2008) show in a recent paper that in a closed economy, the application of inflation targeting in a context of a rising bubble might lead to the policy stance actually encouraging the growth of asset price bubbles (see Christiano, L., C. Ilut, R. Motto and M. Rostagno (2008), “Monetary policy and stock market boom-bust cycles”, ECB Working Papers No. 955. October). 6  See also the April 2005 ECB Monthly Bulletin article entitled, “Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy and Trichet, J.C.

2.6  More central bank involvement in supervision? The recent financial market crisis has also highlighted the important role that central banks play in safeguarding financial stability and the need to increase interaction between central banks and banking supervisors. This need for increased interaction, also identified by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in one of its recommendations, would further support and enhance the central banks’ role in financial stability assessments, crisis management and resolution, and liquidity provision. First, with regard to financial stability assessment: central banks can benefit from extended access to supervisory information especially in relation to systemically relevant institutions, in order to identify risks and vulnerabilities for the financial system as a whole in a more efficient way. In this context, the FSB and the International Monetary Fund are already intensifying their cooperation with a view to enhancing the assessment of financial stability risks on a global scale, while in the EU the same is valid for the Banking Supervision Committee and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors. These efforts should also be mirrored at the national and regional levels, through the intensification of the cooperation and exchange of information between central banks and supervisory authorities for an overall better monitoring and assessment of risks to the financial system. The other side of this coin relates to the issue of incorporating the outcome of the financial stability risk analysis into policy action in the field of supervision, which also needs to be reinforced. Second, in the area of crisis management and resolution : the global nature of financial markets and the increased interlinkages between markets and institutions requires competent financial authorities, central banks, supervisors and ministries of finance to strengthen their coordination mechanisms for the management of crisis involving cross-border financial institutions. In the EU, an important milestone has been reached with the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the competent authorities of all Member States in June 2008. This MoU establishes common principles, procedures and terminology to be used by all parties involved in a cross-border crisis. Third, in relation to liquidity provision: in order to maintain stable money markets, central banks would benefit from enhanced access to supervisory information, including liquidity stress-testing and contingency funding plans of banks. At the same time, supervisors would benefit from information available at central banks, such as banks’ bidding behaviour. Overall, while the need for enhanced interaction between central banks and supervisory authorities is widely acknowledged, recent events have called into question whether improved interaction in cooperation suffices. In this context, the debate has recently turned towards the future supervisory architecture. In particular, the financial crisis has underscored the urgency of reviewing the EU supervisory framework, which is still based on national responsibilities against the background of increased financial market integration and the growing role of large cross-border financial institutions.  In response to these concerns, a High Level Group was set up under the chairmanship of Mr Jacques de Larosiére with the mandate to examine the allocation of tasks between the national and the European level. The final report of the group, published last February, includes a number of proposals to strengthen both macro- and micro-supervisory arrangements in Europe.  As regards the arrangements for macro-prudential supervision, the De Larosière report proposes to establish a European Systemic Risk Board under the auspices of the ECB, which should substantially improve the assessment of systemic risks to financial stability at the EU level. By assigning a strong role to central banks, and particularly to the ECB, the report recognises that these institutions should play a leading role in macro-prudential supervision.  However, in order for the new Board to perform its tasks in an optimal manner, it is important that three key requirements are fulfilled: BIS Review 78/2009 9 
• First, the ECB must have timely access to all relevant information, including that concerning individual institutions;  • Second, risk warnings from the new Council should be translated into effective policy action;  • And third, the new Council must have a solid institutional and legal basis in order to ensure independence and effectiveness of its decision-making processes.  3.  Concluding remarks The financial turmoil, which began in the summer of 2007, has developed over time into one of the most disruptive crises that the world has experienced in many decades. This is why from the start of the turmoil public authorities have undertaken interventions in key policy fields, including liquidity management, monetary policy and fiscal policy, which are unprecedented by number and scale. In addition, many initiatives have been undertaken to address weaknesses in the regulatory and supervisory framework in order to provide sounder foundations to our financial systems.  Despite our best efforts, we cannot yet see the light at the end of the tunnel and key financial markets and economic sectors remain under stress. It would be very difficult to predict when exactly our economies will return to normality, but I would be prepared to bet that, when this finally happens, the world will look different in many respects.  In this speech I have focused on six specific areas of relevance for central banks that are, to a varying extent, in a state of flux. They may all lead to changes in the environment in which central banks operate. By increasing our efforts to draw the right lessons from the crisis and implementing the necessary reforms, especially in the regulatory and supervisory frameworks, we can make sure that in the future the environment surrounding central banks will not be just different, but also more conducive to price and financial stability. 10 BIS Review 78/2009 
Philipp Hildebrand: Current state of the financial system in Switzerland Introductory remarks by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the half-yearly media news conference, Berne, 20 June 2009. *      *      * Introduction This time last year we reported that the overall market environment had calmed somewhat. However, we also stressed that it was too early to sound the all-clear, and that there was considerable uncertainty about the future development of the crisis. Our concerns at that time proved more than well-founded. Indeed, the actual events outstripped our expectations. If I may, I will start with my conclusion: the state of the Swiss and international financial system is – and remains – vulnerable overall. Consequently, we are still maintaining close contact with the big banks and with Swiss and foreign authorities, and are monitoring further developments with great attention. In addition we are continuing our intensive efforts at national and international level to improve the regulatory framework. Given the scale of the crisis, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is convinced that although the measures taken so far in this area are heading in the right direction, some of them do not yet go far enough. I will therefore begin by briefly assessing the situation of the financial system, and then present the issues to which the SNB attaches medium to long-term priority with regard to reform of the banking sector operating environment. In the short term, however, the main focus is on overcoming the crisis.  Situation in the banking sector As our Financial Stability Report published today describes in detail, the situation in the Swiss banking sector deteriorated considerably in 2008. The turbulence in the money and credit markets that had erupted in mid-2007 worsened in 2008, also spilling over to other areas. The two big banks, in particular UBS, were hit hard by these negative developments. As you know, together the two institutions recorded a total loss of some CHF 30 billion in 2008.1 They took extensive measures to strengthen their resilience. In addition to reducing risky positions, they raised sizeable amounts of private capital. The resilience of UBS was further strengthened by the package of government measures announced by the Federal Council, the SNB and the then Swiss Federal Banking Commission (SFBC, now FINMA or Swiss Financial Market Advisory Authority) in October 2008. Owing to all of these measures, the big banks’ capital situation at the end of 2008 improved slightly compared to the end of 2007, despite the massive losses incurred. However, our assessment is that, overall, risks in the big banks’ books are still material. This is all the more serious since, compared to the end of 2007, the profit potential of the big banks is lower.  Banks with a domestic business focus, i.e. cantonal, regional and Raiffeisen banks, present a much more favourable picture. Although the overall profitability of these bank categories declined in 2008, it still remains above the long-term average. Their capital base is high by historical standards and they were able to build up their liquidity reserves last year. However, for these banks, too, the economic downturn will represent an increasing challenge.  The outlook for the banks is also shaped by the negative forecasts for the entire world economy. These suggest a substantial deterioration in credit quality – including for                                                  1  The figures published in our publication, Banks in Switzerland, are reported at parent company level, not at group, or consolidated level. According to these figures, the total loss for the big banks amounted to some CHF 38 billion. Cf. press release of 18 June 2009 on Banks in Switzerland for further details. BIS Review 77/2009 1 
Switzerland. Consequently, increasing loan losses, substantial reductions in earnings and a deterioration in the capital situation may be expected for a large number of banks. However, cantonal, regional and Raiffeisen banks appear in relatively good shape to withstand these negative developments. The situation for the big banks appears more difficult. In addition to the still sizeable market risks, they face significant credit risks overall. Simple comparisons with earlier crisis periods show that potential losses on traditional lending are high, when set in relation to the capital cushion. The longer and deeper the recession, the greater these potential losses will be.  In our basis scenario we expect the economy to recover gradually as of 2010, both internationally and in Switzerland.  However, we cannot rule out a significantly deeper and longer-lasting recession than that forecast in the basis scenario. In this adverse scenario of a deep and long-lasting recession, large losses would be possible for banks with a domestic business focus as well as for big banks. Such losses might lead to a depletion of a substantial share of the banks’ current capital reserves. This might in turn impair market confidence in their soundness.  Given this risk potential, it is therefore essential that the big banks take all the necessary measures to ensure their resilience to any further significant deterioration in conditions. These measures include another reduction in their risk positions, a further strengthening of their capital base, the preservation of an adequate liquidity cushion and the alignment of their cost structure with the changed market environment. The opportunity offered by the somewhat calmer environment at present should be used to take these measures. The SNB and FINMA will monitor developments in these areas closely. In this respect, the SNB explicitly welcomes the fact that, at their last General Meetings, the big bank shareholders agreed to the creation of authorised capital. This allows the big banks to react appropriately and flexibly to market developments.  Regulatory agenda However, if the stability of the financial system is to be increased in the medium and longer term, the authorities themselves face challenges, and not just the banks. Intensive efforts are currently going into the development of appropriate solutions, both at the international level and in Switzerland.  Last autumn, for instance, the then SFBC issued decrees imposing tighter capital adequacy requirements on the big banks. In future, the capital base at these institutions will have to exceed, in good times, the minimum risk-weighted capital requirements by 100%. As a complement to this, FINMA has also introduced a “leverage ratio”, i.e. a limit to the banks’ leverage. The SNB considers that leverage of over 20 in the banking sector is not prudent and thus is undesirable in good times. In other words, we consider that, in good times, the capital base should account for at least 5% of the balance sheet total. This is in line with FINMA’s requirements. FINMA expects the big banks’ “leverage ratio” to be well over 3% at group level and well over 4% for individual institutions in good times. To prevent the capital requirements from having a procyclical impact, two steps have been taken. First, there will be a long time delay before they are implemented. The new FINMA targets will apply as of 2013 at the earliest, and an extension would be an option for the big banks if compliance becomes impossible due to the situation on the capital markets or the big banks’ individual earnings position. Second, an anticyclical element is explicitly built into the new Swiss regulations. In bad times, the big banks will be allowed to fall short of the new targets. In other words, a capital cushion will be built up in good times to absorb losses in crises. Alongside reinforcement of the capital base, liquidity also needs to be strengthened to increase the resilience of banks. Consequently, a comprehensive revision of the liquidity regulations for big banks is currently underway. Nonetheless, better capital and liquidity requirements do not rule out the possibility that banks will again face existential difficulties in 2 BIS Review 77/2009 
the future. The SNB therefore considers all of the efforts that are going into facilitating orderly wind-downs of large international institutions in future to be just as important. The lack of any clearly defined and internationally coordinated wind-down procedure contributes to a de facto obligation on the part of the state to provide assistance to these institutions. Any rescue of a large financial institution brings more than just high costs. The “too big to fail” issue also has a tendency to harbour incentives for banks to enter into excessive risks. In Switzerland, the “too big to fail” question is particularly relevant and, in many respects, unique, given the importance of the big banks for the country’s banking sector and its economy. A clearly defined and internationally coordinated wind-down procedure would help to ease this problem. The interplay between national jurisdictions is, however, extremely complex, and finding a solution for a predefined and internationally coordinated procedure of this kind is correspondingly challenging and time-consuming. The SNB therefore believes that careful consideration must also be given to alternative approaches. These include rules governing the organisational structure of large financial institutions. The aim of such rules would be, in a crisis situation, to split off those units of a bank that are important for the functioning of the economy and wind down the rest. This does not mean, however, that this type of approach would question the universal bank model as such. The SNB is aware that rules governing the organisational structure of large financial institutions are not easy to draw up. Legal and operational aspects would therefore need to be analysed with the requisite care and any regulations drawn up in close collaboration with the banks affected.  We are convinced that everything needs to be done to implement one of these approaches for facilitating the wind-down of large financial institutions. If significant progress is not achieved within a reasonable time frame, measures that address the size of the banks should also be examined. One way in which the size of a bank can be influenced is through capital regulations. Capital requirements that are dependent upon size reduce a bank’s incentive to inflate its balance sheet without restraint. Measures with a direct impact on the size of banks are also conceivable. A size restriction would of course be a major intervention in an institution’s corporate strategy. Naturally the SNB is aware that there are advantages to size. For this reason, the advantages and disadvantages of such a measure would have to be examined and weighed up very carefully. Nevertheless, in the case of the large international banks, the empirical evidence would seem to suggest that these institutions have long exceeded the size needed to make full use of these advantages. It should be noted that although the instrument of size restriction is far-reaching, it is by no means new in economic policy. For decades it has been one of the tools for preventing market dominance in the area of competition policy. Within the context of financial stability, the objective of such a measure would be to reduce risks to the stability of the banking and financial system, rather than to maintain competition.  I would like to run through the last few points again briefly. In the short term, priority must be given to overcoming the crisis. However, in order to increase the stability of the financial system in the medium to long term, we consider a reform of the operational environment in the banking sector to be essential. We attach particular importance to alleviating the “too big to fail” problem. Apart from stricter rules for systemically important institutions, the SNB currently envisages two further options that it intends to examine – first, measures to facilitate the wind-down of large, international institutions and, second, direct and indirect measures to limit their size. The SNB will examine all of these in depth, in close collaboration with FINMA, alongside possible further options. There can be no more taboos, given our experiences of the last two years.  The role of the authorities What are the lessons to be learnt from this crisis with respect to the role of the authorities? If the regulatory progress we are aiming for is also to be enforced, we need strong authorities. BIS Review 77/2009 3 
This applies, on the one hand, to FINMA, which is charged with oversight of individual banks, or microprudential oversight. FINMA needs sufficient qualified resources to fulfil its oversight responsibilities. On the other hand, the SNB must step up its own activities through an even closer collaboration with FINMA and also by reinforcing our macroprudential oversight. Unlike FINMA, the SNB does not supervise banks. We do not focus our attention on individual institutions but on the banking system as a whole. Our macroprudential oversight is largely complementary to the microprudential oversight carried out by FINMA. However, in Switzerland, overlaps occur naturally between the microprudential and macroprudential perspectives due to the systemic importance of the two big banks.  Within the ambit of its mandate, the SNB therefore considers it imperative to maintain direct and frequent contact with the big banks. Where necessary, we will step up the frequency and intensity of these contacts. Their purpose is to obtain information of relevance for macroprudential oversight, but also to inform the big banks of our risk assessment. The SNB will also become increasingly involved in regulatory projects that are relevant from a systemic point of view. Initial examples are the work on the introduction of a leverage ratio and on the reform of liquidity regulations, which FINMA and the SNB have been driving forward together. This development does not essentially call into question the division of responsibilities between the supervisory authority and the central bank. However, because of the importance of the big banks for our financial system and our economy, greater weight must be given to the macroprudential perspective, both in the oversight of the financial system and in its regulation. 4 BIS Review 77/2009 
Mark Carney: From green shoots to the harvest – comments on financial stability Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Regina & District Chamber of Commerce, Regina, Saskatchewan, 18 June 2009.  *      *      * It is a pleasure to be back in Saskatchewan. This great province has been one of the fastest-growing parts of the country in recent years, benefiting from increasing diversification into biotechnology, alternative energy sources, and carbon-management solutions, among other industries. Today, I will refer to the traditional backbone of this economy: agriculture. I do so because lately there has been much talk of "green shoots" in the global economy. From the initially careful references to data that suggested a slowing of the rate of decline in global activity, the use of the term "green shoots" has quickly evolved. Some now refer to green shoots as if the global recovery is a foregone conclusion or even as if sustainable growth had already begun. Would that it were so easy. Saskatchewanians know that it is a long, anxious time between the appearance of seedlings and the harvest. Much hard work remains, and external forces can profoundly influence the outcome: too little or too much rain, hail, pests, and disease can all frustrate even the most promising beginnings. And, in the end, global forces of supply and demand determine the prices received. Old adages usually contain great wisdom: Just as you don't count your chickens before they are hatched, we shouldn't presume that green shoots today guarantee a bumper crop tomorrow. Financial stability and the Bank of Canada I want to extend this analogy to provide some perspective on recent developments in Canadian financial stability. Financial stability is the resilience of the financial system to unanticipated adverse shocks. This resilience determines the extent to which Canadian households and businesses have access to the credit they need at appropriate terms and conditions. While our financial system is one of the soundest in the world, the ferocity of the once-in-a-lifetime global financial tempest has affected all Canadians, regardless of their location or occupation. So, does our financial system still leave us well positioned for our green shoots to mature into a viable crop of summer wheat?1  The Bank of Canada is well placed to make this judgment. As part of our commitment to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada, the Bank actively fosters a stable and efficient financial system. The Bank constantly assesses the major risks to the soundness of our system, and helps to develop policies to mitigate them. In essence, we worry not only about prospects of external shocks (the equivalent of weather or crop prices), but also about the buffers that our banks, businesses, and households have (the equivalent of the financial reserves farmers need to carry in case the harvest disappoints). Twice a year, the Bank publishes its Financial System Review, or FSR – the most recent edition appeared earlier this week. My talk today will draw on that analysis and assessment. I will concentrate on three risks, in particular: 1) the liquidity and funding positions of our                                                  1  Our financial system is only one of the factors that influence the outlook for growth and inflation in Canada. BIS Review 77/2009 1 
banks, 2) the adequacy of their capital, and 3) the financial health of Canadian households. I will conclude with a few observations on the economic outlook.  Assessment of overall financial stability  Since the autumn, the global economy has been in a deep and synchronized recession that was triggered by the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. In recent months, financial market conditions have improved noticeably and further, gradual progress is likely as numerous international policy initiatives gain traction. Equity markets have seen strong gains in recent months (see Appendix, Chart 1), and credit markets have also rallied (Chart 2). While there is still a long way to go before economic and financial conditions return to normal, markets seem to be turning their backs on worst-case scenarios. The panic that engulfed global financial markets last fall is over. Developments in Canadian financial stability over the past six months reflect the competing influences of improved financial market conditions on the one hand and a deterioration in the economic outlook on the other. Overall, the level of risk to the Canadian financial system is judged to be broadly unchanged since last December.  I would sound a note of caution familiar to those who work the land. We are well prepared but will still be tested. While the strong position of our banks has improved further in recent months and the balance sheets of Canadian households remain relatively sound, the global recession will mean that these reserves will be drawn upon in the months ahead.  Let me now turn to the three risks that I cited a moment ago, starting with liquidity and funding for banks. Liquidity and funding  At the heart of the financial crisis was the collapse of wholesale funding markets for banks. Since August 2007, the very short-term interbank and repo markets have been under great strain. During the most intense periods of the crisis around the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008 and Lehman Brothers and others in the fall of last year, these markets seized up entirely: Good collateral became unfinanceable overnight, firms failed, and risk aversion across all financial markets skyrocketed.  This crisis of confidence was less acute in Canada, but still produced severe strains in our wholesale funding markets. Heightened uncertainty made counterparties reluctant to extend financing beyond the shortest maturities, resulting in intense funding pressures for Canadian financial institutions. Banks cut back their market-making activities in order to conserve balance sheet capacity, which further aggravated market volatility. These dynamics raised the risk of an adverse feedback loop between the financial system and the real economy.  The Bank of Canada responded to these pressures by dramatically expanding our liquidity facilities, and the Government of Canada implemented a program to purchase insured mortgages with the help of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, thereby increasing the access of Canadian institutions to longer-term financing. Reflecting both the strength of our banks and the scale of our actions, conditions in Canada have been consistently better than elsewhere (Chart 3). Since December, these policies have gained considerable traction, helping to reinforce the improvement in domestic funding conditions as the global financial crisis subsided (Chart 4).  This improvement has been reflected in a decline in the spreads on bank financing in money markets, a moderate extension of maturities, and a substantial reduction in the cost of term funding for Canadian banks. In addition, policy initiatives have allowed banks to increase substantially their holdings of government securities, which has helped boost their liquidity situation in a capital-efficient way. These improvements have been further supported by 2 BIS Review 77/2009 
strong growth in retail deposits and slowing credit growth (Chart 5). Market-making activity in Canadian financial markets has also been recovering, although it remains less than satisfactory. Policy response There are important lessons to be drawn from this experience. The performance of core funding markets during the crisis intensified the financial panic and helped trigger the recession. This is totally unacceptable. As a consequence, one of the Bank of Canada's top priorities is to promote institutional changes to create more robust core funding markets. Promising avenues to break such (il)liquidity spirals include introducing clearing houses, standardizing products, implementing through-the-cycle margining, and ensuring more effective netting. As the ultimate provider of liquidity to the system, the Bank is thinking through whether to adapt its facilities to support continuous private liquidity creation. Bank capitalization  Since the crisis began, the capital adequacy of banks around the world has been the subject of intense scrutiny. Concerns moved quickly from bank exposures to U.S. subprime debt on to structured products of all types as the crisis spread and, finally, to more traditional credits to businesses and households as the recession took hold. Concerns about capital adequacy for banks outside Canada were made worse by uncertainties caused by accounting standards, valuation methodologies, and a loss of credibility of the Basel II regulatory capital standard. It was not lost on investors that every single financial institution that failed had a capital ratio well above its Basel II regulatory minimum the day before it went down. As a consequence, investors have demanded ever-higher capital ratios from all banks, creating a dynamic that has exacerbated the recession. In this context, Canadian institutions have benefited from several factors: high initial capitalization (minimums set by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions are well above the Basel threshold), high-quality capital (with one of the highest proportions of common equity), the clarity provided by a simple leverage cap, low exposure to structured products, and clear valuation and disclosure standards (including rapid implementation of the Financial Stability Forum's enhanced disclosure guidance of April 2008) (Chart 6). Writedowns by Canadian banks have been relatively moderate to date, reflecting their conservative lending practices and low exposure to highly impaired asset-backed products. But Canadian banks, as the principal source of finance in our economy, are still exposed to the risk of a marked deterioration in economic conditions, which would depress earnings and generate losses in their household and corporate loan portfolios. In general, this risk is why banks carry high capital buffers. The macroprudential risk is that these capital buffers may not be allowed to play their intended role in absorbing these losses because of market pressures to maintain inordinately high capital ratios. This could force banks to curb balance sheet growth, causing a tightening of credit conditions that would reinforce the negative impact of the economic downturn on the financial system. Reflecting the generalized nature of the financial panic, as the crisis unfolded, Canadian banks came under pressure from markets to increase their capital ratios. In response, Canadian banks raised significant additional, high-quality capital from private sources. The recent improvement in market sentiment has been reinforced by the release in May of the stress-test results for the 19 largest U.S. banks. These tests showed that the amounts of additional capital that need to be raised are manageable – indeed, more than half of the estimated shortfall has already been filled. The results have contributed to a general improvement of confidence in the global banking sector. To the extent that global levels of uncertainty and risk aversion have been lowered, this should also relieve some of the market BIS Review 77/2009 3 
pressure on Canadian banks to maintain inordinately high capital ratios. It would be welcome if buffers could serve their intended purpose, particularly in light of the extraordinary liquidity and funding support that public authorities have provided to our financial institutions. Policy response The crisis has undermined the credibility and demonstrated the procyclicality of the current bank capital regulatory regime. This, too, is unacceptable. An improved regime should be dynamic (with buffers and provisions moving through the cycle), simple (including Canadian-style leverage caps), and coherent (consistent with broader initiatives such as moving over-the-counter derivatives onto exchanges).2 The Bank is working with its domestic partners and is using its positions on the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision, at the Financial Stability Board, and in the G-20 to advance this goal.  In April, G-20 leaders made it a priority to find ways to reduce procyclicality in the financial system (procyclicality in the financial sector resembles the hog cycle, except that the boom-bust nature is further encouraged by regulations, accounting standards, and market practices).3 To that end, our latest FSR provides detailed analysis of key issues, ranging from reducing the procyclicality of bank capital regimes, compensation packages, and value-at-risk-based risk-management practices.4 The Bank will continue to devote considerable analytic resources to ensure Canada leads the G-20 effort to reduce procyclicality.  Household and corporate balance sheets  The resilience of our financial institutions is obviously directly affected by the financial resilience of Canadian households and corporations. Canadian firms entered this recession in very strong shape. Corporate leverage is close to an historic low and is substantially below that in other major countries (Chart 7).  The picture for Canadian households is more mixed. The starting point is relatively strong: The debt-service ratio has been stable over the past year and remains just below its long-term average. In addition, equity in Canadian homes is significantly higher than in the United States (Chart 8).  However, a deeper-than-expected recession has meant that stresses are rising. Income growth has slowed, and personal wealth levels have been eroded by lower house prices in some regions; credit growth has continued to outpace income growth, contributing to higher debt levels (Chart 9). At the same time, sharp increases in unemployment are raising the incidence of financial stress among households (Chart 10). Non-performing household loans and associated provisioning at Canadian financial institutions are thus increasing, although the deterioration in credit quality is being mitigated to some extent by the decline in effective borrowing rates (Chart 11).  The Bank has conducted a partial simulation exercise to estimate the impact on household balance sheets of a more severe economic downturn than currently envisaged, which would                                                  2  Given where we are in the current crisis, it should also be Augustinian; that is, new requirements should be phased in over time to avoid deepening the recession because of procyclical deleveraging. 3  When hog prices are high, more producers opt in to the market. As the product reaches maturity, there is an excess of supply, and prices fall. Given low prices, producers then cut back their production, leading to a shortage and a price increase once again. 4  This issue of the FSR includes the following reports: "Procyclicality and Bank Capital," by N. Arjani; "Procyclicality and Provisioning: Conceptual Issues, Approaches, and Empirical Evidence," by M. Misina; "Regulatory Constraints on Leverage: The Canadian Experience," by A. Crawford, C. Graham, and É. Bordeleau; "Procyclicality and Value at Risk," by P. Youngman; "Procyclicality and Margin Requirements," by N. Kamhi; and "Procyclicality and Compensation," by É. Bordeleau and W. Engert. 4 BIS Review 77/2009 
increase the unemployment rate to 10 per cent of the workforce. The results indicate that the associated rise in financial stress among households would lead to a significant increase in losses (which would reduce the Tier 1 capital ratios by about 1 percentage point) for financial institutions, which is well within their capacity to absorb (Table 1).  The economic outlook  The global economy is in the midst of a major synchronized recession. The Bank expects that growth will resume later this year but that the recovery internationally and in Canada will be more muted than normal. In part, this reflects the need to correct a series of imbalances across and within major economies. The recovery will initially owe much to monetary policy, which has been very aggressive, and to fiscal policy, which is beginning to have an impact. The effects of monetary and fiscal policy will reach full force in 2010. Self-sustaining demand in most economic areas is not yet imminent. It appears likely that the global economy is entering a period of lower potential growth. The substantial capital misallocation and financial excesses of the boom years will take years to work off. Recognizing the scale of the industrial restructuring and the decline in investment over that period, the Bank has sharply lowered its estimate for Canadian productivity growth and potential growth.  The shifting composition of global growth will have important implications for Canada. The current pattern of U.S. activity, with its weakness in the housing and auto sectors, is proving particularly challenging for our businesses. We expect the U.S. recovery to be relatively subdued compared with historical experience, given its need to reduce excesses, particularly of private debt.  More positively, the greater proportion of emerging-market growth in overall global growth should create new opportunities. Our research indicates that, even in the throes of the crisis, those emerging markets whose demand is most relevant to our exports are also generally the most resilient. These countries can be expected to make up an increasing proportion of global demand. This should provide an important support for commodity prices over the medium term. The Bank has acted proactively and aggressively to counter the major shocks to the Canadian economy. We eased our policy rate to the lowest possible level – 1/4 per cent – to support private demand and to achieve our 2 per cent inflation target. Conditional on the outlook for inflation, the Bank expects the policy rate to remain at its current level until the end of June 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. The Bank retains considerable additional flexibility, including unconventional measures, as outlined in the principles-based framework in our April Monetary Policy Report. Conclusion Despite the global crisis, the Canadian financial system remains resilient. Prior to the crisis, Canadian households, businesses, and financial institutions had not built up the high levels of debt that have made other countries vulnerable. Canadian banks have bolstered their already strong capital ratios with new private funds. Wholesale funding conditions have improved significantly and are among the most competitive in the world. The liquidity of bank balance sheets has improved. In short, our system is well positioned to face the strains of both the current recession and a more muted recovery. In farming, you are not in full control of your destiny, and your work is never done. Shocks frequently come from above. You may hope for the best, but you must plan for the worst. Even on the eve of summer, you know that it will soon be a long, cold winter, followed by another spring. The cycle begins anew, and the process is renewed as you constantly BIS Review 77/2009 5 
innovate by investing in new equipment and crop varieties. Ultimately, you are keepers of the land to pass on to the next generation. And so it is with financial stability. In a highly integrated global economy, shocks frequently come from abroad. We plan for the worst by trying to build a system that can absorb blows rather than amplify them. Canada has a strong system, but this crisis has proven that even the best is not good enough. Just like farmers, policy-makers need to innovate to make our financial system more resilient and efficient. This means more robust core funding markets, a better bank capital regime, and, more broadly, a series of measures to reduce procyclicality. The Bank will continue to work with our domestic and international partners to build such a financial system, so that the economic harvest in Saskatchewan and across Canada can be more consistently bountiful.        6 BIS Review 77/2009

Ben S Bernanke: Community development financial institutions – challenges and opportunities Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Global Financial Literacy Summit, Washington DC, 17 June 2009. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website. *      *      * I am pleased to be back at the Town Hall Education, Arts, and Recreation Campus for the Global Financial Literacy Summit. I commend the organizers and participants for their commitment to financial literacy. As Americans struggle with very difficult economic and financial circumstances, the importance of financial literacy and financial education has never been more evident. Organizations such as our host today, Operation HOPE, with its local Hope Centers, provide a vital service by helping adults and young people gain the financial knowledge they need to achieve their economic goals.  Community-based organizations such as Operation HOPE offer training and counseling to people in traditionally underserved markets, helping them to manage credit, buy homes, and start small businesses. As we reaffirm our commitment to increasing financial literacy as a means of improving economic opportunity, we should recognize that the contributions of community development organizations go well beyond providing information and guidance to individuals and families. These organizations also facilitate economic growth and development by offering a broad range of services and financing in low- and moderate-income communities. In this regard, a uniquely important role has been played by a group of specialized lenders known as Community Development Financial Institutions, or CDFIs. This morning I would like to offer a few thoughts about this important set of institutions and the challenges they face in the current economic and financial environment. We don't have to look too far to see the contributions of CDFIs. In this portion of Washington, D.C., east of the Anacostia River, CDFIs and other community-based organizations are working with private partners and with government in multifaceted efforts to spur development, add quality affordable housing, increase commercial activity, and better connect these neighborhoods to the broader regional economy. Community-based organizations such as CDFIs can play critical roles in these important undertakings because of their detailed knowledge of neighborhoods' economic needs and strengths and because of their commitment to their mission of community development. CDFIs and their role in community development CDFIs come in various forms. They may be banks, credit unions, nondepository loan funds, or venture funds. Generally, CDFIs strive to provide affordable and appropriate financial services to people and communities who traditionally lack access to such services. Depending on the institution and local needs, they may offer financing for homeownership, rental housing, commercial real estate, health care, small businesses, microenterprises, charter schools, and child care facilities, among other purposes.1 CDFIs often also work with traditional lenders to attract private capital for community development. A nearby example of such cooperation is the redevelopment of the long-vacant former Camp Simms National Guard site in Southeast D.C. That project, which included a local CDFI in partnership with                                                  1  Paul Weech (2009), "Observations on the Effects of the Financial Crisis and Economic Downturn on the Community Development Finance Sector," Working Paper Series 2009-5 (San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, May).

the D.C. government, a private developer, and a local community development corporation (CDC), led to the creation of a shopping area that included a much-needed grocery store and other commercial services.  In many ways, the formation of CDFIs represented an important milestone in the ongoing evolution of policy strategies for community development and revitalization. During much of the past century, federal community development efforts were large-scale, top-down affairs. As we have seen in the sphere of international development assistance, centralized, large-scale development efforts – though not without their successes – often imposed a one-size-fits-all approach that failed to take sufficient account of the particular needs and characteristics of local communities. In many cases, the results were disappointing or worse; for example, the so-called urban renewal programs of the 1950s and 1960s had what ultimately proved to be devastating effects on some areas. In response, the policy focus has shifted over time toward using tools that allow more-customized approaches to local needs, such as block grants and housing vouchers. The growth of local CDCs and the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act in 1977, which required most deposit-taking institutions to lend and invest throughout their business areas, exemplified the trend toward a more bottom-up approach to development.  By the late 1980s, new alliances formed among the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, creating a network of institutions that understood and were committed to serving local communities.2 In 1994, the Congress created the CDFI Fund, housed within the Treasury Department.3 The Treasury recently estimated that the fund attracts $15 in nonfederal investments for every dollar it invests in a CDFI.4In addition, the government provided new market-based incentives to attract private capital to community development. For example, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, created in 1986, offers credits to investors in affordable rental housing. The affordable housing developments, in turn, often rely on community-based organizations to help with development, financing, and property management. More than 2 million units of affordable rental housing have been built as a result of investors using the incentives offered by the program since its inception.5  Today, nationwide, there are more than 1,000 certified CDFIs with a collective $25 billion in assets.6 These organizations have loaned and invested billions of dollars in our nation's most distressed communities and have attracted many conventional investors into underserved areas. For small businesses in particular, CDFIs provide critical funding because many traditional creditors view such loans as too risky or, sometimes, too small to be profitable. As a complement to lending, CDFIs offer training and technical assistance to their customers, directly or through partnerships, thus increasing borrower capacity and mitigating loan risk. Successful CDFI borrowers often graduate to conventional financing as their needs grow,                                                  2  David Erickson (2006), "Community Capitalism: How Housing Advocates, the Private Sector and the Government Forged New Low-Income Housing Policy, 1968-1996," Journal of Policy History, vol. 18 (2), pp. 167-204. 3  The CDFI Fund was established by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, Pub.

thereby attracting the participation of mainstream lenders while freeing up CDFI resources to plant new seeds in the community.7Current challenges and opportunities for CDFIs CDFIs have certainly not been spared from the financial disruptions of the past two years. While many CDFI portfolios have continued to hold up relatively well despite the financial crisis, rates of delinquencies and defaults on CDFI loans have risen as economic conditions have worsened.8 In light of the mission of CDFIs, it is not surprising that their financial concerns often reflect economic distress in the broader community: the once-thriving local business that is shutting its doors, the affordable rental housing complex that is struggling to make payments as tenants lose jobs and fall behind, and the after-school youth center that cannot repay its loan because its donor base has shrunk. Even as the capacity of CDFIs has become more constrained, economic conditions and pullbacks by mainstream lenders have increased the demands being placed on these organizations to provide credit and services.9Traditionally, CDFIs have been able to fund a majority of their operating activities through earnings.10 However, those earnings have come under pressure as loan losses have risen, deal volumes have declined, and sources of capital for new activities have become more expensive or unavailable altogether. Moreover, CDFIs' main sources of outside capital and operating support are facing significant pressures of their own. Funding from philanthropic sources has been reduced as endowments have suffered capital losses and rates of giving have declined.11 Indeed, two-thirds of foundations surveyed recently reported that they plan to reduce the number and size of their grants in 2009, and cuts are expected to continue in 2010 and beyond.12 Funding from state and local governments that sometimes support CDFIs is also dwindling, reflecting increased fiscal pressures. And mainstream financial institutions have reduced their support of CDFIs, both by providing less direct funding and by extending less credit in support of projects done in partnership with them. Just as banks are adapting to the changing financial landscape, the community development industry can adopt changes to help it emerge stronger from this crisis. CDFIs are taking steps to minimize losses, strengthen their portfolios and liquidity positions, and assess existing activities and planned investments in light of the worsened financial and economic environment.  As CDFIs move past the immediate hurdles, however, careful consideration will need to be given to more systemic changes to correct weaknesses that have emerged in the current CDFI model. Notably, the reduction of funding by key participants highlights the importance of broadening and diversifying the industry's funding base. For example, in the case of the                                                  7  See "Observations on the Effects of the Financial Crisis," note 1. 8  The net charge-off rate in fiscal year 2007 was 0.55 percent (see "Providing Capital, Building Communities," note 6). From a survey of CDFIs in fiscal year 2008, a charge-off rate of 1.7 percent was reported. See Opportunity Finance Network (2009), CDFI Market Conditions Report: Fourth Quarter 2008, OFN, April. 9  In the fourth quarter of 2008, 63 percent of reporting CDFIs reported an increase in credit applications, while over the prior quarter, 52 percent saw an increase in delinquencies. See CDFI Market Conditions Report, note 8. 10  Earned revenues represent 53 percent of CDFI total operating revenues. See U.S. Department of the Treasury, Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (2007), Three Year Trend Analysis of Community Investment Impact System Institutional Level Report Data FY 2003-2005 (Washington: Department of the Treasury, CDFI Fund). 11  At last report, philanthropic sources made up 12 percent of capital and 25 percent of operating funds for CDFIs.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit markets, major investors, including several large banks and government-sponsored enterprises, sharply curtailed their investments in affordable housing as the value of the tax credits declined along with their profits.13 Continuing and expanding the current efforts to attract new investors to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit market could mitigate the overreliance on a few market investors. The same could be said for investors in projects supported by the New Markets Tax Credit, a program of the CDFI Fund meant to attract investment to low- and moderate-income areas.  Other ongoing efforts to access institutional funding and the capital markets should continue so that CDFIs can tap more-reliable sources of funding at wholesale prices. For instance, the Federal Housing Finance Agency recently introduced its rules for public comment on how certified CDFIs can become members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and access its lower-cost funds, as permitted under recent legislation. Such funding, with known pricing and terms, would be reliable and would help CDFIs manage their balance sheets more efficiently and inexpensively.  Prior to the financial crisis, some CDFIs had been making progress in gaining access to secondary financing markets. Although these markets remain disrupted, such efforts hold promise, especially to the extent that CDFIs are able to produce high-quality data and analysis of proposed investments. Good data, together with qualitative knowledge, is critical for identifying previously unrecognized market opportunities, assessing investment performance, and helping guide investors to make better decisions.  Finally, cultivation of nontraditional funding sources might prove fruitful. Increased interest by socially motivated individual investors has expanded the pool of investment capital for community development. One CDFI has created a product similar to a mutual fund where individuals purchase "community development notes" that are invested in community development organizations. The fund has raised capital from about 4,700 individuals and invested about $160 million; further, it has performed well, with an average 3 percent rate of return to investors and very low loss rates.14 Even during the recession, new investors have been drawn by the appeal of supporting low- and moderate-income communities while earning relatively good rates of return. Other developments, such as emerging peer-to-peer lending platforms, also hold promise.  While community development finance is a small part of our overall capital and credit markets, the Federal Reserve recognizes that these financial flows are critically important for many low- and moderate-income communities. In fact, the Board of Governors has been working with several of the Federal Reserve Banks to promote research on how best to promote CDFIs' effectiveness and financial stability.15The current crisis points to the importance of a strong network of healthy community-based organizations and lenders. As many communities struggle with rising unemployment, high rates of foreclosures, and vacant homes and stores, these organizations lead efforts to stabilize their neighborhoods. Rather than pulling back, CDFIs are introducing new products and programs to help communities respond to the crisis. For instance, a number of groups                                                  13  Angelyque Campbell and Jennie Blizzard (2008), "Community Development Finance: Innovative Paths to Capital during the Credit Squeeze," Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, MarketWise, Fall/Winter. 14  Data from audited financial statements on the Calvert Foundation Community Investment Notes, as of year-end 2008.

are purchasing homes, which might otherwise sit vacant, from loan servicers who take possession of foreclosed properties. These homes are repaired and then sold or rented to families. Because foreclosures and resulting vacancies impose costs on neighborhoods and local governments, facilitating occupancy can help maintain neighborhood stability.16 These efforts are difficult, time consuming, and challenging to finance – exactly the kind of thing in which CDFIs specialize. CDFIs and other groups across the country are working hard to stabilize neighborhoods because they do not want to lose the progress attained by years, and sometimes decades, of investment in low- and moderate-income communities. Indeed, this community stabilization work is important for the overall economic recovery. Healthy and vibrant neighborhoods are a source of economic growth and social stability. CDFIs and other community groups are already responding to the evident needs, but they will require many willing partners to ensure success in the long run, including governments, mortgage servicers, and mainstream lenders. Strong community organizations can accomplish a great deal, but their capacity will be severely limited without the willing partnership of many other institutions.  Conclusion As the effects of the financial crisis and the resulting economic downturn have spread, there has been increased focus on preserving the gains made in low- and moderate-income communities over recent decades. Accomplishing that objective requires preserving the institutions that helped build these communities. Without strong CDFIs, attracting investments and capital to rebuild and revitalize communities would be even more difficult. Economic recovery, like economic development, is a bottom-up as well as a top-down process. Through their work at the community level, CDFIs, together with other community development organizations, can help build a sustainable recovery for all of us.                                                   16  In particular, recent research points to the adverse spillover effects of foreclosures on local property values. See, for example, Zhenguo Lin, Eric Rosenblatt, and Vincent W. Yao (2009), "Spillover Effects of Foreclosures on Neighborhood Property Values," Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, vol. 38 (4), pp. 387-407. BIS Review 76/2009 5 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Celebration of 130th Anniversary of the Bulgarian National Bank Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the Gala Event of the Celebration of 130th Anniversary of the Bulgarian National Bank, Sofia, 12 June 2009. *      *      * Dear President, Dear Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, Dear Governor Iskrov, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great honour and a pleasure for me to be here this evening and to address you on the occasion of the 130th Anniversary of the Bulgarian National Bank. I should like to start by thanking my colleague, Governor Iskrov for inviting me to do so.  The Bulgarian National Bank has good reasons to proudly celebrate this historical date: The achievements during the last 130 years have been many. The Bulgarian National Bank, like most of the other central banks with a long history, did not arise as the institution we know today. It has evolved over time. Since its establishment in January 1879 as a government credit institution with an authorised capital of two million French francs, the Bulgarian National Bank has come a long way. Progressively, it acquired new and increasingly complex functions and duties. It has also established over time close relationships with the rest of the banking and financial system, both at home and in the international sphere. Being the guarantor of the Bulgarian people’s money, the Bulgarian National Bank has become one of the most respected public institutions in this country.  During its long existence, the Bulgarian National Bank has been confronted with several challenges, some of them of great significance. Equally, since 1881, the year of the introduction of the lev – which I have been told in ancient Bulgarian means “lion” –, the Bulgarian National Bank has to deal with several major institutional changes. The most recent took place in 1997 when a currency board arrangement to the Deutsche Mark was adopted. In 1999, the latter was replaced by the euro. Before the actual accession of Bulgaria into the EU, a Cooperation Agreement was signed by the ECB and the Bulgarian National Bank in January 2005. Moreover, under the leadership of Governor Iskrov, the ECB and the Bulgarian National Bank worked intensively together on the Bulgarian National Bank’s Law to bring the independence of the central bank generally in line with EU legislation However, some additional changes still need to be made to ensure that legislation in the monetary field is fully in line with the provisions of the Treaty. Following Bulgaria’s entry into the EU on 1 January 2007, the integration of the Bulgarian National Bank into the European System of Central Banks has been smooth, and the work carried out by the Bulgarian National Bank members in the respective ESCB committees has been noticeable, delivering high quality standards.  The work of the Bulgarian National Bank, and its commitment to maintaining price stability, has also contributed to improving the living standards of the Bulgarian people. No doubt, during the last years, Bulgaria has accomplished significant progress. Yet, as you know, the current economic situation is extremely challenging. So far, the Bulgarian economy has been relatively resilient to the global financial crisis inter alia, thanks to the sound supervisory policies conducted by the Bulgarian National Bank. But this is no time for complacency in any respect. It remains essential for all economies, including BIS Review 76/2009 1 
Bulgaria, to pursue very actively the reform process and to pave the way for sustainable macroeconomic developments that are of the essence in the medium term. Bulgaria doesn’t have to take on these challenges alone. Solidarity is a key feature of the European Union and thus an inseparable part of the integration process. For instance, net transfers from the EU budget to Bulgaria amounted to close to EUR 600 million in 2007, about 2% of GDP. And recently, the Commission has put forward plans to accelerate payments under the European Social Fund for an amount of EUR 19 billion in 2009-2010, an important part of which (35%) is destined for Central and Eastern Europe.  There is of course no substitute for sound policies. That is why I should like to encourage the Bulgarian authorities in this very important occasion to be ambitious. To be ambitious enough in pursuing sound and stability-oriented economic policies that can bring sustainable economic growth in the medium and long term. This applies, in particular, to the conduct of sound fiscal policies and to the implementation of timely and consistent structural reforms that support the sustainability of the convergence process. All economic policy actors without exception need to be committed to the achievement of this goal. As the beautiful words written in front of the Bulgaria’s National Assembly remind us – “There is strength in numbers”. At the ECB, we stand ready to preserve and reinforce our dialogue with the Bulgarian National Bank, a dialogue that has proven very fruitful in the past. I am confident that our excellent working relationships will continue to serve both our institutions well. Happy birthday, Bulgarian National Bank! CHESTIT ROZHDEN DEN BNB! 2 BIS Review 76/2009 
Bandid Nijathaworn: Financial developments and the Thai banking sector Keynote address by Dr Bandid Nijathaworn, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the Third Euromoney Thailand Investment Forum, Bangkok, 10 June 2009.  *      *      * Thank you and Good morning First let me thank Euromoney for the invitation. It is an honour to be speaking to you today. For the last few years that I have been coming to this forum to speak, I find the session to be very useful as it provides an excellent opportunity for us at the Bank of Thailand to interact and share our views with investors on Thailand’s current issues, including our policies. So, it is a pleasure to be here this morning. My topic today is about financial developments and the Thai banking sector. Given the limitations of time, I want to focus my remark today on two issues. The first is the short-term issue about the current economic and financial conditions, and the policy response that we have had in trying to strengthen the process of recovery. Next, I will speak on the medium-term issue of financial sector reform, beginning with how we see the new or the post-crisis financial landscape emerging and our plan to respond to these changes in the context of our financial sector Master Plan. First, the current conditions. Latest economic data in Thailand continues to show deterioration in economic activities as evidenced by the estimated decline of 7.1 percent in this year’s first quarter GDP growth. However, most recently, while the overall domestic activities remain weak, more positive signs on the real sector are emerging, especially in the monthly April data that show greater stabilization in the pace of contraction on a month-on-month basis, of exports, manufacturing output, capacity utilization, and private consumption, as well as a narrowing of the trade surplus.  On the financial front, recent rally in equity prices is also positive. The rally, which is largely liquidity driven, is indicative of two developments that are taking place in our financial markets at this time: first, the resurgence of capital inflows linked to the return of risk appetite globally; and second, the search for yield by Thai savers, on account of the low nominal deposit rates, which sees savings shifting away from bank deposits to other instruments. Hence, the latest round of deposit rates increase by banks can be seen as a response to this development. On liquidity, at this time, liquidity in the Thai banking system remains ample. Loan-to-deposit ratio, including B/E, was at 83.9 percent in April. Bank credit continues to grow on a year-on-year basis, but fell by 2.7 percent since December last year. The decline largely reflects the fall in corporate loan demand on account of the slowing economy. Consumer credit and mortgage loans, on the other hand, continue to register positive growth, and this has provided an important underpinning for consumer spending thus far. Inflation, on the other hand, continues its downtrend in May, and although we see inflation numbers turning negative, the current uptick in commodities and asset prices, together with signs of greater stabilization in the real sector, help lessen the concern regarding deflation risk. Against this background, the Monetary Policy Committee in its meeting on May 20th held the view that monetary policy has been substantially eased and the current policy rate at 1.25 percent remains supportive of the economy. Two implications must be drawn from this decision. First, given the low policy rate and the ample availability of liquidity, more gains could be made by ensuring that, at the current policy rate, the benefits of past rate reductions are passed on more fully to consumers and the private sector through corresponding adjustments in the banking system’s interest rates. The second implication is that, while the BIS Review 76/2009 1 
emerging signs of stabilization are positive and are consistent with the developments on a worldwide basis, they must be treated with caution given that the current state of the global economy and financial markets are still far from normal. Hence, the MPC will continue to monitor closely the uncertainty surrounding both domestic and external economic conditions, and stand ready to implement appropriate monetary policy to support economic recovery in the period ahead. Turning now to the banking sector. The Thai banking sector was able to weather the impact of the global financial crisis with a relatively strong initial position. These strengths are found in the sector’s strong capital base, its limited exposure to subprime-related and other toxic assets, and its low reliance on external funding. As a result, the impact of the crisis on the Thai banking system so far has been limited. The Thai banking system is resilient with good fundamentals, and continues to function normally to support the economy. In the last two quarters, despite the consecutive negative GDP growths, the performance of the Thai banking sector remains satisfactory. The sector continues to see profits in the last two quarters, while the increase in the non-performing loans has not been large. This robust performance reflects a number of common responses that have been undertaken by the banks to manage the increase in credit and market risks. The responses include parring down of investment in foreign assets, lowering the loan growth target in line with the economy, strengthening risk management and credit standards, paying close attention to liquidity, and acting early to assist clients to adjust to the impact of the shock. These measures have helped banks to contain credit risk, and so far we have seen the gross NPL ratio rising slightly to 5.5 percent in March from 5.3 percent in December. As for the Bank of Thailand, our approach to bank supervision during this time of global stress is to ensure that the banking system is healthy, and the system continues to operate fully to support the economy with good risk management and adequate capital. So far, this is very much the picture we are seeing. At end of March, the BIS ratio for capital adequacy for Thai banking system is 14.9 percent, of which the level for tier-one capital is 11.8 percent. On the issue of credit extension, to ensure adequate flows of credit to the economy, our approach has been to rely on market mechanism by encouraging greater competition amongst banks with regard to interest rates adjustment through a process of close consultation and dialogue. The recent round of bank’s lending rate adjustment following the last MPC meeting is a case in point. In addition, to help banks better manage the increased credit risk, a credit guarantee scheme backed by government funding has been set up to promote SME lending by banks. Also, to help resolve problems related to bank lending, the Bank of Thailand has set up a customer-call center to look into problems related to loans application and approval between customers and banks.  Going forward, the slowing economy will continue to put pressure on the asset quality of banks. Therefore, managing credit risk will continue to be an overriding focus of Thai banks this year. To do this effectively, banks need to have in place both a strong capital base and a good risk management system, both of which have been strengthened significantly in the past years in line with Basel II and international best practices. Therefore, this should enable our banks to manage risk adequately going forward while supporting the economy. Let me now turn to the second topic which is the medium-term issue of financial sector reform. Although the Thai financial sector has proven resilient amidst the global crisis, reform of our financial sector needs to continue to ensure that the sector is well positioned to fully support the economy, in terms of efficiency and diversity of products. In addition, the current crisis will definitely bring about important changes in the global financial landscape, as well as in the regulatory approach to bank regulation and supervision. This means the reform process must help position the financial sector to adapt to the emerging financial landscape, while contributing to increasing efficiency and the robustness of the financial system. On this issue, key trends that we can expect to see in the emerging financial landscape will include, on the demand side, consumers becoming more risk averse and having preference 2 BIS Review 76/2009 
for local institutions and for simplicity of transactions and instruments, while demanding greater accountability and transparency. On the banking side, business models of banks will become more conservative, relying less on wholesale funding and on the use of leverage, while giving greater importance to risk management and higher liquidity buffer. And on the regulatory front, more emphasis will definitely be on surveillance with focus on systemic stability, and the roles of systemically important financial institutions including the non-bank. These changes are the key essentials that will define the emerging financial landscape to which we will need to adjust. To ensure that Thailand reaps the benefits of the changing landscape and is in the position to mobilize resources for investment and support economic growth, the Bank of Thailand is set to launch the second phase of our financial sector Master Plan this year to further enhance efficiency, robustness, and competitiveness of the Thai banking system.  Our Financial Master Plan Phase II aims to promote financial system efficiency so that financial institutions can perform their functions more efficiently, becoming more competitive, with increased financial access to the public. The plan essentially comprises three pillars. The first pillar is to improve the regulatory environment and to reduce the unnecessary regulatory and legacy costs. The focus in this pillar will be on streamlining regulation, and on promoting measures and incentives to deal with legacy NPA and NPL, without compromising prudential oversight or good risk management.  The second pillar is to enhance efficiency by injecting more competition into the financial system. The focus will be on financial liberalization, increasing competition from the current and new players, and promoting greater financial access. The latter will give importance to expanding the retail banking businesses and promoting new microfinance business models and players.  And the third pillar is to substantially improve the economy’s financial infrastructure in the areas of risk management, credit information system, legal reform, information technology, and upgrading the quality of human resource. Such infrastructure is crucial for banks so that they can attain greater efficiency and more effective risk management at a lower cost. I will not have time today to dwell on the details of the plan, let me just say that the plan is now complete and is currently being considered by the finance ministry, and is scheduled to come into effect this year. It is our hope that this continuing momentum of reform will help expand the competitiveness and the growth of the Thai financial sector and the economy in the years to come. I probably have used up my allotted time. Again, I want to thank Euromoney for the invitation. It has been a pleasure and thank you for your attention. BIS Review 76/2009 3 
Lucas Papademos: ECB Financial Stability Review June 2009 – opening remarks Opening remarks by Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the June 2009 ECB Financial Stability Review, Frankfurt am Main, 15 June 2009. The original speech, which contains various charts to the speech can be found on the European Central Bank’s website.  *      *      * I.  Introduction  My colleagues and I would like to welcome you to today’s press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the June 2009 edition of the ECB Financial Stability Review. The financial stability assessment contained in the Review has been prepared with the close involvement of the ESCB Banking Supervision Committee. The Review examines in detail the main trends and events that characterised the euro area financial system over the past six months1 and it contains 15 boxes and five special feature articles that address topical financial stability issues in a more focused and analytical manner. As done for the first time last December, we have prepared a summary note that highlights some key messages of our analysis and assessment. Many of the downside risks to euro area financial stability that were identified in the December 2008 issue of the FSR have crystallised.2 In particular, the further significant deterioration in global macroeconomic conditions as well as sizeable downward revisions to growth forecasts and expectations have added to the stresses on global and euro area financial systems. The contraction of economic activity and the diminished growth prospects have resulted in a further erosion of the market values of a broad range of assets. The adjustment of bank balance sheets has adversely affected the market pricing of assets and the financial intermediation role of banks in channelling funds from savers to investors. Moreover, there have been increasing signs of an adverse feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector which poses new challenges for the safeguarding of financial stability.  II.  Sources of risk and vulnerability II.1.  Risks in the global macro-financial environment  The primary objective of the Financial Stability Review is to identify the main sources of risk to, and vulnerability for, the financial system stability in the euro area and to provide an assessment of the system’s capacity to absorb adverse disturbances. As the global financial and economic turbulence is still ongoing, let me start by examining risks to euro area financial stability stemming from developments in the global macro-financial environment.                                                  1  The analysis and assessment contained in the Review is for the most part based on information that was available until the “cut-off” date of 29 May 2009. 2  These risks included the possibility of: a further deterioration in the US and the euro area housing markets and the impact it could have on banks’ loan quality and the value of securities backed by mortgage-related assets; a deeper and more prolonged slowdown in both the global and the euro area economy that could cause a sharper and broader deterioration in borrowers’ ability to service their debt; a more pronounced de-leveraging by banks, due to persistently high funding costs and concerns about the adequacy of capital buffers, which could negatively affect the flow of credit extended to the broader economy; and a surge in financial market volatility caused by a further unwinding of positions by hedge funds. BIS Review 75/2009 1 
Over the past eight months, the crisis has broadened and affected most countries, including advanced, emerging and developing countries. US household sector Developments in the US economy, particularly in the household sector, continue to be central to the global financial stability outlook. There are two reasons for this: first, the important contribution of US consumer spending to global economic activity; and, second, the continuing high exposure of global financial institutions to securities backed by US mortgages and consumer loans. According to the IMF, these exposures amount to USD 1.3 trillion.  Since the end of 2008, private consumption in the US has recovered somewhat after a significant decline in the second part of 2008. This decline resulted from weak income growth, rising unemployment and a rapid deterioration in the balance sheets of US households. Total net household wealth in the US declined by USD 7.8 trillion (or 13%) in the second half of 2008. The outlook for household wealth in the US depends on many factors, amongst which the future evolution of US house prices is important. Chart 1 shows that, according to the Case-Shiller futures price index for 10 major US cities, prices are expected to fall by a further 14% from their current levels, before bottoming out by mid-2010. Moreover, delinquency rates on mortgages and on all other types of household loans have exceeded the peak rates recorded in the previous downturn in 2002-2003. US corporate sector The delinquency rates on US commercial and industrial loans also picked up but have remained lower than those on household loans and well below the levels reached during the 2002-2003 recession. This suggests that the US corporate sector has proven relatively resilient to the turmoil thus far. However, the outlook for the US non-financial corporate sector has deteriorated. As shown in Chart 2, US corporate profits fell further in the second half of 2008. Both domestic profits and those from the rest of the world contributed to the decline on a year-on-year basis. The turn in the corporate credit cycle has also been reflected in the rise of speculative-grade corporate default rates since the end of 2007, which over the course of the next 12 months are projected to reach levels far above the peaks in the early 1990s and in 2001. The expected sharp increase in US speculative-grade corporate defaults could cause a widening of credit spreads and exacerbate funding problems. Moreover, it could adversely affect the US labour market and consumer spending. Risks in the Emerging Market Economies and in new EU member states In emerging market economies, macroeconomic conditions have continued to worsen significantly, reflecting the confluence of weaker external demand, tighter financing constraints and falling commodity prices. In Central and Eastern Europe, economic and financial conditions deteriorated sharply, as a consequence of reduced capital inflows, the collapse of international trade and declining domestic demand. Although the economies of these countries are heterogeneous, many were highly vulnerable to a reduction in capital flows because their economic expansions had been financed to a considerable extent by external borrowing. Reduced external demand has also had a significant impact on several countries in the region. As a result, credit growth to the private sector has decelerated rapidly, and there is an emerging risk of a vicious circle between weakening economic activity and deteriorating asset quality. Against this background, as shown in Chart 3, sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads increased sharply in early 2009, especially in those economies with a large fiscal deficit and a wide current account deficit, and where domestic demand has weakened significantly. The CDS spreads have narrowed substantially since March 2009, but they remain at levels well above those in the first half of 2007. The risk to the euro area economy relates both to the close economic links with these countries as well as to the large exposures of a number of euro area banks to the region.  2 BIS Review 75/2009 
II.2.  Risks in the euro area non-financial sectors  Let me now focus on risks and vulnerabilities that we have identified in the non-financial sectors of the euro area economy. The intensification of the strains in the financial sector in the last quarter of 2008 has set in motion a negative interplay between the financial sector and the real economy which emerged more clearly at the beginning of 2009.  Euro area macroeconomic environment The pace of economic activity has slowed significantly since October 2008. Especially in the first quarter of 2009, we witnessed a substantial and broad-based contraction of euro area activity. Both external and domestic demand are expected to decline further in 2009 and gradually recover in 2010. As shown in Chart 4, private sector forecasters and international institutions have been revising downwards their estimates of real GDP growth for 2009 and 2010.  This assessment is broadly in line with the June 2009 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area published on 4 June, according to which annual real GDP growth will range between -5.1% and -4.1% in 2009 and between -1.0% and 0.4% in 2010, that revised downwards the ranges of projected GDP growth, particularly for 2009, compared with the March 2009 ECB staff macroeconomic projections. The projected gradual recovery next year, with rates of growth returning to positive levels by mid-2010, reflects the effects of the significant macroeconomic stimulus under way as well as of the measures taken so far to restore the functioning of the financial system both inside and outside the euro area. Box 5 of the Review provides a comparison of the amplitude and time profile of “normal” economic cycles with those observed during past episodes of banking crises. The latter were characterised by a more protracted U-shaped recession, while the former involved a sharp decline in activity followed by a swift recovery. Nevertheless, in recent weeks, there have been signs – both within and outside the euro area – that the pace of deterioration in activity is moderating and that consumer and business sentiment is improving though still remaining at low levels. In addition, there may be stronger than anticipated effects on activity stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus under way and from other policy measures taken. Confidence may also improve more quickly than currently expected. At the same time, concerns remain about the following potential downside risks: a stronger impact on the real economy from the financial market turmoil, more unfavourable developments in labour markets, the intensification of protectionist pressures and adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. Euro area non-financial corporate sector  Concentrating on the euro area non-financial corporate sector, lower sales volumes and profit margins have caused a substantial weakening of corporate profitability which is expected to persist in 2010. Firms in the euro area entered the economic downturn with a relatively high leverage ratio. Reduced profits hamper firms’ ability to generate internal financing while, at the same time, external financing conditions are likely to remain tight, as long as banks continue to de-leverage and other funding markets remain under stress. Non-financial corporations’ default rates for both euro area and European firms have started to increase. The European speculative grade-rated corporations’ default rate is expected to jump to almost 20% by the end of 2009, as shown in Chart 5. Furthermore, credit rating agencies began revising downwards their ratings of non-financial corporations in December 2008. Box 6 of the Review takes a closer look at the outlook for corporate defaults. It concludes that given the extraordinary nature of recent developments in the financial markets, current forecasts could prove too pessimistic despite the sharp decline in economic activity. The prospect of global and European speculative-grade corporations’ default rates increasing substantially implies a significant risk to the financial system.  BIS Review 75/2009 3 
Another source of risk is the commercial property market where conditions continued to deteriorate over the past six months. In the first quarter of 2009, commercial property prices actually fell in all 13 euro area countries for which data are available. The outlook will remain unfavourable until economic and financial conditions improve and investor appetite for commercial property returns. Potential further losses constitute a significant risk for many banks since commercial property loans in the euro area on average account for about 10% of total loans and, in many cases, exposures are even much larger.  Euro area household sector  Turning to the household sector, euro area house price increases continued to ease in 2008, as shown on Chart 6. In at least six euro area countries house prices have declined on an annual basis. These developments have been associated with a moderation of both housing demand and supply, but the balance of the changes in demand and supply has been putting downward pressure on prices.  The annual rate of growth of loans to the household sector declined sharply in the final quarter of 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting the deterioration in housing markets, weakening economic conditions and prospects, and the ongoing tightening in credit standards. According to the results of the April 2009 ECB bank lending survey, a further dampening of households’ demand for housing loans is expected due to worsened housing market prospects and low consumer confidence.  II.3.  Risks in the euro area financial system  Euro area money markets Let me now focus on the euro area financial system. Over the past few months, developments in several financial markets give rise to some optimism. Although market liquidity in the euro area is still tight, it has improved appreciably, especially in the interbank money market.  Since mid-February, conditions in the euro money markets improved. This is reflected in the lower utilisation of the ECB deposit facility and in higher overnight unsecured interbank transaction volumes. More importantly, money market rates have declined substantially and the spreads between Euribor rates and EONIA swap rates have continued to narrow, as shown in Chart 7. In late May 2009, the spread between the 3-month Euribor and the EONIA swap rate had fallen below 50 basis points for the first time since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. In shorter maturities, money market spreads have narrowed even further. These positive developments are a consequence of the extensive provision of liquidity and other policy measures taken by the Eurosystem. Forward Euribor-EONIA swap spreads in the three-month maturity indicate that these spreads are expected to continue narrowing in the coming months.  Euro area government finances An important development in financial markets was the marked increase in the net issuance of euro area government debt securities at the end of 2008 and early 2009, as shown in Chart 8. New debt issuance has mainly been in the form of short-term debt, partly because the steeper yield curve has made short-term financing relatively cheaper. The national bank support schemes, which were announced in October 2008, were perceived by investors as a credit risk transfer from the private to the public sector. This is reflected in the widening of government bond spreads relative to Germany and the increasing divergence in CDS spreads in the first quarter of 2009, especially in those countries with a weaker public finance position and a relatively large financial sector. Since March 2009, however, a narrowing of bond and CDS spreads indicates some improvement in investors’ confidence in the euro area sovereign bond markets.  4 BIS Review 75/2009 
Euro area equity markets  In mature economies, stock market valuations have steadily improved since early March of this year and the major equity indices both in the euro area and globally have more than recovered the losses of the first two months of the year, while volatility has also declined. As shown on Chart 9, several equity valuation measures, including the ratio of equity prices to long-term past corporate earnings, indicate that despite the recent recovery in prices, equity market valuations in the euro area are still substantially lower than the peaks reached in October 2007 and in March 2000, and also below the long-term average level.  Euro area LCBGs’ earnings and solvency developments  Turning next to the euro area financial institutions, large and complex banking groups (LCBGs) remained under intense financial stress in the last quarter of 2008. Profits and (the weighted average) return on equity (ROE) declined sharply, as shown in the left panel of Chart 10. This performance reflects partly further write-downs on structured product portfolios and increasingly the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, which resulted in an increase in loan losses and a decline in non-interest revenue. In the first quarter of 2009, euro area banks’ ROE improved somewhat, albeit at a very low level, thanks to a more favourable trading environment and better non-interest revenues. The asset quality of banks’ loan portfolios will remain a crucial determinant of their performance in the rest of the year.  At the same time, the efforts of euro area LCBGs to bolster their capital buffers have contributed to maintaining their current regulatory capital ratios at levels that conform to the regulatory minimum requirements. Both the median and the weighted average Tier 1 ratios increased in 2008 compared with 2007 (from 7.76% to 8.15%, and from 7.7% to 8.6%, respectively). The total capital ratio followed a broadly similar pattern. However, part of the recovery in regulatory capital is also due to a reduction in risk-weighted assets and to asset shedding at a majority of LCBGs.  Write-downs and new capital raised Since the turmoil erupted, the total reduction in net income attributable to write-downs of global banks on their assets has amounted to just under USD 1 trillion so far. The left panel on Chart 11 shows that US banks have accounted for the bulk of the income losses – about 60% of the overall figure. A further 20% of the global losses was incurred by UK and Swiss banks and euro area banks’ write-downs also corresponded to 20% of the total. To compensate for the large write-downs, euro area LCBGs successfully raised capital in 2008 – both from private and from public sources. By late-May 2009, euro area banks had received relatively more capital than their US peers in relation to the recorded write-downs, as private and public capital injections were equivalent to 119% of the write-downs in the euro area versus 88.5% in the United States. Availability of public bank support Since October 2008, EU governments have implemented support measures to alleviate strains on the European banking system. These measures complement the extensive liquidity support that has been provided by the ECB/Eurosystem and have been implemented in accordance with specific guidance from the ECB and the European Commission. The bank support measures taken, which include equity re-capitalisations, guarantees of new bank debt and asset relief schemes, are summarised in Box 11 and a tentative assessment of their effectiveness is provided. The main conclusion is that the measures have been successful in stabilising the banking system and in bolstering confidence.  The take-up rates of the government committed support to banking systems has varied across countries and across types of measures. Overall, the take-up rates are considered satisfactory taking into account banks’ needs so far. In particular, the use of government BIS Review 75/2009 5 
guarantees on new bank debt issuance has been indispensable in providing banks with access to medium-term funding when needed, as shown in Chart 12. Looking forward, banks should be encouraged to take advantage of the governments’ commitments for support and strengthen their capital buffers. This is especially important in order to restore the provision of credit to the economy and also because the current ample liquidity provided by the ECB will not remain permanently in place.  Estimated future banking sector losses in the euro area  A key issue for bank performance and financial system stability is the amount of potential further write-downs that could be faced by global and euro area financial institutions and the additional capital that should be raised by them in order to safeguard their solvency. Box 14 of the FSR presents the ECB staff estimates of potential write-downs on the securities and loans of euro area banks which, for the sake of comparability and transparency, are calculated following the approach used by the IMF in its Global Financial Stability Report published in April 2009. However, the ECB staff calculations have been based on certain parameters that can be estimated on the basis of euro area data. Table 1 on Slide 15 shows the estimated potential write-downs facing the euro area banking sector.  The ECB staff estimates suggest that the total amount of potential write-downs of euro area banks on their securities and loans over the period 2007-2010 could amount to around USD 649 billion. Taking into account the write-downs on banks’ securities reported by late May 2009 and the banks’ loan loss provisions for 2007 and 2008, the potential future losses of euro area banks, largely concentrated on their loan exposures, could be around USD 283 billion until the end of 2010. These potential losses would be cushioned by provisions and retained earnings over the next two years.  I want to stress that estimates of potential future write-downs on banks’ securities and loans depend crucially on the assumptions made and the methodology used and they are subject to a considerable margin of error. Bearing in mind the significant uncertainty surrounding all available estimates, further efforts are needed to obtain as accurate figures as possible because the magnitude of the expected potential write-downs has weighed heavily on investor confidence and has affected already-weakened financial institutions.  Euro area insurers’ investment exposures  Finally, allow me to make a few points with regard to euro area insurance companies. Large euro area insurers suffered a deterioration in their financial conditions in the second half of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. Most of them reported declines in premium income, as falling equity prices and widening credit spreads lowered the demand for life insurance products. At the same time, non-life insurance business lines were challenged by the deterioration in the economic environment which adversely affected the demand of households and firms for their products. In addition, insurers endured a significant erosion of their investment income because of stresses in many of the financial markets in which they mainly invest, especially corporate bonds and equities. As can be seen in Chart 14, the biggest investment exposure of euro area insurers relates to corporate and government bonds, on average about 60% of total investment in 2008 for a sample of large insurers, up from 46% in 2007. In addition, many insurers have investment exposures to structured credit products. Continued high yields on corporate bond and structured credit products have led to large unrealised losses in many insurers’ “available for sale” bond portfolios. Insurers may have to sell such securities and realise losses if the ratings of the securities they hold are downgraded or in the event of liquidity shortages. In addition, realised losses for insurers are likely to increase as corporate bond default rates are expected to rise in the period ahead.  6 BIS Review 75/2009 
Euro area insurers’ outlook The main challenge that the euro area insurer sector is currently confronted with is a synchronised deterioration in both underwriting and investment income. This is illustrated in Chart 14. Insurance underwriting is usually supported by a favourable economic environment and the slowdown in economic activity is weighing on the underwriting performance of euro area insurers. At the same time, the turmoil in the financial markets continues to weigh on insurers in their attempts to generate investment income. III. Overall assessment In conclusion, I will summarise our overall assessment of the risks to euro area financial stability. Over the past six months, the deterioration in the macro-financial environment has continued to test the shock-absorption capacity of the euro area financial system. The profitability of euro area major banks has been eroded and the prospects for a significant turnaround in the short term are not promising. These prospects weighed on investor confidence in the resilience of already-weakened financial institutions. Importantly, however, capital buffers have been rebuilt through mitigating actions taken by the major banks themselves, as well as through the injection of capital by governments, and the securities prices of these institutions have responded positively. Because capital buffers have been maintained well above the minimum regulatory requirements, overall euro area LCBGs appear to be sufficiently well capitalised to withstand severe but plausible downside scenarios.  The main risks identified within the euro area financial system include the possibility of:  • a further erosion of capital bases and a renewed loss of confidence in the financial condition of LCBGs;  • significant balance sheet strains emerging among insurers; and  • more widespread asset price declines coupled with high volatility.  Outside the euro area financial system, important risks include the possibility of:  • US house prices falling further than currently expected;  • an even more severe than currently projected economic downturn in the euro area; and  • an intensification of the stresses already endured by Central and Eastern European countries.  It cannot be excluded that many of these risks could materialise simultaneously. Indeed, this could happen if the global economic downturn proves to be deeper and more prolonged than currently expected. All in all, notwithstanding the measures that have been taken by the Eurosystem and governments to stabilise the euro area financial system and in spite of the recent recovery in the equity prices of most major banks, policy-makers and market participants will have to be very alert in the period ahead. There is no room for complacency because the risks for financial stability remain high, also bearing in mind that the credit cycle had not yet reached a trough.  Banks, in particular, will therefore need to be especially careful in ensuring that they have sufficient capital and liquidity buffers to cushion the risks that lie ahead while providing an adequate flow of credit to the economy. Over the medium to longer term, banks should undertake the appropriate restructuring to strengthen their financial soundness and resilience to shocks. This may include adapting their business models to the new financial environment.  BIS Review 75/2009 7 
The commitments made by euro area governments to support the financial sector have been sizeable across a range of measures. Given the risks and challenges that lie ahead, banks should be encouraged to take full advantage of these commitments, in order to improve and diversify their medium-term funding, enhance their shock-absorbing capacity and protect sound business lines from the contagion risks connected with troubled assets. Thank you very much for your attention. I am now at your disposal for questions. 8 BIS Review 75/2009 
Kevin M Warsh: Defining deviancy Speech by Mr Kevin M Warsh, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Institute of International Bankers Annual Meeting, New York, 16 June 2009. *      *      * In a seminal essay delivered about 16 years ago, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan offered a striking view of the degradation of standards in society.1 He observed that deviancy – measured as increases in crime, broken homes, and mental illness – reached levels unimagined by earlier generations. As a means of coping with the onslaught, society often sought to define the problem away. The definition of customary behavior was expanded. Actions once considered deviant from acceptable standards became, almost immaculately, within bounds.2  Society moves on, as it were. Well-meaning efforts are periodically made to treat its failings. But if these efforts prove less than successful, citizens and policymakers alike tend to grow increasingly accustomed to the unfortunate statistics. Every bit the reformer throughout his decades of public service, Moynihan seemed reluctantly resigned to society's construct: "In this sense, the agencies of control often seem to define their job as that of keeping deviance within bounds rather than that of obliterating it altogether."3  Given the financial crisis, deep contraction in the real economy, and extraordinary fiscal and monetary responses, I cannot help but wonder what constitutes deviance in economic terms in 2009 and beyond. What level of real economic output and unemployment is expected and, more important, accepted? And what level of volatility constitutes the "new normal"?4 As I will discuss, we must be wary of macroeconomic policies that – in the name of stability – may have the effect of lowering trend growth and employment rates.  In Moynihan's framework, will we in the official sector be accepting of periods of significant financial and economic distress, however infrequent? That is, will deviancy be defined down with the understanding that a rare crisis is the price for dynamic, robust economic growth? Or will the official sector say, "Never again – not on our watch," and become less tolerant of deviations in economic and financial conditions? Under the mantle of reforming capitalism, will policymakers instead define deviancy up, and seek to guarantee stability in our economic affairs?  I suspect that, for a time, policymakers will be more attracted to this latter path. Stability is a fine goal, but it is not a final one. Long after panic conditions have ended, stability threatens to displace economic growth as the primary macroeconomic policy objective. But we must recognize that the singular pursuit of stability, however well intentioned, may end up making our economy less productive, less adaptive, and less self-correcting – and in so doing, less able to deliver on its alluring promise. This fate, however, does not have to be ours. The U.S. economy is capable, in my judgment, of delivering more.                                                   1  Daniel Patrick Moynihan (1993), "Defining Deviancy Down: How We've Become Accustomed to Alarming Levels of Crime and Destructive Behavior," American Scholar, Winter. 2  The views expressed herein are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of other members of the Board of Governors or of the Federal Open Market Committee.

The Growth Experiment5This most recent boom and bust is not, as they say, our country's first rodeo, but it may turn out to be the most consequential since World War II. And, here, I am not just talking about the near-term peak-to-trough changes in growth and employment levels, which are likely to prove significant.  Policymakers are revealing new policy preferences and prescriptions – fiscal policy, trade policy, regulatory policy, and monetary policy, chiefly among them. Long after the official recession ends, the choices being made may significantly alter the contour of the U.S. economy. The harder question that remains is whether these changes will prove beneficial.  From the mid-1980s through 2007, U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged more than 3 percent per year, and was less volatile than in previous decades. The average unemployment rate was less than 5-3/4 percent, a full percentage point less than in the previous 15 years. Most notable was the realized acceleration in labor productivity in the mid-1990s.  The bipartisan, pro-growth policies that predominated during this period contributed meaningfully to these gains. Tax and spending decisions generally sought to expand the economic pie. Trade policies were aimed at opening new markets to U.S. products and services, and removing barriers domestically. Regulatory policies permitted failure, and relied in equal parts on capital requirements, regulatory standards, and, no less important, market discipline. As a result, businesses were well positioned to adopt new efficiency-enhancing technologies and processes to excel in the pro-growth environment. These policies helped drive significant productivity gains, and remarkable U.S. and global prosperity.6  I do not mean to suggest that the period that preceded the crisis was a golden age. It wasn't. Even during this seemingly enviable, secular period of prosperity, the U.S. recessions of 1990-91 and 2001 remind us that periodic, cyclical weakness occurs. The labor markets deteriorated during these downturns, and at great costs to many families and communities. But these periodic deviations were accepted, in some sense, by the body politic. There were lessons to be learned, reforms to be implemented, and public and private practices to be improved upon. But the broad outlines of the growth experiment forged on, and were judged by most to be largely a success.  Hence, the relative stability that earned the Great Moderation its enduring moniker is not, in my view, the greatest economic accomplishment of the past few decades. The acclaim should be assigned to the resulting economic boom that massively increased economic output and living standards. Maximum sustainable growth, not stability per se, was the predominant policy goal. Strong growth, of course, was made possible, in part, by the low volatility that marked the period.7 Firms choose to invest more, for example, in less volatile economic conditions. But, pro-growth policies were the coin of the realm.                                                   5  The term "Growth Experiment" was coined two decades ago to describe certain pro-growth tax policies. See, for example, Lawrence B. Lindsey (1990), The Growth Experiment: How the New Tax Policy Is Transforming the U.S. Economy (New York: Basic Books). I, however, am referencing a broader range a macroeconomic policies. 6  Since 1980, the performance of the world economy has proved strong. Real world GDP grew by approximately 145 percent from 1980 to 2007, a compound average of about 3.4 percent per year (Becker and Murphy (2009)). They also contend that even if the current recession were to be deeper and more prolonged than contemplated by the most pessimistic forecasters, global annual growth rates would still average better than 2.7 percent from 1980 to 2010, with per capital incomes rising a total of about 40 percent over the period. See Gary Becker and Kevin Murphy (2009), "Do Not Let the 'Cure' Destroy Capitalism," Financial Times Magazine, March 19. 7  Whether by good fortune or good policy, between the start of the Great Moderation in the mid-1980s and the end of 2007, the standard deviation of annualized quarterly real U.S. GDP growth was 2.1 percent, less than half as large as its value over the two previous decades. 2 BIS Review 75/2009 
But, as I remarked to another group of international financiers more than two years ago: "The Great Moderation…is neither a law of physics nor a guarantee of future outcomes. It is only a description – an ex post explanation of relative prosperity. If policymakers and market participants presume it to be an entitlement, it will almost surely lose favor."8 Well, warnings notwithstanding, it was treated like an entitlement by far too many in the private and public sector, and as a result, lost considerable favor.  The Panic of 2008 Has the experience of the last 20 months caused the findings of the vaunted growth experiment to be fundamentally revised? During this recent period of turmoil, the imponderable, or what was previously thought to be virtually impossible, happened with great speed and force and frequency.9 Asset prices plummeted, and market volatility reached its highest level in decades. Financial market functioning was deeply impaired across most asset classes and geographies. As a result, the U.S. economy endured a sudden stop. In the final quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, private employment registered the largest two-quarter percent decline since the mid-1970s, and real GDP saw the most dramatic decline in a half-century.  These data are clearly indicative of significant deviance, and justifiably raise questions about the success of the growth experiment. Policymakers are rightly disposed to react, respond, and revisit the presumed record of accomplishment. In revising the historical record, however, we should not too hastily discount the preceding period of prosperity. We must avoid a classic case of what behavioral economists term "availability bias," when decisions made are influenced disproportionately by more recent events.  Ultimately, I will leave it to economic historians to assess whether the Panic of 2008 was more anomalous than the period of prosperity that preceded it. I believe that the categorization of recent events as deviant, ultimately, will depend on what happens next. That is, if policy changes cause future economic performance to suffer, then the boom of the last generation may, regrettably, turn out to be more exceptional than the bust. The Stability Experiment That new policies are being implemented during a period of economic turmoil is no coincidence. These new preferences reveal much about the type of economy to which policymakers aspire. And to be clear, the stability experiment appears well intended. It aspires to manage the economy with greater care and more expansive and effective regulation, as well as a larger and more persistent role for government action, and an increase in home bias in global commerce.  Advocates of the stability experiment – each guided by their own compass – seem all too inclined to announce that the growth experiment has ended, and to conclude that the results are deeply disappointing. They seem to prefer to define deviancy up, wishing to assure an uncertain citizenry. If government policies are corrected, and private practices are made more prescriptive, they argue, the ship of state can ensure that the real economy avoids rough seas altogether. The political economy confirms the policy response: Policymakers may pay greater attention to insuring against rare bad events – to which they could be held to account – than to allowing scores of great things to flourish.                                                   8  Kevin Warsh (2007), "Market Liquidity: Definitions and Implications," speech delivered at the Institute of International Bankers Annual Washington Conference, Washington, March 5. 9  Kevin Warsh (2009), "The Panic of 2008," speech delivered at the Council of Institutional Investors 2009 Spring Meeting, Washington, April 6. BIS Review 75/2009 3 
As I mentioned at the outset, stability, in the sense of lower macroeconomic volatility, is a fine objective, but it is not a final one. The conduct of monetary policy, for example, aims to achieve price stability throughout the economic cycle. But central bankers do so because we believe it is the precursor to strong and sustainable growth. If other policies – notably, those for fiscal, regulatory, and trade – treat stability as the ultimate objective, then we might find ourselves with lower growth and diminished economic potential.  Reform efforts are sorely needed, and practices demand marked improvement. But policymakers are wise to resist the hubris that most recently afflicted actors in the financial sector. I describe this mix of new pro-stability policies as an experiment for good reason. It might deliver on its promise of lower volatility, lower unemployment, and higher growth over the course of a generation. But, it might not. The costs of the stability experiment might turn out to be large. Necessarily and hastily crafted when the financial crisis began, the stability experiment is likely to survive far longer than the panic that preceded it. It is surging in popularity and is likely to grow in application, particularly if, as I suspect, the economic picture disappoints.  Incipient recovery Since mid-March of this year, financial conditions have continued to improve. Panic conditions are showing signs of retreat. Asset prices are rebounding, searching for a new equilibrium from their panic-induced depths – both in the United States and across the vast majority of our trading partners. And this improvement in markets coincided with the arrival of the proverbial green shoots of spring. This gloss of recovery is appealing, of course, and not only to central bankers.  I, like you, am rooting for the positive trend to continue. But, in my estimation, the rather indiscriminate bounce off the bottom – across virtually all assets and geographies – may be more indicative of a one-time reset, which may or may not be complete. I would be more comfortable going forward if we observe more dispersion in the valuations of particular assets and greater differentiation across asset classes and geographies.  The panic's hasty retreat should not be confused with robust recovery. For economic performance will turn ultimately on the force of private final demand; and for now, it remains weak. Real consumer spending rose only modestly in the first quarter of this year, after dropping sharply in the second half of last year. Businesses reduced real spending at an annual rate of more than 35 percent and continued to cut their workforces. Real exports fell at an annual rate of close to 30 percent.  The trauma experienced by businesses and consumers coming out of the panic should not be underestimated. Notwithstanding recent encouraging signs that the contraction is abating, I would expect business capital expenditures and consumer spending to continue to disappoint for the next several quarters. Even if, as I expect, the United States emerges from this recession sooner than our advanced foreign trading partners, I am still very cautious about predicting a sustained run-up in net exports so soon after the virtual collapse of global trade. Exceptional fiscal expenditures, by their own terms, are intended to replace shortfalls in aggregate demand. And recent extraordinary monetary policy actions are intended to lower risk-free rates and grow balance sheet capacity to help offset the pullback by private financial intermediaries. But financial markets may extract penalty pricing if fiscal authorities are unable to demonstrate a credible return to sustainable budgets. And they are unlikely to look kindly on monetary authorities unless they decidedly and unambiguously chart their own independent paths. The Federal Reserve should not – and will not – compromise another kind of stability – price stability – to help achieve other government policy objectives. 4 BIS Review 75/2009 
On balance, I would not be surprised if these countervailing forces – unprecedented public support and underwhelming private demand – fight to a draw by the fourth quarter. But the scale of stimulus and the recent blow to the real economy are both lacking precedent, so predicting the victor is tough business. Of course, the extraordinary monetary and fiscal support may prove more efficacious in the near term than I expect, leading to a continued easing in credit conditions, a slowdown in the rate of deleveraging, improved inventory levels, and better quarterly economic statistics. Even so, the benefits of stimulus are likely to wane. More important, unemployment rates, in my judgment, are likely to remain higher and linger longer than in recent recessions. The "jobless recovery" may prove to be a familiar and vexing refrain. As a wise Stanford mentor of mine coined many years ago, "The economist's lag is a politician's nightmare."10Medium-term prospects The rebalancing of U.S. GDP and global demand is likely to require some patience. During the transition, there may well be political impetus for still more-aggressive macroeconomic policies. In evaluating new measures, however, policymakers' predominant interest should be ensuring the credibility of their fiscal and monetary frameworks. For, if macroeconomic policies were to become unanchored, or misunderstood by markets, continued government aggressiveness could prove counterproductive.  The global economy runs the risk of being mired in a period of slower growth for several years to come. Some portion of the subpar economic performance may be owed to the normal capital and labor reallocations that take place during recoveries. And given the serious misallocations that marked the onset of this recession, there is good reason to believe that the period of reallocation will be deeper and last longer. A reduction in the size of the finance and housing industries, for example, is well under way. Efforts to forestall those changes, in my judgment, are unlikely to succeed as promisingly as advertised. But perhaps a larger risk is that changes in public policies may, in the pursuit of stability, hold down the growth of the U.S. economy over this period.  Simple textbook models tell us that a nation's output is the product of the number of hours worked and the output produced per hour. In thinking about the medium-term prospects for the economy, I find it useful to consider these two factors separately. Output per hour, or productivity, is the secret sauce to U.S. economic growth and to rising living standards, but I fear that the recipe may have lost some key ingredients. Growth in labor productivity arises when a firm's workers use more and better physical capital, or when firms become more efficient at converting inputs into output. Innovation plays a key role, both because it directly boosts efficiency and because firms' decisions to invest in physical capital tend to depend on the underlying pace of innovation. In addition, in today's economy, the productivity of many firms relies heavily on intangible, or intellectual, capital; although hard to measure, intangible capital appears to also be tied to innovation. To be concrete, from 1995 through 2007, U.S. labor productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector averaged about 2-1/2 percent per year, a marked improvement from the 1-3/4 percent pace that marked the prior quarter century. This period of rapid growth in labor productivity was driven by large capital investments, significant improvements in management processes, and remarkable advances in technology. Looking ahead, if policy is less encouraging of capital accumulation, or returns to innovations are constrained by policy, we may find a material reduction in the growth rate of productivity and living standards.                                                   10  See George Shultz (1993), Turmoil and Triumph: My Years as Secretary of State (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons). BIS Review 75/2009 5 
The level of support that the financial system is capable of providing also remains highly uncertain. Private financial institutions are now understandably slow to create new products that connect savers and investors. Although it is undesirable to revert to the excessive risk-taking that preceded the crisis, current financial practices seem suboptimal in promoting economic growth. Furthermore, repeated interventions by the public sector run the risk of causing systemically significant institutions to operate more like public utilities than efficient allocators of capital and proper arbiters of liquidity. Productivity may also suffer at the hand of policies that discourage trade. Trade enhances productivity by promoting efficient specialization, permitting economies of scale, and increasing the potential returns to innovation.11 However, the bipartisan consensus favoring free trade appears broken, with each political party internally divided on the question. Given the contention, however imprecise, that Anglo-American-style capitalism caused the turmoil, there may be a shortage of credible and persuasive voices to fight the growing global tide of economic isolation.  As for hours worked, the other key determinant of output, the risks seem unmistakable. We have grown accustomed to falling natural rates of unemployment during the last two decades. Even when unemployment spiked during recent recessions, the prevailing rate found its way to still lower levels. According to most economists, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) was in the neighborhood of 5 percent prior to the financial crisis.  Looking ahead, I could well imagine that the natural rate of unemployment trends higher. Historically, small businesses have tended to be the largest drivers of new job creation. But how they will respond if macroeconomic policies favor stability over growth is difficult to predict. The answer may ultimately depend on their access to growth capital and liquidity given the changing mix of public policies and private practices. More generally, I believe that the dynamism of the U.S. economy contributed critically to pre-crisis levels of employment. The remarkably low level of the NAIRU was made possible in part by the extraordinary churn in jobs seen in the U.S. economy. For example, over the 12 months preceding the start of the recession in December 2007, although 62 million people lost their jobs, 63 million jobs were created. Policies aimed at limiting the range of economic outcomes do not, in my view, keep unemployment rates low. These policies make it more costly for firms to adjust the size of their workforces, thereby making employers more reluctant to hire.  Gauging trend growth in output and employment is essential to the proper conduct of monetary policy. Broad changes in macroeconomic policies may make it more difficult for central bankers to make such calculations. To the extent changed policies reduce potential growth, or raise the natural rate of unemployment beyond recent estimates, it is more difficult to make good and timely policy. We must keep a keen eye on these risks as conditions evolve. Ironically, the longer that output and employment disappoint, the more attractive the gloss of stability may become. As a result, we should evaluate the benefits and costs of the stability experiment with a keen eye to guard against downside risks for the real economy.                                                  11  For a discussion of the benefits of trade in the modern global economy, see W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm (2007), "The Best of All Worlds: Globalizing the Knowledge Economy," in Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas: 2006 Annual Report (Dallas: FRB Dallas). 6 BIS Review 75/2009 
Longer-term prospects I have not lost confidence in the inherent innovation, creativity, and dynamism in the U.S. economy. Nor have I lost confidence in the inherent good sense of our citizens. If the stability experiment fails to deliver on its promise of higher employment and better economic performance, then policymakers ultimately will change their prescriptions yet again. And so, in the long term, after the final results of the U.S. experiments with growth and stability are finally tabulated, the broader U.S. experiment in democratic capitalism will endure – and our economy will emerge stronger than ever.

Christian Noyer: The macroeconomy and financial systems in normal times and in times of stress Speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, at a conference, jointly organised by the Bank of France and the Deutsche Bundesbank, Chantilly, 9 June 2009. *      *      * Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Colleagues It is my great pleasure to address such a distinguish audience to day.  As you may know, this is the second time the Banque de France and the Deutsche Bundesbank have jointly organised such a conference. It is held every two years, alternating between Germany and France. The fact that an event of this nature is co-sponsored by the two institutions sends a strong signal to the research community. It also clearly illustrates the importance of research in today’s monetary policy making, given the interplay, which is not always fully understood, between financial markets and the real economy. The top quality work that has been done in this conference will be of great help for policy making. Normal times and times of stress Over the recent months, thanks to the joint actions of governments and central banks, markets have shown gradual signs of improvement. Yet, the functioning of the markets has not been fully restored. At the current juncture, one key challenge is to restore confidence in a context where players are still confronted with numerous sources of uncertainty: uncertain exposure vis-à-vis counterparties, uncertain valuation regarding financial assets or financial risks. In such a context, what should we do to return to normality? Economic theory provides a set of conditions to be fulfilled for a market to function efficiently: full information, enforceable property rights and contracts, absence of externalities just to mention the most important ones. In times of stress, these conditions are not fulfilled. But they are hardly met in normal times either. Moving from one situation, to the other, does not necessarily involve a huge economic shock. Small changes in economic sentiment or “animal spirit” may bring financial markets to a point of near collapse.  The past ten years are a striking case in point. The development of securitisation was initially perceived as improving welfare through better risk management and allocation. Overall, it was seen as a move towards more complete and efficient markets.  The crisis has shown that this was not necessarily the case: the process was plagued by information asymmetries and moral hazard, and created high risk concentration on a limited number of counterparties, It also lead to the build-up of financial imbalances which proved unsustainable. In those conditions, a minor change may suffice to trigger a financial market collapse. It is difficult to rationalise such an outcome unless it is the result of some kind of coordination between economic agents on a bad equilibrium. Some contributions presented here mentioned strategic complementarities, an explanation which cannot be completely ruled out. Indeed, it seems that the driving force behind the massive securitisation era was, for most participants, regulatory arbitrage.  Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the main policy response has focused on regulation. Indeed, there is a widespread consensus that the cause of the current financial meltdown stems from the failure or even the absence of regulation in important segments of the financial system. But it may also have implications for monetary policy, to which I turn now. BIS Review 74/2009 1 
Some implications for monetary policy Central banks have been on the frontline since the crisis unfolded in the summer of 2007. A dramatic change occurred however after the collapse of Lehman Brothers where we had the sentiment that we were moving into uncharted territories: spreads reached unprecedented levels both on the money and credit markets, leading to a worsening of financing conditions across industrialised countries. Without action some important parts of the transmission mechanisms would have been significantly impaired.  In such a context, major central banks embarked on unconventional policies by: • Increasing central bank liquidity; • Influencing risk premia on private financial and credit instruments. Such policies are referred to as credit easing policies;  • Pre-committing to conducting very low interest rate policies for as long as necessary in countries where the interest rate has already reached its lower bound.  All these policies are set out as temporary policies and deemed to be used in times of stress only. It is obviously too early to gauge their overall impact. So far, they have been effective with regard to market confidence, and have contributed to a significant reduction in various credit risk premia. One channel relies on portfolio composition effects. I know that some contributions presented here made that point in a very sophisticated framework, i.e. positive feedback effects may be generated through the greater liquidity of investing entrepreneurs. Obviously, the soundness of the financial system is critical to the success of these unconventional policies.  These policies must be viewed as state contingent policies: they are conditional on the state of the economy. A significant part of the intervention is short-term oriented, as the acquisitions focus on short-maturity assets. Furthermore, the assets purchased are usually of very good quality. In most cases, and in particular in the Eurosystem, the increase in the monetary base is determined endogenously by the banking system, motivated by banks’ preference for liquidity and thus by the state of stress of the banking system. Finally, these measures tend to address aggregate risks.  These unconventional measures would automatically unwind, as improvements in inter-bank and credit markets would reduce the need to use these facilities. Financial market indicators, risk premia components and their determinants as well as monetary indicators (inflation expectations in addition to monetary and credit developments) should be taken into account to carry out the assessment. Some implications for financial stability This crisis has triggered a debate regarding possible tools to be developed to prevent the build up of financial imbalances and design countercyclical regulatory policies. Some papers presented during this conference made such a point, calling for a new macro-prudential approach and proposing measures of systemic risks that capture risk spillovers and tail risk correlations. I am of course very sympathetic to this approach and I also think that such measures should form the basis of any macro-prudential regulation. The general principle of this macro-prudential regulation is straightforward: it consists in ensuring that supervision manages to limit risks for the stability not only of a particular institution, but also of the entire financial system. Its implementation is however a bit more complex and raises several policy issues: first, there are questions on how to calibrate these macro-prudential instruments so as to address common exposures across financial institutions and the contribution of each institution to system-wide risk; a second issue is how to dampen the inherent procyclicality of the financial system; a third issue is the respective importance of rule-based approaches versus more discretionary tools. Finally, questions 2 BIS Review 74/2009 
remain regarding the institutional set-up, in particular as to which institutions should be involved in the process and make the decisions. These issues are currently being debated in various circles and the recently-published de Larosière report made some substantial proposals regarding the institutional set-up. I will not elaborate on all these issues but simply touch on a couple of them. The most important features of a macro-prudential approach is that it treats aggregate risks as endogenous and considers possible feedback effects between the real economy and the soundness of financial institutions. Its ultimate objective is to prevent costly recessions such as the one we are currently experiencing. Consequently, its implementation must be grounded on some welfare analysis. This is an area in which further research is required. It is very important that the implementation of this macro-prudential approach finds the right balance between efficiency and stability in the financial sector, It should therefore be constructed so as to act directly on the incentive to take risk and the rewards provided by risk taking. Should central banks be involved in? Clearly, they should play a pivotal role: they are a major player during financial and liquidity crises. They are well equipped to assess cyclical positions and they have a strong incentive since the efficacy of their monetary policy relies on the smooth functioning of the transmission mechanism. On the other hand, they are not alone in caring about financial stability and their primary mandate, which is price stability, does not always necessarily coincide with financial stability. As a conclusion, I would like to thank your very much for you attention and for your kind participation and thank once again the organisers and the teams involved in the preparation of this conference.

Kiyohiko G Nishimura: Financial system stability and market confidence  Speech by Mr Kiyohiko G Nishimura, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Japan Society of Monetary Economics’ Spring Annual Meeting, Tokyo, 16 May 2009.  *      *      * 1.  Preface  I am grateful for this opportunity to speak before the time-honored Japan Society of Monetary Economics. Taking advantage of the occasion to address leading scholars, I would like to make half of my remarks today as a Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, and the other half as a former Economics Professor of the University of Tokyo, where we meet today. I hope that I can in some way contribute to your debates over the current financial crisis. When Lehman Brothers went bankrupt last September, the financial crisis entered a new level of acuteness, though more recently it has begun to subside thanks to bold policy initiatives taken by countries around the world. Nevertheless, the financial crisis has had significant negative impacts on the real economy. The IMF has revised its 2009 real growth rate forecast for the world economy down to negative 1.3 percent. At the current point in time, the Japanese financial system is stable on the whole and our financial institutions remain sound. However, it is also a fact that Japanese financial institutions are facing a much more difficult earnings environment. We will therefore continue to carefully monitor whether the banking sector is able to maintain a sufficient level of robustness and appropriately provide financial intermediation functions.  While governments and central banks have been focused on current crisis management, the G20 Summit and many other fora have seen vigorous discussions of policies that will prevent recurrence of financial crisis. However, the primary interest in most of these debates is how to strengthen regulation, and it is my impression that critical re-examination of the effectiveness of existing regulations or consideration of the possible side effects of re-regulation have taken a back seat.  As a central banker whose mission is to maintain the stability of the financial system, I believe we should genuinely reflect whether our previous policies led financial institutions in the correct direction. Where there are mistakes, we must correct them and help financial institutions to set off again on the proper path. At the same time, we should recognize that regulation must not impede the growth of the financial services sector. The ultimate goal of regulation should be the creation of a sufficiently flexible financial system that is able to smoothly absorb internal and external shocks.  In my remarks today, I would like to focus on how we design systems that will prevent the recurrence of financial crisis, and consider this from a broad perspective that is not bound by established concepts and approaches. Obviously, the design of desirable policies and regulations requires a deep understanding of what is behind the crisis. Therefore, while it may strike many of you as being a bit roundabout, I would like to begin my remarks by reviewing the background to the current crisis and the mechanisms that have exacerbated it.  BIS Review 74/2009 1 
2.  Emergence of the "credit bubble"1At the outset, I would like to set out the causes of the current financial crisis in my own way. We are currently in the midst of financial crisis. The global financial system may be in a lull, but we do not know when another challenging issue could erupt. The situation surrounding us does not allow for premature conclusions. Therefore, I would like to ask you to understand that my remarks are based on the information that is available to us at the current point in time and necessarily represent a provisional diagnosis.  No one would deny that the prologue to the current financial crisis was the subprime housing loan crisis in the United States. But that was essentially a problem in a portion of the home mortgages in a single country – albeit the United States – and it would normally be inconceivable for that alone to plunge global financial markets into chaos. It is therefore more appropriate to look to macro global problems as the true background to today's financial crisis. It is undeniable that the low interest rates and excess liquidity that have prevailed around the world since the collapse of the IT bubble are behind the crisis. In that sense, we were in a situation in which it would have been quite plausible for a financial crisis to occur anywhere and in any form. Why did the US subprime housing loans trigger the crisis? The US current account deficit has begun to expand rapidly since the latter half of the 1990s. Meanwhile, emerging Asian economies, including China and oil producing countries, have begun to see their current account surpluses expand. This is the phenomenon that has come to be called "global imbalances." I am sure that you will recall a variety of discussions over whether this situation would be sustainable.  In fact, when there are significant differences in the degree of development of individual countries' financial markets, a situation like the global imbalances that appear on the surface to be a disequilibrium can in fact be one kind of equilibrium itself.2 In emerging economies and oil producing countries, many imperfections may be observed in the domestic financial markets. Stock markets are undeveloped, deposit interest rates are fixed at low levels by regulation, and so on. Because of this, these countries may lack financial assets that offer a safe store of wealth gained by rising incomes. One solution is to purchase "safe" financial assets from other countries. The development of information and telecommunications technologies has made it far easier to purchase foreign assets than it was in the past. And it was the United States that supplied those "safe" financial assets. For emerging economies and oil producing countries, this translated into current account surpluses, since the purchase of foreign assets is, ultimately, the export of capital. Conversely, for the United States, this resulted in current account deficits because the savings shortfall due to excess consumption was covered by importing capital. This set the stage for the spread of a US-made "credit bubble" to the rest of the world.  Obviously, the global imbalance on its own is insufficient to generate a "credit bubble" that is completely divorced from economic fundamentals. For that, we must turn to the problems inherent in the process by which subprime housing loans were turned into securitized                                                  1  The word "bubble" should be used according to its strict economic definition, but usage is often much looser, as can be seen in policy debates, for example. In this paper, I have placed "credit bubble" within quotation marks to indicate that is being used colloquially rather than in its strictly defined sense. 2  Cabarello, R. J. (2006), “On the Macroeconomics of Asset Shortage,” The Role of Money: Money and Monetary Policy in the Twenty-First Century, The Fourth European Central Banking Conference, 9-10 November 2006, edited by Andreas Beyer and Lucrezia Reichlin, pp. 272-283. 2 BIS Review 74/2009 
instruments. On this point, I would like to focus on the question of the agency problem and how it relates to the expansion of the securitization business.3  The primary characteristic of the securitization business is its complexity. Today's securitized instruments have extraordinarily complex structures. For example, they bundle together thousands of subprime housing loans, dissect the cash flow that these loans produce and turn them into a number of different financial instruments with different levels of priority. Furthermore, these financial instruments are again bundled together and chopped up to create more financial instruments. As this process of synthesis and partition is repeated, the risk structure becomes too complex and it is no longer an easy task to measure risk exposure. Certainly, one could argue that instruments should not be purchased if the risks are not clear, but what happened was that many investors placed excessive faith in the ratings issued by ratings agencies for these securitized instruments and began to gobble up complex products regardless.  There is the second feature of securitization that we must also discuss: "functional differentiation." Most of the subprime housing loans in the United States were issued by financial operators called "mortgage banks." Instead of continuing to hold the credits after making the loan, these operators sold them to investment banks and other institutions. Investment banks and others then took the home mortgage credits that they had purchased, pooled them together and used them to back securitized instruments that were sold to investors. This is called the "Originate To Distribute" (OTD) model, whose process starts with the origination of home mortgages and ends with the sale of securitized products based on them. One of the problems with the OTD model is that it lends itself to moral hazards. If mortgage banks are able to sell home mortgage credits and transfer the risks, they have no incentive to seriously screen the loans. It is not hard to imagine loans being made to applicants who could not meet credit standards in normal times. This is a typical moral hazard, and I believe it is what planted the seeds of the "credit bubble."  Through this process, an enormous volume of securitized instruments backed by and related to subprime housing loans came onto the market. Moreover, many of these instruments were given "AAA" ratings, indicating the highest levels of creditworthiness. What is surprising is that the yield on these AAA-rated securitized instruments was often much higher than the yield on Treasuries even though they also had the same AAA rating. Had market functioned normally, this price distortion could not have been maintained over the long term. But in point of fact, no one questioned this state of affairs; not the banks, not the rating agencies, not the investors, not the regulators. Whether people thought the situation strange or not, everyone seems to have agreed to ignore it.  Why could such an abnormal situation continue for so long? Some would argue on this point that an important factor came from organizational behavior and a certain "responsibility avoidance" attitude on the part of organization members – what is referred to in the literature as "plausible deniability".4 The sellers of securitized instruments maintain that they bear no responsibility, and to demonstrate that there were no problems with their instruments they point to the fact that other operators were selling the same kinds of instruments. They claim that they, like others, calculated the prices of their instruments on the basis of historical data and experience, and they were given the blessing of ratings agencies. In other words, nobody could have possibly foreseen the current price drops, and therefore nobody is responsible. It just happened. Meanwhile, the buyers of securitized instruments – institutional                                                  3  For a more detailed analysis from a slightly different perspective, see the following.

investors – use the similar logic to justify their purchases. Everybody else was buying the same financial instruments and nobody had a problem with it, the excuse goes. It is natural to believe that this plausible deniability was one of the reasons that the “credit bubble” in securitized instruments emerged and was maintained for such a long period of time.  Along with the emergence of the “credit bubble,” there is another feature that distinguishes the current crisis – the fact that virtually very few market participants believed that such a serious financial crisis could actually occur. How is it that market participants came to believe this? It has something to do with the phenomenon of so-called "Great Moderation." Beginning in the 1990s, the United States and other countries saw a significant decline in the volatility of their GDPs and other real economy indicators and, as a result, the volatility of financial indicators was stable as well. This situation remained in place for a long time and presumably market participants had an illusion that the same situation would persist in the future and economic upheavals could never occur.  There is an opinion that such an illusion was reinforced by the "Greenspan Put," named after Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). In other words, even if financial crisis were to occur, former chairman Greenspan and the FRB would certainly be able to use monetary policy to fix it. If the Greenspan Put were true, it could be rational for market participants to take risks on the assumption that the tail risk (the rarely-occurring risk such as financial crisis) would never emerge. In short, the misplaced faith of market participants in monetary policy generated overconfidence in the market.  3.  Erosion of confidence and deepening of the crisis  I would now like to turn to the collapse of the “credit bubble” and the deepening of the financial crisis that resulted. One of the distinguishing features of the current financial crisis is the liquidity crisis caused by the materialization of counterparty risk. On July 10, 2007, S&P and Moody's announced that they would be reviewing the ratings of several residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) backed by subprime housing loan assets. As a consequence, the AAA ratings of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) backed by these instruments were also downgraded. Indeed, an unremarkable change in the ratings of risk assets that were not all that important in the context of the market as a whole directly shook the global financial system.  In the United States, money market funds (MMFs) have been considered to be extremely safe financial assets. One of the primary reasons for this is that MMFs are only allowed to invest in AAA-rated assets. When ratings were downgraded for ABCP, MMFs did not reinvest. Naturally, funds that originated ABCP and used it to raise money found themselves in fund-raising difficulties: Funds under the Bear Stearns umbrella went bankrupt; BNP Paribas moved to freeze its affiliated fund’s new applications and redemptions. The structured investment vehicles (SIV) created by banks to issue ABCP were unable to find funding sources, and then these banks were forced to provide liquidity enhancement instead. Banks, which frequently lend each other money, suddenly became aware of counterparty risk, the risk that the other party of a transaction might suddenly go belly up. They began to worry that some bank somewhere might suddenly be unable to secure liquidity and fail. Indeed, on August 9, a liquidity crisis actually occurred, with liquidity drying up quickly in the interbank market. The event has come to be known as the "Paribas Shock." Many European banks were among those facing liquidity difficulties. Confronted with this situation, the European Central Bank (ECB) promptly announced that it was prepared to supply massive amounts of liquidity into the short-term money market.5                                                 5  In point of fact, MMFs played a role in deepening the crisis during the "Lehman Shock" of September 2008 as well, as will be discussed below. The Reserve Primary Fund, a major independent MMF, held large amounts of CP issued by Lehman Brothers. The fund incurred large losses because of the bankruptcy, plunging it into 4 BIS Review 74/2009 
Some argue that there may be an excessive maturity mismatch on financial institutions’ balance sheets as a background factor that triggered the liquidity crisis. Certainly, a close observation of the facts in the current financial crisis exposes not only the maturity mismatch but also the "liquidity uncertainty" that is the fundamental risk inherent in all financial instruments. It is a truism that liquidity is largely unrecognized while it exists and only understood once it disappears. For example, the design of ABCPs assumes that they can be sold on the market at any time if necessary, but when crisis actually occurred, these instruments could not immediately be sold. Had institutional fund-raising been a little more long-term, there would have been a time cushion that might have enabled them to deal with the crisis in liquidity. Although it may not be possible to take every possibility into account in the selection of assets, a constant awareness of the uncertainty of liquidity and continuous assessment of the maturity gaps between assets and liabilities are key factors in improving the soundness of financial institutions.  One often-heard opinion is that credit default swaps (CDS) and other financial derivatives amplified the instability of the financial markets in the current financial crisis. Opinions will differ on the merits of CDSs themselves, but no one would deny that the dysfunction of the over-the-counter (OTC) market, where these instruments were primarily traded, undermined confidence in financial markets as a whole. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. Right around the same time, the market began to talk about American International Group, Inc. (AIG) being on the rocks as well, and its share price plummeted. AIG sold large volumes of CDS protection, in which it was believed that there were many contracts that used Lehman Brothers as a reference company. The bankruptcy of AIG would nullify CDS hedges. Were this to happen, financial institutions that had dealings with AIG would be unable to fulfill their CDS contracts with other financial institutions, raising the specter of a chain reaction. Market participants were suddenly forced to recognize this counterparty risk. Faced with these circumstances, the US government had little choice but to place AIG under its de facto administration.  Most CDSs are traded directly. As long as counterparty risk is limited to the parties directly involved in the negotiated transaction, the market as a whole does not recognize any broad risk. The reason the market as a whole became aware of this risk is that the market participants recognized that they are in complex intertwined relationships among themselves arising from the negotiated transaction network. If counterparty risk is recognized in some transaction somewhere – in other words, if there is thought to be a risk that the other party will go bankrupt – everyone who has dealings with that party is at risk of being pulled down too in a chain reaction of bankruptcies. So the initial counterparty risk spreads and spawns new counterparty risks for the parties that have dealings with the counterparty. These "network externalities" certainly played a major role in the process by which the current financial crisis expanded. Counterparty risk can be significantly reduced by centralizing transactions (institutionalizing a "central counterparty"), but in practice, many of the transactions were so complex that the creation of a central counterparty was a daunting task. I do not think that the current sense of paralysis that pervades financial markets can be explained merely as the rupture of a “credit bubble.” When bubbles rupture, one would ordinarily expect economies to return to their fundamentals. In other words, economies get back to functioning as they should. But I do not think there is anyone who would say that economies at the moment are functioning properly. The global economy today has fallen far beneath its potential and is seemingly unable to pull itself up.  The root cause of this is the erosion of confidence in the market. When confidence is eroded, market participants become extremely fearful that they might be confronting a completely                                                                                                                                                       "break the buck" (net assets per dollar face value worth less than one dollar) status. This greatly undermined the confidence in MMFs as a whole, triggering a rapid outflow of money that translated into a major upheaval for the short-term money markets. BIS Review 74/2009 5 
unpredictable and uncertain world. In this case, for market participants who want to behave rationally, the most natural course is to assume the most pessimistic scenario and make the best of it.6 Such market participants will react more readily to bad news, to information about the worst conceivable circumstances, than they will to good news. What is more, in situations such as these, market participants tend to adopt a strategy of standing still until confidence has been restored.7 Actions that may be rational at the level of individual market participants can lead to a "fallacy of composition," which delays the restoration of functions for the market as a whole.  4.  Institutional issues on the financial system  I would next like to explore the background of the current financial crisis from the following two perspectives: monetary policy implementation and financial system design. Let me begin by considering monetary policy in the context of the so-called “bubble” phenomena.  It is extremely difficult for central banks to be aware in real time of the emergence and collapse of “bubbles”.8 There are two schools of thought about how to deal with bubbles. One says that you should wait and clean up after the collapse because it is difficult to be aware of bubbles as they emerge. The other argues that they should be dealt with quickly by reading the signs of a bubble from numerous indicators like asset prices. Both positions, however, acknowledge that it is difficult to identify the emergence and collapse of bubbles in real time. When a large bubble collapses and severely damages the financial system, monetary policy has extremely limited effects, as we have seen in the current financial crisis. Furthermore, if the process of bubble formation involves "Greenspan Put"-type expectations among market participants, it may lead to excessive risk-taking activities.  Thus, the current financial crisis raises the extraordinarily difficult question of how central banks should conduct monetary policies to stabilize financial systems, and ultimately, economies. While it is very important that this be discussed in detail, I will refrain from doing so in my remarks today because I wish to highlight another important question regarding the design of financial systems. The “credit bubble” and its collapse we have witnessed have resulted in a growing impetus in Europe and the United States to reconsider the existing regulatory framework. In the background is the financial deregulation that made great strides after the 1990s. The United States, under the Glass-Steagall Act, maintained a clear delineation between the banking and securities businesses ever after 1933. The Glass-Steagall Act came out of the lessons learned from the Great Depression and was designed to protect depositors by separating banking business from securities business so as to improve the soundness of banks. However, in 1999, amidst a global deregulatory movement, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act effectively tore down the walls between banking and securities businesses. This enabled large commercial banks to enter the securities business.  Meanwhile, in 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relaxed the leverage restrictions on investment banks. This deregulation was of decisive importance in the current                                                  6  If a decision maker’s confidence is “contaminated” or eroded in the sense that she thinks, though with a small probability (say ε), she is ignorant about the situation she faces, her rational behavior can be described as “maximin” optimization.

Ozaki (2007), “Irreversible Investment and Knightian Uncertainty,” Journal of Economic Theory, Vol. 136, pp. 668-694. 8 Shirakawa, Masaaki (2009), "Way Out of Economic and Financial Crisis: Lessons and Policy Actions" (Speech to the Japan Society, New York), Bank of Japan, April 23, 2009. 6 BIS Review 74/2009 
financial crisis.9 It is said that this deregulation resulted in a sharp increase in the leverage of US investment banks from a multiple of 12 to 33.  Recent years have, in addition, seen a growing role for the "shadow banking system" of financial operators outside the framework of banking regulation. Hedge funds and private equity funds epitomize the rise and fall of this shadow banking system. Able to freely engage in financial transactions without being bound by banking regulation, these financial operators used leverage to earn large profits. Investment banks can also be considered part of this shadow banking system because their regulation was looser than that imposed on commercial banks. There is nothing particularly wrong with the enlargement of shadow banking system itself if failure here does not pose a systemic risk. However, large commercial banks also developed close ties with the shadow banking system by having hedge funds under their umbrellas or by creating special purpose companies off their balance sheets to transfer related operations. It reached the point where the performance of these companies began to impact the soundness of major commercial banks themselves. In addition, the shadow banking system also had greater influence on the global financial system. When it began to face liquidity shortfalls, it accelerated the sale of its assets, bringing a downward spiral to asset prices, which in turn became one of the factors in systemic risk. The current financial crisis indicates that some form of regulation is necessary for the shadow banking system.  Another important point to be raised concerns the relationship between the Basel Accord (BIS rules) and the financial crisis, specifically the procyclicality of capital adequacy requirements. When the economy improves, bank lending increases and the economy accelerates because capital requirements become smaller, corresponding with reductions in downside risk. Conversely, when the economy deteriorates, bank lending decreases and the economy decelerates because capital requirements become larger as downside risk increases. Thus, capital adequacy requirements are considered to have the effect of amplifying business cycles.10 The procyclicality of capital adequacy requirements has been criticized for exacerbating the economic downturn in the current financial crisis. Nonetheless, it does not appear that a consensus has been reached on exactly how serious the procyclicality is. It will be important in the future that a new quantitative analysis be performed of the procyclicality to facilitate a more objective debate.  5.  Re-stabilizing the financial system  For the remainder of this speech, I would like to trace the recent debates from those concerning regulations to maintain the soundness of individual financial institutions to those about safety nets to maintain the stability of the entire financial system. In so doing, I will add some theoretical examinations.  In reviewing the recent debate, the framework of the "3 Cs" can be of some assistance.11 The 3 Cs stand for the words "comprehensive," "contingent" and "cost-effective." "Comprehensive" regulations are best understood as regulations without loopholes. Unless the regulatory net spans all financial institutions comprehensively, the more regulations are beefed up, the more funds will flee from strictly regulated sectors to more loosely regulated sectors.                                                  9  Blinder, A.

(2009), “Cycle-Proof Regulation,” The Economist, April 8, 2009. BIS Review 74/2009 7 
"Contingent" regulations have the following properties. During the up-phase period, they should mitigate overconfidence to prevent the accumulation of systemic risks Once systemic risk actually emerges, however, they should impose few restrictions to avoid reinforcing economic deterioration. In preparation for a severe erosion of confidence, they may be furnished with some policy incentives to restore confidence. To sum up, it is desirable that regulations be contingent on risk-taking attitudes of market participants, and thus strict during booms and loose during busts.  "Cost-effective" regulation is a concept which is important in the evaluation of regulations. This standard dictates that when one or more regulations could achieve the same results, the least expensive approach should be chosen. For example, if it is desirable to induce financial institutions to raise capital, it is better to do so during boom times when funding is readily available as opposed to slump times when the economy has begun to turn sour and the funding cost is higher. This standard is also important when considering how to use public funding. When making the decision between injecting capital and purchasing nonperforming credits, one must consider costs involved as well as benefits of policy effects.  Currently, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and many other fora, interest groups and ad hoc groups are floating many different proposals about how best to regulate finance. Taking the "3 Cs" in mind, I would like to take up several regulatory reform proposals that have come out of the international debate and examine their significance. In doing so, it is perhaps easiest to divide regulations into two categories: "ex ante measures" to be taken to prevent the crisis and "ex post measures" to influence how the crisis plays out when it happens. These could also be termed "policies for normal times" and "policies for emergency times."  (1)  Ex ante measures  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is taking the lead in a discussion on ways to alleviate the procyclicality of capital adequacy requirements. As I explained, current capital adequacy requirements are considered to have procyclicality properties. In response, the discussions focus on the idea of introducing variable "buffer capital." This would make it acceptable for institutions to accumulate capital when the economy is booming and draw it down when the economy slumps. However, one can also critique this argument in terms of the "3 Cs." Capital adequacy requirements are meaningless if they do not apply to all broadly-defined financial institutions, not just banks.  Even if this proposal is understood as being desirable from a qualitative standpoint, there are still many problems that would be involved in actual implementation. For example, on the idea of accumulating capital during boom times, there still is the question of specifically how much capital and at what pace it should be accumulated. And therein is the even more difficult question of how one defines and determines the business cycle. Implementation involves real-time judgments about when it is allowed to begin drawing down the buffer. However, as can be seen from the business-cycle dating problem for the Japanese economy, a long period of time is required before the peaks and troughs of the business cycle can be identified. There is also the need to clearly articulate how time lags between national business cycles will be treated. These are just a handful of issues that must be resolved before any such regulations could be fleshed out.  There is another international debate taking place on liquidity monitoring. As I noted, the current financial crisis initially emerged as a liquidity crisis. At the time, the system used by regulators to monitor the liquidity of internationally-active banks was inadequate. The discussion therefore turned to ways to increase the effectiveness of international monitoring by developing common liquidity metrics and sharing information among regulators. At the current point in time, the debate focuses on which liquidity metrics would be appropriate to use. However, there are significant differences from country to country in the effectiveness of liquidity monitoring. Japan engages in detailed monitoring with the cooperation of the 8 BIS Review 74/2009 
institutions involved, but there are some countries where the quality of monitoring is not very high. One-size-fit-all-type arguments are therefore not very realistic. Mechanisms must be sufficiently flexible and adaptable to the circumstances of individual countries.  With this in mind, I would like to mention a very interesting approach to the liquidity risk.12 Without a doubt, when the financial crisis is viewed as a liquidity crisis, the root cause is the excessive maturity mismatch on the balance sheets of funds and the like. Therefore, it would be desirable to have regulations that would provide incentives to alleviate this maturity mismatch, thereby preventing crisis. One possible solution would be to link the maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities with the capital requirement. For example, a bank raising funds from longer-term deposits would have a lower capital requirement than one raising funds in the overnight money market. This scheme would give banks an incentive to take longer maturities on the liabilities side in particular. Putting aside the question of whether it is desirable to link maturity mismatches with capital requirements, it is clear that the continuous monitoring for appropriate liquidity at financial institutions is an effective tool for detect the early-warning signs of financial crisis.  The G20 meetings held in April decided to reorganize the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) as a new "Financial Stability Board" (FSB). Previously, four international institutions, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, International Organization of Securities Commissions, International Association of Insurance Supervisors and International Accounting Standards Board, made independent judgments and took independent actions. The FSB is expected to serve as a kind of supervisory body of these institutions and provide coordination functions. The measure aims to overcome the differences among sectors and create regulations and rules that are consistent throughout the financial system. The G20 also decided to regulate hedge funds. This is the first step in bringing the shadow banking system within the net of regulations.  (2)  Ex post measures  The global economy is in the midst of a financial crisis. The ex post measures that I am about to describe are the policies and programs that are actually being implemented by governments and central banks today.  The United States and European countries have taken initiatives to address liquidity and fund-raising difficulties as part of steps to stabilize the financial system. These efforts can be organized into two categories: "granting government guarantees for market-based fund-raising" and "expanding deposit protection." Government guarantees for market-based fund-raising attempt to stabilize the market conditions for fund-raising, particularly for bond issuance by financial institutions, at a time when financial markets are increasingly strained. Most countries have also taken measures to raise deposit insurance ceiling in their deposit insurance schemes and/or to guarantee the unlimited protection of personal deposits. These measures succeed in alleviating the perceived uncertainties of depositors regarding the financial system, avoiding serious upheavals such as bank runs and providing banks with a stable source of fund-raising through deposits.  During the current financial crisis, countries have responded with comprehensive policy packages. Public capital injections were an important component in those packages. However, specific nature of these injections differs from country to country and even from time to time in the same country. In some cases, injections were made across the board, even to sound banks, as a preemptive measure, while in other cases injections were to bail out financial institutions that had recorded large losses and significantly impaired their                                                  12  Brunnermeier, M., A. Crockett, C. Goodhart, A. Persaud and H. Shin (2009), “The Fundamental Principles of Financial Regulation,” International Centre for Monetary and Banking Studies & Centre for Economic Policy Research, Geneva Report on the World Economy, Vol. 11, 2009. BIS Review 74/2009 9 
capital. There are also a number of differences in the design of instruments and accompanying conditions.  The United States and European countries’ governments purchase nonperforming assets and provide loss compensation schemes for these assets in order to cap loss amounts. These measures differed in terms of whether these assets were taken off balance sheets, timing when accounting losses on these assets are recognized and necessity for pricing of individual assets. Despite these differences, however, the aim was to remove concerns about the soundness of financial institutions by relieving uncertainty about their asset holdings.  When Japan confronted a severe financial system problem in the late 1990s, it began by buying up nonperforming assets and later moved to injections of public capital. In contrast, the first step for the United States and European countries in dealing with the current financial crisis was to inject public capital, and then they moved on to purchasing nonperforming assets.13 The reason for this difference, presumably, was the difficulty of valuing nonperforming assets and the speed with which the crisis was progressing. The nonperforming assets in the current crisis are complex securitized instruments, generally backed by home mortgages. With market functions significantly impaired, it is no easy task to arrive at pricing.  In the United States, the public and private sectors joined together to create a fund for the purchase of nonperforming assets in an attempt to take them off balance sheets. It remains to be seen whether this system will function as intended. As the real economy worsens, the scope of nonperforming assets is moving from securitized products to commercial and other loans. A further development must be watched very closely.  The impacts of the upheaval in international financial and capital markets vary across countries and regions. While the financial systems of the United States and European countries have been visibly shaken, the Japanese financial system remains stable on the whole. However, there is no guarantee that Japan will be spared a decline in financial intermediation functions because worsening earnings and falling share prices are now impinging on institutions' capital. Japan has taken a number of measures to achieve its policy goal of maintaining financial intermediation functions. On December 16, 2008, the Act on Special Measures for Strengthening Financial Functions was amended to provide for injections of public capital. On April 10, the Bank of Japan decided to provide subordinated loans to financial institutions in order to help them increase their capital. Prior to this, on February 3, it restarted a program to purchase equities from financial institutions so as to ensure the stability of the financial system by supporting to mitigate equity holding risks of financial institutions. This is a unique policy that is geared towards Japanese financial institutions, which tend to have large equity holdings. The government also restarted a purchasing program in March.  6.  Approach to new safety nets  Separate from the political movements to expand and strengthen regulation, there has also been a completely new approach proposed for stabilizing the financial system. What this financial crisis has clearly taught us is the extreme difficulty of strengthening banks' capital when a financial crisis is under way, that is, when macro systemic risk has materialized. Viewed from the opposite perspective, the creation of a safety net that would facilitate bank capital increases during times of crisis would greatly contribute to the stabilization of the                                                  13  The United States attempted unsuccessfully to introduce a scheme called "M-LEC" to purchase nonperforming assets similar to what was done in Japan. Since September 2008, it has instead opted to inject public funding, just as the European countries.  10 BIS Review 74/2009 
financial system. The new approach that I will explain focuses on this point. I would first like to introduce the idea of private-sector "capital insurance," which is an expansion on the concept of ordinary insurance. Then, while reviewing some of the problems involved in private-sector capital insurance, I would like to discuss the potential for capital insurance in the form of a public-private partnership to overcome them. Finally, several other schemes are also introduced from a variety of schemes proposed so far. These schemes come under the general rubric of "contingent capital" in that they are safety nets that attempts to increase capital when necessary during crisis while having as little impact as possible on the market.  (1)  Private sector "capital insurance"14Let me begin with an overview of private-sector "capital insurance." As its name suggests, this scheme involves an insurance policy. The bank has the same position as the insured in an ordinary insurance policy, while the investor has the position normally occupied by an insurance company. When an insurance policy is agreed, the bank pays the investor a premium. In response, the investor locks away liability reserves in a "lock box." Should there be a financial crisis, it pays insurance benefits to the bank from the lock box. The bank can use those funds to increase its capital. If the policy term elapses without a financial crisis, the liability reserves in the lock box return to the investor. This is the basic idea behind capital insurance.  What sorts of banks are envisioned as the insured? Professor Kashyap and other advocates of private sector capital insurance say that it should be open to all financial institutions subject to the Basel Accord (BIS rules). What is crucial is that all financial institutions with the potential to cause systemic risk be enrolled, although the proponents say that it should be up to the institutions to decide whether or not to enter into an insurance policy. I would like to return to this issue in a moment and discuss it more fully, since this issue is important in determining whether this will be an effective tool for avoiding systemic risk.  The next question is: Who are envisioned as insurers? Professor Kashyap and others argue that all investors not subject to the Basel Accord should be able to provide insurance. If an investor is subject to the Basel Accord, when financial crisis occurs, capital is merely transferred from one bank to another with no improvement in the soundness of the banking system as a whole. In other words, when crisis breaks out, maintaining the stability of the financial system requires the injection of capital from outside the system. According to Professor Kashyap and others, possible investors could be pension funds and sovereign wealth funds (SWF), but the problem is that there is no guarantee that these investors will invest in capital insurance. Finally, there is a question of how to identify the "insured events" that will trigger payouts of insurance benefits. The standard advocated by Professor Kashyap and other proponents is that the payout is triggered when a moving average (e.g., an average over four quarters) of the total losses of all financial institutions entering into insurance policies exceeds a certain threshold value. Their point is that it is important to look at losses for the banking system as a whole, not those for individual institutions. It reflects the fact that the capital insurance they propose is ultimately an insurance against systemic risk or financial crisis. However, putting aside clear cases such as what we find now, it can be a very difficult and subtle task to determine what constitutes a financial crisis. This is another important point that needs to be addressed from the perspective of risk management, since it relates to the questions of how quickly the scheme would be able to strengthen capital without mistakes. While the proposal of Professor Kashyap and others can seem a bit novel, it does constitute an attempt to provide a safety net for the financial system by attaching insurance so that                                                  14  Kashyap, A. K., R. G. Rajan and J. C. Stein (2009), “Rethinking Capital Regulation,” in: Maintaining Stability in a Changing Financial System, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, pp. 431-471.

capital is above a certain threshold. It is also an excellent attempt to internalize external diseconomies. During the 1990s, Japan injected enormous amounts of capital into its banks in order to stabilize its financial system. Likewise, enormous amounts of capital have been injected into European and US financial institutions during the current financial crisis. While there are some institutions that anticipate being able to repay the funds quickly, there are others that will continue to require larger and larger injections. If this capital is not returned, it will be the taxpayers that ultimately bear the costs. As I touched upon in the discussion of the "credit bubble," financial institutions engaged in excessive risk-taking under the assumption that governments and central banks would do something if there were a problem. That is, financial institutions generated the external diseconomies of systemic risk, not bearing the cost of its cleanup, but keeping all of the profits for themselves. This proposal asks institutions to bear the cost of materialized systemic risk in the form of premiums. In that sense, it internalizes external diseconomies.  That being said, the proposal tabled by Professor Kashyap and others also has many problems. First, the capital insurance that they advocate is entirely private and the main insurers will be private-sector investors. Will private-sector investors on their own be able to come up with the enormous liability reserves that would be required to halt systemic risk? They look to pension funds and SWFs to play this role, but will we always rely on them? Obviously, you might be able to attract enough investors if premiums are sufficiently high. But if premiums are too high, most financial institutions would forgo insurance altogether.15  Also, as crisis deepens, institutions may require capital injections beyond the amounts initially envisioned. There is the potential for systemic risk to materialize after all of the liability reserves have been paid out of the lock box. A crisis like the current one that is global in its dimensions may be beyond what private sector funds alone can deal with. In these situations, will it really be possible to stop the erosion of confidence? That said, this idea should be better combined with additional government-based insurance as a set to deal with large losses, and only by doing so, will it be possible to maintain confidence in capital insurance.  The proposal by Professor Kashyap and others is that enrollment in capital insurance be voluntary. There is no guarantee, therefore, that all financial institutions that impact financial system stability would purchase capital insurance. This is the classic free-rider problem. In particular, a bank that considers itself "too big to fail" might very well decide not to purchase capital insurance. If it is indeed "too big to fail," then its bankruptcy would generate systemic risk and the government could be expected to bail it out regardless of whether it enrolled in capital insurance. If that assumption is correct, the bank has no incentive to purchase capital insurance. What we end up with is a situation in which no one purchases capital insurance as long as they believe that the government will never allow financial crisis to occur. There is also the question of capital insurance pricing. For ordinary insurance products, pricing is based on the law of large numbers. However, a financial crisis is a "tail event" that rarely occurs, or it is a phenomenon for which the probability distribution is completely unknown. In either case, the law of large numbers cannot be used to price capital insurance.  (2)  Capital insurance as a public-private partnership  As I have noted, the scheme proposed by Professor Kashyap and others has many problems. However, some of them can be solved if public institutions are used to back up private capital insurance. First, by having public institutions responsible for a part of the insurance, it is possible to provide liability reserves of sufficient size. Moreover, there is no need to actually put liability reserves away. It is sufficient for there to be a commitment to                                                  15  Professor Blinder made similar comments regarding the paper of Professor Kashyap et. al. at the symposium sponsored last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. 12 BIS Review 74/2009 
fiscal outlays if an insured event occurs.16 In addition, government’s involvement would prevent private premiums from becoming too high in the face of phenomena that carry large uncertainties.17  Private sector expertise must be marshaled in order for any such insurance program to be effective. Therefore, one option that is quite possible is to create a public-private partnership in which efficient private sector institutions originate capital insurance that is, for all purposes, "re-insured" by the government. That is the form that Japan uses to provide "earthquake insurance." A public-private partnership for capital insurance enables the system to draw upon the expertise of the private sector to achieve greater efficiency than would be seen if capital insurance were provided by public institutions only.  To have a well-functioning capital insurance, we need not only its public nature, but also an element of mandatory enrollment. More specifically, financial institutions with the potential to trigger systemic risk must be required to enroll in an insurance program. This solves the free-rider problem. It might also allow financial institutions to opt out of the insurance program. However, in such cases, the financial institution would be required to scale back its business and demonstrate that it will not trigger systemic risk. Even still, it is no easy matter to come up with objective criteria that can be used to identify "financial institutions with the potential to trigger systemic risk." There is also a question of whether only banks need be covered by the insurance. It is impossible to foresee which business models will be the source of future instability in the financial system. Therefore, regulators must constantly review the definition of a "financial institution with the potential to trigger systemic risk" as their financial sectors develop and evolve. The remaining issue is that of pricing the insurance. The involvement of public institutions in the provision of insurance means that the burdens ultimately revert to the public. It goes without saying that it is only fair for the public to bear some of the cost because they enjoy the benefits of a stable financial system. An important issue in this will be convincing the public of the appropriateness of insurance pricing.  This will require a bit of creativity in the mechanisms used to set premiums. As a rather simple example, consider a mechanism by which premiums are based on a measurement of the institution's systemic risk, defined in terms of its gross assets. In such cases, a financial institution that is right on the border between enrolling and not enrolling in insurance may elect to reduce the size of its assets so that it is not compelled to enroll. If premiums are set on the low side to encourage these financial institutions to participate, they will be too low to provide a deterrent to further risk-taking by financial institutions that carry large systemic risks. Without going into detail here, this problem can be solved with a progressive premium geared to the size of the institution. If the government is involved in insurance, it may be impossible to avoid giving the impression that this is a government-funded "bailout insurance." If that is the case, there may be new moral hazards for financial institutions. Indeed, it is not overstating the case to say that the biggest hurdle to the involvement of public institutions in capital insurance is how to suppress moral hazards. Therefore, the introduction of capital insurance with public institution involvement cannot be allowed to undermine the importance of the regulatory supervision of enrolled institutions.                                                   16  Rochet, J.

Likewise, even if such an insurance program were to be created, it would not in any way reduce the importance of accurately communicating information on financial system stability to market participants and the general public in a manner that avoids amplifying uncertainties. The more complex the insurance program becomes, the less effective it will be in alleviating the "fear and panic" psychology of investors. For instance, if uninsured financial institutions were to fail during a financial crisis, would it be possible to maintain confidence? No one has ever tested this point, and no one can predict the outcome with any certainty.  (3)  Other discussions  In addition to these schemes, there have been many other proposals put forward to enable capital to be strengthened when financial institutions are in crisis, and they have served as the starting points for active discussions on how to deal with macro systemic risk. I would like to give you a brief overview of some of them.  The first is an instrument called a "catastrophe bond." Most people use the abbreviated form "cat bond." The issuer of this instrument is relieved of its obligation to repay principal to investors if certain conditions are satisfied. By selling investors a bond in which redemption is waived in the event of major losses, a bank is able to maintain its capital even if losses are incurred. For example, if the bank is holding nonperforming credits, it could forgive large amounts of debts so that it could simultaneously downsize both the asset and liability sides while keeping its capital untouched.  Another similar instrument is called the "reverse convertible debenture."18 This is a bond that is automatically converted to equity if certain conditions are satisfied. Putting aside the issue of accounting treatment, this instrument has very similar effects on capital to a cat bond. By selling investors a bond that is converted to equity in the event of major losses, a bank would be able to raise its capital automatically even if losses were incurred.  Finally, there is a contract known as the "margin call on shareholders."19 This contract allows an issuer to compel shareholders to purchase additional shares when certain conditions are satisfied. For example, by issuing equity with this kind of agreement attached, a bank that incurs large losses could cause its existing shareholders to purchase new equity, reducing the need to raise capital from the market.  With all of these instruments, it is possible to set the triggers differently according to specific purposes. For instance, if the objective is to maintain the soundness of a specific financial institution, the trigger would probably be the losses of that institution. If the objective is to prevent systemic risk, the trigger would be the total losses of all financial institutions enrolled in the system. In the latter case, uniform triggers would need to be set so that all contracts are fulfilled at the same time.  In this section, I have tried to give you an overview of several different forms of financial instrument that could be part of a safety net for the financial system. There would need to be some form of mechanism in place for all financial institutions with the potential to trigger systemic risk to hold such instruments. Mandatory purchases are one approach, but there should also be some thought given to incentives so that financial institutions purchase them of their own accord. One effective method might be to allow institutions to count such instruments as capital.                                                   18  Flannery, M. J. (2005), “No Pain, No Gain?

7.  Conclusions  There is a growing momentum, particularly in Europe, for stronger bank regulation. The argument is based on the opinion that the current global financial crisis would not have occurred if regulation had been sufficiently strong. However, one must question whether stronger regulation by itself will prevent future financial crises. There has been no demonstration on this point, and indeed, it has not even been fully discussed, even in academic circles. There is an undeniable impression that most of the debate on banking regulation in recent months has accepted the assumption that stronger regulation is necessary to prevent the recurrence of crisis without any critical investigation.  There should also be a careful and cautious discussion of the side effects from more regulation. If one takes a step back to the fundamental economic perspective of government involvement versus economic efficiency, there are two trade-offs in particular that could be considered to be of importance. The first is the relationship between improved financial intermediation functions and financial system stability. Stronger regulation may indeed increase the stability of the financial system. On the other hand, government interference has the potential to reduce economic efficiency. Inefficiency in the financial services sector manifests itself in the form of reduced financial intermediation functions. These questions can be viewed as issues of public economics and the tools of this discipline need to be applied to a cost-benefit analysis from the two perspectives of quality and quantity. Such an analysis should be applied to a wide range of candidate regulations in order to arrive at the best balance between economic efficiency and government regulation and interference.  The second point to consider is the trade-off between financial sector innovation and financial system stability. When unease in the financial system surfaces, there is always an argument about restricting the operations that financial institutions can undertake, as manifested by “narrow banking” approaches. However, in many cases, this argument is lack of a perspective of financial innovation. It would be very difficult indeed to enhance value added in the finance industry without using innovation to flexibly adapt to dynamic economic developments.  We must therefore consider approaches to promoting innovation while also maintaining the stability of the system. In doing so, we must pay attention to the two forms of innovation: One is achieved by the consolidation and attrition of companies and the other is achieved within a single company. Japan has a large number of "long-established" companies, a fact that illustrates the process of innovation in the latter sense that has taken place again and again over time. Financial sector is no exception: Innovation occurs primarily within banks. Therefore, promoting innovation in the financial sector can be seen as a question of promoting a "scrap and build process" within organizations as the environment changes. The current global financial crisis raises significant issues for financial institution risk management and supervisory regulation. In my remarks today, I have described some of the very active debates that are currently taking place. Japan experienced the rupture of an asset bubble in the early 1990s and a prolonged period of financial and economic stagnation thereafter. We therefore have the advantage of being able to discuss issues realistically on the basis of our experiences. I look forward to greater contributions to the debate from the Japanese academic community, and with that hope I would like to close my remarks today. Thank you for your kind attention.

Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell: Beyond the turmoil – rules, supervision and infrastructures Speech by Ms Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the opening panel at the SPIN 2009 Conference, Rome, 15 June 2009. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to participate in the opening discussion at this conference. The organisers, in choosing the title of the panel, have given us the challenging task to look beyond the current turmoil surrounding rules, supervision and infrastructures. This is certainly not easy as we cannot yet speak of an end to the difficult period facing both the financial and real sectors of the economy. However, looking beyond the turmoil and start implementing the lessons we have learned is exactly what is needed at this point in time. Against the background of the crisis up until now, we have to draw the right conclusions and begin designing the future of the financial architecture, including new rules and improved supervision and oversight. This needs to be done now before the window of opportunity – which will not remain open forever – closes.  However, before looking beyond the turmoil let me take the opportunity first to examine the performance of market infrastructures in the current crisis. Developments in the financial markets and the fate of specific institutions have been at the heart of the public debate. However, owing to the close interdependencies between financial markets, intermediaries and infrastructures, the difficulties affecting institutions and markets have also had a knock-on effect on market infrastructures, putting the functioning of payment systems, central counterparties and securities settlement systems under a real-life stress test. Fortunately, as I will illustrate in a moment, EU market infrastructures have proven to be remarkably resilient, thereby limiting the overall systemic risk. In the main this has been due to the successful interaction between industry, regulators and overseers, just like – if I may – in the Italian banking sector, which has also shown itself to be remarkably resilient in the current circumstances.  In the second part of my intervention, I would indeed like to look beyond the current turmoil. I will – despite the very positive overall assessment for infrastructures – point to three areas that warrant particular attention for the future of market infrastructures. The first of these is the enhancement of overall crisis management arrangements for market infrastructures. The second involves strengthening market infrastructures for OTC derivatives. And third, given the importance of retail markets to the overall stability and efficiency of the financial system, there is the need to complete the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). Performance of EU market infrastructures during the financial turmoil  The financial market turmoil has impacted on EU payment systems, central counterparties (CCPs) and securities settlement systems mainly through intensified and more volatile market activity. We have also seen some peaks in transaction volumes as well as more frequent and higher margin calls. Furthermore, many infrastructures have had to cope with the default of a major participant, notably in the context of the demise of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and the corresponding spill-over effects on its subsidiaries.  Fortunately, EU market infrastructures were able effectively to overcome these challenges without any major operational disruptions. In particular, the Eurosystem’s TARGET system – which is not only the backbone of the large-value payment infrastructure for the euro, but also plays a central role in providing settlement services for 36 retail payment systems and 33 securities settlement systems that are connected as ancillary systems – has proven to be BIS Review 74/2009 1 
stable and resilient. Nonetheless, I would like to mention three key stylised facts which illustrate the impact of the current turmoil:  First, the values processed in TARGET in the last quarter of 2008 showed an unusually high increase of 13% compared to the first three quarters (see Chart 1). When looking at the average values settled in different time bands during the day, the main difference between the third and the fourth quarter of 2008 relates to the values settled in the last hour of operations. This reflects the strong increase in overnight deposits made by banks with national central banks as a consequence of the switch to the full allotment fixed rate tenders in the ECB’s open market operations, following the intensification of the crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.  Second, not surprisingly from September 2008 onwards, we see a remarkable increase in the number of sender limits along with a decrease in their value (see Chart 2). Nonetheless, these changes had a marginal impact on the smooth flow of transactions and did not cause delays to the timely submission of payments.  Third, the level of non-settled payments remained fairly stable in the second half of 2008, amounting to just 1% or so of the total daily average value settled in the system (see Chart 3), indicating the overall resilience of the TARGET system in the face of the financial turmoil.  Crucially, market infrastructures continued to function robustly. In particular, by providing stable networks despite the highly disruptive conditions in financial markets, market infrastructures played an important shock-absorbing role and helped to maintain overall public confidence in the financial system.  Since central banking overseers and financial regulators recognised long ago the critical importance of the reliable functioning of market infrastructures for overall financial stability and efficiency, they took action together with the service providers. Stringent requirements ensure that EU infrastructures are adequately designed, effectively manage their risks, and operate efficiently and reliably, both under normal circumstances and at times of crisis. Recent experiences suggest that these measures were well-targeted. Nevertheless, some areas for further improvement have also been identified. I shall now mention a few key areas for further action.  Areas for improvement As stated, I would like to focus on three areas: firstly, improvements related to the overall crisis management arrangements; secondly, the strengthening of market infrastructures for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives; and thirdly, efforts geared to producing a more integrated retail payments infrastructure. Crisis management arrangements One priority that relates to the overall crisis management arrangements is to further improve notification procedures, particularly regarding the communication of insolvencies by public authorities and infrastructure providers to market participants. Although this has generally worked well during the current turmoil, some measures are in progress to foster the exchange of standardised information.  In addition, further measures are needed to ensure close cooperation with the authorities regarding the relationship with the defaulting participant and the coordination of measures to limit the impact of the default. Moreover, it might be an advantage if infrastructures were able to end unilaterally the contractual relationship with the participant (without waiting for the final decision by the relevant judicial or administrative authority). Furthermore, the current turmoil has reminded us that default rules need to be not only sufficiently clear and comprehensive for the infrastructure participant, but also that they 2 BIS Review 74/2009 
should not cause any conflict between infrastructures. Therefore, as infrastructures are becoming increasingly interlinked, more coordination in the implementation of the default rules is vital for further mitigating risks at the systemic level. Finally, the default of Lehman Brothers was a major showcase for the severe implications of “institution-based interdependencies” between two or more infrastructures resulting from the exposures of major financial institutions participating in each of these infrastructures. Therefore, it is crucial for us to continue closely monitoring the interdependencies between individual institutions in order to assess their impact on the stability of the infrastructure. Infrastructures for OTC derivatives Let me now turn to the need to strengthen the infrastructure for OTC derivatives. OTC derivative markets have been very dynamic with a veritable explosion in outstanding contract volumes primarily over the past decade. The basic problem, however, is that this very dynamic evolution of OTC derivatives markets has outstripped development of the underlying clearing and settlement arrangements. Indeed, as the post-trading of OTC derivatives remained predominantly bilateral and non-standardised, the respective arrangements have become increasingly inadequate for coping with the growing volumes and complexity of OTC derivatives trades. This was highlighted in particular during the financial market turmoil, when higher trading activity and market volatility further aggravated the existing tensions. [The resulting processing backlogs and uncertainties about counterparty risk raised strong concerns among policymakers, as highlighted in the Financial Stability Forum’s April 2008 report 1 on the lessons from the financial turmoil.]  The need to strengthen market infrastructures for credit default swaps (CDS) stems from the importance of CDS markets for overall financial stability, for three reasons. First, the systemic importance of CDS markets comes from the high degree of interconnectivity between CDS markets and credit and cash securities markets, the embedded financial leverage of CDS, and the significant level of CDS exposures in relation to the total assets and capital cushions of the banks involved. Second, the associated financial risks, for example when compared to interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, are more difficult to manage. This stems from the greater underlying complexity and the correlations between different CDS exposures when market-wide strains occur. Third, specific risks to financial stability stem from the high degree of market concentration where very sizable financial risks are held by a small group of major market players. Therefore – as we have seen not only with the default of Lehman Brothers, but also the earlier near-defaults of Bear Stearns and AIG – the default of one major CDS counterparty can put these markets under very severe strain. A natural inference from our experiences during the current turmoil is, therefore, to improve the resilience of OTC derivatives markets through a more widespread adoption of central counterparty clearing or exchange trading. Central counterparties (CCPs), by concentrating all outstanding derivatives positions of the participating buyers and sellers in one place, enable a significant reduction in counterparty risk: firstly, through the diversification and netting of risk exposures; secondly, through the application of stringent risk-based margining procedures to ensure adequate management; thirdly, through collateralisation of outstanding exposures on at least a daily or even intra-day basis. In addition, CCPs also contribute significantly to market transparency and integrity and bring significant operational efficiency gains, e.g. through the standardisation of risk management processes as well as via multilateral netting and collateral management.                                                   1  Financial Stability Forum, “Report of the Financial Stability Forum on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience”, April 2008. BIS Review 74/2009 3 
As a result, public authorities and industry bodies worldwide have embraced the establishment of CCPs for CDS markets as a top priority and we expect a number of solutions in both the EU and the United States to be up and running by the end of July 2009. In view of the role of the euro for the derivatives market, I would welcome a CCP in the euro area. The effective and timely implementation of the respective roadmaps and full dealer commitment to making the maximum possible use of these facilities will be essential.  Looking ahead, it will also be vital to ensure close convergence between the requirements and approaches of the overseers and regulators involved so as to maintain a level playing-field between the different CCPs and pre-empt possible regulatory arbitrage. At EU level, the forthcoming ESCB-CESR recommendations for central counterparties have already been revised to include specific guidance on their application to CCPs for OTC derivatives. It is now also crucial to achieve such a common understanding at the global level as well. In this respect, we look forward to the recently initiated joint efforts of the CPSS and IOSCO to review the CPSS-IOSCO recommendations for central counterparties issued in 2004. Finally, I wish to reiterate that the introduction of CCPs will not be a panacea for addressing all concerns regarding the resilience and efficiency of OTC derivatives markets. For instance, we will need complementary action to ensure better risk management and transparency as well for those products that are not yet sufficiently standardised to be eligible for central clearing. Furthermore, sound post-trading needs to be complemented by enhanced trading, pre-clearing and lifecycle management of OTC derivatives, e.g. via the greater use of automated trading and confirmation, portfolio compression, the registration of all trades in central data depositories, as well as enhanced risk management and disclosure requirements for the financial institutions involved in OTC derivatives trading.  Towards more efficient and resilient retail infrastructures for the euro area  Let me finally come to the third issue we need to focus on beyond the current turmoil: the vital role of retail infrastructures in terms of financial stability. The retail business facilitates the bulk of payments related to the day-to-day lives and financial activities of both individuals and companies. It represents the financial system’s interface with the general public and is crucial for preserving confidence in the financial system and, ultimately, in the euro as the single currency.  Two issues relating to the retail business and the current turmoil are noteworthy. First, the retail business – with its cornerstones of saving, lending, and payment services – has successfully withstood the financial crisis. Second, banks with a balanced business model have been best equipped to cope with the current challenges. Therefore, retail services offer two major opportunities at the present time: first, to revive confidence in the banking sector in the eyes of the general public; second, to strengthen banks’ balance sheets.  However, one important – sometimes overlooked – issue seems a key prerequisite: in the same way as the large value infrastructures mentioned before, stable and efficient retail infrastructures are needed throughout Europe in order to alleviate systemic risk and safeguard financial stability. However, despite 50 years of European economic integration, Europe is still lacking an integrated retail payments market.  Therefore, the further realisation and completion of the Single Euro Payments Area project is a crucial element for the retail banking and payments market beyond the turmoil. Without doubt, SEPA is the largest payment initiative undertaken in Europe, following the euro cash changeover. Major milestones have already been achieved: only recently, regulators have addressed the uncertainties surrounding interchange fees and the reachability of the SEPA Direct Debit. Nevertheless there are still a number of further topics on our common agenda, e.g. standardisation in cards, payment innovations, a migration end date, and the governance of payment issues at the European level.  4 BIS Review 74/2009 
Harmonisation in the field of retail payments is a natural area for efficiency gains. However, the market is moving only slowly in this direction. Although SEPA continues to be a mainly self-regulated project, some elements might need more regulator involvement. The Eurosystem has emphasised that a realistic but ambitious SEPA migration end date is necessary. Such a date would facilitate communication and provide more certainty for all stakeholders. The most viable option for achieving an end date is through regulation by the public authorities. Since an EU regulation is probably the most effective option the Eurosystem appreciates the Commission’s launch of a public consultation on this topic.  Only by tearing down the walls of fragmentation can we ultimately bring about harmonisation, efficiency gains and a level playing-field. Such a development inevitably leads to increased competition. I am fully aware that it is not easy – especially in a period of low growth and higher credit risks – to change revenue models. However, those who invest early will benefit and position themselves successfully. Corporates tell us that they would benefit from SEPA services because they are internationally connected. Taking into consideration the renewed relevance of retail payments, the key success factors in the years ahead will be harmonisation, innovation and increased competitiveness. Banks and infrastructures will successfully take up these challenges only by continuing to play an important role in retail payments. Conclusion  From the very beginning of the crisis, the ECB has acted in a decisive manner. It has taken a number of measures unprecedented in nature, scope and timing. The ECB has provided large amounts of liquidity support to banks. By making changes to its operational framework, the ECB made sure that all solvent banks would have sufficient access to funding. When the crisis intensified in September last year, we introduced a number of new measures. Most importantly, we provided banks with unlimited access to liquidity at fixed rates for up to six months. The ECB also expanded its list of assets eligible for use as collateral in the Eurosystem’s credit operations. Moreover, we recently announced further measures, namely to provide longer term refinancing up to one year and to purchase covered bonds of up to EUR 60 bn. Looking now beyond the turmoil on rules, regulation and infrastructures, the current financial turmoil has taught us one key lesson for the future: self-regulation is not sufficient for systemically important markets, institutions and infrastructures. Maintaining financial stability is in the public interest. Therefore, public authorities must take appropriate measures to regulate, supervise and oversee systemically important markets, institutions and infrastructures in order to prevent systemic risks spreading and safeguard the financial stability of the system.  For market infrastructures, one lesson for the future is that, despite their remarkable resilience in the current crisis, there is no room for complacency given their crucial role in financial stability. On the contrary, overseers and regulators in future years need to increase their efforts towards ensuring safer and more secure market infrastructures and also to further strengthen EU market infrastructures. I have highlighted three specific areas for enhancement. First, the general crisis management arrangements, particularly on disseminating information and increasing awareness about default arrangements of market infrastructures. Second, measures for building market infrastructures for OTC derivatives, also in the euro area. And third – as in the case of large value payment systems – the need for a more integrated and harmonised retail payments structure. Therefore, I regard continued full support from all stakeholders for the effective and timely implementation of the Single Euro Payments Area as a key priority for the period ahead. Thank you for your attention. BIS Review 74/2009 5

Martín Redrado: What’s wrong with the current framework of global financial architecture? Speech by Mr Martín Redrado, Governor of the Central Bank of Argentina, at Bank Indonesia’s 7th Annual International Seminar “Global financial tsunami: what can we do?”, Bali, 13 June 2009. *      *      * Climate change is not the topic of this seminar, as it was last year, but it is appropriately embedded in the label for the occasion. This is particularly appealing for the turbulent times the global economy is going through. The international environment seems to be emerging from a unique combination of natural catastrophes: extensive droughts on credit markets, earthquake on trade and a flood of distrust. And, as if the former weren’t enough, we are now confronting the risks of an A-flu pandemic. In a context of several structural changes that the economy is experiencing worldwide, there are also different microclimates. First, I will briefly provide my vision on where the global economy is heading to. For this purposes, I will assess the recent developments on these “micro-environments” as they add several question marks to the likelihood of achieving a sustainable and long-lasting recovery. Then, the lessons learned so far from the crisis in terms of the changes needed in regulatory and policy frameworks both at the national and supra-national levels will be addressed. In the case of how the global financial infrastructure is evolving and what path it should follow, I will stress both its lender of last resort role and its regulatory function.  The U.S. economy is still on “de-leveraging” mode. The two-fold hit of financial assets and home equity loss led to a significant wealth destruction combined with debt overhang that is calling for a stronger correction of savings. This process has already begun with PCE figures. They reveal a savings rate that jumped from zero early last year to about five percent today. Further adjustment is in the pipeline. The labor market is still on the downside, amid continuing massive lays-off in manufacturing sector. Although some particular areas seem to be bottoming out like construction and services – there is some evidence that the intense declines in output that we have seen are over – spending is still weak. We can describe, so far, what we are witnessing recently is as a “jobless recovery”. On the monetary and financial side, the string of initiatives launched one after the other have not delivered as expected in terms of kicking start the credit market. PPIP, TALF, TSLF, TARP; it is even hard to track such an extensive list of programs aimed at supplying liquidity, fresh capital and re-starting securitization but more with the goal of boosting market activity than crowding it out. On the demand side, one drawback going forward is that financial institutions are not likely to take advantage of excessive leverage as it happened in the past. On the supply side, much debate is around exit strategies. Particularly, how the Fed is going to deal with the massive liquidity provision, which is seen as an increasing inflationary risk. However there is a point to be made on the opposite direction: I mean a deflationary scenario as a result of the unwinding of the liquidity provision. If the Fed obtains any profit due to its operation (given a revaluation of financial assets bought, which would, of course be, a good news) it would end up withdrawing more cash from the market than the formerly issued. This could trigger a new dry up on the markets. So, it is not just about returning to the pre-crisis balance sheet of Fed. In my view, the roadmap for a sustainable recovery of should have several features such as: i) long term funding, which is still absent; ii) households balance sheets repair (the micro-fundamentals point to additional adjustment still to come); iii) banks balance sheets repair; the banking will be redesigned on the basis of simpler criteria, with lower leverage and more BIS Review 73/2009 1 
capital. Burying the old system and enabling a new one to emerge will take time; and iv) long-run fiscal and monetary sustainability. On the other edge of the Atlantic, Europe is caught in a delicate situation. First, the divergence between policy makers about fiscal and monetary policy measures to prevent a deepening of the slump. And, second, the “East menace”, which is the sizable exposure of its banking system to Eastern Europe risk. Currency mismatches and their impact on credit risk still poses significant challenges for the region. In fact, the whole periphery (both East and West) is under scrutiny due to the brutal adjustment in aggregate spending that is yielding sky-rocket unemployment.  In the emerging world, the adjustment is also taking place. And, in some cases, it is showing up the hard way. We witness Asian economies suffering from a collapse on trade which is mostly region-driven. Figures reveal that U.S. imports did not fall as much as intra-Asia trade. On the positive side, inventories data in East Asia suggest that the retrenchment on industrial activity might be over. Again, here also the “green shoots” could be the effect of anti-crisis packages rather than a more lasting effect with domestic consumption taking the “driver’s seat”.  On our side Latin America has been better prepared to face this crisis both when comparing with history and with the way other emerging markets are being affected. And, of course, these developments have not been achieved by chance. Following the crises of the 1990s and 2000s, our countries have taken important steps to strengthen macroeconomic management, prudential regulation and oversight. Improved current account and fiscal positions, large amounts of external liquidity, better liability management and robust monetary frameworks are several features that place my region not even in the first row of the fire line at this time. I would like to stress, in particular, the strengthening of balance sheets, including the built up of liquidity buffers to face external shocks and the reduced currency mismatches – one of the key sins of the past. The development of a domestic currency capital market was a corner-stone that allow the monetary and financial system to act as a shock smoother rather than a shock amplifier. Several challenges lie ahead to restore a normal path in the world financial system. Let me tackle this issue by sharing my views on some of the relevant topics that need to be addressed at the national and supra-national order. At the national level, one of the key structural changes is that financial stability is now ranking higher on every central bank goals worldwide. Both developed and emerging countries have had to adjust monetary schemes focused on the interest rate as the single instrument to maintain stability. In my region, financial stability has always been at the forefront of the central banks´ tool kit due to our recurrent crisis. In fact, financial stability objectives were implicitly and explicitly added, and instruments were adjusted to new priorities. Within this framework, many central banks have had to revisit their usual regulation, operation and intervention mechanisms.  In this regard, the economic literature is lagging behind. If the relationship between economic theory and policy recommendations is reasonably well defined during “normal” times, in times of turmoil, this relationship becomes much weaker. We have reached a point in which economic theory is having a hard time keeping up with praxis. Literature has shown results that are ambiguous or contrary to those produced by the usual “technology”, especially in relation to the approach that relies on the interest rate as the single instrument. The same applies to the managed floating exchange rate regimes. Recent empirical papers that refined the analysis started by several academics argue against sharp fluctuations in the domestic currency. Instead, mitigating excessive volatility, especially in developing countries with rather shallow capital markets and limited access to hedging instruments, seems to be an appropriate policy. This kind of monetary and financial framework that ensures systemic stability has been my main task during the last years. This means giving priority to avoiding "the next crisis" and 2 BIS Review 73/2009 
building buffers to minimize the effects of disruptions. In my country, the decades of macroeconomic instability and recurrent crises were not harmless in terms of welfare. Although Latin American countries have shown lower economic growth rates and higher macroeconomic volatility than other regions, the case of Argentina is on a different scale. If we consider the past 30 years, the average growth in Latin America was less than half of Asia’s, with volatility that nearly doubled Asian levels. In that period of time, Argentina’s growth was three times lower than in Emerging Asia, while volatility turned out to be eight times higher. This process triggered enormous economic and social losses, hindering on our chances to develop and leading to changes in our citizens’ behavior. Indeed, the consequences of this process include portfolio dollarization; fiscal dominance; obstacles to develop a long-term credit market; and the marked negative correlation between changes in retail deposits and foreign exchange fluctuations. These factors, which undermined the power of some traditional monetary policy instruments, have played a key role in the design of our current monetary and financial system. In particular, our risk management strategy based on four pillars (permanent equilibrium in the monetary market, managed floating exchange rate regime, development of external liquidity buffers, appropriate financial regulation and supervision) is compatible with these aims as well as with the tools available. This scheme, which was carefully developed along recent years, now allows us to overcome each episode of stress, minimizing the impact on the real economy and avoiding inconsistencies that might make it unsustainable over time. Over the last two years, we have experienced four periods to significant financial stress in the domestic market and our monetary and financial framework has delivered. In each of the events, we first reacted firmly to normalize the money demand and stabilize the foreign exchange market. Then, with simple instruments, we ensured liquidity provision to guarantee systemic stability. Finally, we implemented an array of measures including reforms on the markets for Central Bank securities, the development of additional mechanisms for liquidity provision, changes to enhance futures market depth and transparency, and instruments to facilitate supply of foreign currency. Our system worked as a dam to the rest of the economy, providing for the first time in decades monetary and financial stability. So in my view, there is a need to rethink the paradigm for Central Banks so that we have the tools to provide monetary and financial stability. Now let me move from the national level to the global one. In this instance a more sophisticated supra-national framework is urgently needed to deal with financial stability. Any roadmap should have at least the following ingredients:  i) Greater convergence in financial regulation and supervision standards among countries; ii) Rethinking the role of the IMF; iii) Reinforcement of macro-prudential supervision and regulation tools; iv) Reformulation of asset valuation methods;  v) Avoidance regulatory arbitrage and control of shadow banking system;  vi) Redefinition of the credit rating agencies function. Current events show that cross-border banking operation has both systemic and macroeconomic consequences domestically and internationally. This calls for coordinated actions between national authorities together with a more aggressive “stepping up” from international financial institutions. Let me be very clear: the international architecture is in desperate need of a “guardian” for global financial stability. This is, of course, a well-suited role for the IMF given its global reach and infrastructure.  So far, the IMF has announced a series of measures, which revisited its traditional credit practices and created new credit lines, such as the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) and the Exogenous Shock Facility (ESF). These are welcomed steps but also “baby” steps. As long BIS Review 73/2009 3 
as a comprehensive set of products for different countries with different particular needs is not developed, any attempt to perform this role effectively would fall short. The IMF should have the fire power to deal with global events but should also have the proper equipment. This means making available instruments to ensure the adequate circulation of liquidity worldwide.  This may include: short-term credit for liquidity purposes for central banks tailored to the specific needs of the country , guarantee schemes to develop a particular domestic credit market and a variety of products for countries facing capital outflows that are unrelated to their economic fundamentals, among others.  It is not a matter of chance that so many bilateral swaps agreements between Central Banks emerged during the crisis. It is a natural response of the system to the lacking of an international provider of liquidity of last resort going forward. In my view, while this is very welcomed, the arrangements are not enough it terms of size and length to provide an alternative to self-insurance via foreign reserve accumulation. In fact, the development of all of the bilateral agreements and the regional initiatives such as Chiang Mai just prove the need for international cooperation in a context of an absence of a multilateral organization in a position to perform as a kind of “central bank of the central banks”. This is the next step we need to go for. And for this to happen, the role of the G-20 is critical. So far, the group has managed to build consensus on the relevant issues and has been able to make some progress both in the reform of the international financial architecture (expansion of the FSF and the Basel Committee, the capitalization of the IMF, revisiting of the IMF international lender of last resort role, and speeding up the governance reform process of the IFIs) and in coordinating macroeconomic policy responses to the crisis.  One of the key challenges the G-20 faces going forward is to consolidate as a formal body. That means not only to propose changes to reform of the international financial architecture but also, and most importantly, to systematically monitor its degree of implementation. The next meeting is going to be essential to assess the degree of progress in the implementation of the course of action set forth.  In my view, the creation of the FSB has been the most significant reform in the international financial architecture so far. The FSB will play a key role in the new international financial architecture. It will be responsible for coordinating banking regulation, developing regulatory and supervisory standards, preparing early warning reports and exchanging information with supervisors. Enhanced representation will increase the likelihood of effective implementation of standards and will hike the quality of standards.  For instance, in the case of the regulatory treatment of currency mismatches, we, I mean those countries that suffered significant macroeconomic crisis, have some experience to share. The increased credit risk faced by subsidiaries, when these subsidiaries are significant for the banking group as a whole, imposes significant negative effects for the parent bank and home financial market. Central Banks could strengthen its regulation on credit risk management by requiring banks that before granting a loan, they should assure that no currency mismatches exist in debtors’ balance sheets. This regulation can be imposed by host authorities to subsidiaries in their jurisdictions, and also, by home regulators to the banking group as a whole regarding each of its subsidiaries. This means for example that home regulators ask that the parent bank and each subsidiary inside the group must comply with that requirement. If not, penalties should be imposed, such as increases in capital requirements. The effect of that kind of currency mismatches could be explicitly considered in the Pilar II of the Basel II Agreement. If the effect of currency mismatches are not properly attended by banks, supervisors at the banking group level, should require additional capital to attend the potential effect, at the banking group level, of the worsening of debtors´ income in hosts markets, and therefore, in subsidiaries capital position and then, in 4 BIS Review 73/2009 
parent bank capital positions. Also, the potential effects of currency mismatches should be explicitly addressed in supervisory colleges.  Credit risk transfer is another key aspect of the agenda. Instead of reducing systemic risks, Credit Default Swaps have contributed to raising them. Risk is not always shifted to the parties that are best able to bear it, but to those subject to laxer regulatory constraints. Another topic important to highlight, because of its relevance for emerging markets economies, is the lack of transparency and absence of reliable statistics in the OTC derivatives markets for non-financial corporations. This opacity left policy-makers without information about exposures on OTC transactions done with foreign financial institutions. As we know, the consequences of these exposures in some emerging markets were systemically important and central banks had to provide financial assistance to the market, to avoid major financial distress. We must work towards encouraging the trading of credit derivatives using electronic platforms or regulated exchanges and the clearing of standardized credit derivatives through a central counterparty. This would help to reduce risk, in part by allowing for the multilateral netting of outstanding notional amounts, and, on the other hand, by the requirement of posting collateral. However, if central banks promote its usage they should be prepared to provide it with access to central bank credit facilities, or to provide liquidity by other means in case of need. A macro-prudential approach recommends that regulators and supervisors should consider potential systemic risk and the vulnerabilities of the environment in which financial institutions act. It will be fundamental to understand the interaction that exists between the financial system and the real economy. This approach will demand greater cooperation between local and external regulators, requiring them to develop an integrated picture of the financial system, considering not just banks, but also all financial institutions. The analysis of macroeconomic vulnerabilities that could subsequently impact on financial system liquidity or solvency should also be embedded in the regulatory framework. Deviations should be analyzed in relation to the long-term trends for certain variables, such as credit to GDP ratio, assets prices (residential and commercial property, shares and government securities, and currencies), the exchange rate equilibrium (real/effective) and the international capital flows, among others. To sum up, we can expect that financial markets are going to be different going forward. The former market based financial system should be brought down the umbrella of prudential regulation avoiding regulatory arbitrage. However, this could lead to a time of slower credit expansion given that higher leverage in that sector allowed faster credit expansion which is alleged to underlay faster growth rates. So once again, preventing a credit market bubble calls for tougher surveillance on this kind of financial agents, but at the same time we should be careful not to choke productivity growth. In this financial framework, Central Banks duties should be also rethink particularly regarding the ability to be lender of last resort to non-bank financial institutions. But something that we can be sure of is that a stable global financial market would reduce the “parking” of liquidity leaving the possibility of diverting resources to be more efficiently allocated, helping our countries to keep catching up with the needed development of our societies.

Barbro Wickman-Parak: The financial crisis – where do we stand today and where are we heading? Speech by Ms Barbro Wickman-Parak, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Danske Market's Central Bank Seminar, Snekkersten, Denmark, 11 June 2009. *      *      * When I joined the Executive Board of the Riksbank almost exactly two years ago, in May 2007, I expected my new job to be varied and exciting. Though I perhaps wasn’t expecting it to be exciting in the way it turned out to be. Of course we were then already aware of the problems with subprime loans in the United States. But, like most other people in Sweden and abroad, I didn’t foresee that the worrying signs we saw then would gradually develop into a global financial crisis of historical proportions. Nor did I anticipate that as a result of this crisis the Riksbank would lend several hundred billion kronor to the banks. Or that the Riksbank would cut the repo rate by 4.25 percentage points during the course of just over six months, to its lowest level ever – the fastest monetary policy easing in the period we have had an inflation target. And of course I could not anticipate that several other central banks would by then have reached the lower limit for their policy rates and have begun to resort to unconventional measures. But nevertheless – this is where we stand now. Several explanations for the crisis One usually says that the crisis began in 2007 with problems in the US mortgage market and that this gradually developed into a global financial crisis, which became acute in autumn 2008 in connection with Lehman Brothers filing for bankruptcy. But the picture is more complex than this. The origin and course of the crisis will be analysed thoroughly and we probably will not have a complete history of it until much later. However, we can already note that there are several explanations as to why the crisis arose and why it became so widespread. One circumstance that probably played some role is that growth had long been good in many countries, at the same time as inflation was low – quite simply, things had gone unusually well for an unusually long period of time. And when things have gone well for a long period of time it is probably human nature to relax and become slightly incautious. This is what appears to have happened this time in various ways and places, not solely in the US mortgage market.  One factor that probably also contributed was that there was a global saving surplus that meant there were large capital sums to be invested in the financial markets. This surplus pushed down the interest rate on risk-free assets. The combination of a lot of money to be invested and low risk-free interest rates contributed to an increase in the demand for assets that were profitable to invest in and led to an intensified hunt for high yield. This type of environment often inspires great inventiveness in the financial markets and many new financial instruments were also created. These were often complex and difficult to valuate correctly. But in the optimistic climate prevailing then – everything had gone so well for so long – it was nevertheless easy to sell them. Those who invested in the new instruments disregarded, or failed to sufficiently understand, the risks that were “inbuilt” in them. The financial supervisory authorities and regulations also lagged behind this development.  The problems in the international financial markets began to become more apparent as early as summer 2007. But the Swedish economy and the Swedish financial markets long appeared able to manage fairly well, despite the fact that the turbulence was having more and more effects on the world around us. Of course, economic activity in Sweden began to weaken as international economic activity declined, but this did not initially seem to entail any very serious downturn. However, when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September BIS Review 73/2009 1 
2008 the situation worsened dramatically. The confidence that had existed between financial institutions was shaken to its foundations when no one was certain who might be next in line to default on their payments. Now the Swedish financial markets were also hard hit and some sub-markets were practically at a standstill. The earlier expectations that the decline in economic activity would be fairly mild were replaced by a much more negative view of future developments, both in Sweden and abroad. The Lehman Brothers crisis was also the prelude to a series of measures to stabilise the Swedish financial markets. At the same time the Riksbank took several rapid and resolute steps down the interest ladder to alleviate the effects of the crisis on economic activity. Still sensitive but liquidity risk has declined The first phase of the crisis can be described as a liquidity and confidence crisis. No one trusted anyone else and very few were willing to lend money and take risks. The price of loans between the banks, interbank rates, also rose sharply. Since the crisis started the central banks have lent large amounts to the banks. For example, the Riksbank has offered loans in Swedish kronor at longer maturities than normal to facilitate the supply of liquidity to the Swedish banks. We have also lent US dollars to Swedish banks and we have made the collateral requirements for the loans somewhat more generous. The government has tried to reduce the banks’ liquidity risks through its guarantee programme, which basically involves banks and other credit institutions being able to sign contracts with the government on guarantees for some of their borrowing. Without the measures taken by the Riksbank and other authorities the financial system would have ceased functioning and would still not be functioning. The same applies of course in many other countries. As we note in the Financial Stability Report that we published just over one week ago, these measures have contributed to ensuring that there is no imminent risk of a liquidity shortage for the banks. Interbank rates have fallen, although it still appears difficult to find funding at longer maturities. There are also other signs that the conditions on the international credit markets have eased somewhat and it appears to have become slightly easier to obtain funding by issuing securities, even when these are not backed by a government guarantee.  Now it is unfortunately not the case that the problems are over – we are not yet on solid ground with regard to financial stability. There is still a lack of confidence between financial institutions and the international credit markets are fairly far from functioning as they did before the crisis. The situation is still sensitive and there is still a risk of a surprisingly negative shock giving the crisis new energy and once again making it more difficult for the banks to obtain funding. The Riksbank will of course follow developments very closely. We will continue to supply the banks with liquidity and we are prepared to do so as long as necessary. But to summarise briefly, the situation does look somewhat brighter with regard to liquidity risk.  Greater focus on credit risks Now that liquidity risks are less prominent, there is instead a greater focus on credit risks, as economic activity has weakened and growth prospects have deteriorated. The very large policy rate cuts made by central banks around the world and the fiscal policy stimulation from governments have not been able to prevent a severe weakening in economic activity. Our most recent forecast published in April points to GDP in the world falling by a good 1 per cent in 2009. This is a something quite unique: since 1970 GDP in the world has increased by on average 3.6 per cent a year and growth has not been negative even for a single year. The export-dependent Swedish economy is hard hit by the international downturn. In our April Monetary Policy Update we forecast a fall in GDP of more than 4 per cent in 2009.  When economic activity weakens and the demand for goods and services declines it becomes more difficult for the banks’ borrowers to meet their payments. Bankruptcies 2 BIS Review 73/2009 
increase and the banks suffer loan losses. The loan losses in their turn make the banks even less willing to lend money and the economy risks ending up in a spiral where falling activity and stricter credit terms reinforce one another.  The banks can cope with loan losses The main scenario in the Riksbank’s forecasts does not involve Sweden ending up in a serious downward spiral. But in the recently published Financial Stability Report we are nevertheless assuming, even in the main scenario, that the Swedish banks will face fairly substantial loan losses in 2009 and 2010. A large share of the losses, approximately 40 per cent, is expected to arise from operations in the Baltic countries and the rest of eastern Europe. But in the Report we also note that all of the major Swedish banks have sufficient capital to cope with the losses that will arise if the Riksbank's forecasts are correct. We also observe that the Swedish banks are well-capitalised in an international perspective. One cannot disregard the fact that there is great uncertainty over future developments in economic activity. When one has the task of safeguarding financial stability, it is natural preparing for situations where things go very badly. And when assessing the resilience of the financial system it is also of greater interest to study a more negative development than the one forecast. We have therefore investigated in our Financial Stability Report how the banks would cope with a scenario of a much weaker development than that considered most likely today. There we assume, for instance, that GDP in Sweden will fall twice as much as predicted in our main scenario forecasts for 2009 and 2010 in the Monetary Policy Update published in April. It is assumed in the really negative scenario of the Financial Stability Report that developments in the Baltic countries and the rest of eastern Europe will be much weaker, although that is far from the only reason behind the poor development. Here, too, approximately 40 per cent of the loan losses are expected to come from operations in these regions.  In this scenario all of the banks meet the statutory requirement of Tier 1 capital adequacy of at least four per cent. However, it may be necessary to have higher capital adequacy to avoid negative consequences such as funding problems and downgraded credit ratings. In the unlikely event that this very negative scenario were to occur, several banks might therefore be forced to act to strengthen their capital bases. If this could not be achieved solely through private capital injections, there is a possibility for the government to inject capital by virtue of the Government Support to Credit Institutions Act of last autumn. The Riksbank’s assessment is that we, together with other Swedish authorities, are also well prepared to be able to manage the problems that could arise if the situation were to deteriorate to the level of the stress test described in the Financial Stability Report.  Let me just clarify that the Financial Stability Report’s test of the financial system’s resilience cannot be compared with the alternative scenarios of a “more probable” nature that are usually presented in the Monetary Policy Reports. The latter normally describe the consequences for monetary policy of developments being better or worse than the situation described in the main scenario, but where the alternatives are not normally too far from the main forecasts. In the Financial Stability the scenario is rather more exaggerated. So where do we stand now and where are we heading? Let me briefly summarise where we stand now in terms of risk focus; the liquidity problems have been dampened, while credit risks and feared loan losses are increasingly in the limelight as economic prospects have deteriorated. Credit risks and the size of loan losses are of course closely interlinked with economic activity. So I shall now, not least for this reason, move on to talk about economic activity – the assessments made by the Riksbank at the most recent monetary policy meeting in April and the nuances in the views of future economic developments that I put forward at the meeting. BIS Review 73/2009 3 
Things could be better or worse It is natural in times like these to paint a gloomy picture and focus on downside risks. And I am probably the last person to deny that such risks exist. It is also natural that the focus of the monetary policy discussion should be on what a central bank can do when the policy rate approaches zero and further stimulation may be necessary as this is to some extent “uncharted territory” for us.  But let me now change perspective and adopt a slightly more positive tone. In the discussions at the two most recent monetary policy meetings I have pointed out that there is some possibility that the recovery both in Sweden and abroad could come more quickly than most people are assuming. One could perhaps say that I have acted as the devil’s advocate, if one can use this expression for arguing that there is some chance that things will be better than is generally believed.  A more general reason as to why an upturn might come more quickly than expected, once it starts, is that the crisis can to a large extent be described as a massive confidence crisis that has made a lasting impression on the real economy. Households hesitate over consumption and companies hesitate over investment. But confidence is in many ways an on-off variable – either you have it or you don’t. All countries have been affected more or less at the same time and world trade has declined dramatically. Once confidence and faith in the future return, it may well be the case that the upturn is rapid and forceful as more and more countries come on board. My views at the April monetary policy meeting did not primarily concern 2009. I think everyone is agreed that this year will unfortunately be a really poor growth year. In Sweden, as in many other countries, growth plummeted in the fourth quarter of last year. Recently published preliminary GDP figures for the first quarter also show that growth continued to fall, although the rate of the fall slowed down. My main emphasis was on what lies ahead of us – the economic cycle further on this year and into 2010. I shall not repeat everything I said at our two most recent monetary policy meetings; anyone who is interested can read the minutes of the meetings. But I would like to take the opportunity to bring up some of the views I expressed then. One view that I wished to highlight concerned the housing market in the United States, which is in many ways the origin of the problems. Some signs of stabilisation are now visible there, although some quarters of adjustment still remain before the stocks of unsold houses have been reduced and house prices stop falling. Falling housing investment has provided large negative contributions to growth in recent years. Very little housing has been built for several years now in relation to the increase in the number of households. When the turnaround comes, housing investment should provide a good contribution to growth.  I also mentioned that stocks in the United States have been phased out rapidly and they will sooner or later be down to levels where the demand flow, even if it is declining, will need to be met with increased production. However, here one must bear in mind that this “cyclical” upturn will be temporary if final demand does not catch on further ahead. I could also see signs of stabilisation in important forward-looking indicators, particularly orders in the purchasing managers’ index. However, the picture is not clear-cut and never is when economic activity is in the balance. But, as I mentioned at the meeting, if the signs of stabilisation become clearer they may affect the mood more permanently, not least on the stock market. This can in its turn have a positive effect on households’ undermined wealth and help increase consumption. Further ahead it may be possible to reinforce a positive cycle and for investment to pick up. I also mentioned that a large part of the economic policy stimulation, particularly investments in the US infrastructure, would have its greatest effect in 2010. Having said this, I would like to point out, as I did in the discussion at our most recent monetary policy meeting, that it might very well be the case that the signs of stabilisation I mentioned then were delusive. And it is definitely not the case that I fail to see the 4 BIS Review 73/2009 
seriousness of the economic downturn we are in. Nevertheless, the recovery could as I have said be quicker or slower than expected.  Inflation outlook may change quickly Falling resource utilisation and inflationary pressures have meant that we could conduct a strong, expansionary monetary policy to alleviate the effects of the economic downturn and at the same time ensure that inflation does not undershoot the target very far. We will see a negative inflation rate this year if we measure inflation by the consumer price index, the CPI. But this is largely due to our own interest rate cuts. The low inflation rate is temporary and should not trigger expectations of future deflation. Inflation expectations according to, for instance, Prospera’s survey, are anchored in a slightly longer perspective around the target of 2 per cent. My view at the April meeting was that we should begin to see signs next summer or autumn that the extremely low interest rate needs to be raised. I said then that it was not merely a question of an upturn possibly being on the way; I also pointed out that monetary policy is forward-looking and its effects come after a time lag. It is therefore more guided by developments in 2012 and 2013 the closer we come to this period. I also emphasised that although inflationary pressures were not a problem at that point, or in the near future, the situation could look very different in a year or two. For example, commodity prices could have begun to rise more than we had predicted, or the expansionary monetary policy and fiscal policy conducted in large countries could have pushed up international inflation with a risk of increased imported inflation. I also mentioned that we could not be certain that the krona would strengthen in the way we had assumed, or that productivity would recover as we had predicted. We know from experience that the inflation outlook can change rapidly. During the late spring and summer of last year we were concerned over inflation being too high, even though this was mainly due to rising oil and food prices. Rising unit labour costs were also taken into consideration. Fears that high inflation expectations would become entrenched also formed part of the picture. We then raised the interest rate despite beginning to see signs of weaker economic activity in the future. The assessment was that this was necessary to attain the inflation target a couple of years ahead. When developments turned out differently, we had to quickly change our course. We are of course always prepared for situations like that. We are ready to act as quickly and as forcefully as is necessary, both to attain the inflation target and to carry out our financial stability responsibilities.  Unconventional measures There have been many discussions on what the Riksbank could be expected to do if developments turn out weaker than we are now assuming. And our toolbox is not empty because the repo rate is so close to its lower limit.  Put simply, the way the repo rate tool works is that the banks either borrow or buy Riksbank Certificates with a maturity of one week from the Riksbank at the price of the repo rate. In addition, there are what is known as daily fine-tuning operations between the Riksbank and the banks at an interest rate very close to the repo rate. The current level of the repo rate and expectations of what it will be in the future in turn affect other interest rates with longer maturities and, of course, activity in the economy. As I mentioned earlier, the Riksbank has implemented a number of measures that work through the banks in order to improve the functioning of the financial markets. This includes loans at maturities of 3 and 6 months to Swedish banks, against collateral and at a variable interest rate. These measures were recently supplemented with the possibility to borrow at a 12-month horizon. The primary aim of the lending has been to manage financial stability. But the measures also have monetary BIS Review 73/2009 5 
policy side-effects in that the Riksbank is active further out on the yield curve than normal. The liquidity premiums decline, which in turn should lead to lower interest rates.  If a central bank wants to affect interest rates more directly at slightly longer maturities there are various measures at its disposal. Central banks such as the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are for example buying government bonds with long maturities to influence long-term interest rates in the economy, thereby trying to attain monetary policy easing. However, the effects of such a strategy are uncertain. As yet our experience of that kind of action is rather limited. Moreover, government bond rates are affected by many other factors than the central banks' possible purchases of these securities. The Riksbank has not taken any such measures. The Executive Board decided at its meeting in April that the time was not yet ripe for this. But nor could we exclude the possibility that this might be possible further ahead, if the economic situation were to deteriorate more than we were assuming.  During our discussion of this type of unconventional measure at our most recent monetary policy meeting I pointed out that the Riksbank is already implementing extensive measures through its lending to the banks. These measures will continue as long as is necessary. I also considered that it was not necessarily the case that we would need to take the same measures as, for instance, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. There are several different reasons for this. The companies in these countries are more dependent on market funding, while in Sweden the banks are the most important source of funding. I also said that we had not yet seen the full effect of the radical interest rate cuts we had made, which contributes to an even greater uncertainty in the question of whether further stimulation through unconventional measures is needed.  When we meet in July we will present our forecasts for the economy and the repo rate over the coming three years and discuss once again whether there is a need to carry out other measures than those we have already carried out. We must always maintain the best possible level of preparedness to deal with various situations that might arise. But this is not the same thing as needing to put those plans into action.  Concluding thoughts I would like to carefully emphasise that what I have taken up regarding economic activity and monetary policy should not be interpreted to mean that in a sudden outburst of uncontrolled optimism I have a much brighter view of the coming period than most others. And my message today does not contain anything new in relation to what I said at the most recent monetary policy meeting. I can assure you that I am aware of the seriousness of the ongoing downturn. And it is not a question of my being hawkishly “trigger-happy” and wanting to raise the interest rate again as soon as we see the slightest sign of a recovery. I believe, like my colleagues, that we need to maintain a low interest rate for a relatively long period of time. What I want to say is rather this: I believe it is easy to become a hostage to the situation when all of the figures are falling and to put a large emphasis – possibly too large – on the downside risks. And, of course, one cannot rule out the possibility that the crisis and the economic downturn will be more protracted and more profound than we are now assuming. But there is also a risk that one may thus give too little weight to the possibility that things could actually go better than we believe and thus we may receive a surprise from a different direction.  I have worked with forecasting for many years, and there are two things in particular that I have noted, and for which I also believe there is scientific evidence: that it is difficult to predict turning points in the economy, and, once they have happened, it is easy to underestimate the strength of the development that follows. This applies to both downturns and upturns. There is perhaps no reason today to assume that a rapid recovery will be the 6 BIS Review 73/2009 
most likely alternative. But it is definitely something that it is worth being prepared for in the slightly longer perspective.  A central bank must have good long-term planning. Even if we are busy trying to alleviate the effects of a collapse in economic activity we must ensure that we bear in mind the medium-term perspective. This may seem self-evident, but I believe it may be important to point it out. Not merely emphasising the short-term perspective is important for maintaining confidence in the inflation target in the long term. There must be a preparedness to act in a situation which could differ from the expected by being both better and worse. We currently have an extremely low interest rate and we are in a crisis that to some extent stems from having had a low interest rate for a long time. We must be aware of the imbalances that may build up and neither be “deflation nutters” nor “inflation nutters”. BIS Review 73/2009 7 
Mario Draghi: Financial stability in the global environment? Learning the lessons from the market crisis  Keynote speech by Mr Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at IOSCO’s Annual Conference, Tel Aviv, 10 June 2009. *      *      * I am pleased to be here today to discuss the emerging financial regulatory landscape that we are building in response to the market crisis. The last few months have been very busy ones in the international regulatory policy field. I will speak to the main thrusts of the reform agenda and the work underway and ahead of us to implement its directions. But before I do so I would like to say a few words about changes to the role that the Financial Stability Board (FSB) will play in future.  Over the last year, a broad consensus emerged towards placing the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) on stronger institutional ground, with a view to strengthening its effectiveness as a mechanism for national authorities, standard setting bodies and international financial institutions to address vulnerabilities and to develop and implement strong regulatory, supervisory and other policies in the interest of financial stability. A stronger institutional set-up will make the FSB more effective in shaping the global response to the present crises and to retaining globally integrated financial markets.  To mark these changed objectives, the London Summit re-launched the FSF as the FSB, with an expanded membership and a broadened mandate to promote financial stability.  The FSB expanded membership now includes, in addition to the FSF members, the rest of the G20, Spain and the European Commission.  These changes will enhance our ability to contribute to ongoing efforts to strengthen the international financial system. New members will add broader perspectives to our deliberations, and increase buy-in and implementation of our output. All members commit to pursue the maintenance of financial stability, maintain the openness and transparency of the financial sector, and implement international financial standards. To this end, members commit to undergo periodic peer reviews – based, among other evidence, on the Financial Sector Assessment Program of the IMF and World Bank.  In terms of mandate, alongside the FSF old remit – which was to assess vulnerabilities affecting the financial system, identify and oversee action needed to address these vulnerabilities, and promote coordination and information exchange among authorities responsible for financial stability – the FSB will now also:  • monitor and advise on market developments and their implications for regulatory policy, and on best practice in meeting regulatory standards;  • we will set guidelines for and support the establishment of supervisory colleges and manage contingency planning for cross-border crisis management, particularly with respect to systemically important firms;  • the FSB will strengthen its collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including by conducting Early Warning Exercises;  • and importantly, we will undertake joint strategic reviews of the policy development work of the international standard setting bodies to ensure their work is timely, coordinated, focused on priorities and addressing gaps. Here there is a strong consensus that the independence of standard setting is essential and must be preserved. Indeed, the value of international standard setting is indispensably linked with their independence. At the same, independent standard setting needs to be complemented with processes for coordination, accountability and governance for BIS Review 72/2009 1 
standard setters, including regular consultations with stakeholders. As we have seen in the FSB in the last 18 months or so, coordination across standard setting bodies has been essential in crafting a coherent response to this crisis and to creating a more resilient financial sector going forward. The work of IOSCO has been and continues to be of great importance in this regard.  To support its functions, the FSB will establish an institutional structure commensurate with its expanded tasks. This will comprise a Steering Committee to take forward to the work of the FSB in between plenary meetings, as well as Standing Committees on Vulnerabilities Assessment, Regulatory and Supervisory Cooperation, and on Standards Implementation. And we will greatly expand its secretariat resources.  ** ** **  Moving on to the regulatory reform agenda, the main value of the intense recent period of international policy making has been the broad consensus it has established on the agenda of change needed to build a stronger, less crisis-prone financial system for the future. Let me emphasize the importance of this: without this consensus, the integrated system that has been of such benefits to all of us would be at high risk of fracture. We now need consistent implementation going forward to preserve a level playing field across national financial sectors.  To summarise very broadly the thrusts of the agenda, let me begin with a key lesson: the need in future to take a system-wide approach to the assessment of financial system and economic conditions, as well to the system’s regulation, rather than focus alone on the health of individual institutions, markets and products. While individual economies and financial institutions appeared sound to market participants and to us as authorities, we failed to recognise the extent to which savings-investment imbalances, the growth of complex securitised credit intermediation, changing patterns of maturity transformation, rising embedded leverage, a burgeoning shadow banking sector, and rapid credit-fuelled growth, had created large systemic vulnerabilities. In the future, we need – at national and global level – to be in a much better position to understand and address trends in credit growth, in system-wide leverage and maturity transformation, and in the inter-linkages within the financial system, to identify and constrain emerging risks. For this we require additional system-wide prudential as well as other tools.  Creating the prudential tools, regulatory set-ups and policy tools required to better constrain system-wide risks, including generating the transparency needed for authorities and markets to be better informed about the risks to the system, is the focus of much of the reform agenda. These changes do of course need to be implemented at national levels. But there is work internationally to generate the tools and policies needed, to promote coherence in implementation and to conduct the monitoring that is required. Let me speak to some of these.  One central lesson of this crisis is that the system entered it with too little capital, far too small liquidity buffers, and a capital and valuation regime with significant pro-cyclical consequences. Much work is underway on bank capital and liquidity that will address these issues. The Basel Committee proposed last year changes that by end 2010 will expand Basel II risk capture and very significantly increase trading book capital requirements. And the Committee’s much strengthened liquidity guidelines are in the process of being implemented nationally. Further work is underway to strengthen guidance for and monitoring of liquidity management at large cross-border banks.  The FSF and its member bodies also produced a set of recommendations to mitigate pro-cyclicality. These call for (i) regulatory capital requirements to increase the quality and level of capital in the financial system during strong economic conditions so that they can be drawn down during periods of economic and financial stress; (ii) a revision of the market risk framework of Basel II to reduce the reliance on cyclical Value-at-Risk based capital 2 BIS Review 72/2009 
estimates; and (iii) to supplement risk-based capital requirements with a leverage ratio to contain the build up of leverage in the banking system.  Regarding provisioning, we – and now G20 Leaders – called on the IASB and FASB to reconsider the incurred loss model by analyzing alternative approaches for recognizing and measuring loan losses that incorporate a broader range of available credit information, including by analysing fair value, expected loss and dynamic provisioning approaches.  Policy development in these areas is underway by the IASB and FASB, as well as by the Basel Committee and detailed proposals will be set out by year-end.  On accounting more generally, the G20 asked the FSB to monitor progress by accounting standards setters in implementing the G20’s accounting-related recommendations, including efforts to enhance convergence, and improve involvement of prudential regulators and other stakeholders in the IASB’s standards setting process. We welcome the efforts by the IASB to accelerate its work schedule to reduce complexity in accounting for financial instruments, and reduce inconsistencies in standards, a goal that is very close to the FSB’s global mission. Some authorities have raised concerns about the IASB and its approach to certain issues. The FSB has a strong interest in seeing the IASB come through this period in a manner that supports its role as a high-quality independent accounting standard setter that considers constructive input from key stakeholders. As you know, the Financial Stability Forum (FSF; now the FSB), of which the IASB, IOSCO and others are key members, has had a proven record of supporting IFRS as one of the 12 key international standards that promote financial stability, and in providing constructive recommendations that enhance transparency and related IASB standards. Good recent examples of this are the FSF's report on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience published in April 2008 as requested by the G7 and the FSF’s procyclicality report in April 2009 which included recommendations developed by a working group co-chaired by Kathy Casey. We have had a positive role in supporting high-quality IFRS and the FSB plans to continue to do so.  A second important area in implementing a system-wide approach is to ensure that all systemically relevant institutions, markets and activities are subject to appropriate oversight, transparency requirements and, where needed, resolution mechanisms. In practice, this means that the scope of regulation will be broadened, and that prudential tools and standards, as well as the intensity of oversight, will be recalibrated to better reflect the systemic foot-print of institutions and activities. How to deal with too-big-to-fail institutions and related moral hazard concerns will be an important focus ahead. And we need to establish market infrastructure, including adequate resolution frameworks, to address the problems of interconnectedness and opaqueness in the financial system.  A lot of work is underway in these areas:  • The BIS and the IMF are setting out methodologies for quantifying systemic risk, identifying systemically relevant institutions and activities, and developing system wide tools for monitoring leverage.  • And the Joint Forum is advancing a project on gaps in the scope of regulation, and approaches to addressing them. This covers gaps both in the regulated sector (i.e. gaps such AIG’s holding company), and unregulated markets, products, and entities, where IOSCO has recently set out consultative proposals.  • In the area of OTC derivatives, work thus far has focused on establishing central counterparty clearing for the CDS market, but central clearing should be extended to standardized OTC derivatives more generally.  • On hedge funds, the US, the EU and other relevant jurisdictions are in the process of articulating registration, regulation and oversight arrangements for hedge fund managers. The FSB, relying on IOSCO, have been tasked with fostering coherent approaches in this area.  BIS Review 72/2009 3 
• The FSF also recently published Principles for Cross-border Cooperation on Crisis Management, to strengthen arrangements for dealing with financial stress at cross-border institutions, and better prepare authorities to manage crisis situations. Another group under the Basel Committee is looking into legal differences across countries and how they can hinder orderly resolution of financial firms.  I would like to highlight here the very important work of securities market regulators, working through IOSCO, to restore transparency, market quality and integrity in the securitisation process. The checks and balance within the market failed to address significant moral hazard problems within this chain. For securitization to recover and to play a role consistent with financial stability objectives, these problems need to be addressed. There is balance to be drawn here as to how far regulation should go and how far we can trust market discipline to reassert itself. But one issue we must not lose sight of is that much securitisation product, whether complex or not, whether with their knowledge or not, ultimately ends up in retail investor portfolios. IOSCO is formulating recommendations to address these incentives problems, through conduct and disclosure requirements, retention by issuers of economic exposure to transactions, strengthened due diligence requirements on asset managers, strengthened investor suitability requirements, and not least, reduction of conflicts of interest at credit rating agencies. We look forward to receiving your conclusions at our forthcoming FSB meeting.  The above complements other important efforts to strengthen risk management practices and governance at banks and other financial institutions. The lessons of failures in these areas have been set out in reports and guidance by the Senior Supervisors Group (SSG), the Basel Committee, by the IIF and the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group.  One area that politicians, the broad public and supervisory authorities will pay significant attention to is changes to compensation practices at financial institutions. The Principles we have developed cover Effective Governance of Compensation Systems, Effective Alignment of Compensation with prudent risk taking, and Effective Supervisory Oversight and disclosure to and engagement by shareholders. They will be reinforced through supervisory examination and intervention at the national level, as well as by disclosure requirements (on which IOSCO is working). We expect national authorities and firms to implement material parts of the Principles by end of 2009.  There is a clear need for supervisors, regulators and other authorities to raise their own game, nationally and internationally. At both levels, authorities need to become more responsive to and more nimble and effective in mitigating emerging risks. Information exchange and co-operation across authorities both nationally and internationally needs to improve. Most countries are reviewing their national arrangements for collaboration amongst relevant national authorities. And at the international level, supervisory colleges have now been established for most global banks.  The priority ahead is implementation. This is largely in national hands, but we need coherent approaches across countries and regions. Indeed, the G20 leaders have placed a renewed emphasis on this. The FSB, the standard setting bodies and the IMF/WB have been tasked with assessing implementation to serve three complementary aims: first, to foster greater adherence to international standards; second, to help identify jurisdictions that lag behind in terms of their implementation of selected standards; and third, to support peer review processes, such as those FSB members have committed to as an obligation of membership.  ** ** **  I’d like to conclude with a number of principles that guide our actions as we pursue our reform agenda:  • First, the guiding principles behind our work is to recreate a financial system that operates with less leverage, is more immune to the set of misaligned incentives at the root of this crisis, where transparency allows better identification and 4 BIS Review 72/2009 
management of risks, where prudential and regulatory oversight is strengthened, and the system is able to let mismanaged institutions fail.  • Second, clarity. We are committed to establishing clear expectations about what the future regulatory environment will look like. Establishing stable expectations regarding the future regulatory environment will allow market participants to make forward strategic decisions with a greater degree of confidence.  • Third, while the direction is clear, changes will in cases be gradual. Some elements of the reformed system (such as higher capital) will need to be phased in as conditions improve.  • Fourth, we must preserve the advantages of open and integrated global financial markets. Given global markets and institutions but national regulatory rules and practices, we must strive for international consistency in standards of regulation to support a level playing field across jurisdictions. At the same time, if open global markets are to be preserved, these standards need to be strengthened to give adequate protections to “innocent bystanders” affected by the indiscriminate risk taking and retrenchment we have observed.  • Last, as we develop and apply more assertive regulation and supervision to contain excessive leverage and address market failures, we must resist imposing excessive, stifling levels of regulation. Regulation must not prevent innovation, which is necessary if we are to improve product choices for consumers and an expanded access to credit. But we need to ensure that innovation does not compromise other clearly stated goals, including systemic stability and consumer protection. The challenge for regulators and market participants alike is, as always, to strike the right balance.  BIS Review 72/2009 5 
Elizabeth A Duke: The systemic importance of consumer protection Speech by Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the 2009 Community Development Policy Summit, Cleveland, Ohio, 10 June 2009. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * I want to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland for sponsoring this, its seventh annual Policy Summit, and for inviting me to speak. The agenda for today's meeting is certainly an ambitious one. You will be tackling questions about how housing policy might be restructured to stabilize neighborhoods and create a more sustainable approach to homeownership. You will also be discussing how the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) might be revised to ensure its continued role as a catalyst for private investment in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. These are certainly important issues to consider as we try to find solutions to a set of very complex problems brought about by the turmoil in the mortgage and housing markets. I don't have to tell anyone in Cleveland, where foreclosures have harmed whole neighborhoods, about the devastating impact the foreclosure crisis has had on individuals, neighborhoods, and the broader economy – an impact so deep that we would be remiss not to reconsider current policies to ensure a lasting recovery and sustainable homeownership.  As I look at your agenda, I am struck by the fact that the problems we've seen with foreclosures and neighborhood destabilization stem from the over-provision of poorly designed credit, whereas, in contrast, CRA had its birth when credit was generally unavailable to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. So as I talk today about the Federal Reserve and our role in consumer protection, I'd like to emphasize the importance of both the availability of credit and the ability of consumers to use such credit safely to increase their own well-being in transactions that contribute to economic growth. If we have learned nothing else in this crisis, we have learned that consumer protection is not just good for consumers; it is also necessary to restore investor confidence and promote a strong and stable economy. How we got here  Given economic events over the past 18 months, few would question the importance of the link between the performance of consumer-based financial products and the health of the broader economy. Even so, it is important to examine this link in order to learn how we can do a better job of both protecting consumers and protecting the stability of the macroeconomy in the future.  The current economic situation developed over a period of years as the confluence of several market developments created an environment of inexpensive and readily available credit. Advances in information technology and financial innovations over recent decades encouraged new lending products and the extension of credit to a wider spectrum of borrowers, including many who would have previously had difficulty qualifying for credit. Such developments as credit scoring lowered transaction costs and helped to evaluate risk more effectively and consistently. Similarly, advances in financial engineering encouraged and broadened opportunities to draw on capital from around the world through the securitization of debt. This inflow of capital provided creditors with new sources of funds for the expansion of credit. The securitization process was made more versatile – but also more complicated – by the introduction of structured products, such as collateralized debt obligations, which were intended to match investors to various credit and prepayment risks. BIS Review 72/2009 1 
As the credit markets evolved, financial products also changed. Consumers were increasingly offered more complex, but often less transparent, products. Where once the vast majority of mortgages were 30-year, fixed-rate products, by the height of the housing boom in 2007, adjustable-rate products proliferated – such products as the 2/28 (a loan with a low introductory rate for the first two years) or the option ARM (a loan on which the consumer could choose to pay a full payment, an interest-only payment, or even a payment that did not fully cover even the interest, with the difference being added to the loan's principal balance). For large numbers of borrowers, piggy-back second mortgages substituted for down payments. These products relied primarily on rising property values and borrowers' ability to refinance for repayment. The high levels of risk posed by these products became apparent only when home prices began to fall and the rate of foreclosure increased dramatically. Just as mortgage products were becoming more complex, credit card terms, rates, and fees also were becoming significantly more complicated and difficult for consumers to fully understand. New practices evolved, such as charging different interest rates for different transactions and double-cycle billing, whereby lenders calculated interest based not only on the current balance, but also on the prior month's balance. While such practices increased revenues for lenders, it is less clear how they benefited cardholders. Also, payment-allocation rules tended to treat consumers unfavorably and made it difficult for them to benefit fully from promotions such as balance-transfer programs. Even as credit products were growing in variety and complexity, consumer debt was expanding dramatically over recent years. In particular, mortgage debt rose from $3.5 trillion in 1995 to $11.1 trillion in 2007,1 while revolving credit grew from $443 billion to $939 billion over the same period and nonrevolving credit (mostly automobile and student loans) grew from $697 billion to $1.6 trillion.2  In hindsight, it is not hard to see how these various factors combined to create a perilous situation for consumers, investors, and the broader economy. Bad decisions resulting from poorly underwritten mortgage products with complex features or, worse, features purposefully hidden from consumers were made on such a scale that the spillover effects from the resulting defaults and foreclosures were far broader than in prior downturns. Previously, the negative impact of foreclosures had tended to be limited to local areas experiencing significant job losses or to recessionary pressures resulting from fluctuations in the business cycle. But the accelerating growth rate in the subprime lending market and the fact that so many of these risky loans were bundled into securities set the stage, so that when individual borrowers failed to keep up with payments, the result was devastating to the entire market. Investors belatedly recognized the serious problems of poor underwriting and inappropriate loan structuring – practices that may have been facilitated by the securitization processes. Problems also spilled over to securities backed by credit card receivables, auto loans, and other asset classes. As a result, investors stopped purchasing most asset-backed securities and much of the secondary market stopped functioning. The loss of investor confidence has had enormous ripple effects in the economy as the tightening of credit has squeezed housing and automotive sales and threatened the viability of businesses reliant on credit lines to cover inventory and other expenses. In addition to the loss of investor confidence, consumer confidence was also shaken. The collapse of the housing market exposed practices that were not consumer-friendly. Some lenders, brokers, appraisers, and investment banks were clearly motivated by transaction fees and had little incentive to ensure that borrowers would be able to sustain                                                  1  "Federal Reserve Statistical Release, Z.1, Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States". 2  www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/hist. 2 BIS Review 72/2009 
homeownership. Banks, under stress from losses in their mortgage portfolios, pulled back on private-label mortgage lending and increased the prices associated with other types of lending. The effect of these practices, combined with the impact of job losses and other ramifications of a shrinking economy, have had a significant impact on consumer confidence. Consumer spending has fallen off as a result, further exacerbating the negative cycle. A banker's perspective In thinking about what it will take to achieve economic recovery, I often draw on my experience as a community banker. In the days when I was lending money, we kept those loans on our balance sheet. In that context success was directly related to the ability of customers to repay loans. Indeed, it was related to their ability to repay and borrow again over a career and over a lifetime. This was accomplished through effective underwriting and risk analysis and through proper loan structuring. When the incentives in the credit process are properly aligned, the benefits flow to both the borrower and the lender: the borrower is assured terms and conditions such that he or she can reasonably be expected to repay the loan, and the lender is paid interest on the money lent. While I don't necessarily believe we need to return to a time when all loans are held on balance sheet, I do believe we need a system of balanced incentives for the longer-term prosperity of all. Credit transactions conducted to the benefit of both borrower and lender expand economic growth. This is as true on the community level as it is at the macroeconomic level. Access to capital to create and expand small businesses leads to job growth and benefits the larger community. Likewise, mortgage lending, responsibly done, gives a community a solid base of residents with a stake in its future. The problems that we face today result, in large part, from a misalignment of incentives. Securitization, while providing liquidity, also weakened the incentives to properly underwrite loans, in many cases by passing default risk from originators to investors. Compensation structures were also problematic. Some originators were compensated on the basis of particular loan features or loan volumes rather than on loan quality. Meanwhile, loans with features that may have been appropriate for a small subset of potential borrowers – such as interest-only mortgage loans or loans requiring little or no documentation of income – were offered to a wider group of consumers. Studies have shown that if borrower income is held constant, loan features do matter to the successful repayment of a loan. So I hope we have learned that misaligned incentives that result in harm to consumers have implications for the economy overall. If we recognize this, then we must also recognize that consumer protections cannot be viewed as an ancillary component of a scheme to regulate for safety and soundness. Rather, they are fundamental to the quality of the credit upon which the economy is built. Having said that, policymakers must also consider the desirability of a dynamic economy, one in which useful innovations are encouraged and credit is made available to as many consumers as have the ability to benefit from it. The tension between protecting consumers and making credit broadly available is one that is as important in making an individual loan as it is to ensuring the stability of the economy. The key to successful policy formulation is to resist the temptation to regulate the problem of the moment. For example, if, in reaction to the abuses in consumer and mortgage lending over the past few years, we were to focus solely on consumer protection policies, the result could be overly restrictive access to credit, which could threaten future economic growth. On the other hand, if the policy focus is strictly on stabilizing the banking sector without giving due consideration to consumer protection, both consumer and investor confidence will remain weak and we will risk repeating the mistakes of the past. Trust in the financial system can be regained only if sufficient consumer protections are in place to give borrowers reason to believe they will be treated fairly. BIS Review 72/2009 3 
The role of the Federal Reserve The Federal Reserve addresses its consumer protection responsibilities in a variety of ways, using its regulatory and supervisory authority as well as its consumer education, research, and outreach capabilities. We take a multifaceted approach to consumer protection, for a couple of reasons. First, our organization is in the unique position of being a central bank as well as a regulator and supervisor for the banking industry. Moreover, our experience in this arena has taught us that there is no one solution sufficient to address the information needs and substantive protection of consumers in credit transactions. By offering a broad spectrum of products, services, and activities, we aim to provide consumers with the information necessary to make good financial decisions. For example, based on our belief that clear and well-organized disclosures can help consumers make good choices among financial products, the Federal Reserve has used its regulatory authority to develop extensive new disclosures for a variety of financial products, including credit cards. We are currently in the midst of a major overhaul of mortgage disclosures. To ensure that new disclosures are useful to consumers, the Federal Reserve has used consumer testing to explore how consumers process information and understand important features of financial products. This has been quite an informative exercise. We have used what we learned from consumer testing to improve the disclosures we require. For example, we recently revised the credit card disclosures required to be provided to consumers at account opening. The new rules require that certain key terms be included in a conspicuous table because our field testing indicated that consumers were unlikely to read dense language but were comfortable with interpreting information in a table format.  Our consumer testing efforts have also taught us that even the best disclosures cannot offer the protection consumers need in all cases. Some aspects of increasingly complex products simply cannot be fully understood or evaluated by consumers, no matter how well educated the consumer or how clear the disclosure. In those cases, we have chosen to prohibit certain practices. For example, the Federal Reserve recently banned the practice of double-cycle billing when calculating interest rates on credit cards because we found in testing that there was no reasonable way to explain the practice. We have also banned practices related to mortgage lending that have potentially unfair and deceptive features. We found that the failure to require escrow accounts for homeowners' insurance and property taxes often caused borrowers to underestimate the cost of homeownership, so we made such escrows mandatory for high-cost loans. Similarly, we have also placed restrictions on the use of prepayment penalties. The Federal Reserve has also become more proactive in its efforts to make consumers aware of its role in consumer education and outreach. While we have a long history of providing unbiased, research-based information to consumers on a variety of financial products, we have stepped up our efforts to get information to consumers quickly. And we have recently made use of some unconventional venues – unconventional at least for a central bank. For example, to make consumers aware of foreclosure-rescue scams, the Board recently ran a 30-second public service announcement (PSA) in movie theatres in 18 markets across 10 states having high foreclosure rates. Additionally, the coverage that the PSA campaign received on television, radio, and in newspapers carried the message about the existence of mortgage-rescue scams to a far broader audience. As a complement to the PSA campaign, the Board developed a 5 Tips flyer regarding foreclosure-rescue scams that provides essential information in an easily digestible format. Material developed by the Board is now being leveraged by others. Several Reserve Banks, for instance, are working to add the Board's PSA to additional theatres in their markets. And one Reserve Bank has decided to replicate the effort with a PSA tailored to its particular market. In addition, the PSA and 5 Tips have been picked up by other public and nonprofit 4 BIS Review 72/2009 
organizations, including the National Association of Realtors, and mortgage servicers such as GMAC. The success of this campaign has highlighted the demand for timely information that consumers can use. Through this effort, we have learned a great deal about the importance of the Federal Reserve as an unbiased source of consumer information. We intend to build on this knowledge going forward – focusing on the content provided, leveraging the same message through multiple distribution channels, and creating awareness of the information's availability. Finally, as a research institution we engage in efforts to measure the effectiveness of financial education, in order to understand what approaches work best. For example, Board staff, working with the Department of Defense and others, conducted a longitudinal study involving soldiers at Fort Bliss to determine whether receiving a two-day financial education course as part of their advanced individualized training improved the soldiers' financial behaviors compared to those who did not receive training. We found that soldiers who took the course were more likely to engage in positive financial behaviors (such as saving regularly, participating in retirement programs, and paying off credit card bills monthly) and less likely to engage in negative behaviors (such as paying overdraft fees and paying bills late). The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is currently engaged in a longitudinal study to measure the effectiveness of homeownership counseling. Throughout the Federal Reserve System we continue to study and apply the lessons learned in the field of behavioral economics to improve our financial education and consumer information.  The goal of each of the Federal Reserve's actions with respect to consumer protection has been to restore consumer confidence by making credit more transparent and, where necessary, prohibiting practices that are so complex as to be unfair and deceptive. These actions are not only good for consumers, but will benefit the financial industry. We aim to promote access to responsible credit for consumers to the greatest extent possible while also recognizing the value of innovation and the need to restore fully functioning credit markets. Being attentive to the interconnection between meaningful consumer protections and broad access to credit will ensure a more lasting and sustainable economic recovery. Conclusion With that, I would like to come full circle and end with the importance of dialogue between the Federal Reserve Banks and the regions they serve. This conference is an excellent example of the ways in which policy is shaped by your involvement. Every day across all 12 Federal Reserve Districts we leverage forums such as this, as well as partnerships with financial institutions and community groups, to better understand how financial products are shaping the communities that make up our vast economy. I want to commend you for taking the time to engage in thoughtful consideration of policies that will help alleviate the impact of the current housing and economic crisis on our neighborhoods. I also look forward to a continued discussion of the role that strong consumer protection must play in our economic future.  BIS Review 72/2009 5 
John Hurley: Restoring stability to the banking system Speech by Mr John Hurley, Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, to ACI Ireland, Dublin, 10 June 2009. *      *      * Introduction Thank you for inviting me to speak to the Association again. When I last addressed the ACI it was the autumn of 2007. We had by that time experienced the first months of market volatility, which had started out as a problem centred on the US sub-prime market quickly followed by global problems of declining liquidity and a sharp re-pricing of risk.  As we now are aware, we were, back then, only in the foothills of what has turned out to be a financial crisis of very major proportions; one that has demanded, and continues to require, an immense response from authorities worldwide. It is also a crisis with a particular domestic resonance here, coinciding as it did with the correction in our own property and construction-related sectors. As in other countries, the authorities here have taken extraordinary and unprecedented measures to stabilise the banking system and the economy.  My address tonight will focus on events since September of last year when the turmoil became a full-blown crisis and how authorities have responded since that time. It is clear that that this crisis will drive significant changes both in terms of the structure of banking systems as well as the regulatory regime and I will share some thoughts on these issues. Restoring stability to the banking system is a necessary but, on its own, not a sufficient condition for restoring health to the economy. I will conclude by commenting on the other key policy challenges of restoring competitiveness and stabilising the public finances.  Financial market turbulence evolves into a crisis The events of last September, centring around the failure of Lehman Brothers, were seminal, after which governments and central banks everywhere had to intervene in an unprecedented way and on a scale that was not conceivable beforehand. Beginning in September, global interbank markets increasingly seized up, even at the very shortest maturities. The severe shortage of liquidity impacted significantly on the operations of banks everywhere. In response, policy makers across the world have taken exceptional steps through direct financial sector interventions, as well as monetary and fiscal policy responses. Recapitalisations, deposit guarantee extensions, the provision of credit and liquidity, and programmes to deal with distressed assets were all undertaken to support financial institutions, while central banks cut policy rates to historically low levels and have introduced a range of non-conventional monetary policy measures. The response of public authorities in Ireland Notwithstanding the limited exposure to structured financial products of Irish banks, the interaction of the global shock to financial markets with the pre-existing vulnerabilities in the domestic economy triggered systemic repercussions here. A particular vulnerability here was an overheated property market that had been financed through the banking sector, in large part with funds raised on wholesale markets both at home and abroad. The immediate systemic consequences of the shortage of liquidity for the domestic banking system have been accompanied by the broader economic impact we are now experiencing.  The principal motivation behind all of the decisions that have been taken subsequently with respect to the banking system has been to limit damage to the real economy from the banking crisis. The banking sector plays a crucial role in the modern economy by acting as a BIS Review 72/2009 1 
financial intermediary and ensuring that funds are distributed from those who wish to save to those who wish to borrow. When this vital function is impaired, it can have severe effects on economic activity. Downturns that are preceded by episodes of financial stress tend to be longer in duration and, partly because of this, more severe than those caused by other factors. Furthermore, when the financial stress is related to the banking sector in particular, then the impact tends to be even more significant.  The approach adopted here in response to the crisis is consistent with the general approach adopted by countries across the EU; namely, the initial introduction of a state guarantee for banks’ liabilities, followed by recapitalisation of banks to ensure viability and nationalisation where warranted, and most recently, measures to address banks’ non-performing property-related assets through the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). A final necessary stage must address the optimum shape and structure of the domestic banking sector that will be required to meet the needs of the economy in the years ahead. The State guarantee By end-September of last year, the severe shortage of liquidity in global money markets was impacting significantly on the operations of Irish banks. Funding pressures were exacerbated by negative international investor sentiment, related to Irish banks’ exposures to the property sector, at a time when property prices and transaction volumes were declining following a period of unprecedented increases. Daily liquidity reports were showing that the situation was becoming increasingly strained.  Events came to a head on Monday 29th September when it was found necessary to introduce a State guarantee for a range of domestic banks’ liabilities. The objective of the guarantee was to give sufficient time for our banks to stabilise their funding situation, by providing the necessary confidence for international investors that would enable them to continue lending to Irish banks in the fraught environment at that time, thereby relieving short-term funding constraints and preventing a drain of liquidity. To maintain the confidence of international wholesale markets on which Irish banks are heavily dependent, it was essential that the guarantee be pitched at a level that ensured success. The guarantee resulted in an immediate improvement in the liquidity situation. Subsequently, a large number of countries, including at least 14 other European countries, introduced guarantee schemes in order to obviate the same risks, although the type, and maturity, of liabilities covered has differed according to different circumstances and judgements made in individual countries.  Recapitalisation It was recognised at the time that the guarantee was not a long-term solution and that it would still be necessary to determine if additional capital would be necessary for Irish banks. On the basis of supervisory information, Irish banks met their regulatory requirements. Across Europe, however, international markets were expecting higher core Tier 1 capital ratios than before the crisis. A number of countries, including Ireland, took the decision to recapitalise banks on this basis. A further consideration in the Irish case was market participants’ expectations of significant write-downs on property-related assets that would eat into existing capital. The severity of the downturn in the economy was also a factor in recapitalisation here. While Irish banks, unlike many of their international peers, were not exposed to securities based on US subprime mortgages, the exposure that attracted concern in the Irish case was our system’s over-exposure to property-related loans. There was great uncertainty about the ultimate impact of the unwinding of an overheated property market on the quality of banks’ assets. There was also concern that banks might attempt to improve their capital positions only by curtailing the supply of credit. Historical experience from other countries shows that this type of dynamic would potentially have had severe and lasting negative repercussions for the economy and the financial sector and needed to be avoided 2 BIS Review 72/2009 
After consultation between all the relevant authorities, a decision was taken to recapitalise our largest domestic banks following due diligence on these banks’ exposures. The banks were also required to make a commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium-sized firms and first-time buyers. Following the emergence of unacceptable governance issues, Anglo Irish Bank was taken into public ownership to protect the stability of our wider financial system.  Non-performing assets on banks’ balance sheets International commentators, such as the IMF in its Global Financial Stability Report, suggest that the challenge now for many countries is to address banks’ balance sheets – specifically, to identify and deal with impaired assets – as a necessary step in recovering from the crisis. Our domestic banks have substantial exposures to land and development loans, which creates uncertainty about their capital positions and, ultimately, affects their ability to provide credit to the real economy.  It is in this context that the Government has decided to establish the National Asset Management Agency. The intention is to transfer the land and development books and appropriate associated exposures to NAMA in return for government bonds. It is essential that this is done; it is a critical stage in the process to renew confidence in the banking sector. The correct pricing of these assets is a most important issue and must balance value for the taxpayer with restoring the capacity of the banking sector to support the real economy.  The Eurosystem response Alongside the various domestic initiatives outlined above, the Central Bank has continued to respond to the crisis as a member of the Eurosystem. The Governing Council of the ECB has reduced its key policy interest rate by 325 basis points cumulatively since last October. This has had a very significant effect in lowering borrowing costs for households and firms across the euro area, including in Ireland. There has been a pick-up in investor sentiment over the last number of months and this partly reflects economic indicators, which have been somewhat more positive both in Europe and globally. Nevertheless, this follows a very sharp contraction in euro area GDP in the first three months of the year and the more recent data, for the most part, point to a further – but smaller – decline in activity in the second quarter.  The recovery is likely to be gradual and extended, however, given the nature and scale of the crisis we have experienced. As a result, monetary policy will have to remain accommodative for as long as is required and will only be adjusted when there are definite signs of a significant improvement. As regards prices, euro area inflation is expected to turn temporarily negative for a period this year but to return to positive territory again thereafter. I would like to emphasise that, over the medium term, indicators of inflation expectations remain very much in line with the Governing Council’s definition of price stability. This reflects the Eurosystem’s credibility.  The Governing Council’s response to the crisis has been exceptional and has also included innovative non-conventional measures, particularly in terms of liquidity provision. Banks are currently able to access unlimited liquidity against suitable collateral at a fixed rate for up to six months, and later this month they will be able to do so for an even longer period, up to 12 months. This has been of enormous benefit to Irish banks and to the euro area banking sector in general. At its last meeting, the Governing Council announced the details of a programme to purchase around €60 billion of euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area, which will help an important market, and again will be of benefit to banks and support credit provision. The European covered bond market is currently stalled and the programme will help stimulate the market, as it increases demand for the instruments in BIS Review 72/2009 3 
question, making new issuance attractive for banks. Covered bonds form an important funding channel for the main Irish banks.  What does the future hold for banking systems generally? While it remains unclear when the crisis will end and what its ultimate effects will be, recent signs of recovery remind us that we need to look at the type of financial system that we want to see emerge when the crisis is over. This holds at national, EU and global levels.  The ongoing crisis underlines the need to adopt a system-wide approach to regulation and supervision. The proposals of the de Larosière report are particularly pertinent on this point. A feature of the current crisis has been that, while the build-up of pressures at a macro, or system-wide, level was widely recognised when it was happening, the publication of these concerns, which was the internationally accepted way for central banks to convey their concerns, was not effective. This was the case both internationally and in Ireland. It is essential, therefore, that we bridge the gap between financial stability, or macro-prudential supervision, on the one hand and micro-prudential, or traditional supervision, on the other. In this context, the European Commission has proposed a new supervisory framework for the EU based on the de Larosière proposals. The proposal for new structures recognises explicitly the need for macro-prudential risk assessments in order to identify emerging vulnerabilities in the financial system and issue risk warnings but also, crucially, the necessity to follow these with policy actions when appropriate. While the details of the proposed new EU framework still need to be ironed out, I strongly support the direction proposed. I welcome also the recent announcement here providing for full integration and co-ordination within the Central Bank of responsibilities for both financial stability and micro-prudential supervision. These new domestic arrangements would fit very well with the proposed new European framework.  The current crisis has made it clear that risk management practices across all parts of the financial sector need to be improved significantly. One of the key aspects that must be addressed is ensuring that the regulatory framework does not magnify the cyclicality already inherent in the financial system, as it has during the current crisis. In this context, it is essential that we develop mechanisms and procedures to ensure that banks accumulate resources in good times to act as a cushion when the cycle turns. Clearly, accounting standards play an important part here, and I welcome initiatives being undertaken both at the IASB and the Basel Committee to improve reporting in order to reduce cyclicality. The restructuring of remuneration packages is another important issue related to risk management practices, and the re-alignment of incentives to prioritise long-term sustainability above short-term profitability is necessary.  Structure of Irish banking sector In the light of all that has happened, we need to examine the structure of the domestic banking system. When the crisis comes to an end the structure and shape of our banking system will be different. This is likely to be an international trend. In Ireland, the very existence of NAMA will in itself be central to this. The banks that emerge from that process may well be smaller but better prepared for the new environment. This should allow for a more focused and consolidated banking sector. We need to ensure that the banking system that emerges is one that is there to serve the future needs of the economy.  The global financial services industry is going through a period of radical change as a result of the financial crisis. At this stage, it is not clear what will be the ultimate impact on the industry. The international financial sector operating in Ireland is obviously not immune to these global developments. However, there is a broad range of activities located in the IFSC, which as a whole has withstood the crisis reasonably well, and I am confident that the IFSC will continue to make a very significant contribution to the Irish economy.  4 BIS Review 72/2009 
Economic assessment While huge efforts have been put in to stabilising the financial sector, we also need to act to restore stability in other areas. More generally, it is vital that we act credibly and quickly to confront the very significant challenges that we face and chart a path that will in time ensure a sustainable recovery in economic growth. Over the past two decades, Ireland has demonstrated a strong ability to exploit its advantages – in the form of flexible markets, a competitive economy and a highly-skilled and educated labour force – to generate growth. In more recent times, these strengths have come to be masked by increased costs and by the fact that economic activity had become unbalanced. We had become too dependent on largely construction-driven growth in domestic demand. Among other things, this pattern of growth entailed an overdependence on property-related transaction taxes. The inevitable downturn in construction activities then gave rise to an extremely sharp and severe deterioration in the public finances, the scale of which has exceeded even that of the downturn in economic growth. The importance of taking effective and immediate steps to improve cost competitiveness and address fiscal imbalances cannot be overstated.  Economy-wide productivity gains have been very modest and labour costs have been relatively high in recent years compared to our main trading partners. This deterioration must be addressed if we are to return to a sustainable growth path. A strategy to restore competitiveness must encompass action on a number of fronts including pay and non-pay costs, infrastructure improvements which support productivity growth, the enhancement of competition in sheltered sectors, continuing to encourage innovation and R&D activity and enhancing the skill levels of the labour force. In particular, a flexible approach to wage developments is essential. More recently, in the face of the sharp contraction in economic activity, many firms have taken action to reduce their costs including the negotiation of reductions in wage rates, with a view to protecting employment. While this has undoubtedly been painful for those concerned, it nevertheless reflects encouraging evidence of the flexibility and realism that is needed if the economy is to maintain the maximum possible number of jobs in the short-term while placing Ireland in a favourable position to benefit from an eventual recovery in world demand. This type of flexibility must embrace all sectors of the economy. The deterioration in the fiscal position has been a cause for serious concern. The Government has agreed with the European Commission to correct our Excessive Deficit position by 2013. The Government’s introduction of a public sector pension levy and the Supplementary Budget are steps they have taken to this end. It is important that the target agreed with the European Commission be met.  Future lower medium-term growth potential means that cyclical recovery will not solve our fiscal problems. The Commission on Taxation and the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, which are currently underway, will have a key role to play in identifying measures that will improve the budgetary situation in coming years, These measures are necessary to restore confidence, deal with financing concerns and underpin the medium-term growth potential of the economy. Conclusions In summary, we remain in a very difficult and challenging environment. The very significant global downturn, as evidenced for instance by the IMF in their latest global economic forecasts, coupled with our own economic difficulties, is impacting significantly on Irish households and businesses. On a human level, the contraction in the economy is impacting directly on households’ incomes and resulting in very significant levels of unemployment. Sound economic management and timely decision making to deal with the unfolding situation are therefore essential. In this context, it is critical that continuing action is taken to both improve the economy’s competitiveness and address the deterioration in the fiscal position. It BIS Review 72/2009 5 
is also vital to ensure that stability is restored to the banking sector as quickly as possible and I have outlined the actions already taken in this regard. If we address all these challenges head-on, the economy has the potential to grow solidly again in the medium term and the process of reducing our significant levels of unemployment can begin. 6 BIS Review 72/2009 
Ben S Bernanke: Brief remarks – the Fed’s efforts with respect to diversity Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference, Washington DC, 25 September 2009. *      *      * Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to speak during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference. Congresswoman Waters, I appreciate the invitation and your leadership in this area. Let me make a few brief comments about the Federal Reserve's efforts with respect to diversity, and I look forward to our dialogue afterward.  As you know, in response to the financial crisis that began more than two years ago, the Federal Reserve has introduced various programs to improve the functioning of key financial markets, with the goal of helping to restore the flow of credit that our economy needs. Usage of many of these programs has been winding down as markets improve, but one program for which an ongoing need still clearly exists is the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. This program, which was implemented this year, has helped restart the securitization markets for various types of consumer and small business credit. Securitization markets are an important source of credit, and their virtual shutdown during the crisis has reduced credit availability for many borrowers. Since its inception, the TALF has indirectly financed nearly 3 million loans to households (excluding credit card loans) and nearly 400,000 loans to small businesses. Investors participate in the TALF by receiving loans from the Federal Reserve to finance purchases of asset-backed securities. TALF was designed from the start to be available to a diverse set of participants: TALF loans to purchase asset-backed securities are available to virtually any U.S.-domiciled firm, and firms can participate with investments as low as $500,000. There have been 121 borrowers so far, including investors of all sizes. Since TALF is open to all investment firms, we needed agents to work with potential borrowers. In March, I participated in the TARP/TALF Access Summit that you organized. At that summit, we heard that a more diverse set of TALF agents would help bring in a more diverse set of TALF borrowers. Acting on that good suggestion, we recently announced the inclusion of four new TALF agents, selected to increase the diversity of TALF borrowers. Three of the four are owned by African Americans. We expect the new TALF agents to begin operation in November. In the area of procurement, the Federal Reserve uses various methods to reach women- and minority-owned contractors. We hold vendor fairs in Washington to publicize opportunities. For example, on September 2, representatives of approximately 60 companies talked to Board staff about contracting possibilities. We are a member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council, and we regularly attend national and local vendor fairs and conferences (including several this year) to share information on how to do business with the Board. Our procurement staff works with Board operating divisions in all phases of the contracting process. In addition, our procurement policies require that nearly all contracts include a subcontracting plan that describes the vendor's commitment to provide small and/or minority- and women-owned companies the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in contract performance. The Board's chief acquisition officer oversees compliance with the Board's procurement policies and procedures, working with staff responsible for outreach to women- and minority-owned companies. Finally, I would also like to mention briefly the Partnership for Progress, a Federal Reserve initiative launched last year in recognition of the importance of healthy minority-owned BIS Review 116/2009 1 
depository institutions to many communities in this country. This initiative supports minority-owned depository institutions through outreach and technical assistance and by training examiners to better understand some of the unique challenges faced by minority-owned institutions. The Federal Reserve System remains committed to diversity and inclusion in our programs and activities, and I appreciate the opportunity to have this dialogue. Again, thank you for inviting me today. 2 BIS Review 116/2009 
Joseph Yam: Reflections relevant to the banking profession in Hong Kong Speech by Mr Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the Joint HKAB – HKIB Dinner in honour of Mr Joseph Yam's retirement as Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Hong Kong, 28 September 2009. *      *      * Peter, friends and colleagues of the banking profession, Not only am I deeply touched by all of the kind and generous words that have been said this evening, but I have also been greatly impressed by the skits and other entertainments put on this evening. I had always assumed that whatever surplus talents bankers may have were always used up on the golf course. Now I know that these talents stretch in other, more cultural directions. Thank you all for such an enjoyable and unforgettable evening. This is a convivial occasion, and the last thing you will want to hear is a long and earnest speech from me. However, this will be my last formal event with you as Monetary Authority. And I think you all know me well enough to expect more than just a few words of gratitude – however heartfelt – for this splendid event. I shall be brief. Much has been said and written recently about the origins, progress and implications of the global financial crisis that erupted with such fury just over a year ago. I shall therefore simply offer a few reflections that I hope will be relevant to the banking profession in Hong Kong. The first observation is that Hong Kong has, so far, escaped the worst. We have not experienced a collapse of our financial system, or a nationalisation of our major banks, or other forms of government intervention that will burden taxpayers for many years to come. In fact, our banking system has been resilient throughout the crisis, and the measures taken early on to reinforce confidence and ensure liquidity were effective and at minimal cost to the public purse. This is not an observation to be made with any sense of gloating or complacency. We all recall the intense anxiety of those days, and many in our community have suffered losses as a result of mistakes and mismanagement in other financial systems. Nevertheless, our well-capitalised banks have been well prepared for shock. Crisis management, particularly when public confidence momentarily came under strain, was effective. The generally cautious approach of our bankers, your refusal to get carried away by innovation, helped minimise the damage: this is a vindication of your reputation for prudence, and a great credit to Hong Kong's banking system. We also seem to have achieved a good balance in the relationship between the supervisor and the banking system. An excellent example of how that balance has contributed to banking stability is the 70% loan-to-value policy for residential mortgage lending by banks. This policy, now a cornerstone of our prudential arrangements, pre-dates even the foundation of the HKMA and evolved out of a productive dialogue between HKAB and the supervisor. It has survived strong political pressure for relaxation and market pressure for innovative credit risk transfer through securitisation. The policy – now nearly two decades old – fits in well with the macro-prudential approach which, particularly in the light of the recent crisis, supervisors in other jurisdictions now consider to be essential to banking stability. The fact that no such policy existed in the advanced financial systems is remarkable enough. But what is more remarkable is the level of initiative of the Hong Kong banking sector itself in seeing the importance of systemic stability and giving it precedence over the profitability of individual institutions. We might therefore observe, in the light of this and of our experience over the past year, that Hong Kong has got it broadly right in the relationship between the supervisor and the banking system. However, this should not lead us to the complacent conclusion that there is nothing much that needs changing. And indeed, no such conclusion is in our minds. Both the BIS Review 116/2009 1 
Carse Report and the recent reports to the Financial Secretary on the Sale of Lehman-related products see room for development and improvement in the way we carry out our work. Quite apart from our own Hong Kong-specific initiatives, there are movements for reform at the international level, resulting from a very different experience in the more developed economies, which we cannot ignore. This point brings me to my second observation: the need to move with the times. The past year has seen a plethora of ideas and proposals for reforming financial regulations, and interventions by government that were unprecedented in their nature and scale. Even in economies less deeply affected by the latest crisis, including Hong Kong, it has been necessary to deepen government involvement, for example in more extensive deposit guarantees or in more intense supervision of banks' risk management – although it is gratifying that so many of the tools that we have been able to rely on, including the apparatus and contingency arrangements for ensuring liquidity, have been developed in a pre-emptive rather than a reactive way. On the various emergency measures, I am quite sure that in the fullness of time, these will either be turned into standing arrangements or withdrawn, hopefully through smooth exit strategies. But, current sentiment is clearly demanding much closer regulation and supervision of banks over the longer term. Quite what form this will take remains to be agreed on in international forums, although the thinking already seems to be towards improvements in the level and quality of banks' capital; new global standards for measuring, managing and supervising liquidity risk; and macro-prudential supervision to reduce the pro-cyclical dynamics of financial markets. No doubt the details will take some time to work out. We might be tempted in Hong Kong to respond that we have demonstrated clearly this last year that we already have the ability to maintain banking stability. The measures being contemplated internationally are designed for repairing and renovating banking systems that have effectively collapsed: some of the measures may indeed be going too far. Therefore, we might conclude that we do not need to consider them for Hong Kong. Such an attitude would, I think, be a mistake. As an international financial centre, Hong Kong must adopt international standards and best practices. We have to move with the times, although that does not of course mean we have to blindly implement everything in an inflexible, straightjacket manner.  Hong Kong is, in fact, in a good position to adopt and participate in the various measures now under consideration by the G20, the Financial Stability Board and its Standing Committees, and other international agencies. Our voice may not be so loud or strong as that of the larger economies, but we still have a responsibility to speak up, to seek to ensure that what comes out of the international forums is balanced, and realistic for local and regional conditions. The increasing participation by Asian economies, including Hong Kong, in these international forums is a good sign that the rest of the world is paying attention to, and ready to learn from, the experiences of this region. The task, for Hong Kong as for all jurisdictions, will be to translate high-level principles and universal standards into local practice, and to develop the skills to carry them out. This is an enormous challenge, but there are reasons for confidence in Hong Kong's case. We have had a largely positive experience in introducing Basel II into our supervisory system, thanks in no small part to the hard work of both HKAB and HKIB. Regulatory reform is driven not just by objective circumstances but also by changing public expectations. This brings me to my third observation: that banks and financial institutions (and, it might be added, regulators) are now operating in a more sceptical, more demanding, even hostile environment. We see this around the world, and, particularly in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, we have seen it in Hong Kong. There is also discontent and anxiety locally that pre-dates the crisis – for example, about access to banking services, about the risks of new technology – that result partly from the changing business landscape and partly from changing expectations. We must expect this trend to continue, and it will be necessary for the banking industry and the regulator to take more and more account of wider public opinion, and to tackle areas of concern. As the industry organisation, HKAB has 2 BIS Review 116/2009 
already become quite deeply involved in such matters: for example, it has played an important co-ordinating and think-tank role in ensuring the safety and efficiency of e-banking, and in promoting accessibility to banking services, particularly among vulnerable groups; it is also one of the joint issuers of the Code of Banking Practice, the reference-point for relations between banks and their customers. HKAB can, I believe, contribute even more in the future, and consolidate its role as industry representative, by strengthening its resources, for example by creating a separate secretariat with a professional chief executive. One of the key causes of the recent financial crisis was the use – or abuse – of innovation by financial intermediaries for short-term private gain at the expense of longer-term stability and effective working of the financial system as a whole. And one of the reactions to this has been a call – a very loud call in some places – for banks to go “back to basics” in conducting their business. If such a reaction were to lead to a return to the sort of inflexible banking services many of the older among us remember, then this would be a pity. If, on the other hand, it were to result in greater reflection and rethinking about the true function of banking in society, then this would, in my view, be a healthy development. At the heart of such thinking must be the view that the banking system exists to provide financial intermediation in support of the larger economy: it cannot be some abstracted, disembodied realm of activity in which intermediaries compete with each other to dream up ever more complicated ways of making a fast profit. But such thinking should not rule out innovation, as long as the objectives are clear: and the main objectives should be to serve activities in the greater economy, to increase the efficiency of the financial system without sacrificing its safety. This leads to my fourth and final observation.  We have many examples of such innovation in Hong Kong to draw upon, but there is one that is particularly appropriate on this evening of reminiscences. I refer to the introduction of renminbi business into banks in Hong Kong – a development which seemed revolutionary at the time, but which now seems a very normal activity. It had small beginnings and is a gradual, cautious process: there is, of course, scope for much further growth and development. This innovation has clear practical uses in facilitating economic relations between Hong Kong and the Mainland, in reinforcing Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre, and in supporting the liberalisation of China's financial system. How many of us here, I wonder, recall that the idea of developing renminbi business in Hong Kong was first broached in 2001, during one of the Annual HKAB visits to the Mainland which I had the privilege of joining? The development of renminbi business in Hong Kong, and more generally the role of Hong Kong in serving the need of China in international finance depend on the pace of financial liberalisation on the Mainland. It is therefore very much out of our hands, involving policies that allow for greater cross border mobility of capital, financial instruments and financial intermediaries. Yet our survival as an international financial centre depends on our being prepared for these policies of financial liberalisation. We should also be proactive in offering advice in policy making and be ready to provide assistance and technical support in policy implementation. One very practical way of doing this is to continue to use our financial system as a platform for cautious experiment in the gradual liberalisation of the renmminbi – a process that is of benefit to our system and to the nation as a whole. The Basic Law specifies that Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre will be maintained. There are many policies and programmes in train to achieve this. But surely the key for the future is in developing Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi market. There should be no doubt that the renminbi will become an international currency one day. For Hong Kong to be unprepared for this, for us to fail to see the opportunities or build the infrastructure to make the best of it, would be to risk marginalisation. There is no shortage of awareness of this point, whether at the policy or the technical level within the government. At the practical and business level, the banks also have a role in making use of the channels that are opened up: it is gratifying to note that banks are playing their role effectively and with enthusiasm.

Ladies and gentlemen, Monetary Authorities and bankers come and go. But I have no doubt that HKAB and HKIB, and the spirit of co-operation that they embody, will go on for ever. I have no doubt that you will continue to promote the prosperity of Hong Kong and the wellbeing of all who live here for many years to come. I wish my successor, Norman Chan every success, and all of the happiness that I have enjoyed as Monetary Authority. As for myself, in two days' time I shall move from this very public role into the role of private citizen, with all of the pleasures and responsibilities that entails. This is an unfamiliar, possibly challenging position for me. But I have never been known to decline a challenge, and I look forward to the freedom to plan my own days and see more of family and friends, many of whom are here this evening. I wish all of you the very best of health, happiness and success. 4 BIS Review 116/2009 
K C Chakrabarty: Global crisis – genesis, challenges and opportunities unleashed Inaugural address by Dr K C Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 21st Anniversary Convention of the Association of Professional Bankers, Sri Lanka, Colombo, 25 September 2009. The assistance provided by Mr. S. Pattnaik in preparation of the address is gratefully acknowledged. *      *      * Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Governor, Central Bank of Sri Lanka; Mr. Ajantha Madurapperuma, President, Association of Professional Bankers – Sri Lanka; Distinguished guests and members of the Association of Professional Bankers, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is a great pleasure and privilege for me to be here today for this 21st Anniversary Convention of the Association of Professional Bankers of Sri Lanka. At the outset, I would like to thank Mr. Ajantha Madurapperuma, the President of the Association and all its members for extending the invitation and providing me this opportunity to share my views on a theme which has tested the competence and conventional wisdom of policy makers, bankers and market participants all around the world, as the complex nature and severity of the global crisis has been truly unprecedented.  It is indeed heartening to note that Sri Lanka like many emerging markets, has weathered the crisis without any significant stress on its financial system, though, the country’s growth outlook, like many other countries, was affected by the varied effects of the contagion from the crisis. In terms of financial outlook, according to the IMF, Sri Lanka’s economic growth for 2009 could be around 3 percent compared to 6 percent in 2008, even though other estimates, including that of the Central Bank suggests that growth could remain in the range of 3.5 to 4.5 per cent. Inflation condition has also been improving, as the annual average inflation rate has continued to decline since November, 2008 and recorded a single digit level of 8.5 per cent in August 2009, which is the lowest since 2006. The recent revision in rating outlook by the S&P from “negative” to “stable” corroborates the improving outlook for the economy. I am optimistic that the Sri Lankan economy and the banking sector will perform well and will be on a high growth trajectory in time to come.  In this age of globalisation, sound national policies pursued in any country alone may not be enough to ensure sustainable high growth with stability. Understanding the opportunities and risks associated with globalisation and developing national and global architectures to enhance the benefits of globalisation while containing the risks, therefore, represent a major challenge for the policy makers. Every financial crisis, notwithstanding the associated ravages, has to be also seen in terms of the opportunities it offer like exposing the limitations of the existing systems, cleansing the financial systems of activities and markets entities that work towards misuse of the systems for maximizing personal returns, and certainly in this process open up new business opportunities. I would like to share with you certain important aspects of the crisis, before sharing with you the Indian experience in terms of the impact of the crisis and the way forward. The genesis of the crisis The sudden manifestation of the crisis in 2007 was the result of two important fundamental macroeconomic imbalances that persisted for too long; one, the monetary policy of the Fed Reserve in the Greenspan era and second, the growing global imbalances. Both these factors were clear precursors of unsustainable bubbles, which were ignored in general because of the pre-crisis phase of high global growth with low inflation.  BIS Review 116/2009 1 
Growing bubbles The Fed’s monetary policy stance before the crisis created the general impression over time that the interest of capital in a free market economy can never be at risk. That encouraged the use of high leverage as a source of sustainable high profits from bubbles. Fed’s monetary policy has widely been highlighted by now for its role in supporting the growth of two most unpleasant things – speculation and leverage – which in turn contained the potential for a severe financial crisis.  The global imbalances The safe haven appeal of the US dollar as the key international currency, and the assured high return on financial investment in the capital market in the US during the Greenspan era led to a situation where the US continuously maintained large and growing unsustainable current account deficits. Countries around the world with current account surpluses or large foreign exchange reserves kept investing in the US. Despite the crisis, and the resultant forced correction in imbalances to some extent, this global problem could persist even after the crisis. The buildup to the crisis - role of more proximate factors Leverage Use of leverage merged as the sure means to maximize income in the US economy. American household and corporate debt had increased significantly before the crisis. One recent University of Chicago study highlights how the size of household debt and house prices moved together in the US, and every increase in house prices induced further growth in debt for consumption purpose. For every one dollar increase in house prices, the increase in debt-financed consumption rose by 25 to 30 cents. The wealth effect of asset price increases, thus, seemed to be much more significant than what was perceived earlier by the policy makers. Correction in asset prices, thus, led to an intense deleveraging process. Assets prices and leverage represent two important variables that must be constantly monitored, as risk from both of them to the financial system could be significant.  Deterioration in credit standards The deterioration in credit standards facilitated by the sustained easy monetary policy stance and deregulation induced opportunity for shifting of credit risk through securitisation, contributed to growth in credit to sub-prime segments. It is often argued that easy access to liquidity alone could not have led to deterioration in credit standards. Securitisation and innovations linked to such securities opened up the option to shift credit risk in sub-prime loans to the markets and thereby free the pressure on banks’ capital, which in turn led to the significant weakening in standards for credit assessment.  Emergence of shadow banks – and the tendency to circumvent regulations  Many leading international banks started/sponsored off-balance sheet Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) to freely undertake activities which were not possible otherwise because of regulatory norms for banks, like capital adequacy and management of liquidity risks. The SIVs, in turn, faced no such constraints, and could borrow freely from the short-term Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) market and take large leveraged positions in papers like CDOs/CLOs whose valuation and liquidity were most unknown. In the pre-crisis period, these SIVs or shadow banks generated good profits for the sponsoring banks. Once the crisis started, the sponsoring banks had to take the losses of the SIVs. The tendency to circumvent regulation but still do something that is perfectly legal (like sponsoring SIVs to undertake 2 BIS Review 116/2009 
certain activities) suggests that regulation alone cannot address all sources of risks to the financial systems. Financial innovations Earlier, it was not easy to securitise any type of loan, like sub-prime loans, and create a market for them. The financial engineers of the Wall Street, however, found the answer in two things: First, by creating information asymmetry by converting the pool of difficult to market loans into Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDOs), and second, creating market for different tranches based on “ratings”. Thus, a “AAA” rated CDO could be created out of cash-flows linked to sub-prime loans. In the post crisis period, some have questioned the relevance of such innovations in any financial market. Innovations need to be encouraged for enhancing market efficiency, but market efficiency cannot be achieved without proper information.  Financial systems became too complex and the potential vulnerabilities escaped supervisory focus The role of complexity in financial systems in causing the crisis has been deftly explained by Landau (2009). Complexity increased from two sides, first, the structured products (whose valuation could be hard to establish), and second, the rising interdependence between financial institutions, market players and counterparties. The nature of this interdependence was too complex to be monitored by any regulator, and the dynamics of the interactions also kept changing in constant search of higher returns through new innovations and regulatory arbitrage.  Three points are particularly important to note in this context: (a) Information is critical for any advanced efficient market, however “Complexity” led to loss of information; some of the innovations in effect destroyed information; (b) Complexity gave rise to higher uncertainty, making financial systems highly unpredictable and (c) Uncertainty led to “flight to quality and hoarding of liquidity”, which precipitated the crisis. When everybody runs for cover to minimise the loss, the “collective action problem” accentuates the market stress.  Pressure on capital and the severe credit squeeze  As the prices of toxic papers witnessed free fall (in some cases the value of certain CDOs fell to below 30 cents a dollar, and stock prices also fell significantly), the losses for the banks having exposure to such papers rose significantly, and the capital buffer turned increasingly inadequate, creating concerns of insolvency. Banks, given the capital adequacy requirement, have to either raise fresh capital, or contract their balance sheet size, when capital comes under pressure because of application of mark-to-market (MtM) related losses in a falling market for financial instruments held in the investment portfolio of banks. In the testimony of William M Isaac before the US sub-committee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government Sponsored Enterprises dated March 12, 2009 it was pointed out that “…MtM losses destroyed $ 500 billion of capital in the financial system. Because banks can lend 10 times of capital, MtM losses destroyed $ 5 trillion of lending capacity”, leading to a severe credit squeeze. The sub-prime crisis, thus, had all the ingredients to deliver a serious global recession. From financial crisis to a synchronised global recession In view of the strong interactions between the financial system and the real economy, a financial crisis often gives rise to an “adverse feedback loop”. As risk taking capacity of the banks erodes with pressure on capital, and as greater risk aversion leads to tighter credit standards, flow of money for financing real activities becomes difficult. This was seen in both BIS Review 116/2009 3 
money market and credit market in the advanced economies. When leading Wall Street banks were feared to fail, inter-bank market had to freeze, due to generalised lack of trust. The credit market, in turn, witnessed severe pressure on the capacity to lend; moreover, the deleveraging process gathered steam over time, where everybody wanted to minimise the losses. The real economic activity decelerated as aggregate demand, particularly private consumption and investment demand shrank under the pressure of deleveraging, wealth loss associated with falling asset prices, increasing unemployment, and deteriorating climate for investment and employment.  As the real effects of the financial crisis magnified over time and the initial decoupling perception turned out to be a myth, the IMF revised its global growth outlook for 2009 downwards repeatedly from 3.9 per cent in July 2008 to -1.4 per cent in July 2009. The volume of world trade has also been projected to contract by 12.1 per cent in 2009. It is the serious real costs of a financial crisis that has led to large scale use of fiscal and monetary policy stimulus all over the world.  In view of the adverse feedback loop in the advanced economies, policies have aimed at addressing both financial stress and the economic recession, since addressing any one would not weaken the vicious loop. Lower interest rates, ample liquidity and fiscal stimulus have been used to contain the adverse real effects; while for restoring stability to the financial system, measures like raising the capital of banks and financial institutions and addressing the impaired assets have been adopted.  The Indian economy before the global crisis India had emerged as a leading emerging market economy (EME) by the time when the sub-prime crisis started. The average GDP growth of 8.8 per cent during the 5 year period 2003-08 was not only one of the highest in the world in the recent period, but it had also permanently raised India’s growth trajectory to a higher level. There was a clear structural transformation, driven by reforms, globalisation and significant increase in domestic savings and investment rates, which helped in boosting both investment and productivity driven growth in the system. More importantly, inflation in India averaged at about 5.3 per cent during this high growth period.  The macroeconomic environment remained stable and resilient to external shocks, despite rising degree of openness and significant reforms. Sustainable current account deficits in the balance of payments and surges in capital flows during this period had led to increase in the country’s foreign exchange reserves to more than USD 315 billion by May 2008, which had significantly enhanced the capacity of India to face any potential external sector vulnerability arising from the global crisis. Domestic savings rate had increased from 23.5 per cent of GDP in 2001-02 to 37.7 per cent in 2007-08, which facilitated the step up in investment rate from 22.8 per cent to 39.1 per cent during the corresponding period. Because of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, the fiscal position was also on a healthy consolidation path. Given the sound macro-financial conditions, India was better placed than many EMEs to face the global crisis, even though over time it became evident that the perception of decoupling was a myth. The impact of the global crisis on India Three channels of contagion – namely trade, capital flows and deteriorating confidence – affected the real sector of the economy. The immediate concern after the Lehman bankruptcy, however, was to assess the exposure of the domestic financial system to the failing institutions and the falling asset prices in the financial systems of the advanced countries.  4 BIS Review 116/2009 
No direct and limited indirect exposure of the Indian banking system to the financial crisis The banks in India did not have any direct exposure to the US sub-prime market. Some banks, however, had indirect exposure through their overseas branches and subsidiaries to the US sub-prime markets in the form of structured products, such as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). Some of the banks, with exposures to credit derivatives, had to book MTM losses; the impact though was not very significant and banks had made adequate provisions to meet the MTM losses on such exposures. Moreover, the banks in general had maintained high levels of capital adequacy ratio.  Once the risk from the financial system was assessed to be limited, the policy priorities focused on dealing with the problem of global illiquidity spiral for ensuring orderly and well functioning markets. Given the strong interactions between financial markets, financial institutions and the real economy, ensuring normal functioning of markets assumed critical significance. The financial markets - in particular the stock market, the money market and the forex market – reflected the heat of the global contagion. Liquidity pressure Global liquidity scare and credit squeeze led to constrained access to funds for Indian entities, and some of the corporates shifted their demand for funds to local markets. The pressure on the balance of payments, led by net capital outflows in the third quarter of 2008-09 and the associated intervention sales by the RBI in the forex market also implied corresponding withdrawal of domestic liquidity from the banking system, which the RBI had to more than offset by expanding liquidity against domestic assets in its balance sheet. Net capital flows declined from US$ 108.0 billion in 2007-08 to US$ 9.1 billion in 2008-09. India's foreign exchange reserves declined by US$ 58.0 billion, of which US$ 37.9 billion was on account of valuation changes, and the remaining US$ 20.1 billion decline reflected the financing needs of the BoP. Thus, with less than 10 per cent of the available stock of forex reserves, the balance of payments pressures from a severe global contagion could be contained. The liquidity demand, however, increased in general after the Lehman incident in September 2008. In view of the funding inter-linkages between NBFCs (non-banking financial companies), mutual funds and commercial banks, when the contagion from the global financial crisis created selling pressures in the stock markets in India, the liquidity needs of the financial system as a whole had to be addressed by the Reserve Bank. The global deleveraging process created selling pressures, as foreign investors could meet liquidity needs in the advanced markets by selling in domestic markets. Heavy redemption pressure on mutual funds started in September 2008, as several investors, especially institutional investors, started redeeming their investments in liquid funds/money market funds. Mutual funds are major subscribers to CPs and debentures issued by the NBFCs, besides CDs issued by banks. The rollover of maturing short-term instruments floated by NBFCs for having regular access to market funding became difficult. The tightening liquidity conditions also made banks somewhat reluctant to lend to NBFCs. The financial market pressures Global illiquidity spiral increased volatility in the financial markets, and restoring orderly conditions in the financial markets became critical to contain the spread of contagion into other sectors of the economy. The Indian rupee, which stood at 39.99 per US dollar as at end-March 2008, depreciated and moved in a narrow range of Rs. 42-43 per US dollar from the third week of May to the middle of August 2008. It depreciated sharply thereafter, breaching the level of Rs.50 per US dollar on October 27, 2008, and touching the low of Rs. 52.09 per US dollar on March 5, 2009. The BSE Sensex fell to a low of 8160 on March 9, 2009, witnessing a decline of 60.9 per cent from the peak of 20,873 on January 8, 2008. The BIS Review 116/2009 5 
overnight call money rate, which had jumped to 13 per cent on September 16, 2008 touched a peak of 19.8 per cent on October 10, 2008, and the access to liquidity from the RBI through LAF (Liquidity Adjustment Facility) repo crossed Rs. 900 billion. The RBI, thus, had to meet the liquidity needs, in both domestic and foreign currency so as to ensure smooth functioning of the markets.  The response from the Reserve Bank of India We are aware that a central bank must pay attention to money and credit growth. The crisis has also brought to the fore that asset prices have a significant role in the economy and the price buildup cannot be ignored by a central bank. It is important that sub-sectors which are displaying incipient problems be treated differently. Preserving soundness of the regulated financial institutions, ensuring orderly market conditions and containing the pace of deceleration in growth warranted introduction of adequate and timely policy measures by the RBI. As WPI headline inflation declined sharply from the peak of 12.9 per cent in August 2008 (to 0.8 per cent by end-March 2009 and then to the negative territory since June 2009), that created enough space for the RBI to pursue the objectives of growth and financial stability, by creating and sustaining ample liquidity in the market. Measures aimed at expanding the rupee liquidity included significant reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR), reduction of the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), opening a special repo window under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) for banks for on-lending to the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), housing finance companies (HFCs) and mutual funds (MFs), and extending a special refinance facility, which banks can access without any collateral. Measures aimed at managing forex liquidity included upward adjustment of the interest rate ceilings on the foreign currency non-resident (banks) [FCNR(B)] and non-resident (external) rupee account [NR(E)RA] deposits, substantially relaxing the external commercial borrowings (ECB) regime, allowing the NBFCs and HFCs access to foreign borrowing and allowing corporates to buy back foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs). In response to the knock-on effects of the global economic crisis on the Indian economy, between October 11, 2008 and June 29, 2009 the Reserve Bank reduced CRR by a cumulative 400 basis points to 5.0 per cent of NDTL (injecting thereby Rs.1.6 trillion to the banking system), lowered repo rate by 425 basis points to 4.75 per cent from 9 per cent, and adjusted the reverse repo rate downwards by 275 basis points from 6.0 per cent to 3.25 per cent. Potential liquidity made available by RBI is about Rs.5.6 trillion, or equivalent of 9 percent of India’s GDP. The impact of RBI’s measures in restoring orderly conditions in the financial markets Responding to the ample liquidity created and sustained by the RBI, the interbank call rate reverted to within the LAF corridor, and since November 2008 the RBI is again into absorption mode, signifying the persistence of surplus in the market. In the recent months the daily average reverse repo absorption has been about Rs.1.2 trillion. The exchange rate has also appreciated from the low of around Rs.52 per US dollar in March 2009 to around Rs. 48 per US dollar in last few months. Quick restoration of normalcy to money and forex market, thus, contributed significantly to avoid any stress in the financial system as a source of risk to the real economy. Despite a sound financial system and normally functioning markets, however, the global contagion affected the growth prospects of the economy. Growth deceleration and the fiscal stimulus In the last two quarters of 2008-09, GDP growth in India decelerated to 5.8 per cent, driven by sharp moderation in private consumption demand and weakness in investment demand, primarily on account of the impact of heightened uncertainty on consumer and investment 6 BIS Review 116/2009 
confidence. Given the capacity already created for about 9 per cent growth, decline in aggregate demand widened the output-gap (i.e. the actual fell below the potential), which warranted adequate expansion in Government demand to moderate the pace of the slowdown. This, though, involved deliberate temporary deviation from the fiscal consolidation process embodied in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act. The deviation from the fiscal consolidation path was evident from the revision to the Centre’s fiscal deficit target from 2.5 per cent of GDP in the budget to 6.2 per cent in the budget for 2008-09. The combined fiscal deficit (Centre and States), including the special securities issued to oil marketing and fertiliser companies, reached 10.7 per cent of GDP in 2008-09. The net market borrowings of the Centre and States jumped to Rs.3.46 trillion (7.0 per cent of GDP) in 2008-09 from Rs.1.66 trillion (3.8 per cent of GDP) in 2007-08. The expansionary fiscal stance had to be sustained in 2009-10 to support a faster economic recovery, which was reflected in further increase in budgeted net borrowing programme (of the Centre and states taken together) to Rs.5.38 trillion in 2009-10. The Reserve Bank, as the manager of the borrowing programme of the Government, has ensured smooth completion of the large borrowings so far, and its accommodative monetary stance, given the subdued demand for credit from the private sector has largely helped in this regard. To help in faster recovery, revival in demand for credit from the private sector would be important, and the RBI has been highlighting to the commercial banks the need for improving the flow of credit for all genuine productive activities, without compromising on credit quality. Certain counter-cyclical regulatory changes have also been effected to support this objective, which include reduction in general provisioning requirement, relaxation on risk weights for certain assets, and temporary restructuring option for certain loans. The emerging policy challenges and the balance of risks to the growth outlook Early return to the fiscal consolidation path, and exit from the expansionary fiscal and accommodative monetary policy remain the key challenge. The challenge has to be seen, however, in the context of the ultimate objective, which is faster and durable recovery in growth. The costs of delay in timely exit are being discussed now; but there are costs of delay in economic recovery as well. The policy choices are becoming increasingly complex for the RBI, as signs of recovery in growth are still tentative, whereas inflation is clearly firming up.  In terms of recent signs of improving growth prospects, one could see the recovery in industrial output during April-July 2009, GDP growth for the first quarter of 2009-10 at 6.1 per cent turning out to be better than 5.8 per cent experienced during the last two quarters of 2008-09, higher relative growth in core infrastructure sector during April-July 2009, revival in capital inflows, strong recovery in the stock market over the end March 2009 level, and increasing IPOs with large over-subscription. The downside risks include the impact of the deficient monsoon on agricultural growth, decline in exports for the 10th successive month up to July 2009 because of the persistent global recession, decline in tourist arrivals in August 2009-partly on account of the swine flu fear, and more importantly the rising inflationary pressures that could limit the scope for sustained growth supportive monetary policy stance. The RBI’s current growth outlook remains at 6 per cent with an upward bias. The medium-term objective, though, is to revert to the high growth path of around 9 per cent. This growth trajectory also should be inclusive with low and stable inflation. Opportunities in the post crisis period Every major crisis exposes the limitations and rigidities of the existing systems, thereby creating compelling pressures on the authorities to reform and restructure. This global financial crisis will provide the trigger for major revamping of the financial stability architectures around the world, besides fostering better governance of the globalization BIS Review 116/2009 7 
process and encouraging relevant cooperation among national policy makers. The key areas that could strengthen the financial stability architecture, as agreed in the recent G-20 meeting in London, include: • More and better quality capital as the best first line of defense against financial crisis; introduction of countercyclical buffers during good times to strengthen resilience during bad times; and use of a leverage ratio as an element of the Basel framework while further strengthening the risk based capital requirement.  • Consistent and coordinated implementation of international standards, including Basel II, to prevent the emergence of new risks and regulatory arbitrage, particularly with regard to Central Counterparties for credit derivatives, oversight of credit ratings agencies and hedge funds, and quantitative retention requirements for securitisation.  • Convergence towards a single set of high-quality, global, independent accounting standards on financial instruments, loan-loss provisioning, off-balance sheet exposures and the impairment and valuation of financial assets.  • Stronger regulation and oversight for systemically important firms.  For countries like India and Sri Lanka, the growth opportunities are almost limitless, given our current levels of development from where we have to catch up with the welfare and income levels of the advanced economies. Large sections of the population contribute much below their potential because of lack of opportunities, and if the policy environment could recognize the gaps and provide the right opportunities with appropriate incentives, the growth prospects could improve significantly. A global crisis of this magnitude does not help in creating and expanding opportunities for around more than 2 billion population in the world who live under abject poverty. That is an important reason why countries like India and Sri Lanka must demand a better global governance system to manage the challenges of globalisation. Moreover, the ambitious fail-proof financial stability architecture that may emerge in the post-crisis period should also emphasize financial inclusion, since financial system is a potential key channel for offering the opportunity that could make a large section of the population realise their potential. India has the opportunity to reap the demographic dividend, because of its demography in favour of a large young population; estimates suggest that by 2020 average age of the Indian population could be as low as 30. The demographic dividend, it has been viewed, could become a demographic curse, unless opportunities are created for everybody, with a sense of participation by all in the development process. Finance, therefore, has a key role in addressing this challenge, unlike the role of finance we experienced in the financial systems of the advanced economies where a few could maximize individual returns but easily socialize the costs of their actions. Concluding observations We have a collective responsibility in ensuring a sound and stable financial system, so as to be able to contribute better to sustainable growth and economic development. The link between finance and growth must be strengthened, and we must realise that finance is a means to economic growth and development; it is not an end in itself. The tendency among some to use the financial systems as a casino must be curbed, both through strengthened regulations and better management of distorted incentives among market participants. It is not easy to draw the optimal line between right regulations andfree markets. No regulator would deliberately stifle financial innovations unless the perceived risks outweigh the benefits. In a free market economy, however, financial innovations may be driven by what the market wants, rather than by what may be necessary for the economy. Freedom increases the scope for misuse, but freedom is also necessary for promoting growth and providing opportunities. Financial crises have been the results of actions of human beings, who are driven by greed and the dangerous drive to remain ahead of the peers in the 8 BIS Review 116/2009 
financial market by maximizing returns through destructive financial engineering. No amount of regulatory response, whether at the national or global level, thus, could be a guarantee against future crises as long as human beings have to manage and run the financial systems. Way back in 1936 Keynes had highlighted the role of “Animal Spirit” in human beings, i.e. their spontaneous optimism, the spontaneous urge for action rather than inaction. In 2009, we have now the book by Akerlof and Shiller titled “Animal Spirits: How human psychology drives the economy, and why it matters for global capitalism”, where they highlight the role of “non-economic motives” in explaining the crisis. Much of the prosperity in market economies has been possible because of the animal spirit, and regulations should not suppress animal spirit, just because of the potential risks of instability and crisis. The excesses in the financial systems often create a natural process of creative destruction, which surfaces in the form of a crisis to ensure a forced clean-up of the systems. In the process of evolution of financial systems, regulatory and supervisory architectures help in preventing crises as long as sound principles are generally adhered to. When unsound practices lead to a crisis, the creative destruction process makes the systems not only to recover from the crisis but also to become more robust and full-proof. The global crisis has offered the opportunity to revisit the conventional wisdom in many areas and the future approach to financial sector reforms as well as supervision must be guided by the primary objective of making the financial sector serve the needs of the real economy. I do hope that all of us will take advantage of the opportunities unleashed in various sectors and move towards the direction of “inclusive growth”. Thank you.

Svein Gjedrem: The outlook for the Norwegian economy Address by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), for Norges Bank’s regional network, Region East, Oslo, 25 September 2009. *      *      * Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. The speech is based on the assessments presented at Norges Bank’s press conference following the Executive Board’s monetary policy meeting on 23 September and Monetary Policy Report 2/09. It has been a year since financial turbulence developed into a full-blown crisis. The result was the most severe downturn in the global economy since the Second World War. Key rates were set at historically low levels both in Norway and abroad. Government spending has increased considerably to support demand for goods and services.  Global economic activity is now picking up, albeit from a very low level, and unemployment is high. Financial market conditions have improved, although liquidity remains tight in many markets.  The financial crisis eroded confidence in banks, counterparties and contractual partners. Access to export credit came to a halt, international trade slowed sharply and manufacturing sales stalled.  With financial markets improving over the past six months and an increase in the credit supply, global trade is now picking up slightly. Manufacturing output has recently increased in the US, the UK, Japan and many emerging economies, while it continues to fall – albeit at a slower pace – in Sweden and the euro area.  Growth in public demand, stronger confidence in financial markets and low key rates are fuelling investment abroad. Even though the global economic situation now seems to have stabilised, there is still a risk of continued low growth for a fairly long period ahead.  The severe downturn and fall in commodity prices has led to very low or negative consumer price inflation in many countries. Inflation is still moving down and is now negative in for instance the US, the euro area, Sweden, Japan and China. Core inflation is more stable, but has also shown a slight decline recently. The current low level of activity and high unemployment will also act as a brake on inflation in the period ahead.  One characteristic of the crisis was the substantial increase in money market rates. Confidence between banks evaporated. Banks reacted by raising interest rates on loans to businesses and households. They started to turn off the lending tap.  Measures implemented by central banks and governments have had a stabilising effect. The most important markets have also gradually become less disorderly, with less distrust among participants. The risk that issuers of credit will go bankrupt has diminished. Activity in money and bond markets has picked up and fluctuations are less pronounced.  The situation in the interbank market has improved. The spread between money market rates and expected key rates, which is an indicator of risk premiums in the money market, has decreased. Money market premiums in Norway have also fallen.  Equity markets have risen since early 2009. Fluctuations in equity markets are less pronounced but are still wider than before the market turbulence began. Expected corporate earnings have not changed substantially since March 2009. It is likely that the recovery in equity markets primarily reflects a reduction in uncertainty and lower risk premiums. Oil prices have doubled since the trough in December 2008, reflecting OPEC production cuts and concerns in non-OPEC countries about supply further ahead. In addition, a number of BIS Review 115/2009 1 
market participants expect that oil demand ahead will increase at a more rapid pace than assumed as global economic activity picks up. Expectations of future economic growth are pushing up oil futures prices. Oil consumption is now rising in China but has been very low in western economies. OPEC spare production capacity is still increasing and oil inventories in advanced economies are high. Oil prices have nonetheless held up. Keeping large inventories is profitable when oil futures prices are high. However, the scales are easily tipped. If expectations of higher demand deteriorate, futures prices will fall and, in turn, prices for immediate delivery. Large oil inventories may then push down prices even further.  The krone is floating and fluctuates somewhat. The krone tends to appreciate in good times and depreciate when negative shocks occur in the Norwegian economy. Fiscal policy and the petroleum fund mechanism, however, contribute to maintaining the stability of the krone. This is clearly evident when we compare developments in the krone in recent years with the currencies of other open economies that are major commodity exporters, such as Australia and New Zealand.  In recent months, exchange rate fluctuations have moderated and risk appetite among market participants has increased somewhat. The Norwegian krone depreciated considerably in the second half of last year, but has appreciated somewhat since then. The cost level in the Norwegian business sector, measured by relative wages in a common currency, is now 10 per cent higher than the average in the period we can refer to as the oil age. The level will rise ahead, even if the nominal krone exchange rate should remain unchanged, because wage growth is higher in Norway than abroad. The real exchange rate, measured by developments in consumer prices in a common currency, is in line with a historical average, but may rise ahead as a result of higher inflation in Norway relative to other countries.  Key rates are now close to zero in many countries. Key rate expectations abroad have fallen. Market participants expect a rise in key rates in a number of countries after the turn of the year.  Monetary policy in Norway is oriented towards maintaining low and stable inflation. The operational target is annual consumer price inflation of close to 2.5 per cent over time. The inflation target is an anchor for inflation expectations in the foreign exchange market, for the social partners in connection with wage settlements and for those setting prices for goods and services. In recent years, average inflation has been fairly close to, but somewhat lower than, the target of 2.5 per cent. Consumer price inflation peaked in October 2008 and has since receded. In the year to August 2009, CPI inflation was 1.9 per cent. Inflation measured by the CPI varies somewhat from month to month, primarily reflecting wide fluctuations in energy prices.  CPIXE inflation shows developments in the consumer price index adjusted for tax changes and excluding temporary changes in energy prices. This indicator provides a more accurate picture of underlying inflation. By this measure, underlying inflation peaked at 3 per cent last autumn, but has since slowed somewhat and was 2.3 per cent in August. Underlying inflation is now below the inflation target. Inflation is slowing as a result of the decline in output and wage growth last year and the beginning of this year and is expected to fall to below 2 per cent in early 2010. Inflation ahead will depend on how quickly capacity utilisation picks up and by developments in the krone exchange rate. Activity in the Norwegian economy has held up better than expected just a few months ago. Higher capacity utilisation and low productivity growth may result in stronger-than-expected upward pressure on costs and point towards somewhat higher inflation in the medium term.  2 BIS Review 115/2009 
The financial crisis and the global economic recession have had a substantial impact on the Norwegian economy, and a range of measures have been implemented to mitigate the effects of the crisis. These measures prevented the liquidity crisis from developing into a solvency crisis in the banking sector and a crisis in the real economy in Norway.  Norges Bank has supplied additional liquidity to banks and eased collateral requirements. The Bank has provided loans with longer maturities, used foreign exchange swaps for both USD and EUR to supply krone liquidity and provided loans to Norwegian banks in USD, which Norges Bank can now procure from the Federal Reserve. The key policy rate has been reduced by 4.50 percentage points since 15 October last year to 1.25 per cent. To facilitate banks’ funding, the government has given banks access to liquid government paper in exchange for mortgage-backed securities issued by the banks’ mortgage companies. The Government has also provided increased loans and guarantees to Norwegian export industries, and has raised lending limits for state banks. Folketrygdfondet (the Government Pension Fund – Norway) has also been permitted to increase its purchases of bonds. The authorities have arranged to supply risk capital to Norwegian banks through the Norwegian State Finance Fund to strengthen banks’ solidity. In order to curb the fall in activity in the Norwegian economy, government expenditure will increase by more than 10 per cent in 2009. The measures implemented by Norges Bank were tailored to a situation in which financial markets no longer functioned. Now, banks and companies are again able to obtain funding in the market. The arrangement whereby banks can exchange covered bonds (OMF) for government securities has made a substantial contribution to securing long-term funding for banks. The first signs that the covered bond market was beginning to reopen became evident in spring. The minimum price in the swap arrangement is therefore now being adjusted to the interest rate that seems to be forming in the market. The arrangement can then be phased out in the course of the autumn.  Over the past year, there has been a substantial need to provide liquidity to banks.  In addition, underlying structural liquidity in the banking system, i.e. liquidity excluding Norges Bank’s liquidity operations, has been negative in recent years.  Structural liquidity is influenced by ingoing and outgoing payments to and from the Government’s account in Norges Bank and is expected to increase ahead, primarily because the Government largely finances lending to state banks, payments to the Norwegian State Bond Fund and the Norwegian State Finance Fund by drawing down deposits in Norges Bank. Banking system demand for loans from Norges Bank will then decrease considerably. In most countries, the financial crisis led to a crisis in the real economy. Fiscal policy measures were gradually implemented as it became clear how strongly the financial crisis was affecting economic activity levels. Many governments have accumulated substantial debt. With few exceptions, all the advanced economies were already in a net debt position and many are now facing funding problems related to an aging population. If the global economy is to recover from the crisis, government debt must be stabilised fairly soon in order to prevent a string of crises in state finances. Norway is in a unique position due to government petroleum revenues.  Monetary and fiscal policy have stimulated domestic demand and output. Growth in mainland GDP was higher in the second quarter than projected in the June Monetary Policy Report. Household consumption seems to be picking up again.  Petroleum industry activity has also had a stabilising effect on the Norwegian economy. There are plans to develop a number of oil fields on the Norwegian continental shelf in the years ahead, but it is likely that these investments will require an oil price of more than USD 60–70 per barrel to be profitable.  BIS Review 115/2009 3 
The events of September 2009 spread rapidly to the firms in Norges Bank’s regional network. In August 2009, manufacturing enterprises reported that growth would hold up. In November, the turnaround was described as a “heart attack”.  Norges Bank established its regional network in 2002. Regular interviews provide information about enterprises’ assessment of the economic outlook before other official statistics are available. This information is therefore an important part of the decision-making basis in the formulation of monetary policy.  Statistics Norway’s quarterly national accounts are available about 50 days after the end of the quarter. The regional network provides figures for the same quarter far earlier. In 2008, the regional network was able to provide clear evidence that mainland output fell markedly in the fourth quarter as early as December of the same year. National accounts figures for the fourth quarter were published more than two months later, on 19 February 2009. Employment in Norway has held up well through the downturn. It appears that unemployment will be considerably lower than expected. Seasonally adjusted registered unemployment was 2.9 per cent in August. Over the past year, the level of unemployment has risen most in the counties of Aust-Agder, Sør-Trøndelag, Østfold and Vestfold and least in Sogn, Akershus and Finnmark. Unemployment is highest in Oslo, at 3.9 per cent in August. Unemployment may be low because firms have chosen to retain their employees. Perhaps firms are opting to keep a certain labour reserve because of recruitment problems and high costs experienced during the previous cyclical turnaround. Higher government expenditure has contributed to holding up public sector employment. Unemployment may move up if global developments deteriorate and have a stronger impact on output in Norway.  Between 1000 and 2000 new jobseekers from other countries are still being registered each month, even though work permits were no longer required for nationals from new EU countries as of 1 May for work lasting less than three months. The level of registered work permits, however, seems to have stabilised over the past year. Inward migration flows are lower than in the period to summer 2008, but have not come to a complete halt.  In 2009, the loss of confidence among banks also affected household mortgage financing. Banks no longer provided bridging loans. Housing turnover fell, but has now picked up again.  House prices are rising after a sharp fall in the second half of 2008. Last autumn it was important to restart the housing market, which will also gradually provide the basis for a potential recovery in residential construction. However, the revival in house prices is not a positive development. The level of house prices in Norway is very high and the additional rise that has now occurred will only increase the potential fall.  Developments in Norway, and to an even greater extent in other countries, show that economic policy instruments are not perfect. The interplay between credit and property prices in particular poses challenges. Interest rate setting influences this interplay only indirectly. The interest rate rises in good times when inflation is expected to increase and falls when growth and inflation moderate. The interest rate is an approximate instrument, which can be used to keep inflation in check over time and thereby stabilise output and employment.  In a small, open economy such as Norway’s, the exchange rate is important for inflation and the level of activity. There is therefore little leeway for setting the interest rate specifically with a view to influencing property markets and credit growth. Attempts to tighten monetary policy in the growth period from 2003 to 2008 would, for example, have resulted in higher capital inflows, a noticeably stronger krone and a decline in manufacturing, even lower inflation, higher growth in real wages and more foreign currency loans to households and enterprises. The rise in credit and house prices would probably not have been affected to any extent. In 4 BIS Review 115/2009 
addition to housing market euphoria, the Norwegian krone would have been considerably overvalued for a period. According to Norge Bank’s bank lending survey, banks continued to tighten credit standards for enterprises while credit standards for households remained virtually unchanged in 2009 Q2. Banks expect approximately unchanged credit standards for both enterprises and households in 2009 Q3. Banks reported a further fall in credit demand among non-financial corporations in 2009 Q2. Credit demand in the enterprise sector is expected to stabilise in Q3. Household credit demand was approximately unchanged in Q2, while banks expect increased household credit demand ahead. Financial market turbulence since summer 2007 resulted in a sharp increase in interest rates, reaching a peak in 2009 Q1. Premiums have decreased substantially since then, but are perhaps not yet fully normalised.  Bank lending rates on loans to enterprises averaged 8 per cent at their highest in 2008 and have now moved down to 4¾ per cent, although margins have also increased here.  Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided in June that the key policy rate should be in the interval ¾-1¾ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 28 October 2009, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks.  In the assessment forming the basis for its monetary policy decision of 23 September, the Executive Board placed emphasis on underlying inflation, which is now below the inflation target. The krone has appreciated and will, in conjunction with continued low imported inflation, contribute to keeping inflation below target in the year ahead. This suggests that the key policy rate should be kept low for a period ahead.  Growth in the Norwegian economy has picked up at a more rapid pace than was expected a few months ago. High activity in the oil industry and monetary and fiscal policy measures have contributed to supporting demand for goods and services. Employment is stable and it appears that unemployment will be considerably lower than expected, despite the decline in manufacturing and the building and construction industry. Low interest rates are contributing to renewed growth in household consumption. Higher capacity utilisation and low productivity growth may increase upward pressure on costs, pointing towards somewhat higher inflation and suggesting that the key policy rate should be raised earlier than projected in the June Monetary Policy Report. On balance, it was appropriate to keep the key policy rate unchanged at this meeting, although the Executive Board considered the alternative of increasing the key policy rate. Thank you for your attention.     BIS Review 115/2009 5

Kevin M Warsh: Longer days, fewer weekends Speech by Mr Kevin M Warsh, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the 12th Annual International Banking Conference, Chicago, Illinois, 25 September 2009. *      *      * Recent media stories and more substantial works chronicle in great detail the events of the past couple of years.1 A pair of conclusions might be fairly drawn from these early drafts of history. One, the financial market turmoil of the past year proved to be of significant consequence to the economy. And two, the Federal Reserve distinguished itself from historical analogues by taking extraordinary actions to address risks to the economy. The commentary, however, tends to part ways as to whether the extraordinary actions undertaken were to the good or the detriment of the U.S. economy in the long-run.  As my fellow members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and I stated earlier this week, economic activity has picked up, conditions in financial markets have improved further, and longer-term inflation expectations are stable. Nonetheless, the second anniversary of the onset of the financial crisis – and about a year from the darkest days of the Panic of 2008 – is no time to declare victory, scarcely the moment to hand out medals.2 I cannot help but think of the strong but weary athlete who, after a morning swim, embarks upon a grueling cycling contest to a rising din of cheers and a smattering of boos…only to be reminded that he is participating in a triathlon, and that he has a long run still before him.  In my view, it is unwise to prejudge the Fed's policy strategy – or to declare the victor or the vanquished – by the split time, however notable it might be. We are at a critical transition period, of still unknown duration, and we must prepare diligently for an uneven road race ahead. If policy is not implemented with skill and force and some sense of proportionality, the success of the overall endeavor could suffer.  Judgments made by policymakers in the current period are likely to be as consequential as any made in the depths of the panic. That means policymakers should continue to communicate as clearly as possible the guideposts, conditions and means by which extraordinary monetary accommodation will be unwound, including the removal of excess bank reserves.3  It also means that policymakers should acknowledge the heightened costs of policy error. The stakes are high, in part, because the policy accommodation that requires timely removal as the economy rebounds is substantial. And our policy judgments will ultimately prove worthy of the accolades, and tender the ultimate rejoinder to their critics, if we rise to meet this heightened responsibility. I am confident we will.                                                  1  The views expressed herein are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of other members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or of the Federal Open Market Committee. I am grateful for the valuable assistance of Daniel Covitz, Eric Engstrom, Nellie Liang, and David Reifschneider of the Board staff who contributed to these remarks. 2  See Kevin Warsh (2009), "The Panic of 2008," speech delivered at the Council of Institutional Investors 2009 Spring Meeting, Washington, April 6, 2009. 3  See Ben S. Bernanke (2009), "Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress," statement before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, July 21, 2009; and Ben S. Bernanke (2009), "The Fed's Exit Strategy," Wall Street Journal, July 21, 2009. BIS Review 115/2009 1 
The final recounting of economic history, I submit, will judge that winning the battle against the Panic of 2008 was a necessary but insufficient condition to win the peace and ensure a strong foundation for economic prosperity. That outcome will require that policymakers have equal parts capability, clairvoyance and courage, perhaps the most important of which is courage.  For those of us at the Federal Reserve, the task ahead involves longer days, but in all likelihood, fewer weekends. While the undertaking is as challenging as any we faced in the preceding period, it is exceptionally well suited to the Federal Reserve's comparative advantages of deliberation, dispassion, and a determination to make judgments based on the long-term interests of the U.S. economy.  The task ahead Economic histories in the United States and elsewhere are packed with examples in which the monetary authorities, with the overwhelming benefit of hindsight, may have misjudged the communication, timing or force of their exit strategies. In some cases, policymakers may have waited too long to remove easy-money policies. In other cases, policymakers may have acted too abruptly, normalizing policy before the economy was capable of self-sustaining growth.  Errors of each sort are neither uncommon nor unexpected in the normal conduct of monetary policy. During normal turns in the business cycle, the consequences of policy error to the broad economy tend to be meaningful. Forgone output. Higher unemployment. Threats to price stability. None of which are – or should be – acceptable to the Federal Reserve, or to the broader body politic. And the current environment is anything but normal. There are uncertainties regarding the trajectory of the economy recovering from a major financial crisis and a deep recession. Equally, there are uncertainties about the performance of the monetary transmission mechanism and the operation of the Federal Reserve's unconventional policy tools. A nimble, even-handed approach toward our risk-management challenges will prove necessary.  Monetary policy rules have for some time served as an alluring guide for policymakers, particularly at transition points when guidance is especially useful. In particular, the Taylor rule has proven to be informative in describing, if not prescribing, how a central bank might adjust its interest rate policy instrument in response to developments in inflation and macroeconomic activity.4 But, to make the outputs operational, we need reasonable conviction in the reliability of our estimates of current resource utilization and inflation or, for some alternative rules that have been proposed, forecasts of these model inputs.5 And it is these kinds of estimates that appear especially uncertain during this period of economic history, emblematic of the challenging task ahead. Policy rules and models alike tend to presume average historical responses, incorporating typical transmission effects and normal market functioning, which may not fairly capture the current state of play.  Nonetheless, policymakers strive to answer the following questions: How is the economy currently performing relative to its long-run potential, and is this likely to change in the next few months? Where is inflation now relative to its desired level, and what are the prospects for an acceleration or deceleration in prices in the near-term? Will changes in the federal funds rate interact with financial conditions and affect future real activity and inflation                                                  4  John B. Taylor (1993), "Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice." Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy 39, December, 195-214. 5  Athanasios Orphanides (2007), "Taylor Rules," Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2007-18 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, January). 2 BIS Review 115/2009 
consistent with past practice? Or have these interactions changed, with implications for both the outlook and the conduct of policy?  It may be, for example, that potential output has fallen by virtue of the panic and its aftermath. If the resulting economy proves less adaptive, for example, the natural rate of unemployment may well threaten to move upward, implying tighter labor markets at higher unemployment rates, and lower potential output. These estimates are especially difficult to ascertain given the uncertain contour of the financial architecture and the greater-than-usual reallocation (and risk of misallocation) of labor and capital across sectors.  Of course, countervailing risks could cause a mark-up in economic potential that cannot be dismissed: Productivity gains may turn out to be larger and more enduring than we expect, and the remarkable resiliency of the U.S. economy could defy skeptics as it has done repeatedly in the post-World War II era.  Data in the past couple of months show continued improvement in real economic performance. In combination with the repair in financial markets, the outlook for gross domestic product (GDP) in the next few quarters appears better, improving the odds of a more enduring positive feedback loop arising from market developments and real activity.  Nonetheless, the medium-term risks to the outlook are still disquieting. Policies, broadly defined, that purport to bring stability to the macroeconomy could risk lowering output potential over the horizon.6 The uncertainty of the capital and labor reallocation process, a global trade environment in transition, and a shifting regulatory environment represent downside risks. The possibility that we fail to accurately gauge the resulting changes in economic and inflation prospects – by virtue of the remarkable, iterative changes in private sector practices and public policy prescriptions – is a foremost risk for policymakers. In this environment, we should maintain considerable humility about optimal policy.  Preliminary, provisional, subject to revision, condition-dependent forecast I just sought to describe the challenges in conducting monetary policy in this environment. That should caution us to steer clear of ironclad policy prescriptions. Nonetheless, I would hazard the view that prudent risk management suggests that policy will likely need to begin normalization before it is obvious that it is necessary, possibly with greater force than is customary, and taking proper account of the policies being instituted by other authorities. Allow me to elaborate on each of these three items.  First, when will the Fed's extraordinary policy accommodation demand removal? The central banker's standard reply, to which I would associate myself here, fits the bill: When conditions warrant. The FOMC stated on Wednesday that "economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period." Although it just might be a central banker's rationalized excuse for not knowing, I genuinely believe that more precise timing is unknowable.  In my view, if policymakers insist on waiting until the level of real activity has plainly and substantially returned to normal – and the economy has returned to self-sustaining trend growth – they will almost certainly have waited too long. A complication is the large volume of banking system reserves created by the nontraditional policy responses. There is a risk, of much debated magnitude, that the unusually high level of reserves, along with substantial liquid assets of the banking system, could fuel an unanticipated, excessive surge in lending.                                                  6  See Kevin Warsh (2009), "Defining Deviancy," speech delivered at the Institute of International Bankers Annual Meeting, New York, June 16. BIS Review 115/2009 3 
Predicting the conversion of excess reserves into credit is more difficult to judge due to the changes in the credit channel.7Financial market developments bear especially careful watching. They may impart a more forward-looking sign of growth and inflation prospects than arithmetic readings of stimulus-induced GDP or lagged composite readings of inflation. The rapid, global revaluation of asset prices – in both directions – has served as a hallmark of the past two years. Monitoring this trend, and gauging its durability, will demand keen judgment. If asset prices find a new and enduring equilibrium, market participants and policymakers alike may well gain additional comfort that the real economy is poised for sustainable recovery. However, if asset prices retrace their recent gains, the real economy would be adversely affected.  Understanding risk premiums embedded in asset prices will be critical to this task. In general, risk premiums across asset classes fell significantly in the past six months, but remain elevated, roughly consistent with prior recession periods. Some portion of the decline in premiums and the concomitant run-up in equity prices, for example, can be fairly ascribed to the abatement of tail risk that became apparent during the panic. Option prices across broad equity market indexes show a substantial markdown in the likelihood of a substantial market correction.  But, the broad and continued ascent in equities appears increasingly to reflect a new judgment about the modal outcome for economic growth and corporate earnings. If it turns out that equity risk premiums continue their recent trajectory, real economic performance would be bolstered further by sturdier household, business and financial firm balance sheets.  It is not just the trend or level of asset prices that should inform policymakers. Correlations of asset prices across markets also provide important insights. In times of panic, historic correlations break down and commonality predominates. Those firms and individuals with purportedly "well-diversified portfolios" going into the panic bore painful witness to this truth. During extreme conditions, sharp swings in investor sentiment often dominate changes in relative valuations and, for a time, limit the degree to which financial markets effectively allocate credit.  This breakdown in historic correlations is not unique to the onset of panics. It may predominate when panic conditions are in retreat. For instance, in the past couple of months, U.S. stock market indexes and corporate bond prices both moved meaningfully higher, while Treasury yields and the foreign exchange value of the dollar fell. These movements are difficult to reconcile with historical experience or by ascribing them to changes in the modal growth path for the economy. Rather, this odd constellation of movements in asset prices may indicate changes in investor preferences and in the distributions of outlooks for inflation and growth. It would be more reassuring to growth and inflation prospects in the coming months if asset prices were to signal a clearer, more reliable message.  Second, how might the policy response evolve?  Many of the programs created during the panic were designed to atrophy – due to their changing relative attractiveness in price and other terms – as market conditions improved. This natural unwinding has proven largely successful. As a result, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet composition has changed in recent months, even while the overall balance sheet size has remained relatively constant.                                                  7  See Kevin Warsh (2008), "The Promise and Peril of the New Financial Architecture," speech delivered at the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York, November 6, 2008. 4 BIS Review 115/2009 
Several of the Fed's non-traditional programs to provide monetary stimulus were established under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed's governing statute. The Congress authorized the Federal Reserve to lend to non-depository institutions, as the programs do, only under "unusual and exigent circumstances." The judgment that the 13(3) standard is no longer satisfied would cause an unwinding of nontraditional policy tools by the Fed, and presage a normalization of policy.8  Ultimately, when the decision is made to remove policy accommodation further, prudent risk management may prescribe that it be accomplished with greater swiftness than is modern central bank custom. The Federal Reserve acted preemptively in providing monetary stimulus, especially in early 2008 when the economy appeared on an uneven, uncertain trajectory. If the economy were to turn up smartly and durably, policy might need to be unwound with the resolve equal to that in the accommodation phase. That is, the speed and force of the action ahead may bear some corresponding symmetry to the path that preceded it. Of course, if the economy remains mired in weak economic conditions, and inflation and inflation expectation measures are firmly anchored, then policy could remain highly accommodative.  "Whatever it takes" is said by some to be the maxim that marked the battle of the last year. But, it cannot be an asymmetric mantra, trotted out only during times of deep economic and financial distress, and discarded when the cycle turns. If "whatever it takes" was appropriate to arrest the panic, the refrain might turn out to be equally necessary at a stage during the recovery to ensure the Fed's institutional credibility. The asymmetric application of policy ultimately could cause the innovative policy approaches introduced in the past couple of years to lose their standing as valuable additions in the arsenal of central bankers. Third, how might U.S. monetary policy be affected by other macroeconomic policies? Monetary policy is not conducted in a vacuum. The Federal Reserve, and other monetary policymakers, will be keen observers to the judgments made by the fiscal authorities around the world. Central bankers will necessarily take account of these judgments. Financial markets' affection for decoupling – that is the disassociation of U.S. economic prospects from the rest of the world – tends to wax and wane. My own views on the subject are less ephemeral. Our prospects for economic growth are highly correlated with the prospects of our large trading partners. And if fiscal, regulatory and trade policies diverge or deteriorate, economic prospects globally could suffer. But if the better path prevails – that born of the past couple of generations of economic dynamism, positive-sum trade flows, fiscal sustainability and regulatory best practices – we will emerge from this crisis with a stronger, more integrated global economy and more resilient financial markets.  Monetary policy convergence has proven remarkable, and remarkably constructive, throughout the crisis. When the removal of accommodation begins in earnest, we should be alert to see if this trend continues.                                                  8  This standard represents a prudent framework from which responsibility is delegated to the central bank. The grant of authority from the Congress is standards-based with clear limits and bounds. It might serve as a useful model worthy of broader application in the ongoing debate about regulatory reform.

Njuguna Ndung’u: Kenya’s vision for a strong and accessible financial sector Remarks by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, during the 2009 Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) Global Policy Forum, Nairobi, 14 September 2009. *      *      * The Right Honourable Prime Minister of the Republic of Kenya, Mr. Raila Odinga; The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance of the Republic of Kenya, Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta; Permanent Secretaries here present; Dr. Alfred Hannig, Executive Director, Alliance for Financial Inclusion; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen: Right Honourable Prime Minister, let me thank you most sincerely for gracing this important Forum. Your personal presence demonstrates the seriousness with which the Government of Kenya takes the role of the financial sector in the process of our nation’s economic development. May I also heartily thank the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) for choosing to host its inaugural Global Policy Forum in Nairobi. This is indeed a very great honour to our country. I also warmly welcome all the Forum participants and hope that in the course of the next three days, we shall have fruitful discussions and emerge with smart policies to expand global financial inclusion. In this respect, I am delighted to be part of the Forum and to champion its course. Mr. Prime Minister, this Forum is jointly hosted by the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) and the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). The CBK is a member of the AFI Steering Committee. The AFI has over 60 member countries that account for the majority, nearly 70 percent, of the world’s “unbanked” population. AFI’s vision is to expand financial services to at least fifty million people across the globe living on less than two dollars a day by 2012. The AFI currently concentrates on six policy areas, namely, Agent Banking, Mobile Phone Banking, Diversification of Financial Service Channels and Providers, State Bank Reforms, Financial Identity and Consumer Protection. AFI’s mandate, however, will be widened as need arises. All these thematic areas, which AFI champions are relevant to our country and are key to our financial sector if it has to become “a vibrant and globally competitive financial sector” as stipulated in Vision 2030. A strong and accessible financial sector is a key ingredient in Kenya’s vision of becoming a middle income country by the year 2030. As a country we are matching on towards all these fronts that AFI espouses. The government in the current fiscal year 2009/10 proposed to introduce branchless banking. This will enable banks to provide their services through Agents with wide distribution networks and therefore legalizing Agent Banking and reducing costs of financial services. There has been a significant reduction of the proportion of our population that remains unbanked from 38% in 2006 to 33% in 2009 according to the national financial access surveys conducted by the CBK and Financial Sector Deepening (FSD) Kenya. This reduction in the unbanked is greatly attributed to the contribution of mobile phones as a channel for money transfer. The recent Financial Access Survey also indicates that the proportion of our population accessing banking services increased from 19% to 23% between 2006 and 2009. However, 33% of the population still has no access to any form of financial service and 27% access financial services from the informal financial sector. Despite the progress we have made towards expanding financial access, the majority of Kenyans still lack access to formal financial services. We are therefore keen to draw on the wealth of experiences that are brought to the table by participants in this Forum. We will, over the next three days, share BIS Review 114/2009 1 
experiences on smart financial inclusion policies that have worked elsewhere. We will thereafter adopt these policies to suit our respective countries as we work together to push forward the global financial access frontiers. Mr. Prime Minister, this Forum also comes at a time when the global economy is suffering a slow down, with economic activities weakened considerably. Although there are signs of improvement, we are yet to see full recovery. Globally, policy actions taken to mitigate the crisis have been geared towards maintaining effective and well functioning financial systems and to reinforce their resilience in order to guard their integrity. We have acted accordingly to ensure that our financial system remains sound, secure, stable, accessible and trusted. We are in constant vigilance that this remains the case and any action necessary to achieve this will be undertaken. With these few remarks, it is now my pleasant duty and honour to welcome the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance to make a few remarks and to welcome you to address this Forum. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minster for Finance, you have the floor. 2 BIS Review 114/2009 
L Wilson Kamit: Opening up opportunities for agriculture and rural development Address by Sir L Wilson Kamit, CBE, Governor of the Bank of Papua New Guinea, to the Consultative and Implementation Monitoring Council (CIMC), 2009 National Development Forum on “Opening Up Opportunities for Agriculture and Rural Development”, Port Moresby, 5 August 2009.  *      *      * Distinguished guests,  Ladies and gentlemen  May I firstly thank the organizers of this conference for the invitation to speak on the financial sector in Papua New Guinea. I was asked specifically to comment on the financial sector’s outreach to rural areas and low income households.  Let me start by briefly talking about the macro economy. Acting Secretary Tosali has already mentioned most of these developments.  Macro economy  Papua New Guinea has, over the last five years, benefited significantly from the export commodity price boom as it resulted in fiscal surpluses, record international reserve levels, reduced total public debt and sustained real GDP growth. In the same period there was a substantial financial sector reform, which commenced in 2000, that contributed to a sound and prudently managed financial system and aided economic growth.  The sound and prudent management of our financial institutions is reflected by the high capital adequacy ratios, a liquid banking system, low level of non-performing loans, and funding of loans by the banking system from deposits rather than from borrowings from overseas. The Central Bank authorized financial institutions also remained highly profitable.  Prudent monetary and fiscal policies between 2003 and 2007 and a co-ordinated approach in their management also contributed to stable exchange rates and price stability (low inflation) and improved confidence in the domestic economy. Together with the low interest rate environment, this led to a significant increase in lending to the private sector, with a growth of between 30-40 percent during the period. The removal of foreign exchange controls, particularly on lending to non resident companies also supported the strong growth.  Agriculture sector  The agriculture sector continues to be an important one for Papua New Guinea, providing employment and income-earning opportunities for a large number of our people, sustaining the livelihood of many and providing foreign exchange inflows. This sector contributed 33 percent to the country’s overall GDP, according to the most recent official National Accounts from the National Statistical Office, which is for 2006 (see chart 1). The value of agricultural exports in the March quarter of 2009 was K406.8 million, 16.4 percent of total exports (see chart 2). This is down from K659.0 million or 17.3 percent in March 2008, and partly reflects the impact of the global financial crisis and the economic recession in the major industrialised countries.  BIS Review 114/2009 1 
  Despite its significance to the local economy, financial resources channeled to the agriculture sector remains dismal. Commercial banks’ lending to the agriculture sector, excluding forestry and fisheries, totaled K147.7 million in the March quarter of 2009, which was 3.1 percent of total lending. This compares to K104.1 million and 4.0 percent of total lending in March 2008. These amounts compare poorly against lending to the other sectors of the economy, including commerce (retail and wholesale trade), manufacturing, transportation, construction and services such as hotel and real estate (see chart 3).  2 BIS Review 114/2009 
 The financial sector reforms have created the foundation for an efficient and sound financial system that assist the course for stability and growth, which provides an opportunity for the financial sector to introduce new financial products that are suitable for the Papua New Guinean economy. The new area of banking that has been successful in several developing countries is electronic or mobile money banking. Electronic banking products have enabled banks to capture the un-banked population, provide financial literacy and significantly reduce the cost of banking. Mobile phone banking and branchless banking operating through agents have become a norm to bring banking services to the rural areas. The fragmented characteristics of the PNG economy suggest that mobile money or electronic banking is the way forward to provide financial services to the mass in the rural areas.  The rapid economic growth in the last five years has created opportunities for bank expansion. The increase in business activities requires commercial bank presence in respective regions of the country. The presence of a fully licensed conventional bank can increase the efficiency of the financial intermediation process and promote economic development. However, many banks have indicated that some of the branches are unprofitable due to the high cost of operations. To circumvent the high cost of running full branches, the commercial banks have expanded the net work of ATMs and EFTPOS, which has complemented branch net work and in some instances have become substitutes for branches to a limited extent. The existences of ATMs and EFTPOS have made banking easier and efficient in the rural areas.  However, these developments will not succeed if:  • Infrastructure is not in place for investors to build on. Mobile banking and branchless banking requires transport, power, and communication infrastructure. E.g. Namatanai sub-branch of a bank closed down due to communication and power problems and failures. I recently visited Dogura. There is no mobile phone communication link between Dogura and Alotau in the Milne Bay province.  • Law and Order/Security issues are a serious concern. The law and order problems have caused the banks to reduce the size of their representations throughout PNG. BIS Review 114/2009 3 
Over the years, banks had to close down in provincial centres. The closure of branches in Popondetta twice in the last few years is an illustration.  • An alarming law & order issue is the threat to staff of financial institutions. Officers and families of staff employed in the financial system should not be placed in situations of psychological stress and anxiety caused by unsavoury elements of our society. The cases of kidnapping and threatening staff and their families is a problem that must stop. Bank staff must be allowed to contribute to the development of our nation without threat or intimidation in carrying out their duties.  Microfinance  Microfinance institutions and development orientated institutions are important vehicles for involving those at the bottom of the pyramid to become financially included. The rapid growth of microfinance institutions over the last few years have began to make a positive contribution to providing banking services to those in the rural area and the informal sector of the economy. Under the BFIA, 2 microbanks were licensed by the BPNG and they continue to expand their branch network and outreach to rural areas and informal sector, which were previously under-banked. To expand this outreach further into the remote rural areas, the PNG-ADB Microfinance Project is piloting linkages of 3 rural groups to the Nationwide Microbank. This linkage involves provision of financial literacy and banking services to the members of these 3 groups, and will form the basis for expanding these arrangements to other areas of the country.  Traditionally, savings and loans societies in Papua New Guinea have been the vehicle for providing financial services to members who do not have access to banking services in the rural areas. Two types of savings and loans societies; provincial based societies and employer based societies. The provincial based societies have extensive branches at the provincial level, particularly to those in rural areas, while the employer based societies provide least expensive financial services to members of that institution.  The savings and loans movement in Papua New Guinea have grown significantly over recent year in assets value. Total assets increased to K730.3 million as at end of March 2009, from K232.9 million as at end of December 2004. The growth in asset values reflects good performance by the Board and Management of those institutions and on-going supervision by the Central Bank. Membership also increased significantly from 131,000 in 2004 to 216,000 as at end of March 2009.  The National Development Bank (NDB) is an important development institution that provides credit to development projects such as those in the agriculture sector. Development lending is usually targeted towards individuals with low capital and longer grace periods for the repayment of loans. Efforts to commercialize the NDB from its mandated function may not assist in achieving the developments objectives of the Government.  Payments system  The Central Bank is also undertaking a strategic project to improve the payments system of Papua New Guinea. An efficient payment system is therefore a vital component of a modern economy and society.  Conclusion  Ladies and gentlemen, in an environment where many banks and financial institutions around the world affected by the global financial crisis are contracting, it is pleasing to note that we in Papua New Guinea are still expanding. Our banking system is sound, liquid and prudentially managed and is prepared to take on the challenges offered in the advent of 4 BIS Review 114/2009 
global financial crises, the fast pace of private lending growth, development of the LNG project and a changed risk landscape of PNG. Everyone must play its part in upholding these hard fought gains.  Thank you. BIS Review 114/2009 5 
Spencer Dale: Separating fact from fiction – household balance sheets and the economic outlook Speech by Mr Spencer Dale, Executive Director and Chief Economist of the Bank of England, at a lunch hosted by the Exeter Chamber of Commerce, Exeter, 24 September 2009. I would like to thank Andrew Benito, Rohan Churm and Richard Williams for their considerable help in preparing these remarks. The views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of other members of the Monetary Policy Committee. *      *      * I would like to thank the Exeter Chamber of Commerce for this invitation to speak to you today. I have strong ties to this part of the country. My family moved to Exmouth when I was 16. My father still lives in Exmouth and my parents-in-law in Exeter. So I visit here often. Exeter was the place that I first studied economics. My family moved to Devon just after I had completed my “O levels” and I studied for my “A levels” at Exeter college, just a few minutes walk from here. In fact after today’s lunch, I am going back to Exeter college to see my old economics tutor – who still teaches “A level” economics – and to spend some time meeting the current students. So it is a real pleasure to be here. The economy appears to have turned. Following the extraordinary falls in output at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, output appears to have stabilised. And the most recent output data and business surveys suggest that we are likely to see positive growth in the second half of 2009. These indicators have prompted numerous headlines declaring an end to the recession. In a strict, technical sense that may be right – we may be moving into a period in which positive growth is resumed. But I would caution against drawing too much comfort from those headlines. Even if output does expand in the second half of this year, for many families and businesses it may still feel like we are in the economic doldrums. Unemployment is likely to continue rising for a period and firms will still face sluggish demand. The recovery may be slow and protracted. This caution is often characterised as the Bank being gloomy. But I fear that misses the point. Let me be clear, compared with the situation we faced only six or nine months ago, the economic outlook has improved significantly. Output is no longer in free fall, the banking system has stabilised, confidence levels have improved, and the risk of a really bad economic depression has receded. To repeat, the economy appears to have turned an important corner on the road to recovery. But we are only just starting along that road. The level of national output is estimated to have fallen by around 5.5% over the past year – the largest four-quarter fall experienced in the post-war period. Employment has also fallen substantially. These falls have resulted in a significant degree of economic slack opening up in the economy. Firms are operating below normal capacity; increasing numbers of people are unable to find jobs. This slack detracts from our well-being. And, if it persisted, would pull inflation down well below 2% – the target that I and my colleagues on the Monetary Policy Committee are mandated to aim for. To meet our target, we need to see a sustained period of robust growth that brings the level of activity better into balance with the supply capacity of our economy. It is a recovery in the levels of output and employment that matters, not just a return to positive growth. BIS Review 114/2009 1 
The turnaround in growth is underpinned by the extraordinary loosening in monetary policy undertaken by the Monetary Policy Committee over the past 12 months. Only a year ago, Bank Rate was still at 5% and quantitative easing was something we had studied only from afar. Since then, Bank Rate has been cut to an historical low of 0.5% and the Bank is a significant way through a programme of asset purchases totalling £175 billion. Economic activity is being supported further by the easing in fiscal policy, the substantial depreciation in sterling, and by the fact that the inventory adjustment appears to be beginning to run its course. But there are a number of headwinds that are likely to slow the pace of recovery. Credit conditions remain tight as banks repair their balance sheets. And the global nature of the economic downturn further highlighted the need for a rebalancing of trade flows between countries with large current account surpluses and deficits. Both adjustments are likely to occur only gradually and each has the potential to derail the recovery. I want to spend a little time today considering a third factor that will shape the recovery: the extent to which households need to rebuild their balance sheets following the big increase in household debt. Spend, spend, spend? Much has been said about the increase in household debt, both in terms of its role in the build up to the financial crisis and the extent to which it may dampen the recovery. The theme of much of this comment is that our current economic difficulties are a payback for past excesses. Households, it is said, were seduced by easy credit and rising asset prices, leading to a debt fuelled spending boom. As a result, we now face a period of retrenchment as we make amends for our former spendthrift ways. Like much conventional wisdom, these views contain a kernel of truth. But their repetition has led to exaggeration and distortion. Separating fact from fiction is vital when forming a view on the economic outlook. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total demand in our economy; decisions made by consumers up and down the country will be critical in determining the strength and sustainability of the recovery. A natural place to start would be with the “consumption boom”, which is often presumed to have preceded the bust. But in fact there was no such boom. Between the turn of this century and the onset of the financial crisis, consumer spending increased no faster than it had done, on average, over the past 40 years.1 Moreover, the fraction of our national output consumed by households did not increase. The kernel of truth in the consumption boom story is that changes in the distribution of our national income meant that this stable growth of aggregate consumer spending was associated with a sharp decline in the household savings ratio. The proportion of income that households set aside fell from close to 10% in 1997 to a little over 2% ten years later. Although there was no spending boom, households were making less provision for the future. Where did all the debt go? But how does the absence of a spending boom fit with the headlines about the rise in debt. The big increase in household debt over the past decade is certainly not a myth. Household                                                  1  Consumption growth was, however, unusually strong in the period 1996-2000. My colleague Andrew Sentance has stressed the importance of analysing trends in consumption over longer periods (eg Sentance 2007). 2 BIS Review 114/2009 
debt as a proportion of income increased from 100% to 165% in the 10 years to 2007. If this big run up in debt was not used to finance a surge in spending, where did it all go? The answer to this question lies in developments within the housing market. House prices trebled in the ten years to 2007. And mortgage debts were accumulated to pay for the housing that had become so much more expensive. The conventional wisdom that the sharp increase in household debt was associated with the house price boom of the past decade is well founded. But what is less often appreciated is that much of that rise in household debt was matched by a comparable increase in the value of financial assets held by households. The value of housing assets purchased by households did increase, through additions and improvements to the housing stock. But the main counterpart to the rise in borrowing was increased saving. To make this point more concretely: while households accumulated an additional £1trillion of debt between 2000 and 2008, they also acquired over £750 billion of financial assets over the same period.2What was going on? To caricature things only a little, older households (or rather those trading down within the housing market) benefited from selling homes at much higher values. They were the winners. The big losers were younger households (or those trading up), paying more for those houses and accumulating higher debts. The money borrowed by young families ended up in the bank accounts of older households. That money wasn’t used to fuel a spending boom. Rather, it was left on deposit or used to invest in other financial assets. The huge increase in borrowing by one part of the population was broadly matched by a big increase in saving by another part. The increase in house prices over the decade to 2007 – and the massive financial flows associated with that appreciation – represent a huge redistribution of wealth between different households within our society. Two important points should be drawn from this episode. First, any analysis of the increase in household debt over the past decade has to pay equal attention to the record accumulation of financial assets. They are two sides of the same coin. Second, changes in house prices do not result in significant changes in aggregate household wealth: for every winner gaining from higher house prices is a loser facing less affordable housing. But that does not mean that changes in house prices can not have significant implications for the macroeconomy. House price changes may directly affect aggregate spending both through their effect on the value of housing collateral, and hence on the ability of households’ to access credit, and through the different propensity of winners and losers to spend their “windfalls”. A debt hangover? Even though the accumulation of debt was not driven by excessive consumption spending, the sharp falls in asset prices associated with the financial crisis have led to a marked deterioration in households’ financial position – assets are worth less but the debts still need to be repaid. The market value of households’ financial and housing assets has fallen by over 10% over the past two years. Does this mean that there is some form of hole in households’ balance sheets that will weigh on the recovery as they seek to repair it?                                                  2  This increase reflects purchases of assets. It does not include the returns from these investments. BIS Review 114/2009 3 
Any real or perceived need for households to rebuild their balance sheets may play an active role in determining their levels of spending.3 For example, the cost of financing debt and the uncertainty about future employment prospects may make households reluctant to exceed a certain level of net borrowing. In this case, the deterioration in the financial position of some households may cause them to spend less in order to repay debt or increase savings. The “payback period” I mentioned earlier. This possibility has focussed much recent attention on the state of households’ balance sheets. But standard measures of households’ financial position – such as the ratio of debt to assets – may exaggerate the severity of the problem. That is because these conventional measures suffer from a “missing” asset and a “missing” liability. Let me explain. The “missing” liability is the cost of purchasing a house in the future. This argument is directly related to the redistribution argument I discussed earlier. Measured in conventional terms, the marked decline in house prices seen over the past two years has led to a pronounced deterioration in households’ balance sheets: house prices have declined by around 15% but the value of outstanding mortgage debt is largely unaffected. The lower level of house prices will eventually be reflected in a lower level of mortgage debt than otherwise as first-time buyers (and those trading up the housing ladder) enjoy the benefits of more affordable housing. But this effect will not fully materialise until the entire housing stock is turned over at the new lower price level, which may take a considerable time. In the meantime, not taking account of this missing liability exaggerates the deterioration in households’ underlying position. Moreover, by considering only the fall in prices of housing and financial assets, we could be exaggerating the extent to which people are actually less wealthy. For some households, these are their only form of assets. This is most obviously the case for the retired. But the largest asset owned by most people is not measured at all. It is the value of what they expect to earn in the future or, what economists refer to as “human capital”. Most estimates suggest the value of future earnings is significantly greater than the sum of net financial wealth and gross housing assets which typically forms the basis for balance sheet measures.4 The significance of this missing asset is that, even though recent events may have impaired households’ future income prospects, the scale of this reduction is likely to be significantly less than the falls seen in financial wealth.5And it is important to remember that households may opt to mitigate the fall in their wealth not only through greater saving, but also by working more. Labour demand has, of course, weakened during the recession and with it the number of hours worked has fallen. But even if households are not able to increase their supply of labour now, they may plan to do so in the future, perhaps by delaying their eventual retirement. This may still help to moderate the extent to which spending falls in the near term.                                                  3  Simple textbook models which tie consumption to permanent income would not predict this sort of behaviour. However, models which recognise imperfections in financial markets are often consistent with this type of behaviour, particularly when the effects of uncertainty are explicitly considered. For a discussion of consumption and saving theory see Berry, Waldron and Williams (2009). For a discussion of interactions between household debt, house prices and consumption, see Benito, Waldron, Young and Zampolli (2007). 4  For example, Bakhshi (2000) estimated that the value of future earnings (human wealth) represented around 80% of household wealth, whereas net financial wealth and gross housing assets together represented around 20%. 5  The sum of households’ net financial and gross housing wealth has declined by over 10% since the start of the crisis. In contrast, external estimates of the loss of supply capacity as a result of the recession, to which the fall in human capital is likely to be closely related, are around the 4-5% range. See, for example, HMT (2009) and IMF (2009). 4 BIS Review 114/2009 
None of this is to deny that households’ balance sheets have been affected by recent falls in wealth. But the extent of that deterioration and hence the pressure on households to repair their balance sheets might be exaggerated by failing to take a more comprehensive view of their assets and liabilities. Nevertheless, it is clear that, even putting balance sheets to one side, the financial crisis has affected households and families in ways that have caused them to spend less. Most directly, the recession has led to a pronounced weakening of the labour market, with employment falling and incomes squeezed. The recession and the sharp rise in unemployment may also have led households to revise their beliefs about the stability of the economy and with it the predictability of their own incomes. The period from the early 1990s up to the financial crisis has been dubbed by economists as the Great Moderation. The UK economy enjoyed over 60 consecutive quarters of positive economic growth accompanied by low and stable inflation. It is possible that some households planned on the basis that this increased economic stability would persist indefinitely. If so, the events of the past two years would have come as a substantial shock. Households’ consumption has slowed sharply since the beginning of 2008. Indeed, consumption is estimated to have fallen for the past five consecutive quarters, the first time this has happened since records began in 1955. Relative to an average rate of increase, the level of consumer spending has fallen by around 7½% since the start of 2008, and the savings rate has increased sharply. There has already been a considerable adjustment in households’ spending. In the near-term, the prospects for consumption depend importantly on the performance of the labour market. Although there has been a substantial fall in employment over the past year or so, the size of this adjustment to date has, if anything, been less than we might have feared given the falls in output. This may partly reflect the greater degree of wage flexibility that has been apparent in this recession compared to that in either the 1980s or 1990s.6 This greater flexibility has meant that more of the burden of firms’ adjustment to the recession has been spread over the workforce as a whole, rather than on those losing their jobs. This may help to mitigate the slowing in consumption, both because households may find it easier to borrow to smooth their consumption if they still have a job and because it may limit the extent to which households increase their savings as a precaution against the possibility of future job losses. Further out, the prospects for consumption will depend importantly on the extent to which the deterioration in households’ financial position does indeed cause them to scale back their spending. As I have argued, there are good reasons for thinking this may happen. But it is also important to remember that there has already been a substantial adjustment in consumption; and that conventional measures of household balance sheets may exaggerate the scale of deterioration. Policy Let me conclude with a few remarks on policy. The current focus of monetary policy is on ensuring that there is sufficient stimulus in the economy to generate the strong and sustained recovery necessary to bring demand better into balance with supply and so ensure that inflation is on track to meet the inflation target. As I have said, the structural adjustments that need to occur – to the structure of the banking system; to the balance of global trade flows, and to the level of public and possibly                                                  6  For more information see the box on page 29 of the August 2009 Inflation Report. BIS Review 114/2009 5 
household debt – have the potential to delay and derail the recovery. But monetary policy can not – and should not – seek to prevent those adjustments. They are necessary for the long-run stability of our economy. Rather the job of monetary policy – and of public policy more generally – is to ensure that these adjustments occur in an orderly manner and within an economic environment which is consistent with hitting the 2% inflation target. Because it is new and untested, there is understandably considerable nervousness about the Monetary Policy Committee’s asset purchase programme – a.k.a. quantitative easing. How is it supposed to work? Will it work? The essence of the asset purchase programme is to increase the supply of money and credit in the economy. An important point to stress is that the success of the programme does not depend on banks returning to a position in which they are able to lend normally. The policy works by supplying money directly into the economy, not through the banks. Much of the money is being injected by purchasing government bonds from institutional investors, such as insurance companies and pension funds. These purchases encourage investors to switch their portfolios away from gilts into corporate bonds and equities, so improving the supply of credit to businesses. Companies’ access to credit is further enhanced by the Bank’s purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds, which improve the functioning of these markets. But is it working? The objective of the asset purchases is to increase the growth of nominal spending. As with changes in interest rates, it will take some time before we see the impact of our purchases feeding through into higher aggregate spending and inflation. However, there are some encouraging signs that the medicine is working. The growth of underlying broad money has picked up in recent months, especially relative to the weak growth rates we might otherwise have seen. Interest rates have fallen. Corporate bond spreads have declined substantially. And the amount of finance raised by companies in bond and equity markets is at record levels. Not all of these developments can be attributed solely to our actions. But I have no doubt that asset purchases have played an important role. At our policy meeting in August, the Monetary Policy Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and to increase the scale of our asset purchase programme to £175 billion. That level of Bank Rate and scale of asset purchases were maintained at the MPC meeting earlier this month. You may have notice that at our meeting in August there was a split vote amongst the Committee. A majority of the Committee – including myself – voted to increase the asset purchase programme to £175 billion, whereas a minority preferred a larger expansion to £200 billion. It is important not to make too much of this difference; all members were of the view that a further degree of monetary stimulus was needed to meet the inflation target. My own judgment was that the uncertainty surrounding both the economic outlook and the effects of asset purchases made it difficult to have a strong view as to the relative merits of increasing the asset purchase programme to £175 billion or £200 billion. Indeed, the inflation projection that was published in the August Inflation Report suggested that either policy was consistent with hitting the inflation target, depending on the future path of interest rates. For me, the decision came down to an assessment of the risks of doing too much versus the risks of doing too little. With regard to the potential risks of doing too little, my main concern was that nominal demand would not recover to a level consistent with hitting the inflation target. My main worry with doing too much stemmed from the uncertainty associated with using asset purchases as a policy instrument. We do not have much experience of conducting monetary policy via asset purchases and there is a risk that their effects will be transmitted through the economy in ways we do not predict and do not want. For example, the substantial injections of liquidity might result in unwarranted increases in some asset prices that could prove costly to rectify. I placed considerable weight on both risks and thought that they were best balanced by an expansion of the programme to £175 billion. 6 BIS Review 114/2009 
I am hopeful that we have started along the road to recovery. The journey is likely to be long and not without difficulty. But the Monetary Policy Committee stands ready to do whatever it takes to ensure that the economy moves into better balance and inflation remains on track to hit the target.

José De Gregorio: Monetary policy and financial stability – an emerging markets perspective  Presentation by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, at the Brookings Institution, Washington DC, 17 September 2009. *      *      * It is a pleasure to participate in this meeting and to speak about the lessons for monetary policy the current crisis is teaching us. The big difference between the current crisis with previous ones in emerging economies is that this time “it was not our fault.” The evidence on the performance of emerging countries facing an unprecedented global downturn shows that some lessons have been properly learned. Today I would like to concentrate on inflation targets, especially in the context of strongly rising and strongly falling commodity prices, financial stability and exchange rate fluctuations. Many of the issues I will be discussing today I have covered in recent presentations elsewhere. Indeed, there is not much new material, but I think those are important issues in conducting monetary policy in emerging countries. 1.  The causes of the crisis: was it monetary policy or was it financial fragility? The argument blaming monetary policy for the current crisis claims that low interest rates combined with large current account surpluses in emerging economies, particularly Asian and oil-exporting ones, created an abundance of liquidity that triggered excessive increases in asset prices (bubbles). This was particularly acute in the housing market. When the bubble burst, the crisis erupted. Then, this argument claims that the housing bubble was caused by monetary policy, which failed to act opportunely and permitted severe imbalances to accumulate. Nonetheless, one must bear in mind that soaring asset prices do not necessarily end up in a crisis like this one. Closer attention must be paid to the financial fragility that accompanied this process, whose main culprit was the unrestrained financial innovation that generated deep distortions that neither markets nor regulators were able to predict. An expansionary monetary policy can undoubtedly induce an excessive increase in the prices of assets and credit. The ultimate role of monetary policy is to smooth the business cycle and control inflation.1 Therefore, it is possible to think that a very expansionary monetary policy, more so than that needed to reach the inflation target, can exacerbate an economic boom. Moreover, such a policy will have serious consequences on output once the monetary impulse is withdrawn. However, an expansionary monetary policy could not explain by itself the severity of the financial collapse and the global recession the world is seeing today. There are countries where monetary policy was expansionary, with interest rates at their minimum, and no housing bubble nor financial collapses occurred. A couple of examples are Canada and Chile, two inflation targeters where, consistently with this policy framework, interest rates hit very low levels not so different from the Fed Funds rate (Figure 1). Still, housing prices generally did not experience increases comparable with those of other economies, and their financial systems have remained sound. Furthermore, in some cases housing prices did go up high, with clear indications that there was a bubble. However, their financial systems made it through and remained stable and,                                                  1  A flexible inflation targeting regime balances the cost of output fluctuations with those of inflation instability, and the result should be a decline in both, output and inflation volatility. For an exposition of this framework and how it relates to the definition of the inflation target parameters see De Gregorio (2009a). BIS Review 113/2009 1 
despite the current difficulties, have avoided acute financial crises. This is the case of, for example, Australia and Spain. Naturally, when facing disproportionate increases in housing prices, both the increase in credit and the boom in construction are symptoms that the downturn will be severe. Still, this need not result in a systemic financial meltdown. In any case, monetary policy can and does help in the creation of bubbles, although not so much by the level of the interest rate but by the monetary policy strategy with which financial turmoil is dealt with. In the United States, the strategy of turning a blind eye to the period of soaring asset prices and then, when the bubble burst, reducing aggressively interest rates used to be the Fed’s strategy (the “mop-up strategy” according to Blinder and Reis, 2005). This approach was first used on the “Black Monday” of October 1987, then with the breakdown of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) and later with the bursting of the high-tech bubble. In all these occasions, once the asset prices reversed down, there was an abrupt relaxation of the monetary policy.2 This implicit insurance, popularly known as the Greenspan put, certainly makes the creation of bubbles more likely. This strategy, which worked in some earlier episodes, failed miserably during the biggest collapse in decades. A monetary policy strategy that used to provide insurance to speculation in episodes of limited financial turbulence proved incapable of confronting a financial crisis of systemic proportions.  This strategy to deal with bubbles is a prescription derived not from inflation targeting, but from a need to insure financial stability. In my view, financial stability must be addressed first with appropriate regulation of the financial system that limits the excesses we saw before the crisis. There may be situations in which it might be appropriate to deviate transitorily from an inflation targeting regime in order to ensure financial stability, but this must be an exception, which in normal times should not arise. I think a first lesson for the conduct of monetary policy is to avoid providing insurance to speculators, which creates enormous moral hazard problems. In emerging countries we have lived this, with much milder consequences, when we attempted to manage exchange rates disconnected from fundamentals for a prolonged period of time.  Therefore, an examination of monetary policy and financial dislocations around the world suggests that the culprit of the current crisis was related more closely with the functioning of financial systems than with monetary policy. One issue that will have to be carefully examined in the future is the cause of the real estate boom and the housing crisis, and why it occurred in the United States. At this point it is clear that lending standards were relaxed beyond reason, and financial innovation went too far.3  2. Inflation targeting and asset prices A corollary of those blaming monetary policy is that, apart from focusing on the variation of the prices of goods and services, it should also take into consideration asset prices, beyond their direct impact on projected inflation. Under an inflation targeting regime, increased lending and asset prices can have repercussions on the inflation outlook, through their impact on the output gap. This would require a monetary policy adjustment to prevent a persistent rise in inflation. Hence, in an inflation targeting regime, asset prices and the level of credit aggregates affect the monetary policy decision to the extent that they affect the inflation perspectives (Bernanke and Gertler, 1999).                                                  2 Interestingly and, according to Blinder and Reis (2005), using Taylor rules as from the first quarter of 1988, the residuals indicate that in all the mentioned episodes the Federal Reserve set the interest rates significantly below those prescribed by the rule. 3  Ellis (2008) shows that in the U.S., households had strong motivation to increase their leverage through tax, legal and regulatory incentives. 2 BIS Review 113/2009 
However, some will argue that monetary policy should react directly to asset prices, for example, by including them in the Taylor rule. Cecchetti et al. (2000) are perhaps the best representatives of this position, claiming that any inflation-targeting central bank should react to asset price misalignments beyond their implications on expected inflation over the policy horizon.  In my view, there are three reasons why monetary policy, in general, should not react to asset prices beyond their impact on projected inflation: • First, it is not clear that an increase in interest rates will be capable of stopping an increase in asset prices. The required adjustments might be so large that they could end up unnecessarily generating high unemployment and an undesired drop in inflation.  • Second, what matters here is to safeguard the stability of the financial system. An excessive interest rate aiming at controlling asset prices could even trigger financial instability, which is precisely what it is meant to avoid, especially if the increase in asset prices is accompanied by higher financial fragility.  • Finally, under inflation targeting, any interest rate movements that are inconsistent with inflation converging to the target may undermine the credibility of monetary policy, destabilizing inflationary expectations, and weakening the effectiveness of monetary policy. This is particularly important in the case of emerging economies with a shorter record of monetary stability.  Another reason that has been put forward to not try to affect asset prices through monetary policy is simply that it is impossible to determine when prices are significantly misaligned with their fundamentals. Although I agree with the fact, I do not think this is a strong reason. Indeed, even though it is difficult to determine when prices are fundamentally misaligned, policymakers should worry about this phenomenon. However, acting through monetary policy may not be the best option, and it is better to look more closely at financial regulation and how to limit the procyclicality of the banking system and build enough cushions for the downturn. This should also reduce fragilities that are generated during the upturn. 3.  Inflation targets, exchange rates and intervention An inflation-targeting regime, where the policy instrument is the interest rate, must operate within a context of a flexible exchange rate. This solves efficiently and unambiguously the well-known impossible trinity for countries financially open, and allows the control of interest rates at a level consistent with the inflationary objective. Adding an exchange rate objective weakens the capacity to control the interest rate, affecting the ability to meet the inflation target. However, the exchange rate generally has effects on monetary policy, since persistent movements of it do affect inflation. In this case, the natural result is a leaning against the wind. When the exchange rate appreciates substantially, it prompts a fall in inflation in the medium term, which results in a reduction in the interest rate. This, in turn, induces pressures for depreciation. However, one must recognize that these are not very significant effects because, in a floating regime, the pass-through coefficient from the exchange rate to inflation is limited.4Emerging economies may feel tempted, after a long history of crises caused by exchange rate misalignments, to keep their currencies depreciated. Managing the exchange rate is, apart from hardly feasible in the medium to long term, risky. In the first place, in less flexible                                                  4  For a recent discussion on the Chilean evidence see De Gregorio (2009b). BIS Review 113/2009 3 
exchange rate regimes, the pass-through from exchange rates to inflation increases, because the level of the exchange rate may become a coordinator of price expectations, given the policymakers’ commitment to exchange rate stability. This, in turn, feeds back to increased pressures to keep the exchange rate stable, thus aggravating the problem. Secondly, a commitment of the authority with exchange rate stability may create perverse incentives to financial risk taking, by artificially lowering the cost of borrowing abroad. This reinforces fear of floating (Calvo and Reinhart, 2002), creating a spiral towards exchange rate rigidity, and deriving in currency mismatches and exchange rate misalignments that the policies were intended to prevent in the first place.  I am not saying that attention must not be paid to the exchange rate beyond its effects on inflation. The exchange rate is an important determinant of resource allocation, and hence, excessive deviations from fundamentals may create distortions. However, I think a sensible way to address signs of severe misalignments, beyond the leaning against the wind with monetary policy, is through sterilized intervention. But, in order for this to be effective and coherent with the inflation targeting framework, some conditions must be met: • In the first place, it must be consistent with the inflation target, in order for the intervention not to jeopardize the credibility of monetary policy.  • Secondly, to safeguard monetary policy independence, once the intervention is announced, it must be implemented mechanically. All this shields the conduct of monetary policy, typically carried out in regular pre-established meetings, from the extraordinary decision of buying or not buying foreign currency. In particular, the sterilization of intervention decisions permits to preserve both the credibility and the independent management of monetary policy.  • Finally, and because of this sterilization requisite, the cost of intervention must be properly considered, because it entails a quasi-fiscal component that could be significant. The Chilean experience last year was in line with the aforesaid principles. It was done in a moment where there was clear evidence of misalignment with respect to the levels deemed consistent with long-term fundamentals. It was also totally consistent with the inflation objective, and started at a moment – April 2008 – in which there were rather benign inflation figures that revealed a smaller risk of unwanted inflationary propagation. Towards midyear it was even possible to raise the interest rate substantially to tackle a surprise rise in inflation that was much deviated from the target. This was so thanks to the fact that the purchase of dollars was being carried out mechanically, despite a significantly depreciated exchange rate after the intervention. The purchase of foreign currency was concluded prematurely due to global tensions in global liquidity in dollars in September of last year. The capacity of the Chilean economy to subsequently deal with a significant exchange rate depreciation, with monetary easing prospects and reduced inflationary pressures, is proof that there was no inconsistency between the decision to intervene and the conduct of monetary policy (Figure 2). It also shows that the flexible exchange rate regime adopted early this decade has the economy well prepared to absorb exchange rate fluctuations without the turmoil that used to come with them in the past. 4.  Bubbles, exchange rates and capital inflows in emerging economies Latin America went through a period of large capital inflows in the first part of the 1990s (Calvo et al., 1996). We cannot disregard the possibility that after the current crisis is over, there will be a reemergence of inflows to emerging economies. Therefore, there could be strong pressures for a sharp increase in the valuation of domestic assets, with a potential bubble in their prices, and this bubble could take the form of an exchange rate appreciation.  4 BIS Review 113/2009 
To begin this discussion, I should emphasize that capital inflows to capital-scarce economies are a good thing. We know that capital flows to institutionally strong economies are beneficial (Prasad et al., 2002). Therefore, the role of policy is not to impede capital flows, but to avoid the creation of a bubble in domestic assets with consequences on resource allocation.5 In this regard, to have in place sound prudential regulation during periods of abundance of capital is essential for financial stability, as we are reminded by the crisis in Chile in the early 1980s, the Mexican crisis of the mid-1990s, the Asian crisis, and more recently, the crisis in Eastern Europe. Even if one could accept that monetary tightening could be an appropriate response to combat an asset price bubble such as the recent housing price bubble, with all the caveats I discussed before, the problem is more acute in small open economies. Tightening monetary policy may have perverse effects, since it induces further capital inflows and strengthens the currency. In this case, the interest rate is not the most adequate instrument with which to burst the bubble.  Indeed, the perverse dynamics are as follows: high interest rate differentials induce capital inflows to arbitrage those differences; then policymakers strive to avoid the appreciation, which in general is thought to be transitory, since the sustainability of exchange rate management is limited; the incentives for inflows increase as not only the interest rate differential is large, but also the expectations of appreciation; finally, the appreciation takes place, which validates the expectations of arbitrageurs. This process goes for a while and may be accommodated gradually or ended by a sudden stop. In this process there are “excess” inflows and “excess appreciation”, and the issue is how to avoid those excesses.  According to the simple dynamics I have just described a first line of defense to avoid excess fluctuations of capital flows is to maintain exchange rate flexibility. This prevents investors from speculating against an authority that will be defending the parity only transitorily. Moreover, by introducing volatility it increases the risks of a one sided bet on the exchange rate.  An inflation commitment may also help to stabilize flows. As I discussed before, massive inflows that appreciate the currencies will result in a loosening of monetary policy that should reduce the incentives for carry trade. In contrast, if capital inflows generate a boom of activity, without inflationary consequences due to the appreciation of the currency, there could be the temptation to tighten monetary policy, aggravating the problem of massive inflows. To control expenditure without increasing pressures on the exchange rate, fiscal policy should help.  A credible inflation target with a flexible exchange rate regime should help to avoid the problems we faced during the 1990s. Indeed, during the period of large capital inflows, no monetary policy in Latin America operated under a full-fledge inflation targeting regime, and most countries had some form of exchange rate rigidity. Despite having a flexible exchange rate and an inflation target in place, the effects on the exchange rate could reflect that domestic asset prices could be forming a bubble. In this case, sterilized intervention, without an explicit objective on the level of exchange rate, can also help. I already discussed some principles to guide sterilized intervention within an inflation targeting framework. A much debated proposal is the use of capital controls. The                                                  5  In addition, a traditional concern is that with the same speed as capital flows in, capital may flow out, generating costly adjustment processes. See Cowan et al. (2007) for a review of sudden starts and sudden stops around the world. Sudden stops of inflows are as common in developed as in emerging countries, but in the former, the sudden stop tends to be offset by a return of domestic capital invested abroad, while in the latter it results in a severe squeeze in the capital account. Accumulation of reserves or another form of insurance should help to avoid large swings. BIS Review 113/2009 5 
evidence on their effectiveness is elusive.6 Effectiveness is also severely impaired as domestic financial markets have reached some degree of development and integration with the rest of the world. With hindsight from the current crisis, one can think that rather than controls, what is needed is a prudential regulatory framework to avoid speculation and high risk taking in the banking system. 5.  The rise and fall of inflation In this section I will review inflation behavior in Chile, a country that had the sharpest increase in inflation among emerging economies in the run up of commodity prices, but also the largest decline since the crisis erupted (Figure 3). The most remarkable component of the inflationary process of 2007-2008 was how strongly the increase in international food prices was transmitted domestically. Inflation rose from a y-o-y rate of 2.6% in December 2006 to 9.9% in October 2008. Then, it declined to -1.0% in August 2009. What accounts for the steep rise in inflation? It may partially be due to Chile’s high degree of commercial openness. There are practically no barriers to imports, no widespread protection of agriculture, nor any large-scale distortions in the market pricing mechanism, so changes in external prices are quickly reflected in the domestic market. In fact, at least during the greater part of 2007, growing inflation was mostly caused by increasing food prices, rather than by a widespread inflationary process (Figure 4).7  The 2007-2008 food price shock was partially considered to be a one-off change in global relative demand and supply, such as the increased use of biofuels that should have no severe medium-term inflationary implications. However, with inflation rising, the monetary policy rate (MPR) was raised by 125 basis points in the second half of 2007, in order to mitigate undesirable second-round effects of the supply shocks (Figure 5). 8By early 2008, the inflationary situation was still a complex one, but risks had decreased, and inflation was expected to reach its target thanks to the monetary policy actions already in place, lower world growth and a strengthened peso. Trend inflation tempered and monetary policy remained unchanged. During this period we decided to initiate a process of reserve accumulation. Nevertheless, halfway through the second quarter of 2008, the inflation path radically changed; the inflationary trend resumed, unexpectedly, with monthly inflation reaching more than 1%. The risks of inflation remaining above the target beyond the policy horizon also grew strongly. Consistently, monetary policy also had a strong reaction. The MPR was increased by 200 basis points in just four months. By September 2008, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Central Bank estimated that it would be necessary to raise the MPR further, even above market expectations.  Finally, inflation reached its 9.9% peak in October. It is still early to determine with a great degree of certainty the strong and sudden propagation of foreign shocks on domestic                                                  6  For a review of the Chilean experience, see Cowan and de Gregorio (2007). The only empirical study that found some effects of reducing the extent of the appreciation is Edwards and Rigobon (2009), however the magnitude of such effect is small, since the elimination of capital controls from its maximum would have appreciated the exchange rate between 2 and 2.5%. In any case, it is useful to remind that the most appreciated real exchange rate in the last 20 years in Chile occurred in 1997, year in which there were capital controls, massive reserve accumulation, an exchange rate band and high interest rates. 7  Another factor underlying inflation pressures and a deceleration of growth was the higher cost of energy. Not only had thermoelectric power plants to operate with more costly inputs, but also unfavorable hydrological conditions and the shortage of natural gas implied that these more efficient sources of generation had to be replaced by diesel. 8  For simulations on the monetary policy response to an oil shock see Desormeaux et al. (2009). They conclude that the response should be moderated when the shock is transitory and policy is credible. A much stronger response is suggested by Batini and Terenau (2009). 6 BIS Review 113/2009 
inflation. Inflation propagated to most prices, so core inflation also increased sharply. The output gap increased slightly during the third quarter,9 although domestic demand was growing strongly (Figure 6). The exchange rate did not add significant inflationary pressures. Perhaps, the sharp increase in oil prices – which came close to 150 dollars per barrel – caused a generalized rise in domestic prices. A strong demand and a large cost shock may have induced an unusual fraction of price-setters to adjust prices, despite the fact that the output gap did not change significantly. However, if this had been the case, prices should have remained more stable rather than experiencing a sharp fall after commodity prices started falling. As in most of the world economies, financial tensions were severe after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Interest rates in both peso and dollar markets posted substantial increases in the most stressful times from mid-September to mid-October 2008 (Figure 7). The Central Bank acted quickly, providing peso and dollar liquidity facilities to the financial system to ensure resource availability would foreign loans become scarce. These facilities, which will be in place throughout 2009, have not been used extensively by financial institutions, reflecting their sustained access to external markets. This is an example of how monetary policy can react to mitigate financial turbulences without affecting the path of monetary policy considered to be consistent with the inflation target. Beyond the stressful episodes in local money markets, the world financial crisis and its aftermaths in the real sector have caused a significant drop in domestic demand and economic activity. Lending standards have certainly tightened, but the Chilean economy is far from suffering the problems that other countries are facing.  Accordingly, the inflation outlook changed significantly, while monetary policy reacted with a change that was large in magnitude and swift in implementation. October 2008 was the month where y-o-y inflation peaked. November brought some relief, largely determined by the drop in fuel prices in world markets. By then, no break in the inflationary trend was foreseen. Nonetheless, given the weakening outlook for activity and inflation, the Central Bank not only did not raise the MPR – which was the most likely path of monetary policy as discussed in September’s Monetary Policy Report presented to Congress – but also communicated that the most likely course of action would be an easing of policy by early 2009.  In January 2009, with a clearer assessment of the reduced inflationary pressures, the MPR was lowered by 100 basis points. Later, with the evidence of alleviated inflationary pressures and drastic increases in downward risks to growth and inflation, the Central Bank decided to cut the MPR by 250 basis points at both its meetings of February and March. The monetary easing process continued and completed 775 basis points in seven monthly meetings, bringing the MPR to 0.50%, the minimum level deemed adequate for a normal functioning of money markets. In addition, the Central Bank adopted some non-conventional monetary policy measures, extending the overnight liquidity facility for banks at the MPR to 180 day tenors and cutting the issuance of 1- and 2-year Central Bank bonds. It has been also announced that the MPR will be held constant at this minimum level for a prolonged period of time, and that it will use with flexibility all the monetary policy tools at hand, which goes way beyond setting the MPR every month. Several lessons and challenges arise for the Chilean experience. First, the volatility of inflation has been very large. This could be explained by the severity of the shocks hitting the economy, but this is not so clear when comparing with other countries. Although it was argued that indexation could be resuming and inflation would stay high, the turnaround was impressive, and hence, it is not clear how persistence has evolved, and it is difficult to                                                  9  The output gap is actual output minus potential output; hence, an increase refers to a rise above potential output. BIS Review 113/2009 7 
explain with a simple linear adjustment. It could be argued that the change in inflation is due to the impact on inflation of the widening of the output gap. However, the output gap changed little when inflation was rising, and the current decline cannot be explained by the current narrowing of the output gap.10 We used to think that the output gap, as a proxy for marginal cost, is what affects inflation, but the Chilean experience was more of a large swing in the growth of domestic demand rather than output. However, the connection from domestic demand to inflation is less clear than that of the output gap. Finally, the degree of openness and competition in the Chilean economy may increase the sensitivity of prices to demand conditions. More work would have to be done to fully understand the dynamics of inflation, but still the inflation targeting framework has been very useful to conduct monetary policy and to stabilize inflationary expectations. 6.  Concluding remarks Although more often than not, central banks have an explicit financial stability objective, for many years, and within a context of strong GDP growth and sound balance sheets of banks and firms, this was a second-class issue. Now things have changed dramatically. As of last year, financial stability became the protagonist in monetary policy management in developed countries.11  Central banks need to oversee price stability and financial stability. To pursue two objectives, one instrument, namely the interest rate, is not enough. Indeed, a well functioning financial system strengthens the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. There may be exceptional occasions in which both objectives may collide, for example when monetary policy requires an increase in the interest rate, while financial stability calls for a reduction. Another example could be a bubble in the exchange rate with high inflation. In the context of monetary policy in an inflation targeting regime, those situations could be accommodated by escape clauses. But, more in general both objectives should be addressed with more than one instrument. The overall purpose of financial stability is to ensure the proper functioning of markets and to avoid having to arrive at the degrees of turbulence and dislocation we have witnessed in the past year. For this reason, financial regulation plays a major role in granting financial integrity. At the beginning, regulation focused on the strength of individual institutions. However, the tensions we have seen show how individual fragility may quickly evolve into systemic problems. The interrelationships among financial institutions and the proper operation of the markets where liquidity is traded are essential ingredients of a market economy, but these characteristics are also the channels of financial contagion, as recently seen. So it is crucial to have a systemic vision, not only from the perspective of how the different institutions relate to each other, but also on how the different types of financial and operating risks are intertwined, creating potential vulnerabilities. Regarding price stability, conducting monetary policy within an inflation targeting scheme is appropriate, and recent experience shows that it may provide ample room for expansionary policies when facing a global recession such as the current one. There will be a long debate and a number of research papers on the proper mechanism to secure financial stability and how it should be combined with monetary policy management. However, the current                                                  10  For example, the output gap fell between 8 to 10 percentage points, which could explain, without lags, a decline of about 3 to 4 percentage points in inflation, by applying textbook Phillips curve or more complex estimations (Brayton and Tinsley, 1996) for the US, which are not very different from those of Chile. The actual decline in inflation in Chile has been about 10 percentage points. 11  The Fed does not have an explicit financial stability objective, although its role in this matter is widely known. See, for example, Plosser (2007). 8 BIS Review 113/2009 
experience in many emerging markets is a demonstration that the objectives of financial stability and price stability can be preserved even under extreme tensions.  In sum, conducting monetary policy through an inflation targeting regime, with flexible exchange rate, clear mechanics for exceptional sterilized intervention only when there are clear signs of misalignments, a countercyclical fiscal rule, and a strong financial regulatory framework has worked quite well to mitigate the effects of the worst crisis the world has faced in several decades.

L Wilson Kamit: Financial sector reforms in Papua New Guinea Speech by Mr L Wilson Kamit, CBE, Governor of the Bank of Papua New Guinea, at the opening of new the ANZ Harbour City Head Office, PNG, Port Moresby, 24 July 2009. *      *      * Mr Garry Tunstall, ANZ Managing Director North West Pacific, Mr Vishnu Mohan, Incoming ANZ Managing Director North West Pacific, Thank you, University of Music – Kaugere Thank you for the invitation to officiate at the opening of ANZ’s new head office and branch. I wish to make some comments on the banking and financial system before we start on the existing part of the programme. Legislative and policy changes At the turn of this decade, PNG embarked on a comprehensive structural reform process, which was supported by the international multilateral financial institutions and the bilateral friends of PNG. One aspect of the reform program was to broaden the scope and improve the effectiveness of financial sector regulation, drawing on international best practices. The reforms: • Gave full responsibility to the Central Bank for licensing and supervising authorised deposit taking institutions, superannuation funds, fund managers, life insurance companies and life insurance brokers; • Strengthened information gathering and investigative powers; • Enables and instills good governance, transparency and accountability of institutions; • Enables vetting of directors and senior managers of authorised financial institutions; and • Effectively prohibits pyramid schemes which have been a major problem in recent times. There is an “open invitation” for opening up banks and financial institutions in Papua New Guinea as long as one observes the licencing requirements. In essence, an applicant must: • Have sufficient capital and have ready access to shareholders funds and resources if needed. It is NOT sufficient to wait for funds from the shareholder when an institution comes under stress. • Management experience in banking and finance. • The applicant and its affiliates must be solvent. • Have the plan to offer financial services including opening up of branches and agencies. These licencing requirements are essential to enable the entry into the financial system of Papua New Guinea of the serious, the committed and the resilient development parties who are prepared to continue to invest and expand in Papua New Guinea. These licencing requirements are essential to “keep out” the inept and inept practices that will threaten the soundness of the banking and financial system. Our own experiences of the lost decade “the 1990’s” attests to this stance. Under the reforms, the Bank of PNG had to shut down a major bank, liquidate 86 savings and loan societies and oversee a number of financial institutions manage and trade themselves back into business. The process is still BIS Review 113/2009 1 
continuing with a small number of institutions still under Statutory Management or In Liquidation. The financial sector The reformation of the financial sector created the foundation for financial stability which has led to rapid economic growth unprecedented in PNG. The financial sector has seen major transformation in asset size since 2000. Total assets of the financial system grew from under K4.0 billion in 2000 to over K20.0 billion as at end of March in 2009, with the banking system maintaining 65.2 percent of the market share, authorized superannuation funds (ASFs) account for 26.4 percent, savings and loans societies 4.1 percent, licenced financial institutions (LFIs) of 3.2 percent, and life insurance companies (LICs) of 1.1 percent. Consistent with the rapid increase in asset size, return on assets and equity of the banking sector increased significantly following the reforms. Banks in PNG remain one of the most profitable in the region. The financial sector reforms assisted significantly in preventing the domestic banking system from the adverse effects of the global financial crises. The successful aversion was also due to the following factors: • Lending by the commercial banks virtually funded domestically by deposits from the public; • The banking system is well funded with ample liquidity and has a stable interest rate environment; • Effective financial system supervisory framework which emphasis on the maintenance of capital adequacy, low level of non performing loans, good corporate governance and management gave confidence to the economy; and • Sound fiscal management by the government, including debt retirement program provide private sector confidence; Improvement in the sovereign risk rating of PNG from BB to BB+. The above factors reflect that an effective regulatory framework, sound fiscal and monetary policies and adherence to basic principles of banking can safeguard the financial system from the adverse effects of external banking or financial crises. Papua New Guinean economy The fast pace of private sector credit growth and the development of the LNG have changed the landscape of risk profile in PNG. The following are risks which are most likely to affect the banking system in the short and medium term. Despite the global financial crises, the PNG economy has performed relatively well in the last 5 years on the back of high international commodity prices, and prudent management of fiscal and monetary policies. The economy grew at an average rate of 5-6 percent in real GDP terms between 2004 and 2008, leading to an improvement in balance of payments position and record international reserves adequate for 9-11 months of import cover. However, there are challenges we still have to face: 1. A significant decline in commodity prices can have an adverse impact on the economy through a fall in producer incomes, increase fiscal deficit, lower investments and increase public borrowing. Decline in incomes can lead to an increase in non performing loans in those sectors and undermine soundness of the financial system; 2. The possibility of a delay in the development of the LNG project can result in asset quality issues of the banking system. 2 BIS Review 113/2009 
3. Financial institutions can introduce risk in their operations through imprudent management practices. These include credit, operations, and market risks. Credit Risk is the threat of default by borrowers and transactional counterparties as well as the loss of value of assets due to deterioration in credit quality. Operational risk is the threat of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events, including legal risk, while market risk is the threat of loss due to movement in prices on the holding of interest bearing securities, equities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivative instruments. 4. The Central Bank must ensure that it maintains supervision standards that will ensure a continuing sound financial system. There is no room for complacency or special dispensation for participants in the financial system. Opportunities Despite the risks, the financial sector reforms have created the foundation for stability and growth, which provides an opportunity for the financial sector to introduce new financial products. The new area of banking that has been successful in several developing countries is electronic or mobile banking. Electronic banking products have enabled banks to capture the un-banked population, provide financial literacy and significantly reduce the cost of banking. Mobile phone banking and branchless banks operating through agents have become a norm in many countries to bring banking services to the rural areas. The rugged terrain, remoteness of many communities and the fragmented characteristics of the PNG economy suggest that mobile money or electronic banking is the way forward to provide financial services to the mass in the rural areas. The rapid economic growth in the last five years has created opportunities for bank expansion. The increase in business activities requires commercial bank presence in respective regions of the country. The presence of a fully licensed bank can increase the efficiency of the financial intermediation process and promote economic development. However, these financial innovations will only succeed if: • Infrastructure is in place for investors to build on. Mobile banking and branchless banking requires transport, power, and communication infrastructure. Eg. The Namatanai sub-branch of a bank closed down due to communication and power problems despite transport linkages (road and sea). There is no communication between Dogura and Alotau for an ordinary mobile phone call, so how can one undertake mobile (branchless) banking without communication infrastructure. • Law and Order/Security issues are a serious concern. The law and order problems have caused the banks to reduce the size of their representations throughout PNG. Over the years, banks had to close down in provincial centres. The closure of branches in Popondetta twice in the last few years is a topical illustration. • An alarming law & order issue is the threat to staff of financial institutions. Officers and families of staff employed in the financial system should not be placed in situations of psychological stress and anxiety caused by unsavoury elements of our society. The cases of kidnapping and threatening staff and their families is a problem that must stop. Bank staff must be allowed to contribute to the development of our nation without threat or intimidation whilst carrying out their duties. Ladies and Gentlemen, let me spend a few moments on the ANZ Bank. The reason why we are here today. ANZ bank is a significant corporate citizen contributing to the development of Papua New Guinea (PNG). It employs Papua New Guineans, it pays its taxes and meets the Bank of Papua New Guinea requirements. The opening of the new office complex is an apparent reflection of determination of ANZ bank to take on the banking challenges offered in BIS Review 113/2009 3 
the advent of global financial crises, the fast pace of private lending growth, development of the LNG project and a changed risk landscape of PNG. In an environment where many banks and financial institutions around the world affected by the global financial crises are contracting, it is pleasing to note that we in Papua New Guinea are still expanding. The opening of the new office complex reminds us that the ANZ Bank is here to stay and take on those challenges in providing efficient and affordable banking services. It has been a partner in development in the past, and on hindsight stands ready to take on new opportunities that are available in PNG. I would like to congratulate ANZ bank on this achievement. I particularly wish to acknowledge the contributions made by Mr Garry Tunstall to the banking and financial system, and to the PNG Institute of Banking & Business Management and PNG to which he is a codirector. I also acknowledge the great contribution by Mrs Desley Tunstall for her tireless assistance to the under privilege in the community especially the Children’s Ward at the Port Moresby General Hospital. I also welcome the new Managing Director Mr Vishnu Mohan and his wife Mrs Bubby Mohan. I wish everyone at ANZ Bank all the very best here in their new Harbour City home. It now gives me great pleasure to cut the ribbon and officially open ANZ Harbour City. Thank you. 4 BIS Review 113/2009 
José De Gregorio: Macroeconomics, economists and the crisis  Speech by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, at the Annual Meeting of the Society for the Chilean Economy (SECHI), Antofagasta, 4 September 2009. I thank Luis Felipe Céspedes, Eduardo Engel, Pablo García and Mariana García for valuable comments. *      *      * This is certainly a great opportunity to speak about a subject that has triggered more than a few reflections in me recently, and that was probably best said by Queen Elizabeth’s famous question, made when she was visiting the London School of Economics last year: Why did nobody notice it? As someone who has dedicated his professional life to academic activities and policy making, the question is surely unsettling. The current global financial crisis and recession, whose depth is unprecedented in recent decades, has cast doubts about the work of macroeconomists, the usefulness of their theories, and their capacity to anticipate and deal with crises. These are the issues I will discuss today. Macroeconomics Over the past few decades, macroeconomic theory has evolved, on the one hand, as a discipline whose purpose is solving problems similar to engineering, and, on the other hand, whose purpose is to explain phenomena embodied in economic reality, similar to science (Mankiw, 2006). In fact, macroeconomics was created to solve the problems of the Great Depression. In its beginnings, it was devoted to building large models to evaluate macroeconomic policies in the tradition of engineering. It is only in recent decades that its focus has drifted toward its scientific dimension. In any case, I prefer to think of economics as being closer to medical sciences (Harberger, 1993), as it diagnoses, analyzes evidence and proposes treatments. It is different from physics because physics does not deliver prescriptions, at least not directly. Hence the importance of the interaction between science and practice. Economics has an additional complication, as it is a social science trying to explain human behavior. The emphasis put on rigor and solid theoretical fundamentals has been a positive development, because making policy recommendations requires a good and accurate diagnosis of reality. Like in the past, we could have extensive, complex models, with many sectoral interrelations, based on statistical estimations and calibrations. But if the models aren’t conceptually well-formulated and are based only on statistical patterns, their usefulness is limited. This was the great contribution to economics by the rational expectations revolution and, in the policy field, by the Lucas critique. Only preferences and technology are invariant to policies, while the resulting behavior of agents is not; therefore, policies will ideally be evaluated with models that specify both preferences and technologies.1 Nonetheless, the current crisis has revealed that models are limited to deal with all complexities of the real world. However, I believe that reduced-form models, with all the caveats regarding their potential misuse, can still help in the design of policy, particularly                                                  1  This must be interpreted with caution, because productivity, which is part of technology, depends on policy changes, especially over the long term. The central point in Lucas’s critique is that one must specify the core characteristics of the economy being studied and not base the research on relationships that change with policies. BIS Review 112/2009 1 
when more rigorous and, especially, more realistic models are not available.2 For this reason, there is always a tension between rigor, realism and flexibility. The tendency to base our models on ever more rigorous grounds has also had undesired effects. The incentives of younger academics – the very ones who are supposed to push the borders of knowledge, and who must publish or perish – limit their capabilities for innovation. The required rigor ends up necessarily threatening realism. Nobody expects a model to explain completely the economic reality, but the problem is that it can overlook elements that are crucial to understanding and preventing disasters like the one we face today. It may be more rewarding from an academic standpoint to write an equilibrium model explaining some particular phenomenon, than trying to formulate a model that formalizes all of the distortions of said phenomenon. It is harder and less rewarding for an academic to formulate distortions – of which the real world has plenty – than to use tidy competitive models to explain important stylized facts with a minimum of new ingredients. Scientific advances and models help us think about and interpret the world; they provide us a way to think about specific problems, but their scope is limited. We must avoid the temptation of thinking that a theoretical simplification is a full description of reality. But we must also avoid the other extreme, which totally dismisses what theory teaches because “reality is much more complex”. This is true, but it does not imply that all we have learned is just a theoretical exercise without practical use in reality. Models must be taken realistically, recognizing that they capture at most a small portion of reality. As for the future, the current crisis will certainly provide material for many research studies that will try to figure out what failed and how to avoid making the same mistakes again. Still, I think it will be difficult to develop simple, manageable models that can make substantive progress in having a complete description of reality. Some interesting efforts will most likely be made, but it will not be easy for them to become part of the heart of macroeconomics, since they will be necessarily complex. Many of the models we currently have available are not only mathematically sophisticated, but their results are obtained by computer-based calibrations whose essential mechanisms lack transparency when it comes to revealing how they arrive at their results. Hence, it is difficult to assess their consistency. We have often come across complicated models where an apparently innocuous condition ends up being the determinant of the results.  Complexity also jeopardizes the capacity to move from scientific research to economic policy proposals. For academic ideas to be useful in economic policy, they must be persuasive. Perhaps that was the virtue of the IS-LM model that was used for many years in macroeconomic policy discussions, or of Solow’s growth model that to this day remains the cornerstone of economic growth research. Fortunately, this is not a time where prescriptions are taken by policy makers without scrutiny – and are later labeled as orthodox – and therefore, the capacity to intuitively explain a result is essential.  The bulk of theoretical research will continue to proceed in areas where its results have a good chance of being published, often at the expense of realism. It may not be very profitable from the academic point of view to incorporate elements of irrational behavior, confidence crises or other anomalies into general equilibrium models that are used in policy design. Nor is it easy to include elements of political economy, in particular the influence of interest groups, which in the US financial system are relevant to understanding the evolution of regulation and the causes of the crisis.                                                  2 In the case of the Central Bank of Chile, two models are mainly used to forecast, both within the tradition of forward looking rational-expectations models. One is built with many econometrically estimated reduced-form equations (MEP, see Central Bank of Chile, 2003), while the other is a general equilibrium intertemporal model (MAS, see Medina and Soto, 2007, for an application). Although the latter has stronger fundamentals, its calibration is less flexible in the analysis of short-term dynamics. 2 BIS Review 112/2009 
Emphasis will undoubtedly be placed on the capacity of researchers to explain complex phenomena, but their studies will be as realistic as the degrees of complexity will allow. Therefore, it is important to insist: models are only a part of the reality that allows us to organize our ideas before diagnosing and prescribing. The arguments’ logic and a good deal of judgment are also critical when it comes to making economic policy decisions. General equilibrium models and finance There are two categories of models that are commonly used in macroeconomics and that require some specific references, namely the Real Business Cycle model (RBC) and the New Keynesian model (NKM). Both share the characteristic of being general equilibrium intertemporal models with complete markets and rational expectations.3 Under the RBC model in its more traditional versions, the economy is fully flexible and there is no role for macroeconomic policies, whereas under the NKM there are sticky prices that result in money not being neutral, which assigns a role to monetary policy. These provide the conceptual basis for the formulation of inflation-target regimes. It is important to place both types of models in their right dimension. The strategy of RBC models is to try to replicate economic fluctuations in the simplest, least distorted model possible. It originated in the attempt to use the neoclassical growth model to explain the business cycle as a result of productivity shocks, which is surely an interesting effort with theoretical consistency. These are very elegant models, but the difficulty of solving them analytically results in having to solve them using calibrations. As a result, there are often doubts regarding the values of the parameters, which in general are unobservable. To the extent that these models are free of distortions, there is no role for active monetary policies, since economic fluctuations are socially optimal. Certainly this is an attractive theoretical proposition, but it is absurd to think that this is how the world works. It will be difficult to explain the financial collapse with this type of model, because it has no frictions and provides very limited policy implications.  The New Keynesian model features no realistic frictions in financial markets either, at least to generate problems as severe as the current ones, so it has nothing to say about the origins of the crisis.4 These models are widely used in central banks to calibrate the monetary policy that is consistent with an inflation target.5 In that sense, they are a very useful tool for establishing well-specified, well-estimated transmission mechanisms, but they are certainly limited, and it is unrealistic to believe that they can provide a full description of the economy. Economies are exposed to many shocks that cause deviations – sometimes significant deviations – from projection scenarios. However, they help to understand alternative courses of action of monetary policy after the shocks have hit. Actually, the much praised aggressiveness in interest rate cuts around the world, to unprecedented levels in many cases, is largely justified by the sharp drop in inflationary pressures. It is likely that, without the commitment to bringing inflation back up to normal rates, monetary policy actions could have attained only part of the expansion. This is a practical demonstration of a wrong criticism on inflation-targeting central banks, which is that they are not concerned with the level of activity. Drops in activity and downward pressures on costs are the factors that opened room for monetary policy, avoiding to repeat the mistakes made in the 1930s. This is                                                  3  Due to these similarities, Goodfriend and King (1997) call these general equilibrium models with price rigidities the New Neoclassical Synthesis. 4  Significant effort to add financial frictions, particularly the financial accelerator that amplifies the cycle, was made by Bernanke et al. (1999). See also Christiano et al. (2007). Although these models do analyze the financial channel throughout the cycle, they do not originate a financial meltdown like the one observed last year. 5  For a detailed introduction, see Galí and Gertler (2007). BIS Review 112/2009 3 
why the NKM will remain useful, while a different type of model will have to be found to address the issue of financial stability, together with extensions that are yet to be formalized. This brings me to the theory of finance. If there ever was one discipline that should have anticipated the vulnerabilities that were building up in financial markets, it was finance. Had the origin of the problem been inflationary, then the problem would have been macroeconomics, but the origin was financial. The origin of the crisis is closely related to financial innovation and the creation of instruments that should have diversified risks. Low interest rates, search for yields and a monetary policy that promised to rescue after severe falls in asset prices prompted the creation of a housing bubble.6 Enormous efforts were made to price many extremely complex financial instruments, but even those academic efforts failed to build valuation models that realistically considered the instruments’ insolvency probabilities. No evidence is necessary to assert that these methods failed because of an extreme event that struck everything. These failures were exacerbated by severe liquidity shortages and widespread panic in the markets.7Broadly speaking, the theory of finance has two branches: asset price theory and corporate finance theory. It is paradoxical that while asset price theories, and their application to the real world, are based on the existence of complete markets and full arbitrage (consider, for example, CAPM), corporate finance theories that explain firms’ financial decisions are essentially dominated by information asymmetries and are plagued by frictions from principal (owner)-agent (executives) problems. This dichotomy will have to be corrected over time to ensure that more realistic models of how financial markets work become available, models which will shed more light on economic policy recommendations. Crisis prevention As for the current crisis, one pending issue is whether it could have been anticipated. Once again the question arises: “Where was the profession, its academics and authorities, such that it failed to foresee the severity of the problem?” It is tautological to say that crises are unpredictable, or else they would never occur. History is plagued with crises. Moreover, crises have become more frequent in recent decades as compared with the Bretton Woods period, although their severity and duration have not changed significantly (Bordo et al., 2001). Important efforts have been made to identify early warning indicators that could anticipate a crisis (Berg et al., 2004). The recent episode clearly shows that they have not been very successful, to say the least. In the current crisis it is hard to find clear regularities with respect to early warning indicators (Rose and Spiegel, 2009). Furthermore, in small, open economies, these crises can be triggered by external events on which policy makers have no control. Crises are very costly, but are also the result of innovation and risk taking, which are important for progress. Obviously we must try to avoid them, especially their propagation and amplification, with good economic policies that cushion the impact of a large global crisis, but certainly they cannot be eliminated altogether. In the extreme, to prevent global financial crisis, the economy would have to be totally isolated from the world, forbid risk-taking completely, and close financial markets altogether. Naturally this is not the best way to progress. Making an analogy with car accidents, the best way to avoid them would be to ban                                                  6  De Gregorio (2009) argues that low interest rates are not responsible for the bubbles or for the financial meltdown, because a number of countries had neither bubbles nor financial instability (e.g., Canada and Chile), while others had housing bubbles but their financial system was much more resilient (e.g., Spain). 7  It should be noted that there were some important warnings of the risks that were being incubated. Worth singling out is the work by Raghu Rajan presented in Jackson Hole in 2005 (Rajan, 2006). 4 BIS Review 112/2009 
the existence of cars. However, it seems more reasonable to build safer cars, buckle up and drive prudently.  Crises will continue to happen, but the proper way to act is to strengthen the financial system and macroeconomic policies, in order to minimize their consequences and probability of occurrence.  We must not remain in the notion that a crisis cannot be prevented and thus there is nothing we can do about it. Going back to the car analogy, the fact that accidents will always happen does not mean that we must allow driving at any speed and with no regulation. Quite the contrary, we know that crises are especially severe when they affect the financial system, so it is reasonable to improve regulatory mechanisms, particularly to allow financial innovation while keeping vulnerability under control.  Meanwhile, it is necessary to continue devoting efforts to the detection of early alerts, although, as I have already pointed out, unambiguous indicators are impossible to find. But there are symptoms of fragility, very common in emerging economies. High and persistent current-account deficits, misaligned exchange rates, currency mismatches in the financial and corporate sectors, excessive increases in the prices of assets and credit, all signal a potential problem, although they do not result necessarily in a crisis.8 Therefore, a look at the indicators is not enough, it is important to put them together to detect fragilities. This is precisely what we try to do in our financial stability reports, which allow us to gain an overall vision of vulnerabilities, although, once again, it does not provide a final verdict. Finally, new financial realities require new sets of information to examine, or to compile when not available.9Crisis management That this is the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression nobody disputes. Moreover, the initial shock on the global economy does not differ much from the one that hit in the 1930s. There are many similarities in the initial conditions and effects of the two (Eichengreen and O’Rourke, 2009; IMF, 2009). Worth noting are the initial fall in manufacturing output and trade, the collapse of stock prices and credit, and the increase in bond spreads. In their origins there was also the same rapid expansion in credit and financial innovation that increased the leverage of financial intermediaries. These remarkable similarities in the first months of this crisis were alarming.  However, both differ in the subsequent evolution of the global economy.10 Between 1930 and 1932, world activity (measured at PPP) dropped by an average of 4.8%. In particular, the U.S. experienced an average annual fall of 9.9%. The current situation is very different, and while the pace of the recovery is yet to be seen, forecasts for the three-year period 2009-2011 point at the world economy growing by an average of 2.1% per year, 0.8% for the U.S.11 In the 1930s, U.S. unemployment soared to 25%, much higher than the 10% projected this time. Also, the world faced a severe deflation in the early 1930s, in some cases sinking                                                  8  Although the evidence shows that financial development is good for economic growth, excessive credit expansion can exacerbate a crisis, as happened during the debt crisis in Latin America (De Gregorio and Guidotti, 1995). 9  One example is the new households’ financial survey of the Central Bank of Chile, which seeks to strengthen the analysis of a sector that is becoming ever more important in our financial system. 10  Evidence provided by Eichengreen and O’Rourke (2009) shows that the first few months of the current crisis are pretty similar to the Great Depression, although in recent months they seem to diverge, because the current episode has begun to show signs of recovery while in the Great Depression the fall continued. 11  For the 1930s, the data come from Maddison (2009), while current growth projections come from Consensus Forecast and investment banks. BIS Review 112/2009 5 
below -10%. We do not see that today, and while inflation has fallen dramatically around the world, it remains far from the levels seen during the Great Depression. Another aspect making a big difference is the performance of emerging economies. Latin America, excluding Chile, posted an average annual fall of 4.2% between 1930 and 1932, while Chile, where the crisis compounded with the downfall of the nitrate industry, fell an average of 17.6%. For the three-year period 2009-2011, private forecasts indicate that Latin America will grow by an average of 1.2%, while Chile will grow by 2.1%. These are just projections, not definitive figures, but data released so far this year indicates that the effects of the crisis, although far from negligible, are much milder than they were in the 1930s. This is an encouraging fact. Usually, whenever developed countries go into a recession, its effects are amplified into our region. That has not been the case this time; on the contrary, our region today is outperforming the developed economies. That the current crisis did not turn into a Great Depression proves that lessons have been learned. Economies are much stronger, and also the policies applied have gone in the proper direction of mitigating the tremendous financial shock of last year.  For one thing, the task of stabilizing the financial system was assumed decisively, which prevented its collapse. Uncertainties remain, but are more focused and less dramatic than at the end of last year. Also, the lessons of Friedman and Schwartz (1963) on monetary policy and the role of central banks as lenders of last resort, of Keynes (1935) on the role of expansionary policies, and of Bernanke (1983) on the role of the financial channel for the transmission of policy actions, have been essential in policy decisions adopted since the onset of the current crisis. Many subsequent studies have shed additional light on the characteristics of good policies and have provided the base for the aggressive monetary and fiscal policies that have been applied around the world, and should also illustrate the way in which the stimulus must be withdrawn.  Finally, the use of the gold standard accounted largely for the depth of the Great Depression (Bernanke and James, 1991; Eichengreen, 1992). Moreover, in the midst of the crisis in 1931, the U.S. raised the interest rate to defend the dollar parity, aggravating the crisis and causing deflationary pressures. In Latin America, thanks to lessons learned from mistakes of the past, it has been understood that macroeconomic stability, in both monetary and fiscal terms, foreign exchange flexibility, and a well regulated financial system are crucial to mitigate the effects of external scenarios as adverse as this one. This reflects major progress in economic policy, which has benefited from important practical lessons and advances in research following the debt crisis.  Final remarks There will be plenty of time to continue analyzing where was the profession such that it did not warn of the magnitude of the crisis. As I have discussed here, this is a multifaceted issue that must consider crisis predictability, management, and the role of research in providing rigorous frameworks – albeit incomplete ones – with which to analyze reality.  Nonetheless, that macroeconomic theory has failed is an overstatement. In particular, the comparatively better performance of emerging economies – with the exception of a few cases such as Eastern Europe that remind us of our mistakes of the past – demonstrate that economic research has taught us something. In particular, the majority of macroeconomic policies have sought not to replicate past mistakes. Now it is necessary to analyze more carefully the role of financial markets, their virtues and, of utmost importance, their vulnerabilities. This crisis is an admonishment to professional arrogance. We must recognize that the real world is much more complex than what our models can explain. This is why so-called 6 BIS Review 112/2009 
professional orthodoxy is discredited. However, we must also avoid the arrogance that comes from ignorance, which leads to abandoning all we have learned about the fundamentals of good macroeconomic policies.  References Berg, A., E.

Caleb M Fundanga: Campaign to keep Zambia clean and healthy Opening remarks by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the review walk of the “Keep Lusaka clean, green and healthy campaign project”, Lusaka, 17 September 2009. *      *      * The Acting Minister of Local Government and Housing, Hon Bradford Machila His Worship the Mayor of Lusaka, His Worship Robert Chikwelete The Chairman of the BAZ, Mr Saviour Chibiya Chief Executive Officers of Commercial Banks Distinguished Invited Guests Members of the Press Ladies and Gentlemen I am honored to officiate at this important occasion at which banks have undertaken to conduct a review of the “Keep Lusaka Clean, Green and Healthy Campaign”. Hon Minister, as you are aware, the “Make Zambia Clean and Healthy” campaign was launched by the Government in 2007 and was aimed at keeping our surroundings clean and green in order to improve the health standards throughout the country. You may wish to know that the banking sector through the Bankers Association of Zambia and the Bank of Zambia commenced work immediately after the national launch. A project committee was formed and each bank including the BoZ embarked on implementing the campaign by making financial contributions. To ensure a uniform landscape on all islands along Cairo Road, a single company was employed to carry out landscaping and maintenance works including maintaining and keeping the pavements  and gardens clean and green. The programme also included placing dustbins along the pavements and ensuring that the street lights were repaired and lit. It is highly gratifying to see how much work has been accomplished and I am sure that the results are clear for all of us to see today. This initiative, Ladies and Gentlemen, is one sure way of inculcating and promoting a culture of cleanliness amongst our people. It is also an effective way of expressing our Corporate Social Responsibility. Beautiful and clean surroundings also go a long way in complementing Government’s efforts of developing tourism. In fact another dimension of the initiative required that all banks including the BoZ maintain and keep their offices and surroundings clean at all times. In this regard, we at the Bank of Zambia have introduced regular inspections of offices while ensuring that all staff are aware of their responsibilities towards the clean campaign. Furthermore, by keeping their premises or business environment clean, banks provide the satisfaction that customer need. You would all agree with me that a business done in a clean environment leave the customer totally relaxed and in good spirit, prompting another visit in future. Ladies and Gentlemen, in line with “Goal 8” of the Millennium Development Goals on “Environmental Sustainability”, we are all expected to work together and reverse the losses of environmental resources. I am glad to report that the financial sector has taken the bold step and has become one of, if not the first, to contribute positively towards achieving this goal. In this regard I would like to call upon other corporate entities and business houses in Lusaka and other cities around the country to emulate the efforts of the financial sector and help keep Zambia a beautiful, clean and healthy place to live in. I must hasten to mention here that, by undertaking such initiatives, we are in no way trying to take over the responsibility of the local authorities but merely supplementing their efforts of keeping the country clean and healthy. BIS Review 112/2009 1 
Hon Minister, allow me to make an earnest appeal to the local authorities through “His Worship the Mayor” to assist in the maintenance of the islands by providing security to minimize the rampant vandalism, theft and destruction of plants and other essentials that occur on a daily basis. We also make a humble request to the Lusaka City Council to consider working on the water reticulation system, as this is one area posing a great challenge in the maintenance of the islands. Furthermore, there are still a number of places, which require urgent attention in the City. Your Worship, we have observed that a number of incomplete buildings have been abandoned posing a danger to the lives of many while others remain without a colour wash for years giving an unattractive sight to our beloved capital city. We would like to request your good office, “Your Worship” to issue mandatory directives to all business houses in the country to complete construction sites within a stipulated period and to ensure that all buildings are properly maintained and where necessary repainted on a regular basis. In conclusion, Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish to commend the Bankers Association of Zambia and in particular the Project Committee for the effective and efficient manner in which this initiative has been implemented thus far. My hope is that the initiative will not only be confined to Cairo Road but to all areas of the country. Finally, I would like to urge all of us present here today to extend this initiative to our homes. Let us keep our homes, communities and the country clean as cleanliness is next to godliness. I thank you. 2 BIS Review 112/2009 
Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell: Business models in banking – is there a best practice? Speech by Ms Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the CAREFIN Conference on “Business Models in Banking: Is There a Best Practice”, Bocconi University, Milan, 21 September 2009. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen,1It is a real pleasure for me to speak today at Bocconi University. Founded in 1902, Bocconi was the first Italian university to offer degrees in economics. As one of the oldest economics departments in Europe, Bocconi leads the way in intellectual thinking on economic progress and innovation. It therefore seems the perfect place to host today’s conference on banking business models and to discuss their future.  Given that the worst financial storm since the 1930s is only gradually calming down, the topic chosen for this conference is very apt. Banks have taken centre stage in the ongoing financial and economic crisis, and any definitive resolution to the crisis essentially hinges on banks regaining financial health and public confidence on the basis of sustainable and welfare-enhancing business models.  However, not all banks have been equally affected by the crisis, nor have they been equally responsible for it. The main players have mostly been large international investment banks or banks that had moved away from traditional retail banking activities. This movement towards a presumably more “modern” business model relied principally on the origination, distribution and trading of often complex securities, on other fee-income generating activities, as well as on a funding structure more dependent on wholesale markets.  Many factors have contributed to the current financial crisis, namely excessive risk-taking, the emergence of a shadow banking system, the exponential growth of innovative financial products, inadequate corporate governance incentive structures at banks, the lack of proper regulation and an environment of abundant liquidity at low interest rates. But my speech today is going to focus on excessive risk-taking and banks’ creation of innovative financial products, which has led to the transformation of their business models.  To a large extent, this shift towards a new business model was based on innovation in the structured credit market, particularly in respect of securitisation instruments, such as credit default swaps, asset-backed securities and collateral debt obligations. A common feature of all these financial innovations is that they transform, transfer and trade credit risk. One of the main consequences of the use of such instruments is that large amounts of credit that were previously predominantly illiquid (such as bank loans) then became liquid and could potentially be traded in financial markets. However, we must not blame such credit risk transfer instruments and vehicles per se . I am confident that those instruments generating real economic value will survive the crisis, albeit probably at much reduced volumes, in less complex structures, with improved transparency, and subject to financial regulation and supervisory structures. They will survive because, when prudently applied and sufficiently monitored in terms of their impact on financial stability, financial innovations generally tend to make a financial system more efficient without necessarily increasing its fragility.                                                   1  I would like to thank Florian Heider, Manfred Kremer and David Marqués Ibañez for their valuable input. BIS Review 112/2009 1 
At this point, it is worth asking what the main banking business models could or should look like from a policy-maker’s perspective, which takes into account implications for both financial efficiency and stability. I will limit the remainder of my speech to a few of the main points of the argument and will also point out some early lessons to be learnt from the crisis.  What is so special about the business of banking? I will start with a standard definition of a “bank”, recalling the main functions that banks are supposed to perform and explaining why these functions are so important and special that they warrant relatively close public intervention and oversight.  A bank is “an institution whose current operations consist in granting loans and receiving deposits from the public”.2 This definition refers to the core activity of commercial banks, namely the simultaneous acceptance of deposits and offering of loans, which distinguishes them from other financial intermediaries. However, banks typically conduct a broader range of activities, which can be subsumed under the following three functions:3  • First, banks provide the public with liquidity (money) and payment services through their deposit-taking business.  • Second, banks transform assets in terms of denomination, quality and maturity, as well as manage the associated risks.  • Third, banks process information and monitor borrowers using specialised technologies. In so doing, they often establish long-term relationships with their clients, which may further mitigate the negative impacts of adverse selection and moral hazard on the resource allocation process.  Changes in banking business models Before I turn to the question of how this traditional banking model has changed over the past few years, I am going to take a brief look at financial market history. Glass-Steagall: investment banks versus commercial banks  Looking specifically at the history of the financial markets in the United States, it was bad banking practices and the public outcry after the stock market crash of 1929 that brought about the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. Interestingly, the Act followed an enquiry into whether commercial banks had sold unsound securities to their customers, thus converting potential bad loans into securities issues. The Act therefore prohibited commercial banks from underwriting, holding or dealing in corporate securities, either directly or through securities affiliates.4 In my view, the concerns that prompted the Act were very similar to those currently being voiced – particularly in relation to concerns about banks’ business models and the sale of unsound securities to unsuspecting investors.  The Act had a global impact on competitive conditions. For instance, the large presence of major US investment banks in Europe can be traced back to the implementation of this Act, which separated investment banks from commercial banks. The Act also had an impact on the supervision of banks, mostly in the United States, but also in other regions in the world,                                                  2  X. Freixas and J. C. Rochet (1997), The Microeconomics of Banking, MIT Press. 3  X. Freixas and J. C. Rochet (1997), op. cit. 4  R. Kroszner and R. Rajan (1994), "Is the Glass-Steagall Act Justified? A Study of the U. S.

including Europe. Owing to the funding structure of commercial banks and the stronger links between them – and hence their importance for financial stability – commercial banks were regulated accordingly. In contrast, investment banks were expected to be in less need of close monitoring and regulation, as they were seen to be less important from a financial stability perspective. The current crisis has vividly illustrated how the actions of not only commercial banks and investment banks, but also other financial players, can have a major impact on all parts of the financial system and the economy at large.  I should now like to focus on two major factors that have changed the way banks do business. First, I will discuss the changes in banks’ business models that relate to the sources of their revenue. And, second, I will focus on the changes in the funding of banks and talk about the unintended consequences of the expansion of their securitisation activities.  Diversification in the sources of revenue  With regard to the change in the sources of banks’ revenue, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 is a prime example of deregulation in relation to banks’ business models. If we compare the regulations in place today with those of 20 years ago, we see an unprecedented process of deregulation across regions and financial sectors. One consequence of this deregulation has been a global trend towards more diversification in banks’ income sources, i.e. towards higher brokerage fees and commission – more generally called “non-interest income”. The increase in non-interest income provides banks with additional sources of revenue and can therefore provide a diversification in their overall income. At the same time, non-interest income has usually been a much more volatile source of revenue than interest rate income. Investment banks, for example, have a high dependence on non-interest income. Typically, they are more profitable than traditional commercial banks, but they are also much more leveraged and their earnings are more volatile (see Chart 1). The volatility of earnings, combined with the close ties of investment banks to other financial players, calls for a higher level of monitoring for these systemically important players.5                                                   5  In addition, recent evidence suggests that there are indeed conflicts of interest in banking that are not anticipated by the public. Investment banks affiliated with financial conglomerates take positions in takeover targets before the conglomerate announces its bid. Moreover, it appears that these inside trades are profitable, while the M&A deals are not wealth-creating. See A. Bodnaruk, M. Massa and A. Simonov (2009), “Investment Banks as Insiders and the Market for Corporate Control”, Review of Financial Studies, forthcoming. BIS Review 112/2009 3 
Chart 1: Bank profits and volatility of earnings (median values of return on equity and standard deviation from 2000 to 2007)  Source: Bankscope. In addition, there is one problem relating to the banks’ risk management that applies mostly to investment banks, but also to other large financial institutions: most risk management techniques neglected the correlations of risks across securities, as not just banks, but also rating agencies, did not sufficiently internalise the growing systemic, market and liquidity risks. Moreover, banks underestimated tail risk. The existing risk-management techniques worked well at predicting small day-to-day losses in the middle of the distribution but failed to anticipate severe losses that are much rarer. But clearly, it is exactly those severe losses that matter most. This mispricing of risk relates to deficiencies in risk management techniques, but also, and perhaps more importantly, to existing incentives in the banking system oriented towards the short term profitability of banks. Diversification in the sources of funding  Turning now to the second factor, the change in banks’ funding sources: at the same time as the change in the sources of banks’ revenue, there has been a wider change relating to banks’ liability side of the balance sheet.6 In particular, this refers to the shift in banks’ business models away from the traditional model of financing. In the traditional model, there was a heavy reliance on retail deposits, but this has been replaced by an increasing reliance on market-based sources of funding. The significant recourse to specific funding instruments, such as mortgage bonds and securitisation, has made banks increasingly dependent on capital markets, but at the same time, of course, less dependent on deposits, to expand their loan base. This is evident from both an upward trending total assets to deposits ratio of the largest euro area banks (see Chart 2.a) and an increase in the loans to deposit ratio of large EU banks (see Chart 2.b). To the extent that more stable retail deposit financing has been replaced by wholesale funding, banks may have become more exposed to market dynamics and perceptions, constituting a potential source of instability in the banking sector.7                                                   6  See Banking Supervision Committee (2009), “EU Banking Structures Report”, forthcoming in October. 7  A.

Chart 2.b:Loans to deposit ratio of large EU banks  (corrected for extreme outliers)  Source: Bankscope. Securitisation markets and the current crisis  The element of this change in banks’ sources of funding that I would like to focus on in particular is securitisation. Securitisation activity did indeed increase substantially in the years prior to the financial crisis (see Chart 3). As you know, securitisation and financial innovation in credit markets have generated significant changes, particularly in the financial structure of banks, and, more generally, in financial market activity in the euro area. It has become clear that the change in banks’ business models from “originate and hold” to BIS Review 112/2009 5 
“originate, repackage and sell” also had significant implications for financial stability. Securitisation was meant to disperse credit risk to those who are better able and more willing to bear it. But, as the current crisis has shown, this did not work out as envisaged. This stems from the fact that the same instruments that are used to hedge risks also have the potential to undermine financial stability – by facilitating the leveraging of risk, for example. Moreover, there were major flaws in the actual interaction among the different players involved in the securitisation process. These included misaligned incentives along the securitisation chain, a lack of transparency with regard to the underlying risks of the securitisation business, and the poor management of those risks. There was a dramatic increase in the complexity of securitised products prior to the crisis, owing largely to misaligned incentives and investors’ search for yield, which, in particular, made the valuation and risk assessment of these products extremely complex and difficult.  Chart 3: Securitisation issuance in Europe  (in EUR billions)  Source: European Securitisation Forum. In contrast, the covered bond market has been more sheltered from these incentive problems than securitisation markets, partly because traditional covered bonds have a simpler structure. This makes the overall market more transparent, and the valuation and risk assessment easier. Covered bonds also have a much stricter regulatory framework. Overall, there have been problems in the securitisation market that relate to opacity and misaligned incentives, which – looking ahead – need to be addressed by market participants and regulators in order to restore the securitisation market to health.  Money market problems as a symptom Having gone through some of the major factors that have affected the condition of banks during the current crisis, I will conclude by recalling not only the exceptional speed with which the crisis hit the financial sector, but also the unprecedented size of its impact. Consider, for example, interbank markets. In normal times, interbank markets are among the most liquid in the financial sector. In 2006 the daily turnover in euro area money markets was €140 billion.8 The sudden seizing up of interbank markets and subsequent failure to redistribute liquidity                                                  8  ECB (2008), Euro Money Market Survey. 6 BIS Review 112/2009 
has become very much a key feature of the financial crisis.9 Chart 4 shows the spread between the three-month unsecured rate and the three-month overnight index swap rate, which is a standard measure of interbank market tension. Until 9 August 2007, which is often said to mark the start of the financial crisis, the unsecured euro interbank market was characterised by a very low spread of around five basis points. After the announcement by BNP Paribas that it would freeze some funds, the spread increased by a factor of 12 to around 60 basis points. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the events surrounding the last weekend of September 2008,10 the rates shot up further, eventually reaching a maximum of 186 basis points. The increase of rates in September 2008 is mirrored by the amount of funds deposited with the ECB at that time.  Chart 4: Interbank market  Source: F. Heider, M. Hoerova and C. Holthausen (2009), op.cit. The events of the last two years have not only shown that even the most liquid funding markets for banks can seize up within days, but also proved that long-standing economic relationships across different market segments can suddenly break down precisely as a result of the links between banks. Future regulation will take into account liquidity risk and prescribe sound liquidity policies.  How banks have fared during the recent financial crisis The recent financial crisis has illustrated how banks’ own business models and incentives can have a major impact on financial stability. In this regard, recent international evidence suggests that banking strategies that rely primarily on generating non-interest income or                                                  9  For an analysis see Heider, F., M. Hoerova and C. Holthausen (2009), “Liquidity Hoarding and Interbank Market Spreads: The Role of Counterparty Risk”, ECB Working Paper (forthcoming). 10  Washington Mutual, the largest S&L institution in the United States, was seized by the FDIC and sold to JPMorgan Chase. At the same time, negotiations on the TARP rescue package stalled in the US Congress. Over the weekend, it was reported that British mortgage lender Bradford and Bingley had to be rescued, and the Benelux countries announced the injection of €11.2 billion into Fortis Bank. On the following Monday, Germany announced the rescue of Hypo Real Estate and Iceland nationalised Glitnir. BIS Review 112/2009 7 
attracting non-deposit funding are very risky.11 There is also evidence, for example by Andrea Beltratti, from Bocconi University, and co-authors, suggesting that those banks that performed better prior to the crisis have also fared worst during the crisis. This seems to suggest that the more profitable strategy prior to the crisis, has also been the more riskier strategy. Their research findings also suggest that there may be additional policy tools that could contribute to containing future threats to financial stability. In particular, banks in countries with stricter capital requirements and more independent banking supervisors seem to have performed significantly better during the crisis. Also, banks with more Tier I capital and in countries with more restrictions on banks’ activities have also done relatively well in recent quarters.12The way forward What have we learnt about sustainable bank business models from the events of the past two years? First, it is important that the structure of banks’ liabilities is appropriate for the structure of the assets that they hold. Banks have been excessively leveraged relative to the risks they were taking.  Second, we still know too little about why different banks hold different levels of equity.13 We do know, however, that, ultimately, equity is the only robust buffer against realising losses. Although holding equity is costly, bank capital regulation should also take into account the macroeconomic implications of bank capital requirements.  Third, banks to a large extent ignored the role of deposits as a stable source of funding. More and more assets were funded by non-deposit liabilities. Banks turned excessively to the wholesale markets in order to finance their growth. Relying on wholesale markets for funding and liquidity has proved to be exceedingly precarious. Fourth, owing to its potential benefits, innovation in the financial sector will continue. However, a serious evaluation of the possible implications of financial innovation for financial stability is warranted. In the case of securitisation, a sharp reduction in the level of complexity and leverage of the instruments issued is expected, while a higher level of transparency and more aligned incentives are crucial for an efficient securitisation market. Fifth, I would like to just say a few words on the macro-prudential aspects of financial stability. It is very important to develop a proper framework for the macro-prudential supervision not just of banks, but also other financial institutions, markets and instruments that can be systemic in nature, irrespective of whether they are regulated or not. For that, we need a deep understanding of the major trends in the financial sector, including new business models, and their impact on financial stability.14                                                   11  A.

Heider (2009), “The Determinants of Bank Capital Structure”, Review of Finance, forthcoming. 14  For further information on macroprudential issues, see A. Crockett, “Marrying the micro- and macro-prudential dimensions of financial stability”, remarks before the Eleventh International Conference of Banking Supervisors, held in Basel on 20-21 September 2000. See also the Report of the High-Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU chaired by Jacques de Larosière, in Brussels, on 25 February 2009. In the European Union, following the publication of the Report of the de Larosière Group, the European Commission proposed in May 2009 a set of ambitious reforms, including the creation of a new European Systemic Risk Board responsible for macro-prudential oversight. The European Council in June 2009 supported the European Commission’s proposal. 8 BIS Review 112/2009 
I am pleased to note that the relevant authorities have already started to take action in response to all these lessons that have been learnt from the financial crisis. With a view to strengthening the resilience of the banking sector, the regulatory reform agenda that has been launched and agreed internationally will:  • introduce a leverage ratio, as a measure to curb banks’ excessive balance sheet growth. This measure will be introduced initially as a supplement to the Basel II risk-based framework and, subject to proper calibration and review, as a minimum regulatory requirement;  • raise the quality, consistency, transparency and level of capital, namely the amount of common equity and other instruments of equally high loss-absorption capacity; • introduce a framework for counter-cyclical capital buffers above the minimum capital requirement, which will be raised during economic upturns and be used in downturns, as well as promote more forward-looking provisions; and • establish a minimum global standard for funding liquidity which includes a stressed liquidity coverage ratio requirement and a longer-term structural liquidity ratio.  These measures will be introduced by the end of the year, and phased in as financial conditions improve and economic recovery is assured. Measures to address the misalignment and lack of transparency of incentives in the securitisation market include strengthening the capital requirements for exposures, as well as introducing risk management practices and disclosures. These measures have already been agreed and will be implemented in the course of 2010. As improving economic conditions may lead to the resumption of securitisation activity, the measures taken will ensure that it is relaunched on a sounder and more sustainable basis. Finally, work is under way to ensure that all systemically important institutions, markets and instruments are subject to adequate regulation and oversight. As a first step, a report will be issued in November by the IMF, the FSB and the BIS that will provide guidance on identifying systemically important institutions, markets and instruments. I started this speech by briefly describing why banks are special. The last two years have painfully stressed how special and important they really are. When the financial system fails, the whole economic system is affected. The financial sector has undergone an unprecedented wave of innovation, change, consolidation and now crisis. We now have a better understanding of the business models that may not be sustainable, but there are still many open questions. For example, will future capital requirements provide banks with better loss bearing capabilities and the economic system with less procyclicality? How can future compensation and corporate governance principles support the long term value creation of banks? And, how can risk management practises and risk pricing models better represent possible gains and losses? Overall, there seems to be no simple answer on banks’ best practises and their business model. Therefore, we need the contribution of the academic community for the future design of banks’ business models and for the policies supporting them. I am – of course - already looking forward to this conference providing some answers to the important questions at stake. BIS Review 112/2009 9 
Mallam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi: Developments in the banking system in Nigeria Address by Mr Mallam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Lagos, 14 August 2009. *      *      * Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen of the Press, As we are all aware, the world economy has been hit by the repercussion of the financial meltdown that started with the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States of America and spread to Europe and other parts of the world. This crisis has led to the collapse of many banks and other financial institutions, and even rendered an entire nation bankrupt. In Nigeria, the banking system appears to have weathered the storm due to a number of factors. Among these are the facts that our financial system is not strongly integrated into the international financial system, as well as the relatively simple nature of financial products and strong capitalization and liquidity of Nigerian banks. However, there are many who have been aware for a while now that whereas the system in general is likely to absorb and survive the effects of crisis, the effects vary from bank to bank. A few Nigerian banks, mainly due to huge concentrations in their exposure to certain sectors (capital market and oil and gas being the prominent ones), but due to a general weakness in risk management and corporate governance, have continued to display signs of failure. As far as October last year, some of the banks showed serious liquidity strain and had to be given financial support by the Central Bank in the form of an "Expanded Discount Window" (EDW) where the CBN extended credit facilities to these banks on the basis of collateral in the form of Commercial Paper and Bankers' acceptances, sometimes of doubtful value.  As at June 4, 2009 when I assumed office as Governor of the CBN, the total amount outstanding at the Expanded Discount Window was N256.571 billion most of which was owed by the 5 banks. A review of the activity in the EDW showed that four banks had been almost permanently locked in as borrowers and were clearly unable to repay their obligations. A fifth bank had been a very frequent borrower when its profile ordinarily should have placed it among the net placers of funds in the market. Whereas the five banks were by no means the only ones to have benefited from the EDW, the persistence and frequency of their demand pointed to a deeper problem and the CBN identified them as probable source of financial instability, most likely suffering from deeper problems due to non-performing loans. The impact of the situation of these banks was being felt by the market in different negative ways. Because of this strain in their balance sheets, the banks pushed up the interest rate paid to private sector deposits and their competitors had to follow suit. They also contributed to the destabilization of the inter-bank market as many of their competitors were unwilling to take an unsecured risk on them. If was primarily because of these banks, or at least some of them, that the CBN took the step of guaranteeing the inter-bank market when it stopped granting new lines under the EDW. Without that guarantee, almost four banks would not have been able to borrow in the inter-bank and would probably have collapsed. As you are aware, we guaranteed the inter-bank market to give us the time to conduct a thorough diagnostic of the banks and ensure that appropriate remedial action is taken. At least four of the banks in question have since the guarantee came into force either remained heavy users of funds at the EDW or drawn heavily from other banks under cover of the CBN guarantee to wind-down at this window. In all events, it is clear that they do not have the ability to meet their obligations to depositors and creditors as they are in a grave situation. BIS Review 111/2009 1 
In view of the aforementioned circumstances, I instructed the Director of Banking Supervision of the CBN to carry out a Special Examination of the following five banks: 1. Afribank Plc 2. Finbank Plc 3. Intercontinental Bank Plc 4. Oceanic Bank Plc and  5. Union Bank Plc. The examination was conducted by a joint team of CBN and NDIC officials. The major findings on the 5 banks included: 1. Excessively high level of non-performing loans in the five banks which was attributable to poor corporate governance practices, lax credit administration processes and the absence or non-adherence to the bank's credit risk management practices. Thus the percentage of non-performing loans to total loans ranged from 19% to 48%. The 5 banks will therefore need to make additional provision of N539.09 billion. 2. The total loan portfolio of these five banks was N2,801.92 billion. Margin loans amounted to N456.28 billion and exposure to oil and gas was N487.02 billion. Aggregate non-performing loans stood at N1,143 billion representing 40.81%. 3. From 1 and 2 above, it is evident that the five banks accounted for a disproportionate component of the total exposure to capital market and oil and gas, thus reflecting heavy concentration to high risk areas relative to other banks in the industry. 4. The huge provisioning requirements have led to significant capital impairment. Consequently, all the banks are undercapitalized for their current levels of operations and are required to increase their provisions for loan losses, which impacted negatively on their capital. Indeed one is technically insolvent with a Capital Adequacy Ratio of (1.01%). Thus, a minimum capital injection of N204,94 billion will be required in the 5 banks to meet the minimum capital adequacy ratio of 10%. 5. The five banks were either perennial net-takers of funds in the inter-bank market or enjoyed liquidity support from the CBN for long periods of time, a clear evidence of illiquidity. In other words, these banks were unable to meet their maturing obligations as they fall due without resorting to the CBN or the inter-bank market. As a matter of fact, the outstanding balance on the EDW of the five banks amounted to N127.85 billion by end July 2009, representing 89.81% of the total industry exposure to the CBN on its discount window while their net guaranteed inter-bank takings stood at N253.30 billion as at August 02, 2009. Their liquidity ratios ranged from 17.65% to 24% as at May 31, 2009. (Regulatory minimum is 25%). It is important to note that at least three of the banks are systemically important (accounting for more than 5% of assets and deposits in the banking system) and together the five banks account for 39.93% of loans, 29.99% of deposits, and 31.47% of total assets as at May 31, 2009. Given the extent of the asset quality problem leading to liquidity stresses, and the variety of stress points on the banks' balance sheets, failure to act to secure the financial health of these banks will clearly place the system at risk. The Central Bank has a responsibility to act to protect all depositors and creditors and ensure that no one loses money due to bank failure. The Bank also needs to move decisively to remove this principal cause of financial instability and restore confidence in the banking system. Consequently, having reviewed all the reports of the examiners and the comments of the Directors and Deputy Governors, I am satisfied that these 5 institutions are in a grave 2 BIS Review 111/2009 
situation and that their Management have acted in a manner detrimental to the interest of their depositors and creditors, Therefore, in exercise of my powers as contained in Sections 33 and 35 of the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act 1991, as amended, and after securing the consent of the Board of Directors of the CBN, I hereby remove the Managing Directors and the Executive Directors of the following banks from office with effect from Friday, August 14, 2009. 1. Afribank Plc 2. Intercontinental Bank Plc 3. Union Bank of Nigeria Plc 4. Oceanic international Bank Plc  5. Finbank Plc These persons forthwith cease to be directors and officers of their respective banks. The Board of the Central Bank of Nigeria has also appointed the following as the MD/CEOs of the affected banks: 1. Mr. John Aboh – MD/CEO Oceanic International Bank Plc 2. Mr. Mahmud L. AlabI – MD/CEO Intercontinental Bank Plc 3. Mr. Nebolisa Arah – MD/CEO Afribank Plc 4. Mrs. Suzanne Iroche – MD/CEO Finbank Plc 5. Mrs. Funke Osibodu – MD/CEO Union Ban Plc Each of the above will head a management team that will include Executive Directors and Chief Financial Officers to be appointed by the CBN. This team is tasked with continuing the businesses of the banks as a going concern. I therefore appeal to the Boards of the affected banks, in their own interest, to co-operate with the newly appointed Executive Management. We are conscious of the fact that changing management alone will not resolve this problem. Consequently, the CBN is injecting a total of about N400 billion into these five banks with immediate effect in form of Tier 2 Capital to be repaid from proceeds of capitalization in the near future. This injection is sufficient to resolve and stabilize all the institutions and enable them continue normal business. The injection of fresh capital by the CBN is a temporary measure as government does not intend to hold the shares for long and shall divest its holdings as soon as new investors recapitalize these banks. Let me also advise all debtors of Nigerian banks, that the CBN and all government agencies are united in our commitment to support the recovery efforts of the banks. Debtors who do not pay shall have their names published in national newspapers in due course and we will solicit the support of law enforcement agencies in recovery. Let me reassure especially the customers of the affected banks and all the banks in general that there is no cause for alarm They should continue to transact their normal business in the banks where their accounts are domiciled as this exercise is meant to further strengthen the banking industry and recapitalize the affected banks. I should also state at this point that the scope of the Special Examination was widened to cover all 24 banks. So far, we have concluded the audit of 10 banks including these five, the others being Diamond Bank, First Bank, United Bank for Africa, Guaranty Trust Bank and Sterling Bank. We have also commenced the next batch of 11 banks and hope to conclude them by end of August, All in all, we expect to conclude the audit in mid-September. The Central Bank is requiring all banks to make appropriate provisioning for non-performing loans and disclose them. We hope that by the end of this quarter, all banks would have cleaned up their balance sheets. On the basis of the information available to us so far, we are confident BIS Review 111/2009 3 
that the banking system is safe and sound and we have dealt with the major sources of systemic risk. I will conclude by restating that, going forward, the CBN will not waiver in its desire to ensure that public confidence in the Nigerian banking system is maintained through appropriate disclosures and the reinvigoration of its policy of zero tolerance on all professional and unethical conducts. We will not allow any bank to fail. However, we will also ensure that officers of banks and debtors who contribute to bank failures are brought to book to the full extent of the law and that all proceeds of infraction are confiscated where legally feasible. Thank you. 4 BIS Review 111/2009 
Karolina Ekholm: Balancing monetary policy – when theory meets practice Speech by Ms Karolina Ekholm, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at SEB, Stockholm, 18 September 2009.  *      *      * As I am sure most of you know, I am the newest member of the Executive Board of the Riksbank. I was appointed in January this year – at the height of the financial crisis – and took up my post in March when virtually all the curves for the development of the real economy were pointing sharply downwards. The period since my appointment has been very intensive and highly instructive. As a university lecturer in economics, part of my baggage included the textbook descriptions of how monetary policy is conducted. I soon realised, however, that there are significant differences between theory and practice. For example, the financial markets work fairly well in theory. At the time I joined the Executive Board, however, this was definitely not the case. This meant that I faced entirely new monetary policy considerations compared to those presented in the textbook analyses of monetary policy. I had actually suspected that monetary policy is much more difficult in practice than in theory already before I began working at the Riksbank. I am sure that these suspicions would have been confirmed even under more normal circumstances. Now, however, my induction period has been marked by the extraordinary conditions that currently govern monetary policy: a financial crisis that has still not really come to an end, a very dramatic economic downturn and a repo rate that is close to zero. It has definitely not been a gentle settling-in period! Today, I intend to tell you a little about these early experiences and to explain how I view the monetary policy considerations that are relevant in the current economic situation. I will also say something about my view of monetary policy in the period ahead and to what extent we need to take factors other than inflation into account.  Monetary policy in practice  The inflation target lies at the centre of the Riksbank's monetary policy. The stated target is that the annual change in the consumer price index (CPI) should be 2 per cent. As far as the target for monetary policy is concerned there is no difference between theory and practice. Both theory and practice show that low and stable inflation creates favourable conditions for the development of the economy in the long term. There is also broad agreement between academics and central banks about the possibilities and limitations of monetary policy. We know that monetary policy can influence both the average level of inflation and how much it varies over time.  Monetary policy can not, on the other hand, significantly affect the average level of real quantities such as production, employment and unemployment. The average level of such quantities is determined by other factors, such as demography, competition and tax policies, research and development and education and training. There are therefore good reasons why monetary policy should focus on inflation and have an inflation target. Flexible inflation targeting policy A strict interpretation of the possibilities of monetary policy can easily be perceived as being that central banks can only affect inflation. However, although monetary policy can not affect the average level of real factors, this does not mean that it is ineffectual in stabilising BIS Review 111/2009 1 
fluctuations in these factors. I mean by this that monetary policy can contribute to the stabilisation of resource utilisation at a normal level. In practice, central banks with an inflation target conduct what is called flexible inflation targeting. This flexibility means that – alongside the long-term inflation target – the central banks also strive to ensure that fluctuations in both inflation and the real economy are kept at a reasonable level. Striking the right balance between these factors is what the Riksbank calls a well-balanced monetary policy. The flexibility of inflation targeting becomes particularly important in situations where a conflict arises between the objective of reaching the inflation target and the objective of stabilising the real economy. In some situations, the inflation target calls for a certain type of monetary policy while resource utilisation calls for another. One example of this is the situation that prevailed during most of 2008, the year before I joined the Executive Board. Energy and food prices increased dramatically. This pushed up inflation to unexpected levels. At the same time, economic activity appeared to be declining – a decline that eventually became a severe economic downturn. If, in such a situation, the interest rate had been substantially increased in order to rapidly bring inflation back down to the target, the economic situation could have been undermined even more. However, as the Riksbank works with a flexible inflation target we can choose not to bring inflation back to the target as quickly as possible. This flexibility also gives us scope to stabilise the fluctuations in the real economy. How long it should take to return inflation to the target depends, among other things, on the type of shock that has occurred, the size of the shock and how long it can be expected to affect the economy.  An almost obvious question in the exam papers on macroeconomics that I helped to set in the spring of 2008 was: What monetary policy can a central bank that conducts flexible inflation targeting be expected to pursue under the prevailing conditions and why? Full marks went to those who answered something like: "such a central bank can be expected to make relatively moderate interest rate increases and accept a level of inflation that exceeds the target in the short term but then falls back to the target". This was also by and large the monetary policy conducted by the Riksbank.  However, it can be difficult to achieve the right balance In theory, balancing the need to achieve the inflation target and the need to stabilise the real economy seems relatively simple, even when there is a conflict between these objectives as in 2008. However, when it comes to conducting monetary policy in practice, achieving the right balance is not always so easy. One problem that I have probably underestimated in the past is that there are no simple and unambiguous measures of how much of the economy's resources are being utilised and what should be considered as a normal level for what we call resource utilisation. In theory it is relatively easy to define the so-called production gap. It is often defined as the difference between what is actually produced and what could be produced if the resources available were used to the full. But I do not really think that it is possible to measure this gap with any great degree of precision. One problem is that it is difficult to measure how much could be produced if all the resources were used to the full. This, which is sometimes called potential production, can not be observed directly but must be estimated.1 At the same time, there is a great deal of uncertainty about the best way to perform such an estimate. Getting an idea of resource utilisation thus requires that we, like other forecasters, look at many different types of measure and assess which conclusions regarding resource utilisation seem to be                                                  1  For a more detailed discussion of how potential production can be defined and measured, see Palmqvist, S. (2007), ”Flexible inflation targeting – how should central banks take the real economy into consideration?”, Sveriges Riksbank Economic Review, no. 2, pages 91-105, Sveriges Riksbank. 2 BIS Review 111/2009 
reasonable. Developing analysis in this area is important and such work is underway at the Riksbank. However, I do not think that we should expect it to be possible to find a measure that is so reliable that it can be used in a mechanical way in all situations to determine exactly how monetary policy should be designed so that it also stabilises the real economy. Another practical problem for forecasters is that it is difficult to identify turning points in economic activity. Here too we have to rely on different types of indicator. We monitor, for example, new orders, stock, the purchasing managers' index, confidence indicators, business tendency surveys and, not least, the Riksbank's own company interviews. At present, the confidence indicators are particularly important. The downturn began with a general crisis of confidence that affected both the financial sector and the publics' expectations concerning the development of the economy. It is therefore reasonable to believe that a turnaround requires the restoration of confidence. However, it is difficult to find any exact and stable link between confidence indicators and actual economic development. So, in this context too there is scope for different assessments when it comes to interpreting the economic situation and the consequences for monetary policy. New and difficult monetary policy considerations recently  No longer a conflict of objectives When I took up my post as a member of the Executive Board, there was no longer really a conflict between upholding the inflation target and stabilising the real economy. Energy and food prices began to fall already in the summer of 2008. The global financial crisis that hit with full force in the autumn of 2008 contributed to a dramatic economic downturn in both Sweden and abroad. This reinforced the rapid fall in inflation. At the monetary policy meetings that I participated in during the spring and summer it was easy to make decisions about the direction of changes to the repo rate. Both inflation and the economic situation justified reductions in the interest rate and the repo rate was indeed cut, first to 0.5 per cent in April and then to the all-time low of 0.25 per cent in July. Any textbook on macroeconomics would have prescribed a cut in such a situation. However, the monetary policy decisions during the spring and autumn were still complicated. The difficult question, at least from my point of view, was how much should the repo rate be reduced. Because we had cut the repo rate so quickly and substantially during the autumn of 2008 and early 2009, the scope for pursuing traditional monetary began to shrink as the repo rate began to approach its lower limit. Determining what level is the repo rate's lower limit also proved to be difficult. Can the repo rate be cut all the way to zero, or even to a negative level? There is no clear answer to these questions. However, in line with the majority of the Executive Board, my assessment in July was that the repo rate should not be cut beyond 0.25 per cent. The reasons for this were the concern that some financial markets would find it difficult to function normally at lower interest rate levels and that it could have a negative impact on the profitability of the banks. My view was that the economic situation in principle called for an even greater cut. At the same time, I thought it was too risky to reduce the repo rate even more when we did not really know how the financial markets would function with such low interest rates. One can note after the event that cutting the repo rate to 0.25 per cent was carried out without any apparent problems. In this perspective, the fears that I had in July would seem to be somewhat exaggerated. On the other hand, I believe that it is worthwhile for a central bank to act with some caution in areas where it does not have any previous experience to draw on. This is why I feel that it was justified to reduce the repo rate in small stages when we were already at a record-low level in the initial position. BIS Review 111/2009 3 
Measures when the interest rate is close to zero What then should a central bank do when the policy rate can not be lowered to the level justified by the state of the real economy? Many central banks have struggled with this question during this crisis. One possibility is to allow the policy rate to remain at the lowest possible level for a longer period than would otherwise have been required. The effects of such a decision can also be reinforced in several ways. The central bank can, for example, lend money to the banks at a fixed interest rate at a maturity that corresponds to the period during which the policy rate is expected to remain at this low level. This can increase the credibility of the forecast that the rate will remain unchanged in the year ahead. It should also push down some interest rates at longer maturities. We decided to implement both of these measures. Since the monetary policy meeting in February, our forecast has comprised a low repo rate during a relatively long period of time. At the monetary policy meetings in July and September 2009, we also decided to lend money to the banks for one year at a fixed interest rate. The Riksbank's current monetary policy has to be characterised as highly expansionary. Such a policy may lead to fears of a too high level of inflation in the future. Personally, I do not think that such fears are justified. The inflation target is, as usual, the focal point of our repo rate decisions. However, as long as the target is not threatened we should do what we can to contribute to the stable development of production and employment. This is why we believe there is a need to keep the repo rate at an exceptionally low level for an unusually long period of time. It does not appear that inflation will be a major problem, while various measures of resource utilisation indicate that it will remain very low over the year ahead. Monetary policy and financial stability The financial crisis has led to a discussion about whether monetary policy should also take into account signs of the development of financial bubbles and aim to counteract such tendencies. This is an important discussion that I and others in the world of central banking will have reason to return to. One of the explicit tasks of the Riksbank is to promote stability and an efficient payment system. The Riksbank will therefore, whatever the circumstances, take measures if the stability of the system is threatened. This task has, for example, been the reason for the crisis measures that the Riksbank has taken since the autumn. However, we need to discuss whether situations can arise in which flexible inflation targeting conflicts with the aim of promoting financial stability. If so, should interest-rate policy be modified or is it more appropriate to use other instruments to, for example, counteract the development of financial bubbles? I have no ready answers to these questions today. They partly relate to the question of the causes of the current financial crisis. Has monetary policy contributed to the crisis through low interest rates or do the causes lie in entirely different factors, such as global imbalances and/or inadequate regulation and supervision of the financial markets? The analysis of the causes of the crisis has begun, but it is still far too soon to draw any clear conclusions about the contribution of different factors. The current economic situation But what are the prospects for the economy in the period ahead and what challenges are we facing now? The financial crisis reinforced the international economic downturn. It is therefore natural to expect that a recovery will only come when the situation on the international financial markets has normalised. Stabilisation of the financial sector The situation on the financial markets has continued to improve during the summer. This is reflected by the fact that risk premiums on the interbank market, for example the TED and basis spreads, have fallen to levels close to those that applied before the outbreak of the 4 BIS Review 111/2009 
financial crisis in both Sweden and abroad (see Figure 1). The stock market has also recovered strongly. Swedish companies have gradually found it easier to find funding on the international capital markets. But the situation is still strained. The interest rates offered to Swedish companies are high in comparison to the interest rates for government securities, that is the credit spreads are still high. In addition, corporate demand for export guarantees is much higher at present than has been the case previously. This indicates that the funding situation of the companies is still strained. International economic activity show signs of recovery Since the monetary policy meeting in July, signs have emerged of a slowdown in the economic downturn abroad. In some countries, there are now even signs of a recovery. This can be seen, for example, if we look at world trade, which has now begun to stabilise following the collapse at the start of the year (see Figure 2). Both outcomes and indicators of future economic growth have stabilised or shown an upturn in most regions. In Asia, in particular, growth has clearly picked up during the second quarter of this year (see Figure 3). This is because domestic demand in China has increased, which in turn stimulates exports in the Asian countries. Nevertheless, although the positive signs of a recovery that we could already see in July have strengthened, there is still uncertainty about future developments. In the USA, which is suffering its most prolonged recession since the 1940s, there are signs of a light at the end of the tunnel. The housing market has improved and the statistics indicate that the fall in house prices has come to a halt (see Figure 4). After four quarters of falling GDP, growth in the third quarter is now expected to be positive (see Figure 5). The labour market is continuing to weaken, however, and unemployment has reached almost 10 per cent, which is an unusually high figure for the USA. Development in the euro area has been somewhat better than our assessment in early July. It appears that the fall in GDP has come to a halt. Several of the major economies have even reported positive GDP growth. However, the situation on the labour market has deteriorated further. Unemployment is almost at the same level as in the USA.  The fall in Sweden's GDP is slowing down Development in a small open economy like Sweden is highly dependent on the development of economic activity abroad and Sweden has also been hit hard by the severe international downturn. GDP has fallen for five quarters in a row. However, since the beginning of the second quarter of this year this fall has slowed down and GDP even increased somewhat between the first and second quarters (see Figure 6). Furthermore, indicators for development in the third quarter, such as the purchasing managers’ index and the Economic Tendency Survey, point to the recovery coming slightly sooner than we previously believed. We have therefore revised our forecast for growth in 2009 upwards slightly. But the recovery will begin from a very low level. Sweden’s GDP is now expected to fall by 4.9 per cent this year compared with last year. This is the largest decline in Swedish GDP in an individual year since 1940. The labour market is still showing weak development Despite the slightly brighter picture of economic growth, the situation on the labour market is expected to be gloomy for some time to come (see Figure 7). This is because the labour market can not improve as long as the companies have unutilised resources and still need to reduce their workforces. Unemployment is therefore expected to increase both this year and next year. Our assessment is that unemployment will not increase again until 2011. BIS Review 111/2009 5 
Inflation is currently low  Inflation has fallen rapidly since the end of last year and we believe that it will be negative for a large part of the year. The fact that inflation, measured in terms of the Consumer Price Index, the CPI, has fallen so quickly is primarily due to the fall in energy prices and mortgage costs. Inflation measured in terms of the CPIF, in which mortgage rates are kept constant, is more stable but it is expected to be below 2 per cent for most of the forecast period (see Figure 8). My view of the situation At the latest monetary policy meeting, I advocated an unchanged repo rate and repo rate forecast. This was also the decision made by the majority. As in July, we also decided to offer our monetary policy counterparties loans at a fixed interest rate for one year. As I mentioned earlier, this can strengthen expectations that the repo rate will remain at the decided level throughout the maturity of the loans and also contribute to lower interest rates for households and companies in other ways. Many analysts felt that the decision to leave the repo rate unchanged was self-evident. The decision to retain the same repo rate path that we adopted in July was perhaps more unexpected. I will explain the reasoning that led to my conclusion that this constitutes a well-balanced monetary policy. There are several factors to take into account in this decision. Perhaps the most obvious factor is the change in the economic prospects. As I mentioned earlier, the forecast for GDP growth in Sweden has been revised upwards somewhat. Irrespective of which indicators you look at, resource utilisation is still very low in Sweden and abroad and the development of employment is expected to be weak throughout next year. There is also great uncertainty about how strong and stable the recovery will be. It is positive that there has been a clear improvement in the situation on the financial markets. This reduces the risk of a serious setback. On the other hand, the situation on these markets has not completely normalised. Central banks around the world will continue to use various measures to help the banks find funding. The extensive fiscal policy stimulation measures that have been and are being implemented in all the major economies have in all likelihood helped to dampen the fall in GDP. But, they are also leading to increases in national debts. This can create anxiety among the households and thus entails a risk that recovery will stop short.  Nevertheless, the situation looks brighter today than it did a couple of months ago. This in itself justifies a somewhat tighter monetary policy than that which we regarded as a well-balanced monetary policy in July. However, there are also factors that can have the opposite effect and thus represent arguments for a more expansionary monetary policy. The development of the krona has been stronger than we expected. Just as it is difficult to explain the earlier weakening of the krona in terms of developments in the Swedish economy, it is difficult to explain the recent appreciation in the krona. The best explanation might be that it is a question of an adjustment towards more normal levels after the exchange rate had strongly deviated from its long-term reasonable rate. However, a strengthening of the krona weakens inflation. As inflation is expected to be slightly below the target over the coming years – and now I am referring to inflation adjusted for the effect of interest rate changes on housing costs – this is something that in itself could be an argument for a more expansionary monetary policy. The brighter economic prospects thus point towards a tighter monetary policy, while the stronger krona points towards a more expansionary monetary policy. I believe that there is more uncertainty about the development of the krona in the period ahead than about the development of economic activity. I therefore attach relatively little importance to the krona when assessing what would be a well-balanced monetary policy. 6 BIS Review 111/2009 
This means that I instead place greater importance on the improved economic prospects. However, despite the fact that prospects now seem a little brighter, it is still the case that resource utilisation is expected to be significantly below normal over the next few years. This means that there is still a need for monetary policy stimulation to stabilise the real economy. Nor does it appear that such stimulation will conflict with the inflation target. Inflation measured in terms of the CPIF is expected to be slightly below the target of 2 per cent in the next few years. All in all, there is therefore nothing at the moment that calls for a tightening of monetary policy at a faster rate than in our assessment in July.  Nor can I see, as economic activity has improved, any weighty reasons for making monetary policy more expansionary by reducing the repo rate even further. The adopted line, with a repo rate of 0.25 per cent that is expected to remain unchanged for several quarters, represents a very expansionary monetary policy. My view is that this policy should only be changed if inflation and/or the economic situation change considerably compared to our current forecasts. Concluding remarks I have now shared with you some of my experiences during my early months as a member of the Executive Board of the Riksbank. I realised already when I accepted the job that it would not be easy. However, the fact that monetary policy decision-making is not as straightforward as it appears in theory only serves to make the job even more exciting. A well-balanced monetary policy presupposes that we arrive at a reasonable balance between achieving the inflation target and stabilising the real economy. A reasonable balance requires in turn that we can effectively measure how much inflation deviates from the target and how resource utilisation relates to its normal level. We have fairly good measures of inflation, although it has been a problem recently that our main measure of inflation, the CPI, is so highly affected by our own repo rate decisions through their effects on housing costs. Consequently, at our most recent monetary policy meetings we have almost exclusively focused on alternative measures from which housing costs are excluded.  The problems concerning how measures of resource utilisation relate to the normal level are, however, greater. It is difficult enough to measure resource utilisation, but it is even more difficult to measure what its normal level is. Instead we have to weigh together different measures and indicators in a reasonable way. This of course provides greater scope for a wider range of assessments. The financial crisis has, not least, also raised the question of to what extent monetary policy should take financial stability into account. This is an important question that should be analysed further.  Let me conclude by saying that it appears that the fiscal policy and monetary policy stimulation measures that are being implemented throughout the world are beginning to have the desired effects. The situation in the financial sector has improved and an economic recovery is now discernable. But it is still uncertain whether the recovery is stable or whether there is a risk that it will come to a halt as soon as the fiscal policy and monetary policy stimulation measures are phased out. Deciding the appropriate time to begin the phase-out of the now very extensive monetary policy stimulation measures is a major challenge. If the phase-out begins too early there is a risk that the recovery will come to a halt. If we wait too long, there is a risk that we will need to increase the repo rate very quickly in order to meet the inflation target. This is a balance that is much easier to achieve in theory than in practice! However, as I have explained here today, my assessment at the latest monetary policy meeting was that it will still be necessary to keep the repo rate at this low level for a long time to come.  Thank you!  BIS Review 111/2009 7

T T Mboweni: Overview of the South African economy Address by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the 89th ordinary general meeting of shareholders, Pretoria, 17 September 2009. *      *      * Introduction The past year has witnessed the most severe global economic downturn since the 1930s. At the time of the previous annual general meeting, the impact of the financial market crisis was becoming evident in various economies. However, at that stage the extent and depth of the global recession were still to be realised. In response to the slowdown, central banks and governments around the world have taken unprecedented and unconventional steps to protect their banking systems and economies. In South Africa the well-regulated banking system was relatively insulated from the fallout. However, the globalised nature of the downturn meant that the domestic economy was not spared, and the resulting domestic recession required appropriate fiscal and monetary policy responses. These developments posed a new challenge to monetary policy and resulted in a renewed focus on matters of financial stability. Appropriate supervision and regulation of the domestic banking sector and payment system have ensured an orderly financial market environment. Although inflation was outside the target range, the stance of monetary policy was loosened significantly in the face of an expected moderation in inflation and a weakening economy. Nevertheless, some upside risks to the inflation outlook remained and this constrained the monetary policy response somewhat. Apart from these concerns, the South African Reserve Bank (the Bank) also focused on maintaining and improving its internal operations. A comprehensive economic report, which is included as part of the Annual Report 2008/09, provides an analysis of developments in the domestic and international economy during the year under review. Particular emphasis is placed on those developments that have had implications for the operations of the Bank. As is usually the case, the focus of this address is on the main operational areas of the Bank. Monetary policy During the past year, monetary policy has been faced with new challenges. For the first time since the introduction of the inflation-targeting framework in 2000, monetary policy had to be implemented in the context of a domestic recession and against the backdrop of the severe and synchronised downturn in the world economy. At the same time, inflation remained well above the upper end of the inflation target range and, despite the downside pressures, targeted inflation was only moderating at a very slow rate. At the time of the previous annual general meeting, inflation was significantly outside the target range. The consumer price index excluding mortgage interest cost (CPIX) inflation peaked at 13,6 per cent in August 2008 and declined to 10,3 per cent by December. With the publication in February 2009 of the reweighted and rebased inflation measure, headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation for all urban areas was adopted as the new inflation target measure, with the target range remaining at 3 to 6 per cent. CPI measured 8,1 per cent in January, but increased to 8,6 per cent in February and has been declining gradually since then. By July, CPI inflation had declined to 6,7 per cent. However, the pace of decline has been constrained by substantial increases in some administered prices, particularly electricity prices, and persistently high food price inflation. As a result of the global turmoil, the outlook for inflation was subject to greater risk and uncertainty than usual, and this complicated monetary policy decision-making. Furthermore, BIS Review 110/2009 1 
the assessment of risks changed significantly in the course of the year in line with the reversal in the trends of a number of factors impacting on inflation. The international oil price had been one of the main sources of upside risk to the inflation outlook during 2008. However, in response to the global downturn, the price of North Sea Brent crude oil declined from levels of around US$146 per barrel in August 2008 to around US$34 in December. Domestic petrol prices followed suit and declined from R10,70 per litre in July 2008 to R6,01 per litre in January 2009. However, as global growth prospects improved, the oil price has recently increased to around US$70 per barrel. Nevertheless, as a result of exchange rate developments, the domestic petrol price is still lower than the levels that prevailed in 2008 and has contributed to downward pressure on inflation during the year to date. The behaviour of the rand exchange rate during the past year has reflected the volatile global environment. In the early stage of the unfolding crisis, the rand came under pressure, along with the currencies of most other emerging-market economies. In November the rand had depreciated to around R11,85 against the US dollar, and at the December meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the exchange rate was identified as the single biggest upside risk to the inflation outlook. However, as risk aversion abated, the rand recovered somewhat over the subsequent months and the risk to the inflation outlook from this source was reduced significantly. The rand has recently been at levels close to those prevailing in the first half of 2008. Global developments also reduced the risk to the inflation outlook. The synchronised global recession and generally lower commodity prices meant that the threat to world inflation had dissipated substantially. While there are concerns about the possible inflationary consequences of the accommodating monetary policy stance in a number of advanced economies, global inflation is expected to remain contained at low levels. The widening domestic output gap during the past period also posed a downside risk to the inflation outlook. After a number of years of growth of around 5 per cent, the economy began to slow to rates below potential output growth. The economy grew at an annualised rate of 0,2 per cent in the third quarter of 2008, but the full impact of the slowing world economy on the domestic economy became more evident in subsequent quarters. In the final quarter of 2008 a contraction of 1,8 per cent was recorded. In the first two quarters of 2009 the economy contracted at annualised rates of 6,4 per cent and 3,0 per cent respectively. Final consumption expenditure by households has been contracting since the third quarter of 2008. The weaker domestic demand was a result of declining real disposable incomes and employment, and negative wealth effects as a consequence of the significant decline in equity and house prices. The negative trend in consumption expenditure was reinforced by a significant deceleration in the growth of credit extension to the private sector. This was in response to both lower demand for, and restricted supply of, credit as banks applied stricter lending criteria in view of the increasing number of impaired loans. Despite these factors that were generally conducive to a decline in the inflation rate, there were other pressures and risks to the upside. Administered prices continued to exert upward pressure on inflation. The biggest thrust came from the electricity price increase of 27,5 per cent granted to Eskom in 2008, followed by a further increase of 31,3 per cent announced in June 2009. Wage settlements in excess of inflation have also posed a threat to the inflation outlook. These settlements partly reflected the deterioration of inflation expectations over the period. Food price inflation was the main contributor to overall inflation over the past year. This was despite significant declines in the prices of agricultural commodities, which were reflected at the producer price level with respect to both agricultural products and manufactured food. Nevertheless, food price inflation at the consumer price level has remained stubbornly high. However, there have been recent indications that the pace of moderation in food price inflation may be accelerating. 2 BIS Review 110/2009 
In response to the downward trend in actual and forecast inflation, the monetary policy stance has been eased progressively by a cumulative 500 basis points since December 2008. The repurchase rate was reduced by 50 basis points at the December 2008 meeting of the MPC and by a further 100 basis points at each of the four subsequent meetings. At the June 2009 meeting the monetary policy stance remained unchanged, but at the August meeting the repurchase rate was reduced by a further 50 basis points as the committee assessed that the risks to the inflation outcome had tilted further to the downside. The easing in monetary policy was applied despite the fact that inflation was still outside the inflation target range. However, in a forward-looking monetary policy framework the MPC focuses on the expected path of inflation. Although subject to a high degree of variability and uncertainty, the inflation forecast during this past period has consistently indicated that inflation was expected to return to within the inflation target range over a reasonable time horizon. The MPC continued to apply monetary policy within a flexible inflation-targeting framework, cognisant of the economic downturn. Nevertheless, price stability remains the ultimate objective of monetary policy and the Bank remains committed to achieving the target over a reasonable time frame. Money-market operations In response to the consequences of the global financial market crisis, many central banks injected large amounts of liquidity into their money markets. However, domestic markets remained characterised by excess liquidity conditions and, therefore, no additional liquidity had to be provided to domestic banking institutions. In order to drain the excess liquidity, the Bank issued South African Reserve Bank (SARB) debentures and conducted reverse repurchase transactions. Liquidity was also drained from the money market through increases in the balances of the accounts held at the Bank by banks and the public sector, and increases in notes and coin in circulation. In the year to the end of August 2009 these factors were jointly responsible for draining a total amount of approximately R6,9 billion from the money market. The excess liquidity is partly associated with the increase in foreign-exchange reserves over the past years. Foreign-exchange reserves The pace of accumulating foreign-exchange reserves by the Bank declined considerably as a result of the turmoil in the international financial markets. At the end of August 2009 the official gross gold and foreign-exchange reserves amounted to US$38,0 billion and the international liquidity position amounted to US$36,9 billion. The Bank will continue with its strategy of accumulating reserves when market conditions are favourable. However, further accumulation is expected to be constrained by the volatility in the foreign-exchange markets, the level of global risk aversion and the cost of sterilisation. Managing the foreign-exchange reserves poses considerable challenges, particularly in the current uncertain global financial market conditions. As capital preservation represents one of the main pillars of the reserves management policy of the Bank, various steps have been taken to protect South Africa’s reserves from the instability and volatility experienced in these markets. Accordingly, counterparty risks, exposure to specific asset classes and the overall duration of the reserves portfolio were reduced, and the Bank’s conservative investment guidelines were tightened further. However, the demise of Lehman Brothers, in particular, gave rise to a series of downgrades in the credit ratings of financial institutions and investment instruments, which resulted in mark-to-market declines or unrealised losses in the value of some of the instruments on the balance sheet of the Bank. A comprehensive review of the external fund management programme was conducted during the year under review. The mandates of three of the existing fund managers will be BIS Review 110/2009 3 
renewed and three new managers will be appointed in September 2009, bringing the total number of external fund managers to six. Currency distribution Currency counterfeiting generally remains a risk to the Bank and the economy. Continuous efforts are being made to combat counterfeiting and to ensure the integrity of currency in circulation. The Bank has initiated a process for the introduction of a new series of banknotes and coin with new themes and improved security features. It is envisaged that the new currency series will be launched by mid-2013. The national payment system The Bank, in conjunction with the settlement banks, has been concentrating on the development and implementation of a national payment system information database, and a review of the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) network infrastructure and associated applications. A review of the current RTGS system – the South African Multiple Option Settlement (SAMOS) – indicated that the system was of a world-class standard. Potential enhancements to the SAMOS infrastructure and applications are due to be made in consultation with stakeholders during 2009. Although volumes and values of payment transactions increased substantially during the financial market volatility in September and October 2008, the operations and liquidity provision of the settlement system and associated foreign-exchange Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system performed well and without disruptions. In October 2008 the SAMOS system settled a record aggregate value of R8,5 trillion. The Bank continued its role as part of the CLS system oversight group chaired by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. During the year the Bank and other participating central banks signed a CLS oversight protocol arrangement. CLS oversight arrangements and processes were thoroughly and successfully tested during the financial market crisis in September and October 2008. Financial stability Financial stability is of vital interest to central banks and, with the evolution of the global financial crisis, renewed attention has been paid to financial stability policy responses. Some central banks have responded by adopting more explicit and broader mandates for financial stability. The crisis also highlighted the need for macroprudential analysis of the financial system as a whole in order to identify and mitigate systemic risks. The Bank continually seeks to identify inherent weaknesses in the financial system and monitors risks that may result in financial system disturbances. Financial institutions and markets in South Africa were spared the worst of the direct effects of the global financial crisis as they were largely shielded by their limited exposure to risky foreign assets and liabilities. Developments in the domestic financial infrastructure and regulatory environment that are likely to strengthen the resilience of the financial system include new legislative developments to improve competition, consumer protection and corporate governance. Bank regulation and supervision As part of its bank supervision function, the Bank maintained its focus on promoting the soundness of the domestic banking system through the effective and efficient application of international regulatory and supervisory standards. The implementation of Basel II on 4 BIS Review 110/2009 
1 January 2008 and the application of the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision remain the cornerstones of the Bank’s regulatory and supervisory framework. The Bank continued to refine its Basel II-revised regulatory and supervisory approach during 2008 and 2009 by attending, inter alia, to the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Processes implemented by banks; thematic reviews of credit, market and operational risk; and the processing of applications by banks to use the advanced approaches to calculate their minimum capital requirements in respect of credit and operational risk. In line with international developments, the Bank held discussions with the banking industry on the stress-testing frameworks it implemented. In addition, the Bank continued to develop its own internal stresstesting expertise and methodology to facilitate the effective monitoring of the stress-testing frameworks of banks. The secondary effects of the international financial market turmoil, combined with cyclical economic developments in South Africa, worsened the operating environment of the banking sector during 2008 and the first half of 2009, with a significant decline in the rate of growth in loans and advances. Furthermore, increasing pressure on consumers continues to be clearly evident in the marked increase in impaired advances and rising credit impairments, which impact negatively on the earnings of banks. However, the South African banking system remains stable and banks are adequately capitalised. In response to the international financial market turmoil, the Bank commissioned an independent review of all securitisation schemes in which domestic banks were participating in order to determine whether such schemes were being managed prudently. Although no material issues were identified, the recommendations in the final report will be used as the basis for further consultation with the banking industry and for possible legislative and/or regulatory framework amendments in future. International co-operation The Bank addresses itself to regional and continental programmes that promote future regional integration. The Bank hosts the Secretariat of the Committee of Central Bank Governors (CCBG) in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and supports the implementation of CCBG projects. The SADC Finance and Investment Protocol (FIP) was ratified by the South African Parliament in 2008 and work has begun in the various committees. Of note is the completion of the drafting of the proposed SADC central bank model law, which will pave the way for the harmonisation of the legal and regulatory frameworks of SADC central banks. The Bank plays a leading role in the SADC payment system project. During the past year the focus has been on the efficiency of electronic settlement systems and the collection of payment system statistics. Further work is being done on the interlinking of payment systems on a regional basis and the efficiency of remittance payment systems in the region. The Bank participated in several initiatives to strengthen financial systems in SADC. The Bank hosted or organised a number of regional workshops and conferences for SADC central banks in conjunction with international training institutions. These institutions included the International Monetary Fund Institute, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Toronto Centre. Participation in multilateral forums such as the Group of 20 (G-20) and the Financial Stability Board increased in the wake of the global financial and economic crisis. South Africa, as an active member of the G-20, contributed to the formulation of the co-ordinated G-20 response to the global financial crisis. The Bank also continues to foster relations with the BIS, and participates in a number of BIS committees and forums, including the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. BIS Review 110/2009 5 
Internal administration The Annual Report 2008/09 of the Bank was distributed to shareholders before this meeting. The total assets of the Bank show an increase from R300 billion at the end of March 2008 to R344 billion at the end of March 2009. The Bank was not unaffected by the turmoil in the world’s financial markets. Low yields on prime investments and the collapse in prices of many traded financial instruments caused a decline in net income after tax from R2,5 billion in the previous financial year to R0,9 billion in the 2008/09 financial year. Operational expenditure is budgeted to increase by 22 per cent in the current financial year. This increase is due to an increase of 42 per cent in the production cost of currency; stock building of currency for the 2010 FIFA World Cup tournament; delivery of back orders of currency in respect of the previous financial year; and significant repairs and maintenance to Bank premises. The four subsidiary companies of the Bank, namely the South African Mint Company, the South African Bank Note Company, the South African Reserve Bank Captive Insurance Company and the Corporation for Public Deposits, achieved their objectives during the financial year. After a review of reports by their boards of directors, and internal and external auditors, the Bank is satisfied that the subsidiaries have continued to be managed in accordance with their objectives and best corporate governance practice. The results of the subsidiaries are reported on a consolidated basis with those of the Bank in the financial statements in the Annual Report 2008/09. The shares of the Bank continued to trade through the over-the-counter trading facility. During the 2008/09 financial year, 40 transactions were concluded, representing 57 980 shares. The permanent staff complement of the Bank increased by 34 in the year and totalled 1 930 at the end of the financial year. The overall staff turnover for the period was 6,2 per cent; slightly lower than in the previous year. In terms of overall employment equity, the percentage of black employees has increased by 2 percentage points to 60 per cent, compared with a target of 50 per cent for 2009. At management level an increase of 2 percentage points was also achieved. While the Bank has made advances with regard to gender representation generally, female representation at the more senior levels remains a priority area. The Bank consulted widely on employment equity, resulting in the implementation of a programme to educate and sensitise employees about disability issues. The Bank completed its disability verification process in which employees were given the opportunity to declare their disability status voluntarily. Performance management had previously been identified as the only remaining barrier to employment equity in the Bank. A task team investigated the Bank’s performance management system and made recommendations for improvement. The revised system is being implemented. As part of the Bank’s HIV/AIDS programme, almost 70 employees were trained to serve as peer counsellors. The programme is an ongoing initiative, and the next phase will address voluntary counselling and testing. The Bank continues to emphasise training and development. In the period under review the Bank received R2,4 million in the form of mandatory grants for complying with the reporting regulations of the Skills Development Act, 1998 (Act No. 97 of 1998). Seven students have completed learnerships and have all been appointed to permanent positions in the Bank. The Bank has also approved a new policy for external bursaries and 25 university students in their second year of study have been granted financial assistance. 6 BIS Review 110/2009 
Besides the general central banking programmes offered, the Bank organised and hosted a number of specialised courses and seminars. Topics included the flow of funds, advanced econometric and computational methods, financial stability, and currency management. The Bank strives to promote a research culture in the Bank and a number of joint research projects have been completed under the auspices of the Visiting Research Fellows Programme. In October the Bank hosted its biennial conference with the theme “Challenges for Monetary Policy-makers in Emerging Markets”. The conference proceedings were published in book form and on the website of the Bank. The Bank has initiated work on an integrated workforce plan to ensure that Bank employees have appropriate skills. The plan will address the continuity of skills and ensure the effective transfer of the intellectual knowledge essential for the successful operations of the Bank. A number of the Bank’s branch buildings have been assigned heritage status, which creates challenges for cash-handling requirements, energy efficiency, environmental friendliness, the provision of uninterrupted power supply, fire-detection systems and access for people with disabilities, while preserving the integrity of the buildings. Most of the planned upgrades, additions or alterations to the branches have either been completed, have reached the construction stage or are near this stage pending the successful completion of the planning and tendering processes. The new Bloemfontein branch building is being designed. The existing fire-detection and evacuation communication systems at Head Office and in the Durban branch are being replaced to comply fully with health and safety regulations. Finally, the Bank has made considerable progress with the implementation of the new enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, which is expected to enhance the efficiency of internal processes. The ERP will integrate the data and processes from various business units, and should offer numerous benefits to the Bank, including the introduction of proven best practices and the decommissioning of more than 20 legacy systems that have become difficult to maintain. The ERP should be fully implemented before the end of 2009. Conclusion Although the worst of the global downturn appears to be behind us, the recovery is expected to be slow and protracted. The domestic economy also appears set to recover somewhat in the coming months, and domestic inflation is expected to continue its moderating trend as a result of downward pressures from weak domestic demand and lower commodity prices. However, the rate of decline is being constrained by high and sustained administered price increases and wage settlements in excess of inflation. The Bank will continue to strive to achieve price stability within a flexible inflation-targeting framework in the interest of sustainable economic growth. The recent global financial market turmoil has highlighted the need for the Bank to maintain a commitment to financial stability. This includes the monitoring and supervision, where applicable, of the national payment system, the financial markets and the banking system. The domestic financial markets have come through the global banking crisis relatively unscathed. Nevertheless, credit impairments have been increasing, which poses a threat to the profitability of banks, and these trends will be monitored closely. Internally, the Bank will continue to concentrate on staff development, and to implement measures to retain staff and boost staff morale through more appropriate performance management. Emphasis will also be placed on enhancing the efficiency of the internal processes of the Bank and the introduction of the new ERP solution during the year is expected to contribute to this objective.

Anselmo L S Teng: Conference on human resources issues (closing remarks) Closing remarks by Mr Anselmo L S Teng, Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Macao, at the 12th Conference of Central Banks of Portuguese Speaking Territories on Human Resources, Macao, 16 September 2009. *      *      * Dear Delegates,  Ladies and Gentlemen,  In the past two days, we have listened to a series of professional and indepth deliberations on the big topic of human resources. The knowledge imparted to us will no doubt provide food for further thought and subsequent practical implementation. I am here today not to repeat what have been said, but to present to you my observations on human resources issues related to the recent financial tsunami.  What caused the financial crisis which triggered a recession not seen since 1930? The post-mortem report will tell you a number of reasons, such as excess liquidity, savings glut, carry trade etc. I would however share with you some of the causes which are related to human resources, the main theme of this conference.  The most popular motto on the Wall Street before the financial tsunami was “greed is great”. Remunerations of originators, traders and top level executives were based on profit of current period. Such a policy increased appetite on the part of employees to take unwarranted risks on behalf of the institutions they were working for.  It is never too late to mend. After all, we all learn from mistakes. It is therefore imperative in human resources management to devise a fair compensation scheme for financial institutions. It is my personal conviction that compensation for risk taking should be based on the following principles:  1) An executive compensation scheme should adequately reflect the performance of the executive in the medium and long term. Therefore, executives and traders should not be compensated based on current year revenue but the average income of a financial institution in a defined period. 2) Executives and traders who are compensated on deals done basis should never get their shares immediately after the completion of the transaction. There should be a vesting period to make sure that the profits are not illusory.  3) Compensation schemes based on deals done should be symmetrical. That is to say, when failures ensue, penalty should be imposed. This is to avoid the one way traffic of paying out enormous rewards once the transaction has been completed while the responsible staff would come out unscathed when the deal turns sour later.  To avoid another financial tsunami, a financial institution should adopt a check and balance approach in management. In the heyday, deal makers in a financial institution are the golden boys. They tended to disregard those who are supposed to control risks. Normally, when there was an argument over whether a certain deal should be done, the senior management, whose year-end bonus may depend on the current year revenue, or who are more concerned with the profit and loss account of the institution, would invariably stand on the side of the deal maker. This is usually the root of huge losses to be incurred later. To harness risks, the risk management function should be vested with more authority. The internal control function should go to board level. There should be a minimum level of knowledge of internal control to be required for all audit committee members. Knowledgeable internal controllers and anti-fraud experts may be hired by financial institutions to implement BIS Review 110/2009 1 
risk-assessment and fraud prevention measures. Measures and procedures are to be implemented to prevent management overriding internal control systems.  The greatest safety to ensure the stability however comes from self disciplined practitioners of the financial sector. Legislations and regulators are serving merely as directions and referees. It is the professional skills and ethics of practitioners which will give the greatest comfort and protection to a financial institution and hence the financial system as a whole. It is therefore the endeavour of human resources function to provide adequate training in these respects, especially ethics, in order to have a long term solution which warrants the stability of the financial system.  Macao returned to China in 1999. This year is the 10th Anniversary of the founding of the Macao Special Administrative Region. Under the principle of “One country, two systems”, “Macao people ruling Macao” and “High degree of autonomy”, Macao’s economy has grown by leaps and bounds. The financial sector has burgeoned in tandem with the spectacular performance of the overall economy. We have witnessed a surge in deposits, assets and profits in our financial sector. Capital adequacy ratio for the banking sector is well above what is required by the Basel Committee while non-performing loans ratio lingers at a low level. Our financial system is not immune to the financial tsunami but it has emerged unscathed. There is however no ground for complacency. The financial sector and the regulators are adopting a prudent and cooperative approach and have been working in harmony in the best interest of the community. We are doing our best to attract qualified people to join the financial work force with a view to maintaining the stability of our financial system.  Nowadays, the official languages of the MSAR are Chinese and Portuguese. In the wake of globalization, we have to utilize English as the medium language to communicate with other parts of the world. It would be perfect if all our staff are conversant with 3 languages. However, I should admit that personnel of such a qualification are very hard to find. We are striving to provide training to our practitioners in the financial sector so that financial practitioners are well versed in at least two of them. We believe a good communication is a job half done.  Last but not the least, please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Monetary Authority of Macao to all participants and to my colleagues including, of course, Mr. António Félix Pontes, for the great effort in making this Conference a success.  Finally, I do hope you will enjoy Macao and that we shall meet again in the not so distant future. Meetings and conferences held in Macao embody Macao as a service platform for economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese speaking countries.  Thank you again, please enjoy the rest of your stay in Macau and have a pleasant trip home! 2 BIS Review 110/2009 
S Budi Rochadi: Currency operations and management Opening address by Dr. S. Budi Rochadi, Deputy Governor of Bank Indonesia, at the SEACEN Seminar on Currency Operations and Management, Bali, 12 August 2009. *      *      * Distinguished Speakers, Honourable Guests, Respected Participants, Ladies and Gentlemen, Assalamu’alaikum wr. wb.and Good Morning. I am delighted to be here this morning to welcome all of you to the SEACEN seminar on Currency Operations and Management on this beautiful island of Bali. Before I begin, I would like to ask you all to join our hands together and thank the Almighty because it is only due to His blessings that we could gather here to attend the seminar in good health and excellent condition. This Seminar is intended to further enhance knowledge sharing among SEACEN members as well as between central bankers and industry in all pertinent issues of currency operation and management. Ladies and Gentlemen As we are all aware, the very traditional responsibility of a central bank is to issue and distribute currency to serve the country’s economy. It is hardly imaginable a modern economy could function smoothly without any cash transaction. Regardless of our achievement in advancing non-cash payment system, cash still remains a critical payment instrument. Fulfilling this responsibility is indeed not a simple thing. There are so many challenges in assuring that the society’s need of adequate currency in terms of quantity and quality for every denomination is met. This only can be achieved if we have an accurate demand for currency forecasting, a smooth currency procurement, and a reliable currency distribution system, which can cater any geographical condition and public preference for the currency. I am quite sure that all of the issuing authorities from SEACEN members are facing difficulties in conducting this task. Even though the problems could vary between countries, there is one thing among others that we share in common that is the accompanying problem with the rise in the number of population. In our case, this task is not made any easier by the fact that the Indonesia’s estimated population of around 240 million at the end of 2008 is spreading in almost a thousand inhibited islands. Another important issue that the central bank and issuing authority have to deal with considering its severe impact on the economy is the counterfeiting activity. Nowadays counterfeiters are becoming more advanced. To cope with that the central bank needs to increase their vigilance by continuously improving the security features of the currency to give protection and assurance to the public holding the currency. Ladies and Gentlemen, To achieve the goals mentioned above, the cooperation among issuing authorities and currency industries should be further deepened. This cooperation will provide safeguard to the proprietary techniques solely used to produce national currencies amidst the development of many security features and printing techniques today. Therefore, governments and security businesses involved, must constantly adjust their whole range of currency operation and management system from design, production, distribution, and destruction process. BIS Review 110/2009 1 
In this dynamic situation, communication and information sharing will help all members of the currency community to better understand and respond to the ever changing environment. Communication brings knowledge, which in turn means greater understanding for the community as a whole. However, communication does not necessarily mean revealing information that should be kept confidential nor does it mean disclosing commercial secrets or proprietary information. Ladies and Gentlemen, In this spirit of communication, I believe that the presence of our fellows from banknote security industry and other related institutions in this seminar will provide us an opportunity to obtain more valuable information that can broaden our perspective. In addition, information sharing among central bankers regarding experiences in managing our respective currencies could help each of us to improve efficiency and effectiveness in our daily job. Finally, may I now take a great pleasure in declaring the Seminar open and wishing this event a great success. Have a pleasant stay in Bali. Wassalamu’alaikum wr. Wb. Thank you. 2 BIS Review 110/2009 
Miranda S Goeltom: Opportunities for Indonesian investment through sharia financing – experiences and challenges Keynote speech by Prof Dr Miranda S Goeltom, Acting Governor of Bank Indonesia, at the International Seminar on Islamic Finance and Banking “Opportunities for Indonesian Investment through Sharia Financing – Experiences and Challenges”, New York, 17 July 2009. *      *      * Distinguished speakers and participants, Ladies and Gentlemen, May I ask you to join me in thanking God the Beneficent and Merciful for His unbounded grace that has enabled us to gather here today on such an important occasion, the International Seminar on Islamic Finance and Banking, entitled “Opportunities for Indonesian Investment through Sharia Financing: Experiences and Challenges”. I am thrilled to see so many distinguished speakers and participants, all prepared to contribute with their insightful experience and expertise. In my opinion, this seminar is of paramount importance in the midst of our efforts to discuss alternative solutions to avoid a repeat of the current economic and global financial crises. In such a deep global crisis we must seek ways to survive and, subsequently, return to our previously hard-earned growth and stability. This is precisely the time when collective action is required most, in order for us all to survive this global financial tsunami and emerge the other side stronger and wiser. Given the depth and systemic nature of the crisis, a wait-and-see approach or simply hoping that recovery will take place on its own is utterly unacceptable. The crisis and the current global financial system Ladies and Gentlemen, A number of analyses argue that the ongoing global financial crisis is inseparable from the effects of the global financial system. In the past decade, financial products have become more diverse, advanced and complex. This is attributable to the effect of innovative development in terms of information and technology, deregulation of supporting financial systems and a favorable global macroeconomic environment, including a low real interest rate. BIS data shows that global financial assets stock increased sharply from about 100% of global GDP in 1980 to over 300% in 2005. This development was further accompanied by expansive growth in the amount and scope of derivatives and financial instruments. The position of interest rate swap and other derivatives reached USD600 trillion at the end of 2007 (11 times annual global GDP) compared to USD75 trillion in 1997 (2.5 times global GDP). The position of Credit Default Swap (CDS) also reached five times that of global corporate bonds in 2007, which is a very different picture when compared to conditions in 2004, where the share of CDS was just 85% of corporate bonds. On the other hand, however, such developments also carried fatal side effects. Financial instruments have become more independent from their underlying transactions that should serve as the foundation. Risk assessment on the types of asset owned has also become more difficult and complex. We have further witnessed that the phenomenon of escalating activity in the global financial market turned out not to be permanent. BIS Review 109/2009 1 
As we have noticed, bubbles have burst and brought terrible impacts on the global economy since mid 2007. The most commonly used adjective to describe the current financial crisis is “unprecedented”. It is unprecedented in terms of the speed at which events unfolded and triggered a series of domino effects; the scale of the impact that has become global; and it is truly unprecedented in terms of the panoply of unconventional measures taken by authorities around the world. This is clear for all to see in the policy responses taken to overcome the crisis, which is incredibly complex and certainly costly. The IMF projected that global economic growth would contract from 3.2% in 2008 to -1.3% in 2009, whereas economic growth in developed countries is expected to be even worse, shrinking by -3.8%. IMF also predicted that total losses due to the current global financial crisis will top US$4 trillion, two-thirds of which stem from the banking sector. The crisis and the sharia financial system Ladies and Gentlemen, The lesson we can glean from this crisis is that a sound and resilient economy is not based on speculative activity. Furthermore, financial sector activity must be founded on business activities that produce real benefits to the public. This condition, in my opinion, implies that the behavior of the current financial system needs to be reset; going back to basics (khittah) as intermediary institutions that distribute funds from surplus units to deficit units. One alternative that has the potential to bolster back-to-basics principles would be to expand the role of the sharia financial system. This relates to the structural advantage of the sharia economic system, which does not permit speculative transactions or products without a real underlying transactions. A traditional sharia financial system focuses on conservative products and avoids exposure to high-risk financial instruments. Consequently, the dependence on financial instruments is comparatively low because investment in each financial instrument must be identified clearly and accurately. The key characteristics of the sharia financing system also aligns the role of banks to be consistent with their primary function, namely to collect funds from their owners and distribute it to borrowers. To be more precise, the main function of banks is to facilitate and finance activities associated with the supply of goods and services to the people; more specifically “real” activities. Therefore, financing activities through sharia banking are closely linked to real sector development. Moreover, speculation and gambling, the main culprits behind the on-going crisis, are not tolerated. Thus, by design, the Islamic financial system can instill greater stability in an economy. And, if implemented correctly, the Islamic financial system can provide an optimal risk management system. Sharia financial system performance Ladies and Gentlemen, The potential role of sharia financial institutions in the economy has been discussed on numerous occasions. According to The Banker magazine in 2007, sharia-compliant assets worldwide have grown by almost 30% per annum in recent years. Such growth outstrips most other business segments in financial services. In 2008, sharia financial assets worldwide reached $643 billion and are expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2010. In fact, there are currently more than 400 financial institutions offering sharia compliant products globally, including Sukuk, which has created significant demand in the market over the last five years. Countries like United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia are competing to become centers of Islamic finance. In such a competitive environment, Indonesia also has a great opportunity to advance itself as the center of Islamic finance. As the most populace Muslim country on the planet, with a population of more than 237 million, Indonesia is undoubtedly a promising market. 2 BIS Review 109/2009 
Since the establishment of its first Islamic bank in 1992, the sharia industry in Indonesia has exhibited relatively robust growth. Sharia banking is in its infancy since the establishment of the first Islamic bank in 1992, however, has demonstrated strong and steady growth. Business volume has grown expansively, exceeding the growth rate of the banking industry as a whole. Currently in Indonesia there are three full Islamic banks (FIBs), 19 Islamic Banking Units at Conventional Banks (IBUs), and 92 Islamic Rural Banks. As a whole, the industry is supported by 531 Islamic bank offices currently operating throughout Indonesia (288 FIBs, 121 IBUs and 92 rural banks). The sharia banking industry has amassed total assets amounting to Rp50 trillion (USD 4.2 billion), or 2.1% of all bank assets in Indonesia. This share has increased steadily from previous years: 1.4% in 2005, 1.6% in 2006, 1.8% in 2007 and 2.14% in 2008. With 1,470 branch offices spread over the country, the amount of financing provided by the industry has grown from a mere Rp 5.5 trillion (USD 458 million) in 2003 to Rp 28 trillion (USD 2.3 billion) in 2007 and Rp 38 trillion (USD 3.2 billion) in 2008. The industry has also shown its commitment to support micro and small-scale businesses with microcredit financing (KUR). By the end of 2008, total microcredit extended by sharia banks reached Rp 326 billion (USD 27 million). As a whole, the Islamic banking sector has grown at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 46% in the last five years. Notwithstanding, the Industry is expected to acquire a 15% market share of the total national banking system by 2015. With reference to the capital market, the first corporate sukuk was issued in early 2002, followed by tens of corporate sukuk issued over the subsequent years. Islamic capital market development was marked by its inclusion in the National Master Plan in 2005. As of December 2008, there were 22 corporate Islamic bonds issued under mudharabah and ijarah contracts totaling Rp 4.78 trillion (equivalent to USD 434.5 million), or approximately 2.7% of total bonds issued. Furthermore, there are currently 36 issuers of Islamic Mutual Funds, consisting of equity funds, fixed income funds and balanced funds. Net Asset Value (NAV) totals Rp1.8 trillion (USD163.64 million), approximately 3.5% of total NAV for mutual funds. Those promising sharia financial institutions are inextricably tied to strong political will from the stakeholders. In June 2008, the Islamic banking industry in Indonesia gained new momentum as Parliament passed a new Islamic Banking Act. In April of the same year, Parliament also enacted a new bill concerning Islamic Bonds. The promulgation of these two laws has provided a firm legal foundation for Islamic banking in the country, thus promoting the advancement of Islamic banking and finance. In August last year the Government successfully issued state sukuk and then in February of this year retail state sukuk were issued. Surely, this has contributed significantly to further catalyze the development of a wide-based retail secondary market for investment products that adhere to Islamic rules. Meanwhile, a bill to tax sharia transactions is being drafted, which we expect will be passed shortly. We hope that it will provide fairer tax treatment for sharia financial activities, thus making sharia products more competitive. Concerning the current global financial crisis, Indonesia’s sharia banking industry has remained relatively stable and insignificant affected. This fact is positively contribured by low exposure to international investment and foreign exchange transactions in Indonesia’s sharia banks. It is approximately just 5% of total assets and liabilities. Annual growth in assets, deposits and sharia banking financing remains high, at 29.5%, 27.1% and 26.08% respectively in May 2009. Stable sharia bank performance is also clearly evidenced by low industry-wide Non-Performing Financing (NPF) at just 6.19% in May 2009, despite a slight increase in March and April 2009. NPF has remained relatively steady compared to NPF in 2007 and 2008 at 6.62% and 5.75% respectively. With regards to capital, Tier-1 capital position also increased to Rp2.48 trillion, compared to its 2008 position of Rp2.19 trillion. However, we are aware that a lot of homework and groundwork still remains to be done. There are issues regarding the basic structure of sharia products, both for asset finance and BIS Review 109/2009 3 
fund raising or liability products. These products require further clarification and clearer guidance not only from the banks but also from the authorities. Another set of challenges that lie ahead in terms of further nurturing sharia finance is how to effectively introduce and sell related products to this potentially huge market. Sharia financing and Indonesia’s economic outlook Ladies and Gentlemen, We believe that the potential of sharia financing in Indonesia will continue to grow in the future. In a country with such a large Muslim population the potential for sharia product expansion is great. Currently, the number of sharia users is relatively still limited, namely 3.3 million fund account holders and 525 thousand financing account holders. The outlook for sharia financing in Indonesia is keep promising thanks to robust economic outlook. Indonesia’s economy, in fact, has outperformed many other countries in the region and peer group. Economic activities have been sustained by relatively strong domestic demand, capable of absorbing domestic production and preventing the market from falling deeper off the precipice of recession. In the first quarter, the economy recorded 4.4% growth, which far exceeds international economic growth. Whereas, economic growth in Quarter II-2009 is projected at between 3.7% and 4.0%, buoyed by consumption, which is projected to exceed 5%. Holistically, Bank Indonesia expects the economy to grow between 3.5% and 4.0% in 2009. Inflation in 2009 is projected to be lower than our initial forecast, possibly below 5%. This is affected by, among others, improving inflation expectations and sustainable food supply and distribution. However, Bank Indonesia continues to monitor potential inflationary pressures expected in 2010, including rising global commodity prices. In this context, future monetary policy is designed to strike an optimal balance between stimulating the domestic economy and maintaining macroeconomic and financial system stability in the mid term. We also believe that Indonesia’s growth prospects are supported by sustainable financial system stability. In the financial sector, CAR remains high at 17.3% and NPL is still in the safe zone; below 5%. Meanwhile, bank liquidity, including liquidity in the interbank money market, is improving and deposits have increased. Despite the limited response by bank interest rates and credit disbursements that are far slower than expected, the bank credit extension plan has shown indications of quicker expansion in the near future. Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me conclude my brief remarks by expressing that, from the point of view of a central bank in an emerging economy, the winds of change are indeed blowing. Dealing with the global financial crisis is paramount. Many of our working assumptions are constantly being challenged by this new reality, which requires creative and sound policy on our part and, more importantly, courage to implement bold, often unprecedented, measures. In this respect, we at Bank Indonesia believe that sharia financial institutions show great promise as one of cornerstone of future sustainable economic activity. Finally, I am sure that this Seminar will generate valuable insight and new ideas in terms of dealing with the global financial crisis. Bank Indonesia, as the monetary and banking authority in Indonesia, is ready to fully support the continued development of sharia finance in the country. We invite and warmly welcome all of you who wish to join with us and develop sharia finance. May God bless all of us with His mercy. 4 BIS Review 109/2009 
Njuguna Ndung’u: Growth and performance of the Kenyan banking sector Remarks by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, at the Launch of Southern Credit Banking Corporation Ltd International Mastercard Debit Card, Nairobi, 10 August 2009. *      *      * Chairman; Managing Director of Southern Credit Banking Corporation; Board Members;  Management and Staff; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen: I am delighted to be here this morning to join hands with the family of Southern Credit Banking Corporation Ltd in celebrating the launch of its MasterCard Debit Card. Allow me at the onset to appreciate the presence of the MasterCard Representative Assistant Vice President: Commerce Development, Mr. Charlton Goredema. I also wish to salute the Board, Management and Staff of Southern Credit Banking Corporation for successfully serving Kenyans in the last twenty seven years. I am pleased to note that your bank has expanded its network from the two branches at incorporation in 1982 to nine branches countrywide and has been in the forefront of innovations in electronic payments solutions in Kenya, a position that it first achieved with their Senator Card brand. Today, the bank is becoming a market leader with the launch of the first MasterCard Debit Card in Kenya and also in the region. It is also one of the only three banks in Kenya with the Acquirer status on the MasterCard franchise. The service will enable the bank’s existing customers transact business at more outlets, at their convenience, anywhere in the world. I commend the Board for this. Ladies and Gentlemen; This new service will provide an expansion of Kenya’s card market segment which is currently thin and requires patronizing by many of the bank customers. Similarly, the new product will go a long way in deepening the financial sector by facilitating payments. Mr. Chairman, Let me turn to growth of the banking sector and its performance, one of the main pillars of Kenya’s economic growth. Ladies and Gentlemen; Despite the local and global turbulences experienced over the past one year, the banking sector remained stable and exhibited resilience. The sector has continued to grow and expand both locally and regionally to new markets within the East African region and beyond. In addition, banks are posting good results for their second quarter ending June 2009. We commend the banking sector for the efforts in weathering storms of the global financial crisis and our own share of internal shocks. Mr. Chairman; Let me at this point mention some indicators of financial sector performance for the quarter ended June 2009 to show not only its resilience but its source of strength: • The Sector’s assets increased by 15% from Kshs.1.09 trillion in June 2008 to Kshs.1.26 trillion at the end of June 2009 as banks continued to expand their lending portfolio. • Deposits increased from Kshs.871bn in June 2008 to Kshs.954bn mainly due to deposit mobilization and expansion of branch networks by banks. • The Capital Adequacy Ratio stood at 19.8% above the statutory minimum of 12%. This is an indicator that the sector has a cushion against periodic shocks. BIS Review 109/2009 1 
• The sector’s average liquidity at end of June 2009 was 40.9% well above the statutory minimum of 20%. • The number of people employed by the sector increased from 24,435 at the end of June 2008 to 25,766 at the end of June 2009. • The number of branches at the end of June 2009 stood at 930 an increase of 158 branches from the corresponding period in 2008. • The number of accounts has similarly increased to 6.7m accounts from around 4 million accounts in the same period – shows we need to do more on this count. Ladies and Gentlemen, Our appeal to the banking sector is to put up strategies that will support and stimulate the private sector. Banks stand to benefit from a strong and vibrant private sector. The CBK has shown the industry the way by the recent successive reduction of the Central Bank Rate and Cash Reserve Ratio. It is good and encouraging for banks to post healthy profits, but also good in tandem with that to reduce the lending rates to encourage the private sector lending and financing both investments, working capital and reducing the risks of default. I would like to reiterate once more that the Central Bank welcomes initiatives and innovations by the banking sector in coming up with new products and is committed to the creation of an enabling regulatory environment towards this end. I would therefore urge the banking sector to seek diversification of their products in light of the dynamic banking environment to leverage on their growth and earnings. Such diversification of financial services like the Debit Card we are launching today do help to reduce transactions costs. But the banks should let us know how we can help to reduce risks and costs if they are the ones sustaining higher lending rates – but also keeping deposit rates low! Ladies and Gentlemen; It is now my honour and pleasure to declare Southern Credit Banking Corporation’s MasterCard Debit Card officially launched into the Kenyan market. Thank you. 2 BIS Review 109/2009 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Interview with Corriere della Sera Interview by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, conducted on 23 September 2009 by Ms Marika de Feo, Corriere della Sera. *      *      * Is the improvement in the financial markets in line with the new data coming out of the economy?  “There is a significant improvement in the functioning of the financial markets in comparison with a year ago. This was what we were aiming at, when we had to take very bold decisions after mid-September 08 (when Lehman collapsed), in order to permit the markets to function again. Back then, there was a systemic solvency issue, not only a systemic liquidity issue. And it is not surprising, taking into account what has been done by the central banks as well as by the Governments, that now we observe this improvement in the markets. There are other factors as well that are playing a positive role. In any case we monitor with great attention at this stage the interaction between the financial sphere and the real economy.”  Will growth be positive again earlier than in mid of 2010? “Our staff told us this month that the real economy could be a little bit better, in average, in 2009 and 2010 than what had been projected three months ago – 0.5% higher for each year. But is means that 2009 will remain very negative and 2010 perhaps only very slightly positive, as an average. I don’t exclude that we could observe positive growth, quarter on quarter, at the level of the euro area as a whole, before mid 2010. But this doesn’t change our main message. Namely, that we have a bumpy road ahead and that the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high and therefore that prudence and caution are of essence. Now much depend on us, on our capacity to reintroduce confidence in the financial and real economy decision making processes, in the households as well as in the corporate sector. It is what the ECB and the Eurosystem want to do: preserve confidence, inspire confidence, remain a solid anchor of confidence. ”  Can we conclude that you still fear a double-dip? “I said that we have to be prepared for a bumpy road ahead. We are in a situation where uncertainty remains: we could have, quarter on quarter, at times, positive figures, without excluding at times negative figures”. Now the G20 will replace the G8. Which is your opinion? “I think it is important that we have a progressive improvement in the global governance. The G20 should be given credit for being the place where global governance could be effective. The G20 is called to be essential, appropriately enlightened by the IMF, because we need to have both as good analytical presentations and diagnosis and the peer pressure of the G20. The G20 has to address the issues of the domestic large imbalances between savings and investments, and of the set of unsustainable external imbalances. We know that these imbalances have been at the roots of the present difficulties. If we don’t correct them, we’ll have the recipe for the next major crisis. And this of course would be totally unacceptable.” Could it be dangerous for the recovery, if governments would withdraw their support to the economy?  “One thing is sure. When time comes, systemic economies are not credible in going back to sustainable fiscal policy in the mid to long run. We won’t have the recovery which we are hoping for. Because Governments would not inspire confidence to households and corporate business. It is the evaporation of confidence that created this dramatic turmoil. Now we have to do everything to rebuild confidence.” When is the timing for a fiscal exit strategy? BIS Review 116/2009 1 
“The position of the Governing Council of the ECB is that the fiscal adjustment process should start, in any case, not later than the economic recovery and that the consolidated effort should be stepped up in 2011. This is the position for the euro area as a whole. Naturally some countries have more problems than others and they have to take into account their particular situation.”  In Germany and Italy there is a debate for cutting taxes – would it be a right way to support growth?  “The rule which is the best in terms of running a fiscal policy is: first, to be careful that the level of deficits in the mid-long term is in line with the Stability and Growth Pact; that the fiscal strategy is sustainable and inspire confidence. Second: to go to this position you need to reduce public expenditure. And third, if it is not enough, you have to increase taxes. Only in the case your reduction of spending is big enough to give you additional room you can embark on tax reductions. There is no other way to proceed. I’m not responding for Italy, or for a particular country, it is simple arithmetic.”  How can a high ratio of debt be reduced, especially in countries with low growth, like Italy? “Italy is not the only country with a high ratio. The reduction of the debt is a matter of appropriate decisions. It is true that, when global growth is relatively low, it make things more complicated. But a high level of national debt is hampering growth. So, regaining control of the debt dynamics and reducing the debt outstanding as a proportion of GDP is good for growth and foster medium- and long-term prosperity.”  The Governing Council will be in Venice in ten days. Can you suggest how Italy can regain its diminished competitiveness? “My responsibility – the responsibility of the Executive Board together with Lorenzo Bini Smaghi and Governing Council together with Mario Draghi - is for the euro area as a whole, for our 330 million fellow citizens. For the Italian diagnosis I rely very much on the analysis of Banca d’Italia and of Mario Draghi. I will say that for all countries permanent monitoring of the competitiveness indicators is absolutely of the essence. And that includes in particular a close monitoring of the unit labour costs and all appropriate efforts to develop and reinforce creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit in the economy as a whole.” Which assets does Italy have?  “I think that the potential of Italy is considerable, because it possesses a human resource which is of exceptional quality. The country has an entrepreneurial spirit which is quasi unique in the euro area, together with a capacity – including at very small enterprise level - to innovate which you don’t see in all countries. I trust that Italy as an economy has a lot of assets, which suggest, that its growth potential should be higher than what has been observed in the past years.” And which are the priorities? “Amongst many others an attentive monitoring of the unit labour costs is essential which suggests taking into account the productivity progress when you are augmenting salaries. Italy has in particular to regain competitiveness in comparison with the average of the euro area. This is very important.”  Why was the banking system in some European countries, like Italy and France, more resilient than in others? “Several countries had resilient banking systems, it is not necessary to single out Italy and France. There are a number of combinations of factors, which might have played a role. The structure of the banking sector, the importance of retail banking are probably important factors in this resilience together with the quality of banking surveillance by the central banks.”  2 BIS Review 116/2009 
Some experts say that structural reforms cannot be introduced in this moment of the crisis. What do you think about that? “I do not think it is true. Structural reforms are more important than ever. Part of the insufficient resilience of the various economies in the world as well as in the euro area is probably due to the insufficient structural reforms made in the past. It is also clear that the big challenges that we have for the future in term of fiscal policies will be solved only if we embark in structural reforms, because in a large number of domains it would be the only way to reduce public spending.”  Is the window of opportunity for introducing reforms of the financial system shrinking? “With the improvement observed in the financial markets some institutions and market participants might think that there is no need for the reforms designed at global level. It would be plain wrong to think that. The improvements observed are observed in particular because there have been bold decisions taken by central banks and by governments. They could not be repeated several times! We have to be fully aware of that. More than ever it is extremely important to introduce the necessary reforms in the financial system, in order to strengthen its resilience and avoid excessive booms and busts.” Is there a possibility, that increasing capital ratios of banks after the recovery could induce financial institutions to reduce lending in advance, slowing down growth? “We have to find out at a global level the appropriate balance between two considerations: in the long run we need capital requirements that are fully taking into account the long-term risks that exist in the financial sphere. At the same time, today we have to cope with an exceptional crisis situation and we have to be careful not to aggravate this situation by encouraging a deleveraging process which is adverse from the stand point of the recovery.” Did the Basel Committee and the FSB terms of reference found a balance between the long-term and the short-term consideration? “Yes. I think we captured this correct balance when we said, after the meeting of the governance body of the Basel Committee, on September 7th that we were requiring banks to move expeditiously to raise the level and quality of their capital to the new standards (which will be calibrated by end 2010) but in a manner that promotes the stability of national banking systems and the broader economy. That being said there are today ways for banks in Europe that need more capital to get it. For instance the recapitalisation option that has been set up by Governments is only utilised at the level of 55 %. The Governing Council calls on banks to take appropriate measures, where necessary, to strengthen further their capital bases and take full advantage of Government measures to support the financial sector.” Are you satisfied with the improvement going on? “It is a process which goes on, but that we strongly encourage.” “The ECB has financed the banks with around 600 billion euro. But they are not forwarding the funds to the real economy. What can be done to encourage lending?  “We are practising, in particular, moral suasion with banks, telling them that what the ECB is doing is not for the sake of being kind, but because we need them to finance the real economy. It is also true, that the demand for new credit is more modest than before the crisis, because of the recession. So when we are asking the mid-sized enterprises whether they had a positive response from banks to their request for new finance, a large majority, 77%, are responding yes whilst a minority of 12 % said no.” In which measure the present monetary policy, very expansionary on both sides of the Atlantic, is supporting the creation of a new bubble in the financial markets? “You know to which extent we are, in the ECB, in the Eurosystem attentive to do what is necessary at any time to ensure price stability in the medium- and long-term, in line with our BIS Review 116/2009 3 
definition - below 2 %, but close to 2% -. I trust that we are credible in this promise to be faithful to our mandate and that is the reason why we are solidly anchoring inflation expectations. And I take it that we are united in purpose – in delivering credibly price stability – on both sides of the Atlantic as well as on both sides of the Channel.” Which risks do you see for the exit strategy, especially if it is not going to be coordinated between both sides of the Atlantic? Is there a risk that the dollar could suffer of this? “As I just said we are united within the community of central banks: we want to deliver price stability. We don’t take the same decisions, because we are in different situations, dealing with different economies, facing different shocks, different levels of flexibility, different structures. As regards the floating currencies, I consider very important for the stability of the exchange rates and the prosperity of the global economy that Chairman Ben Bernanke, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and President Obama underline “that a strong dollar is in the interest of the US”. I trust that it is not only true but that it is also very important for the global economic stability.”  Which limitation to boni do you favour? “I’m in agreement with the FSB terms of reference which seems to me very appropriate. Seen from a central bank perspective, what is decisive is that the boni should not create incentives for taking absurdly high levels of risks that would materialise in a crisis of the type we are experiencing. The main problem, seen from our perspective is to be sure that the structure of remunerations is conducting to sound and wise decisions justified in the medium and long-term.” Are you satisfied with the Commission’s proposal for the European surveillance system?  “The Commission has now presented its proposals to the Council, which is under the Swedish Presidency. As regards the ECB and its General Council we stand ready to do all what we can for the European Systemic Risk Board to fulfil its very important systemic responsibilities in the best fashion possible to the service of the European financial stability.”  Are you satisfied with the outcome of the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh?  “As this stage I would only make three short observations:  First, we central banks appreciated that it is said that “a sense of normalcy should not lead to complacency.” Second, I noted that it is also in the preamble that “we will prepare our exit strategies and, when the time is right, withdraw our extraordinary policy support (....), maintaining a commitment to fiscal responsibility.” Third, it is particularly important that the G20 is designed to be the premier forum for international economic cooperation; that the IMF is asked to play a key role in the multilateral surveillance, that the Financial Stability Board includes major systemic economies, and that the communiqué welcomes the key measures agreed by the oversight body of the Basel Committee.”  4 BIS Review 116/2009 
Franz-Christoph Zeitler: How should banking regulation change? Introductory statement by Professor Dr Franz-Christoph Zeitler, Vice-President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the conference "The future of banking regulation", organised by Imperial College London and the Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt am Main, 24 September 2009. *      *      * I Roughly speaking, the crisis can be split into three phases: • Following problems on the US subprime mortgage market, the players lost market confidence in many securitisations and their refinancing, which primarily affected the money markets.  • The crisis peaked with the Lehman insolvency on 15 September 2008. The crisis of confidence engulfed money, capital and credit markets throughout the world and made it necessary for central banks and governments to launch massive support measures worldwide to safeguard liquidity supply and ensure solvency.  • The financial crisis spread to the real economy towards the end of 2008. Since then, governments have been combating this with massive fiscal stimulus measures.  II The crisis revealed a series of weaknesses in the financial system. A lot of recommendations and proposals for individual measures are currently being put forward and discussed on all issues, some of which do not always appear to be completely devoid of institutional self-interest. All proposals should therefore be measured against the yardstick of whether they strengthen the sustainability of the international financial system. Sustainability, a term that was originally coined in ecology, defines a development which does not seek short-term success to the detriment of long-term success. If we translate this to the financial industry, we find a number of practices that did not comply with this principle:  • Sustainability is questionable, for example, in the case of business models based on short-term, variable-rate loans to subprime borrowers, which were immediately securitised and tranched. The business model was based on the hope that the value of the collateral would increase steadily and that market liquidity for securitisations would prove inexhaustible.  • Moreover, quantitative risk measurement methods, such as value-at-risk or expected-shortfall models, which could figuratively speaking be described as “looking in the rear-view mirror” and whose use has increased, have proved necessary but inadequate and should be supplemented by forward-looking instruments such as stress tests and scenario analyses, which also take into account changes in third party behaviour.  • In retrospect, the total – and at times blind – faith in rating agencies and their assessments cannot be justified as the massive downgrading of entire vintages of securitisations demonstrates the instability of ratings across a cycle and highlights the inadequate scrutiny of the assets underlying securitisation products.  • Sustainability is also a question of accounting, which is based to a large extent on current market value: Firstly, if valuations are allowed to shoot up in good times, they BIS Review 116/2009 1 
will have all the further to nosedive during a downturn. It is a well-known fact that the hangover the day after is worse the wilder the party was the evening before. And secondly, the compass of market value fails if market functions are disrupted.  III Likewise, it would not be very sustainable if regulators were now to respond to the numerous individual problems by intervening with an equally large number of individual measures. Rather, the strengthened international cooperation that has emerged during the crisis is an opportunity to devise a closed and coherent regulatory framework that sets the right incentives. • The scope of supervision is all about setting the right incentives; here, the G20 made an important policy decision back in the autumn of last year: all financial market players – including near banks and shadow banks – must be regulated;1  • The issue of “incentives” also comprises the past practice of arbitrage between the banking book and the trading book, which the new Basel regulations aim to avoid.  • Ultimately, this includes a review of the rules that allowed the crisis to emerge;  o eg legal constructions such as non-recourse mortgage loans, which are used in some countries and were instrumental in promoting borrowers’ willingness to take out subprime loans;  o other rules that need to be reviewed are capital requirements for liquidity facilities or the favourable capital requirements for securitisation tranches; major progress has already been made in this field with regard to greater transparency and risk-oriented capital charges. However, the practice of measuring the leverage ratio solely by on-balance-sheet items – as happens in some jurisdictions – also creates incentives to establish off-balance sheet special purpose vehicles.  IV In order to avoid getting mired in detail, we need to keep our eyes on the big picture in terms of the effects of the many proposals for new rules.  I would like to illustrate this with an example relating to regulatory capital; a whole range of measures are currently being discussed: • the definition of regulatory capital,  • the general increase in minimum capital requirements,  • a capital add-on for large institutions,  • the introduction of an anticyclical capital buffer,  • the introduction of a leverage ratio and  • greater capital backing for certain complex securitisation positions and the trading book (largely completed).  The big picture should be kept in mind when evaluating the impact the measures will have on the capital situation of institutions; before any final decisions are taken, an in-depth impact                                                  1  Guiding principles for the replacement of IAS 39; Nr. 10: To delink partially the valuation process from certain aspects of income and profit recognition. 2 BIS Review 116/2009 
study is therefore necessary (and is actually planned according to current documents) to assess the individual proposals’ interdependence. Even if the origin of the crisis (commercial paper market) and its climax (Lehman) represented a liquidity crisis, the capital debate is essentially right. For strengthening institutions’ capital base makes the financial system more robust. Higher capital requirements make it more difficult to build up excessive balance sheet leverage and increase caution towards risky business models, as the owners' liability gains greater weight. Therefore, the debate represents an important step towards preventing the next crisis. However, that will not end or shorten the current crisis. Although encouraging signs of recovery are emerging, the crisis is not yet over and it will take years to come back to previous levels of output. Rising unemployment, a scarcity of private capital and the pressure to deleverage being exerted by the markets and rating agencies are dampening business and earnings possibilities. At the same time, the deteriorating creditworthiness of many borrowers – euphemistically called rating migration – is hurting banks’ ability to lend. In terms of securitisations, this effect is aggravated by the “cliff effects” under the Basel framework (sudden increase in capital requirements triggered by a rating fall below a certain threshold).  The growing use of fair value accounting, strong rating migration and cliff effects under the Basel framework render the financial system to some extent procyclical. Regulators wishing to avoid this having a knock-on effect on banks’ ability to lend should therefore not implement capital measures until the crisis has been safely resolved. V The crisis provides the historic opportunity to anchor the principle of a social market economy internationally; to provide global “guard rails” for the markets' innovation and dynamism which will ensure system stability and shock-absorb destructive excesses. The key objectives when establishing these guard rails should be  • to strengthen sustainability,  • to steer incentives, and  • to avoid procyclicity.  For the financial sector as for regulators and supervisors, these principles will encourage a reversion to the role of a service industry. On the one hand, supervision is intended to protect creditors, on the other hand, however – when it comes to standards and regulations – it also serves the real economy indirectly by creating a framework allowing the financial industry to fulfil its role as an intermediary.

Axel A Weber: The future of banking regulation Dinner speech by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Conference on "The Future of Banking Regulation" organised by Imperial College London and the Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt am Main, 24 September 2009.  *      *      * 1  Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend a warm welcome to you here at this conference dinner which concludes the first day of scholarly exchange on the future of banking regulation.  In the light of the financial crisis, the subject we are dealing with has major priority and, as the agenda shows, is a very broad topic in terms of the issues it covers. Under discussion are questions about the effects of banking regulation as well as institutional aspects of how banking regulation should be organised. Above all, we should keep in mind that banking regulation should reflect the state of development in the financial markets, which implies that it is exposed to constant change. This is revealed, not least, by the history of banking regulation, which I would like to go into briefly before turning to the prevailing deficiencies of banking regulation and the main challenges in strengthening financial stability. 2  A brief history of banking regulation Safeguarding financial stability – as a prerequisite for macroeconomic growth and prosperity – is the main driver behind banking regulation. Consequently, calls for better banking regulation have typically emerged in the wake of financial instability. In the post-war era, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s combined with the oil shocks of 1973 and 1974 raised the first severe concerns about global financial stability. This prompted the central bank governors of the G10 to establish the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 1974, which eventually led to the creation of the capital adequacy standards Basel I and Basel II. The initial task of the Basel Committee, however, was not to harmonise international banking supervision, but rather to promote education, information sharing and research in this field. The need for convergence of supervisory standards, namely those of capital measures and capital standards, emerged as a result of the debt crisis that erupted in 1982. In particular, the fiscal burdens caused by the recapitalisation of international banks and IMF support to economies that were severely affected by the debt crisis led to the call for better banking regulation and a convergence of international standards. In 1988, the Basel Committee published the Basel Capital Accord which had been agreed by its members. The two aims of this 1988 Accord were the same as those for international financial supervision ever since and up to the present day: first, to strengthen the stability of the international banking system, and, second, to eliminate or mitigate distortions in international competition among banks due to differences in national regulation. Undoubtedly, the main achievements of the first Basel Capital Accord were that it represented a significant step towards international harmonisation of banking regulation – it was later applied by more than 100 countries – and that, for the first time, it put the focus on the relationship between the capital that banks hold and the weighted risks that banks take.  After its implementation, it was not long before Basel I came in for increasing criticism. First, it did not adequately cover all the risks to which banks were exposed. Second, the risk weightings were presented in a very crude form that was an inadequate reflection of the actual underlying risks. Despite such early warning signs, it was a long road that led to the implementation of Basel II. In the interim, financial turbulence, namely the Mexican crisis BIS Review 115/2009 1 
(1994-95) and the Asian crisis (1997-98) had further heightened the awareness among the G10 countries of the need for greater international cooperation in financial market oversight. As a consequence, the Financial Stability Forum was founded in 1999 and the first working groups were entrusted with drawing up appropriate measures for financial regulation. Out of this process the Basel II framework with its three pillars that you are all aware of was born and finally published in June 2004.  Basel II was scheduled for implementation by end of 2006. However, owing to its complexity – especially with regard to the different approaches to assessing the minimum capital requirements – the timetable allowed fairly long transition periods for the change of supervisory regime. As a result, Basel II had not yet been fully implemented by most credit institutions when the subprime crisis emerged in the summer of 2007. In particular, many banks – including the EU ones – applied the new Basel II capital rules for the first time in 2008. Consequently, we still have only a restricted knowledge, based on real data, of how Basel II works in practice. And, most notably, we cannot blame Basel II for the recent financial crisis. Nevertheless, the financial crisis has highlighted deficiencies in financial regulation within and beyond the supervisory framework of Basel II that have to be addressed based on a thorough analysis.  3  Challenges in strengthening financial stability 3.1  Banking regulation The search for the underlying causes of the financial crisis has been intense. Although a definitive assessment is still outstanding, it is widely agreed that the seeds of the crisis were sown by a whole range of developments at the micro and macro economic levels. For this reason, addressing identified deficiencies in banking regulation and the supervisory process can be no more than a building block, albeit a very important one, for enhancing the resilience of the global financial system. The most prominent shortcomings revealed by the financial crisis fall within the scope of credit risk transfer and the expansion of the “originate to distribute” business model that accompanied it. These deficiencies concern insufficient capital backing for securitisations as well as inadequate risk management within financial institutions and a lack of transparency in the whole transfer process. Consequently, the necessary modifications affect all three pillars of Basel II. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has responded promptly in the light of these insights, and many reforms are already under way. More specifically, the capital requirements for securitisations have already been raised and stricter disclosure requirements have been published. Both measures will have to be implemented by 2010. Moreover, the Basel Committee has strengthened the guidelines for the supervisory review process under pillar two of the Basel framework and thus addressed key lessons of the crisis with regard to governance, the management of risk concentrations, stress testing, valuation practices and exposures to off-balance sheet activities.  3.2  Procyclicality In addition to the measures that have already been taken, a number of quite fundamental aspects of the Basel II framework have been subject to review, some of which are also under discussion at this conference. However, most of these aspects concern hitherto uncharted fields of regulation. For that reason, further research is needed to calibrate them adequately. Most notably, there is an ongoing debate on the design of an adequate capital ratio in order to increase banks’ resilience and ability to absorb losses. This debate is focusing, in particular, on how institutions can build up capital buffers during good economic times in 2 BIS Review 115/2009 
order to cushion losses incurred during poor economic periods. Closely connected to this endeavour is the debate on possible procyclical effects of Basel II. Undisputably, Basel II acts in a risk-sensitive manner and therefore responds cyclically to economic developments. However, this is a deliberate and very important feature of Basel II and should not be abandoned. The question is, however, whether or not Basel II acts procyclically in the sense that the increase in capital requirements in times of financial stress or economic downturn is such that the resulting decrease in bank lending threatens to cause a downward spiral or a credit crunch. In the whole discussion on procyclicality, the advantages of the risk-sensitive capital requirements of Basel II should not be forgotten. This is also one of the main findings of the paper by Repullo and Suarez, which will be presented at this conference. Assessing the procyclical effects of Basel II in a dynamic equilibrium model, they identify a procyclical tendency of the risk-sensitive capital requirements of Basel II. However, this effect has a pay-off in terms of the long-term solvency of the banking system, which is much greater than under a Basel I regime or in a situation without any capital requirements. Although there already exists ample research on this question, there are not enough findings yet for an appropriate evaluation of whether or not Basel II has acted procyclically in the current crisis. This is due to the fact that the new Basel II capital requirements, as I mentioned earlier, only came into effect in 2008 in most countries and that, consequently, we have little experience of how they work in practice. Before taking any decisions on possible countermeasures, we should wait for the results of the Basel working group which is currently examining the potential procyclicality of Basel II. Nevertheless, possible options for limiting the procyclical effects of Basel II are already being compiled and research in this field is under way. This is reasonable, not least owing to the complexity of the issue and will enable us to respond quickly when necessary. Possible options for action tend towards a refinement of the risk-sensitive IRB approach of Basel II. For example, the capital requirements could be adjusted counter cyclically using credit growth as an indicator for the state of the economy. In times of high credit growth a surcharge on capital requirements would be prescribed. Slightly different is the proposal Repullo and Suarez make in their paper. They suggest a calibration of the confidence levels used in the Basel formula for calculating capital requirements. The proposed calibration is such that long-term risk is constant but confidence levels are relaxed in situations where Basel II tends to act procyclically. What the two mentioned approaches have in common is that the risk-sensitivity of Basel II is retained – a prerequisite for any sensible adaption of Basel II.  3.3  Systemic risk control Apart from observed stress in single financial institutions and market segments, the financial crisis has had a systemic and global dimension which has highlighted the fact that it is not enough to safeguard the stability of each bank individually. If we want to address the causes of the financial crisis in full, supervision has to be taken one step further. In particular, systemic risk has to be identified and guarded against. This raises new questions, such as how systemic risk can be identified and whether the systemic relevance of an institution should be considered by introducing capital surcharges for systemically important banks. Once again these issues, which enter new fields of financial supervision, are being addressed by researchers, and different approaches are under discussion.  When trying to identify systemic risk, a crucial point is to find adequate measures for indicating economic stress. The paper by Huang, Zhou and Zhu which will be presented at this conference contains an approach for measuring the systemic risk of a financial system using financial market data. Compared with indicators derived from banks’ balance sheets, financial market data have the advantage that they are available on a timely basis and are forward-looking. However, market-based risk measures are much more influenced by market movements than balance sheet related data. Consequently its suitability has to be reviewed more often.  BIS Review 115/2009 3 
Whereas Huang, Zhou and Zhu concentrate in their paper on the identification of systemic risk and the potential downside risk to a group of major financial institutions, Adrian and Brunnermeier go one step further in the paper they presented today. In their approach systemic risk of a financial institution is first identified and then directly incorporated into the regulatory framework. As justified as the intention to regulate banks and financial institutions according to their contribution to systemic risk may be, it is even more difficult to design and implement a rule that puts this into practice. Here, too, it is crucial to identify appropriate indicators of the contribution to systemic risk. The attendant risk – which can never be eliminated entirely – is that regulation focuses in too mechanical a manner on prominent risk indicators while overlooking other, less obvious ones.  Last not least there is a resulting necessity for a permanent revision of the regulatory framework that will allow supervisory authorities to respond flexibly to market developments. This means that the organisational aspects of global financial regulation have a key role to play in strengthening systemic risk control and safeguarding global financial stability. In this respect, the initiatives and action being taken at the European and global levels to enhance macroprudential supervision are to be welcomed. In the EU, the planned foundation of a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) – consisting of representatives from central banks, supervisors, and the European Commission among others – is a step into the right direction. However, the ESRB will contribute effectively to systemic risk control only if an unpoliticised open analysis and discussion is ensured. Therefore, central banks should have sufficient representation on this board and be given adequate weight. There are two more arguments why central banks should play a key role in banking supervision. First, the interdependence of monetary policy and the financial system means that central banks have a strong and natural interest in financial stability. Second, central banks in most countries are strongly involved in banking supervision and can therefore bring their expertise to bear in this field.  Having said that, I do not want to skim over the fact that central banks, too, have their own lessons to draw from the financial crisis. One of the lessons which certainly has to be learned is that the stability of the financial system is an essential condition in its own right which has to be taken into account in the conduct of monetary policy. In this context, the paper Borio and Zhu presented at this conference points to a very important link between monetary policy and the perception of risk by economic agents – something which has, so far, been neglected. Although more research is undoubtedly needed before we can speak of risk-taking as a new channel in the monetary policy transmission process, major lessons for monetary policy can be drawn from the findings of this paper. In particular, the conclusions support the call for a more symmetric monetary policy that tries to look through the financial cycle in stabilising monetary policy. 4  Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen Safeguarding financial stability has been the paramount objective of banking regulation. Unfortunately, it has usually been only the painful experience of financial crisis which has been a catalyst for implementing the necessary regulatory changes. From history and not least from the current financial crisis we should learn that banking regulation is exposed to permanent change, and so the debate on the future of banking regulation must and will go on. Thank you very much for your attention. 4 BIS Review 115/2009 
Philipp Hildebrand: Banking regulation – changing the rules of the game Speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Twelfth Annual International Banking Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Chicago, 25 September 2009. I would like to thank Jürg Blum, Rita Kobel, and Signe Krogstrup for their valuable support in drafting this speech. I also want to thank Bertrand Rime for helpful comments and discussions. *      *      * Introduction  I want to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for the kind invitation and the opportunity to speak to you this evening. It is a privilege to be here. A year ago, we were in the midst of a perfect financial storm. Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in mid-September, the imminent collapse of the global financial system became a distinct possibility. To avert such an outcome, a bold and unprecedented international policy response was needed and promptly initiated. In the US as well as in Europe, several of the world’s largest financial institutions required public capital injections, and their nondeposit liabilities had to be guaranteed. A number of countries were forced to expand their deposit insurance programs. In some cases, governments or central banks purchased or guaranteed bank assets.1   In spite of the rapid policy response aimed at stabilizing the global financial system, the broader economy was heavily hit. Trade and industrial production literally fell off a cliff. In the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, global economic activity recorded its weakest performance in decades. Today, the situation has improved very significantly. The unprecedented global policy response has had its intended effect. The financial system is showing clear signs of stabilization. Incoming economic data over the last couple of weeks suggest that global economic activity is improving. The economic rebound in the coming months may even exceed expectations. At the same time, looking beyond the near term horizon, our economies and the financial system continue to face considerable uncertainties and challenges. Yet, certain parts of the financial industry appear tempted to go back to business as usual. Industry statements and comments made by some banks on regulatory reforms reflect this trend.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I am deeply convinced that it is our common responsibility and duty not to let this happen. Let me begin by laying out three hopefully compelling reasons why we must secure fundamental regulatory reform of the financial sector. The first reason is that too much of the risk taken in the financial sector ultimately resides with taxpayers. The rescue of significant parts of the global financial system from near-certain collapse by public authorities came at very substantial risk and costs to taxpayers. According to data collected by the Bank for International Settlements, here in the United States, for example, the total potential costs of various support measures taken – capital injections, asset purchases, and guarantees of bank debt – amount to about 40 per cent of GDP. For some European countries, these numbers are even higher. While in some cases governments and central banks have been able to reduce their exposures, sometimes even with a profit, the involvement of the public sector remains important. The ultimate outcomes of these involvements are uncertain. Moreover, the consequences of the crisis in terms of job                                                  1  Ben S. Bernanke gave a thorough overview of the various measures taken worldwide in his speech “Reflections on a Year of Crisis” at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Annual Economic Symposium, Jackson Hole, on 21 August 2009.

and wealth losses, huge increases in discretionary and non-discretionary public spending, and dramatic declines in public revenue is bound to be enormous. In some countries, public debt is set to rise at a pace never seen before in peace time. At the end, the citizens of our respective countries will have to foot the bill, one way or another. The second reason is that the crisis also generates important intangible costs which are often overlooked. Confidence in the financial sector and those running it has been severely damaged. Moreover, because a small number of individuals have dogmatically equated markets with the unbounded pursuit of short-term profits, faith in the benefits of a market-based economic system has been undermined. Finally, the extraordinary public policy response to the crisis has potentially prepared the ground for even more moral hazard in the future.  The third reason is that this financial crisis will not be the last one. Between 1973 and 1997 alone, there were 139 documented financial crises in various parts of the world.2 Some suggest that we should redesign the global financial system in such a way that there will never be a financial crisis again. This is neither desirable nor realistic. As long as we want a financial system that performs a meaningful and useful function for the real economy, we will have to live with financial cycles. Moreover, the current crisis has clearly demonstrated the limitations of complex regulations and models. Even the most complex models will never be infallible. What we can and should do is to limit the likelihood of and the fallout from future crises.  It would be an inexcusable mistake to miss this opportunity to see through fundamental regulatory reform. We have to address the vulnerabilities that were at the root of this crisis and are likely to be at the root of those in the future. For this purpose, we need simple, effective measures that can be implemented rapidly once the crisis is over. There are intensive efforts under way to increase the resilience of the financial system. With the support of the G20 leaders, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has initiated an impressive number of reform projects.3 Good progress has been made on many measures. In some important areas, however, decisions have yet to be taken. In line with proposals by the FSB, I believe we need to pursue a dual-track approach to reforming the global financial system, combining preventive measures with measures facilitating the orderly resolution of large international banks in the event of a future crisis.  An ounce of prevention  We have all been told that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Considering the enormous costs associated with the cure of the current crisis, this holds especially true when it comes to financial stability. Most importantly, we need to strengthen the shock absorbers of the financial system. In the context of banks this means that they have to hold more capital and more liquidity. Strengthened shock absorbers in the form of higher capital and liquidity buffers have several beneficial effects. Bigger buffers enable banks to absorb larger negative shocks without triggering an idiosyncratic, let alone a systemic crisis. Furthermore, bigger buffers ensure that banks themselves bear a larger share of their downside risks. Not only does this reduce the potential burden for taxpayers, but it also creates stronger incentives for the banks themselves to operate prudently. If shareholders know that they have to absorb potential                                                  2  Barry Eichengreen and Michael D.

future losses rather than passing them on to taxpayers, they will likely become less willing to let management engage in excessively risky activities. Ultimately, this incentive effect can help make future crises less likely. Strengthening capital requirements  The crisis has nakedly exposed the dangers of excessive leverage. It also revealed a number of fundamental weaknesses of existing capital requirements. While model-driven risk-weighted capital requirements are sensible and should be maintained, they are not perfect and very likely never will be. Most of us have had to learn the hard way that the modeling of risk involves substantial risks itself. Despite risk-weighted capital ratios that in most cases exceeded the regulatory minima, leverage was a key source of vulnerability going into the crisis. Excessive leverage not only intensified the impact of mistakes on the financial situation of individual banks. It also amplified the crisis as ongoing deleveraging in the industry inevitably put downward pressure on financial markets and on the real economy. It is now also clear that banks were undercapitalized at the start of the crisis. Mounting losses quickly depleted their capital base, and, with a few notable exceptions, the banks found themselves in desperate need of massive support measures by the public sector.  To address these weaknesses, a considerable amount of work has been done and is still underway in the FSB and in a number of working groups of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In line with, and in full support of these efforts, I am convinced that a more robust capital framework needs to be built around the following features: • The amount and the quality of capital have to be increased very substantially. Capital buffers need to be high and robust enough for banks to survive a crisis on their own and thus to foster confidence in the system as a whole. In the medium term, this will be feasible without causing drastic adjustments at banks that might be harmful to the real economy. Looking at the banks that received public support, many of them paid out more in dividends and share buybacks during the years preceding the crisis than they subsequently faced in losses. • As a supplement to the risk-based capital requirements, a simple and commonly defined leverage ratio restriction needs to be introduced. A leverage ratio prevents the buildup of excessive leverage and serves as a backstop to the complex, but fallible risk-based capital requirements. • To address procyclicality, banks will have to build up capital buffers above the minimum requirements in good times. In difficult times, banks will be allowed to fall significantly below the target levels defined for good times. Allowing banks to draw down capital without violating any minimum requirements helps to mitigate the harmful effects of deleveraging. Overall, regulators must no longer allow banks, especially systemically important ones, to operate at such worryingly low capital levels as have been observed in the buildup of the current crisis. At the beginning of this month, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G20 were very explicit on this.  More robust liquidity requirements  The crisis has also provided a number of important lessons regarding liquidity. In short, banks’ liquidity holdings were insufficient. This holds true for the quantity but also for the quality of liquidity. One of the explanations for these insufficient holdings of liquidity was that the stress scenarios considered by banks were far too optimistic. While secured funding remained the most stable source of refinancing, it was much less stable than what banks and BIS Review 115/2009 3 
regulators had assumed. Moreover, it quickly became apparent that liquidity problems at single banks imposed considerable stress on the entire international system. As in the area of capital, the FSB and the Basel Committee are working at full throttle towards an internationally coordinated liquidity standard for banks. In my view, this internationally harmonized standard needs to have the following basic features to be effective: • The standard should reflect a very adverse scenario, including a massive loss of confidence from depositors, a disruption of secured funding and a loss of liquidity on major segments of the securities markets. The new standard will only be able to promote stability if the underlying scenario is severe enough. A moderate scenario is not sufficient to bolster confidence in situations of turmoil. • The standard should require banks to hold a buffer consisting of assets whose liquidity and value is robust to massive disruptions in the financial markets. The presumption should be that government securities form the bulk of the buffer. Overall, the new liquidity standard should substantially strengthen banks’ liquidity base. Banks must be in a much better situation to weather liquidity shocks without having to resort to public support. As a consequence of these higher capital and liquidity buffers, the relevant banks may seem more boring. Their rate of return on equity will be lower. At the same time, their earnings are bound to be less volatile and they will likely be more beneficial for the economy as a whole. With such changes must come a change in banks’ compensation policies and practices. Compensation cannot be a one-way street and must become risk aligned and long-term oriented. Facilitating the orderly resolution of banking problems  Prevention is key but it will not be foolproof. Even with these better shock absorbers in place, large and systemically important banks will again experience severe financial stress at some point in the future. Here we must accept that we still have not dealt with the fundamental reason why systemically important banks cannot be allowed to fail. The truth is that, if tomorrow morning a systemic institution were to be on the brink of failure, we would again face the terrible choice of coming to its rescue or risking the stability of the financial system.  The fact that financial institutions which are too big or too interconnected to fail exist is a flagrant contradiction of one of the key principles and beliefs on which any market-based economy is built: Competition should ensure that the most efficient – and not the largest and most risk-loving – survive in the market place. It is evident that a change of rules is required. The financial system of the future should expose financial institutions of all sizes and structures to the test of the market place. In the event that some of them fail, we need a system that allows for the orderly resolution of large and complex financial institutions. In other words, we require a system that permits us to let systemically relevant institutions fail safely. One of the principal hurdles to achieving this objective is that it requires international coordination. Many of you will argue that the notion that we could agree on an international framework for the orderly resolution of cross-border financial institutions is utopian. Your skepticism is understandable. After all, much work has gone into trying to address this problem for at least 30 years, arguably with little concrete success. The many technical and legal problems have impeded any meaningful progress. Despite this unfortunate track record, I would argue that the real problem has not simply been a lack of technical answers to admittedly very difficult problems. After all, where there’s a will, there’s a way. What we urgently need now is the political will to address the technical difficulties and to cooperate internationally in pursuit of a solution. In 1961, President 4 BIS Review 115/2009 
Kennedy announced to the world that the United States would go to the moon before the end of the decade. At that point, the NASA engineers clearly hadn’t solved all technical problems associated with landing a man on the moon. It seems to me that the key to solving these problems was a clearly stated political objective. Much like John F. Kennedy’s commitment nearly 50 years ago, we now need a bold and international political commitment to put in place a framework for the orderly resolution of cross border financial institutions. Provided we have such an unequivocal commitment, solutions will eventually emerge. A new framework needs to ensure that a failing bank can continue to fulfill the functions that are critical for the functioning of the economy. It needs to provide regulatory tools that will help reduce the size and complexity of systemic institutions. This will require a close dialogue and meaningful cooperation between the public authorities and the banks. The framework should also prevent destabilizing effects of a failure on the rest of the financial sector – for example by building and improving on financial market infrastructures that reduce counterparty credit risk. Ultimately, however, it must not exclude the possibility that a large and complex cross-border financial institution can be – and should be – subject to insolvency proceedings where reorganization is not possible. Of course, we must accept the reality that different national resolution regimes will continue to coexist. To make it perfectly clear: I am not proposing to create a global resolution regime to replace national regimes. Such an endeavor strikes me as the equivalent of a journey not to the moon, but to outer space. But that should be no excuse for not improving the framework for cooperation across the relevant countries. Concluding remarks The worst of the crisis is behind us, and there are intensive efforts under way to increase the resilience of the financial system. Banks are again generating profits and, in some cases, very substantial profits, not least because of the costly public support measures, many of which remain in place. As the situation improves, complacency can easily become the rule of the game. We forget the severity of the crisis and fall prey to renewed lobbying of a powerful and recovering industry. We must not let this happen. Strong and bold entrepreneurial and political leadership is now required to see the necessary changes for the financial system through, as demonstrated today by the G20 leaders in Pittsburgh. Clearly, there are many areas in financial regulation that can and in many cases should be improved. Given what is at stake, there is clearly a need to prioritize. I have briefly laid out to you this evening where I see those priorities. Thank you for your hospitality and patience. BIS Review 115/2009 5 
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi: Macro-prudential supervision Speech by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the CEPR/ESI 13th Annual Conference on “Financial Supervision in an Uncertain World”, European Banking Center at Venice International University, Venice, 25-26 September 2009. *      *      * Introduction1The recent financial crisis has produced a broad consensus on analysis and policy action in at least three areas, namely the need: i) to gain a better understanding of systemic risk; ii) to strengthen the macro-prudential aspects of financial supervision; and iii) to deepen central banks’ involvement in it. The establishment of a new body to conduct macro-prudential supervision at EU level – the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) – is one element in a comprehensive set of initiatives and responses in this field.  My remarks today focus on the future work of this body and consist of four parts. I’ll first consider the origins, purpose and structure of the ESRB. In second place, I’ll discuss the concept of systemic risk, and how it can be monitored and assessed effectively. I’ll examine some analytical tools for systemic risk analysis in the EU and look at how these tasks could be organised in the context of the ESRB. In the third part, I’ll cover the ECB’s experience in conducting financial stability surveillance in the euro area and reflect on the vulnerabilities that we (and other authorities) identified before the crisis. I’ll ask why the communications about the risks that built up were insufficient to prevent the crisis. The fourth part is a what if? What if the Risk Board had existed in the early 2000s – could the factors that led to the crisis have been identified and averted? The answer should point to some of the key advantages of (and reasons for) the EU’s new macro-prudential function. 1.  The setting-up of the European Systemic Risk Board  The idea of establishing a body to monitor and assess systemic risk at European level was first mooted in the late 1990s.2 It took over a decade and a financial crisis to implement it. Let me recall the milestones of the setting-up of the ESRB institutional framework. Following the recommendations of the de Larosière Report, in February this year, the main features of the institutional framework for macro-prudential supervision were defined by the Communication published by the European Commission on 27 May as well as the Conclusions approved by the ECOFIN Council on 9 June and by the European Council on 18 and 19 June.  The European Systemic Risk Board will be responsible for the macro-prudential oversight of the financial system within the European Union. It will seek to prevent or mitigate systemic risks within the financial system, so as to avoid widespread financial distress, and it will contribute to a smooth functioning of the Internal Market and ensure a sustainable contribution of the financial sector to economic growth. Its tasks will be to identify and assess risks to systemic stability in the EU, issue risk warnings where risks appear to be significant                                                  1  I would like to thank L. Cappiello, I. Cabral, P. Hartmann, and F. Recine for their contributions, and D. Clarke for reviewing the document. I bear responsibility for the views expressed and for any errors. 2  See, for example, European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (1998), “EMU, the ECB and Financial Supervision”, Statement No. 2, 19 October, which proposes a “European Observatory of Systemic Risk” as an initial step towards a European-wide supervisory structure. Aglietta and Scialom (2003), “The Challenge of European Integration for Prudential Policy”, FMG Special Paper, No. 152, October, provide an elaborate discussion of such a body. BIS Review 115/2009 1 
and, where necessary, give recommendations on measures to be taken to contain such risks and follow up on their implementation.  The Risk Board will have 33 full members: the 27 EU central bank Governors, the ECB President and Vice-President, a Commission member and the three Chairs of the new European Supervisory Authorities. To ensure close cooperation with supervisors, a representative from one national supervisory authority for each EU country may attend the meetings of the ESRB, but will have no voting rights. In addition, the President of the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) will participate, but likewise will have no voting rights.  The ECB was requested by ECOFIN to provide the necessary analytical, statistical, administrative and logistical support, and to draw on technical advice from the national central banks and supervisors. This is a clear recognition of the important role that central banks have gained over time in monitoring financial stability.  The Commission proposals specify in detail the new institutional arrangements concerning the establishment of the ESRB and the involvement of the ECB. The ECB/Eurosystem will provide its views when formally consulted according to the Treaty provisions. Indeed, further work is needed to clarify and optimise the details of the institutional framework for the ESRB as well as for the new European Supervisory Authorities for micro-prudential supervision. Sound institutional arrangements are a crucial pre-condition for the effectiveness of these supervisory reforms in general and the establishment of the Risk Board in particular. In this context, let me mention two key elements to be defined by the forthcoming legislation. One is the arrangements for the exchange of micro-prudential information among national supervisors, the new European Supervisory Authorities and the ESRB (subject to specific confidentiality agreements). In order for the ESRB to perform its functions, it should have the power to request any information it deems necessary (for example, exposures of large and complex financial institutions to structured products).3  The other key element is that a risk warning needs to be translated into appropriate supervisory action. An institutional mechanism should exist to ensure that the recommendations adopted by the ESRB as regards the actions to address the systemic risks identified by the macro-prudential assessment would be followed up by the competent national authorities. However, as the recommendations will not be binding, there should be institutional mechanisms to ensure that they are implemented. And if they are not implemented, an explanation has to be provided. The ESRB may decide to make the recommendations public. As the recommendations aim to address systemic risks, their publication will increase pressure on the Member State to implement such recommendations.  A peer review mechanism should be set up. In particular, the ECB, on behalf of the Risk Board, would closely monitor the implementation of the recommendations by Member States and national authorities. Cases of non-compliance could be reported to the Council and, where relevant, to the European Supervisory Authorities for appropriate follow-up. 2.  The concept of systemic risk and its analysis by the ESRB How well this institutional framework will enable the ESRB to perform its tasks will depend on its understanding of systemic risk, the amount of relevant information at its disposal, the analytical tools that are available to assess the risks, and the framework used to distil the                                                  3  This was, for example, a clear conclusion of the de Larosière Report (2009), “High-level Group on Financial Supervision in Europe”, Brussels. 2 BIS Review 115/2009 
most important results from all these elements. Let me comment on some of these four aspects and touch on how we intend to fulfil our mandate to support the ESRB. Conceptual issues of systemic risk Systemic risk analysis is nothing new to the central banking community, including the ECB. One reflection of this fact is the series of triennial central bank conferences held under the G10 Committee on the Global Financial System between the mid-1990s and early 2000s. Even the European Monetary Institute, which was the forerunner of the ECB, contributed to systemic risk work in this context, alongside the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and many other central banks.4 For instance, from the outset, the ECB drew up a research agenda on financial stability and systemic risk.5 In addition, in 2004 we started to publish a Financial Stability Report (FSR) twice a year. The main objective of this Report is to help identify, at an early stage, potential vulnerabilities and to raise awareness among market participants with a view to promoting preventive and remedial policies. Each issue also contains several special features offering a wealth of further insight into financial stability and systemic risk. This background suggests that the ECB is a logical choice as a provider of analytical support to the ESRB, but it should not obscure two major challenges we are facing. First, the phenomenon of systemic risk is extraordinarily complex. Second, despite the steps reported above and some lively academic literature on financial contagion over the last two decades, systemic risk analysis and research is far less advanced than that of monetary policy, for example. There are no established frameworks that can be taken “straight off the shelf”. Having said that, let me describe briefly the concept of systemic risk. Systemic risk was defined by the G10 in 2001 as “… the risk that an event will trigger a loss of economic value or confidence in, and attendant increases in uncertainty about, a substantial portion of the financial system that is serious enough to quite probably have significant adverse effects on the real economy.”6 In simpler terms, it is the risk that the failure and distress of a significant part of the financial sector reduces the availability of credit, which in turn may adversely affect the real economy. Interestingly, this notion of systemic risk is quite similar to the definition of financial stability that the ECB uses in its Financial Stability Report, underlining the fact that our financial stability work has always had a macro-prudential orientation. Our working definition describes financial stability as a “condition in which the financial system – comprising of financial intermediaries, markets and market infrastructures – is capable of withstanding shocks and the unravelling of imbalances, thereby mitigating the likelihood of disruptions in the financial intermediation process which are severe enough to significantly impair the allocation of savings to profitable investment opportunities”.                                                   4  See, for example, de Bandt and Hartmann (1998), “What is systemic risk today?”, in Risk Measurement and Systemic Risk, Proceedings of the Second Joint Central Bank Research Conference, hosted by the Bank of Japan, Tokyo, 1997. 5  In this regard some of the ECB outputs (partly in collaboration with academics and researchers from other central banks and international organisations) include: Fell and Schinasi, (2005), “Assessing Financial Stability: Exploring the Boundaries of Analysis”, National Institute Economic Review, Vol. 192, No. 1; de Bandt and Hartmann (2000), “Systemic risk: A survey”, ECB Working Paper, No 35, November; Hartmann, Straetmans and de Vries (2004), “Asset market linkages in crisis periods”, Review of Economics and Statistics, 86(1); Hartmann, Straetmans and de Vries (2005), “Banking system risk: A cross-Atlantic perspective”, NBER Working Paper, No. 11698, October; Cappiello, Engle and Sheppard (2006), “Asymmetric dynamics in the correlation of global equity and bond returns”, Journal of Financial Econometrics, 4(4); Gropp, Lo Duca and Vesala (2009), “Cross-border bank contagion in Europe”, in Shin and Gropp (eds.), Banking Integration, Bank Stability, and Regulation, special issue of the International Journal Central Banking, 5(1); Iyer and Peydró-Alcalde (forthcoming), “Interbank contagion at work: Evidence from a natural experiment”, Review of Financial Studies. 6  Group of Ten, (2001), “Report on Consolidation in the Financial Sector”, Basel. BIS Review 115/2009 3 
Following de Bandt, Hartmann and Peydró-Alcalde (forthcoming), we can distinguish three broad and interrelated ways in which systemic risk can materialise.7 The first one is commonly called contagion and is closely studied in the research literature. For example, a supposedly idiosyncratic failure of a financial intermediary leads to the failure of other intermediaries. The second one emerges from imbalances that build up over time, such as credit booms or concentrations of lending in certain regions or sectors. These “bubbles” can go on profitably for most participants who “ride” them for quite a while. Then relatively small events or changes in expectations can lead to their breakdown, simultaneously bringing down a wide range of intermediaries and markets.8 The third way in which systemic risk can materialise relates to economic downturns or other aggregate shocks that cause the collapse of a wide range of intermediaries and markets simultaneously.9  Other important elements in systemic risk include the strong information intensity of financial contracts and transactions, and a high degree of connectedness between financial intermediaries and markets as well as a strong reliance on debt financing (leverage) and on maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities. These factors imply feedback mechanisms that amplify shocks and can lead to non-linearities in the financial system that then are easily transmitted to the real economy.  Systemic stability, or the absence of systemic risk, can be seen as a public good, thereby legitimising the role of governments and other authorities in addressing it.10 Like pollution, systemic risk involves externalities, in the sense that each financial intermediary manages its own risks but does not consider its impact on the risk of the system as a whole. The financial crisis contributed considerably to a better understanding of the phenomenon of systemic risk, which is also reflected in aspects of regulatory reforms. In particular, the possibility of aligning capital requirements to a measure of firms’ systemic risk contribution is being contemplated by regulators, e.g. the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.11How could the ESRB then structure its supervisory work on systemic risk? In broad terms, systemic risk analysis can be broken down into two core components: i) surveillance, or risk detection, and ii) risk assessment, each of which I will address in turn.  Risk detection Financial stability surveillance concerns risk identification. This kind of surveillance mainly aims to detect potential sources of risk, especially financial vulnerabilities – that is weaknesses which, if unearthed, could lead to a disruption or failure in part of the financial                                                  7  De Bandt, Hartmann and Peydró-Alcalde (2009), “Systemic risk in banking: An update”, forthcoming in the ECB Working Paper series, and Berger, Molyneux and Wilson (eds.), Oxford Handbook of Banking, Oxford University Press. This paper surveys all the relevant academic research with respect to the three categories and relates them to the present crisis where applicable. 8  This tendency of financial systems towards boom-bust cycles goes back, for example, to the work by Minsky (1977), “A theory of systemic fragility”, in Altman and Sametz, Financial Crises, Wiley. Notably, observers from the Bank for International Settlements, such as Bill White and Claudio Borio, warned before 2007 that such imbalances were building up. 9  For example, Gorton (1988), “Banking panics and business cycles”, Oxford Economic Papers, 40, observes that most US banking crises during the national banking era could have been predicted with a simple business cycle model. 10  See, for example, Acharya, Pedersen, Philippon and Richardson (2009), “Regulating Systemic Risk”, in Acharya and Richardson (eds.), Restoring Financial Stability: How to Repair a Failed System, Wiley; Lo (2008), “Hedge Funds, Systemic Risk, and the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008”, Written Testimony prepared for the US House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reforms, Hearing on Hedge Funds, November. 11  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, “Comprehensive response to the global banking crisis”, press release, 7 September 2009. 4 BIS Review 115/2009 
system and potentially to a financial crisis. It would have to pay attention to the sources of the three forms of systemic risk discussed earlier – contagion, imbalances and macro shocks. Risk monitoring should identify sources of risks and vulnerability coming from within the financial system – i.e. stemming from financial institutions, markets or market infrastructure – and also those present in the macroeconomic environment and non-financial related events. These would include vulnerabilities resulting from global imbalances, growth prospects, developments in housing markets, creditworthiness of borrowers, to name a few.  The monitoring involves processing large amounts of (often disparate) information of a statistical nature and is based on market sources. In addition, continuous market intelligence efforts are essential for effective risk monitoring and the early detection of new financial instruments, practices or business strategies which could create vulnerabilities and risks in financial markets.  In the case of the Risk Board, market intelligence will be complemented by what could be called “institutional intelligence” and “policy intelligence”, given the qualitative information and expert knowledge available to central banks and supervisory authorities represented in the ESRB. The Board’s independent, impartial status could prove to be invaluable in the surveillance and identification of risks viewed as material. Risk monitoring is facilitated by a large set of tools, including contemporaneous financial stability indicators and forward-looking early warning indicators and models. These tools need to be regularly revised and updated in order to capture innovation in financial markets, fuelled by new products and business models. Macro-prudential indicators comprise a vast set of indicators – on the macroeconomic environment, financial markets, financial institutions and financial system infrastructures. More specifically, they include macroeconomic aspects, financing conditions, monetary conditions, asset valuations, risk appetite, market liquidity, funding liquidity, credit risk, financial strength of institutions, and others. Some of these indicators may contain information relevant to early warnings as they may draw attention to rapidly increasing exposures to specific asset classes, broad-based increases in financial leverage and dynamics in the maturity profile of financial institutions’ debt which could indicate roll-over problems.12In the ESRB context, early warning indicators and early warning signal (EWS) models should play an important role in both the risk surveillance phase and in the lead-up to the risk warning phase. EWS models are designed to indicate when a financial system, market or intermediary reaches a “danger zone”, which usually points to a crisis ahead. In the past, a number of forward-looking stability indicators were used by most central banks, but these were not necessarily comprehensive frameworks of developed EWS models covering most financial systems. One reason for this may have been that the older generation of these models performed well in the sample but they typically failed to predict future crises. Recent research suggests that their out-of-sample performance can be improved, in particular with respect to credit cycles and asset price bubbles.13 A caveat that remains is that it seems difficult for them to improve their predictions on the timing of credit booms and asset-bubble bursting.                                                   12  See, for example, ECB Financial Stability Review, December 2007, Box 16 “A market-based indicator of the probability of adverse systemic events involving large and complex banking groups”; ECB Financial Stability Review, June 2006, Special Feature B “Assessing banking systemic risk with extreme value analysis”. 13  See, for example, Alessi and Detken (2009), “‘Real-time’ early warning indicators for costly asset price boom/bust cycles: a role for global liquidity”, ECB WP Series No 1039, March; Borio and Drehmann (2009), “Assessing the risk of banking crises – revisited“, BIS Quarterly Review, March; ECB Financial Stability Review, June 2009, Special Feature D “Estimating probabilities of hedge fund liquidation”. BIS Review 115/2009 5 
Risk assessment  Risk assessment relates to the evaluation of the relevance and potential severity of each risk identified as material in the surveillance phase. It should therefore include a quantitative evaluation of the likelihood that the potential risk scenarios could actually materialise, as well as an evaluation of the ability of the financial system to absorb the shocks (for example, through existing capital buffers or through the potential to increase buffers in the future through profit retention). It should also include cost estimates in terms of the failure of institutions, costs deriving from the malfunctioning of financial markets or impairment of the real economy. The product of these factors forms the basis for the ranking of risks. Quantitative methods and analytical tools (for example, macro-stress testing models) should support, together with expert judgement, the prioritising or ranking of these risks. The models will help in the conduct of quantitative impact assessments on the financial sector as well as in the assessment of the potential costs for the real economy, and thereby offer information about the relevance and severity of the risks detected in the surveillance phase.  Macro-stress testing models have become the workhorse of macro-prudential stability analysis in the last decade, notably including quantitative impact studies for specific scenarios. Their main purpose is to assess the resilience of the banking and financial systems against extreme but still plausible events. One problem with these models in the past was that even for large shocks they generated hardly any bank failures. This can probably be improved by using appropriate data, more granular than previously available, and by capturing better and a larger number of adverse feedback loops that can play a role in amplifying the transmission of instability in the financial system. These feedback loops could include contagion effects across banks, market liquidity and funding liquidity problems.14 Another difficulty for these models is whether they should be extended to also capture feedbacks from real economy outcomes to financial stability variables.  The assessment task is currently much less developed than the surveillance one. This is not only because it involves considerable analytical sophistication, but also and mainly because there are significant gaps in the information on the financial intermediaries themselves and on inter-linkages between the various parts of the financial system.  Viewing the financial system as a network, more information is needed on the key network nodes, and well as on the links between those nodes.15 The degree of interconnectedness in the system may be determined by common exposures to specific asset classes, such as specific sectors in the economy, for example, commercial property, or to specific regions such as emerging Europe, via granted loans or securities holdings. Inter-linkages may also derive from intra-bank and intra-group exposure, as well as from trading and other correlated positions in the financial markets, such as in the credit derivatives market, which may lead to crowded trades, should they need to be unwound simultaneously. They may derive from cross-ownerships and capital participations among institutions, from similarities in business models, or from reliance on the same external sources for funding, for example.  While it is unrealistic to think that it would be possible to characterise the degree of interconnectedness of the financial system by taking into account all possible channels for contagion, a great deal of invaluable information exists in a scattered form (at the disposal of supervisors, trading platforms or the institutions themselves). At present, these information gaps imply that most modelling techniques for risk assessment, including macro stress-testing and contagion models, are highly dependent on market-                                                 14  See, for instance, Aikman, Alessandri, Eklund, Gai, Kapadia, Martin, Mora, Sterne and Willison (2009), “Funding liquidity risk in a quantitative model of systemic stability”, Bank of England WP No. 372, June. 15  See, for instance, ECB Financial Stability Review, June 2009, Special Feature C, “Balance sheet contagion and the transmission of risk in the euro area financial system”; Haldane (2009) “Rethinking the financial system network”, speech delivered at the Financial Student Association, Amsterdam, April. 6 BIS Review 115/2009 
inferred data based on stock prices or credit default swap spreads that, in particular, might not behave reliably at times of turmoil or stress in financial markets.  It is important to note that the complexities of systemic risk and macro-prudential supervision and the state of current research do not allow the analytical tool kit to be limited to just one or two major models. Given that the framework for macro-prudential analysis is at an early stage of development compared with other areas of economics, there is a need to look at a wider range of models and thereby include relevant risks, imbalances and transmission channels.  Systemic risk analysis needs to be supported by a suite of state-of-the-art analytical models and tools, and a conceptual framework for using them. The complex and intertwined economic and financial linkages call for a constant cross-checking of several indicators or measures. In addition, the evolving nature of finance and the pace of innovation also require that the set of tools for systemic risk detection and assessment are constantly adjusted or revised. Many central banks, including the ECB, have in the past developed such models and tools in order to support their regular financial stability analyses and reports. The experiences with the crisis and the decision to establish a macro-prudential stability function in Europe suggest that, even when building on existing structures, significant efforts are called for in order to extend and further improve models and tools. While it would be desirable for the risk assessment exercise to be increasingly quantitative, it should never become mechanistic or fully model-based. Expert judgement and qualitative assessments will always be crucial to understand the messages coming from various analytical tools, also taking into account overall intelligence efforts.  Comprehensive information base Irrespective of their level of sophistication, models need to be fed with the appropriate data in order to produce results that, in addition to their analytical interest, can support policy messages. A comprehensive information base is also key in the risk surveillance phase that precedes the actual risk assessment. This is because the establishment of a wide radar screen supporting rigorous monitoring is only possible if the critical information is available.  The current crisis has convincingly shown that a significant part of credit intermediation was channelled outside the banking sector and the regulated financial sector. The non-regulated or “shadow” banking system was almost totally off any surveillance radar screen. Not enough was known about special investment vehicles, conduits, securitisation markets and instruments, or about all the financial intermediation that takes place outside the traditional banking system. Moreover, little was known about the direct and indirect exposures between this shadow banking system and the regulated one, which turned out to be substantial. Information on non-banking institutions, potentially of systemic importance, such as hedge funds, was scattered, not quality-checked and typically provided on a voluntary basis. A tendency to create a bias towards the best performers was the result. Even for the banking sector, for which data is abundant – and, what’s more, there is substantial expertise in conducting risk assessments – the information available to bodies entrusted with financial stability functions but without a supervisory mandate is far from satisfactory. The information on the degree of interconnectedness that I previously mentioned is critical, even if only to identify the key nodes of the financial system network which would need to be closely monitored. So far, for the case of the ECB, systemic risk analysis is conducted solely on the basis of publicly available information, mostly gathered from individual financial reporting.  The failure of Lehman Brothers just over a year ago illustrates well the relevance of such inter-linkages between financial institutions. They may matter more than the size of their balance sheets. And if those linkages are impaired, they can affect the functioning of the entire financial system. In fact, before the crisis an increasing amount of overall risk in the economy was perceived to exist, but there was little certainty as to where the risks lay. Few BIS Review 115/2009 7 
suspected that the vast majority of them would be held directly or indirectly at key nodes of the financial system network. The spectacular growth in the securitisation and credit risk transfer market in the years up to the crisis increased discussion of the potential vulnerabilities, in particular about who were the ultimate holders of the risks originating in the banking system, and their capacity to withstand shocks. These risks were transferred from the originators to various investors outside the banking sector, from institutional investors to hedge funds, but also within the banking sector itself. In fact, weaknesses in the so-called originate-to-distribute model followed by most large banks, and fragilities in the funding of special investment vehicles and conduits resulted in some of those risks backfiring and ending up consolidated on the banks’ balance sheets. The eruption of the turmoil left banks sitting on unwanted risks, such as leveraged loans related to leveraged-buy-out transactions, (often referred to as warehousing risk in the financial jargon), which were intended to be sold on to the market. Likewise, in the structuring of collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), which were an extremely profitable business for banks in the years before summer 2007, the banking system ended up accumulating a considerable proportion of CDO tranches. As the crisis broke, these tranches rapidly became a significant fraction of banks’ impaired or so-called toxic assets. Risk warnings Let’s get back to the European Systemic Risk Board. In addition to risk surveillance and risk assessment, the ESRB will be entrusted with a third task – issuing risk warnings and policy recommendations. This is somewhat new to the central banking community. The issuance of risk warnings, in the context of safeguarding financial stability – where the analysis is centred on the downside risks and thus on highly improbable events – differs substantially from other types of analysis focused on a central, most probable, baseline scenario (such as the one supporting monetary policy). The translation of systemic risk assessments into proposals for concrete policy actions – of a prudential or supervisory nature – is also, to a large extent, new to the central banking community. 3.  What went wrong? Confronted with the question of whether central banks and international bodies with financial stability competencies saw the financial crisis coming, it would be fair to answer “Yes, to some extent”. Prior to the summer of 2007, in a number of official publications16, attention was drawn to a number of growing vulnerabilities and potential risks such as:  • the (then incipient) crisis in the US sub-prime mortgage market and its potential to deepen and spread to other markets; • the fact that financial market liquidity could vanish abruptly when investor uncertainty and risk aversion rose;  • the role of hedge funds as key players, over the years, in fuelling liquidity in financial markets, implying that a shock to the hedge fund industry would severely affect the smooth functioning of some markets; • the excessive reliance of investors on the risk assessment of structured products made by rating agencies;                                                  16  See ECB Financial Stability Review, June 2007; BIS Quarterly Review, June 2007; Bank of England Financial Stability Report, April 2007; IMF Global Financial Stability Report, April 2007. 8 BIS Review 115/2009 
• the concentration of risks in the financial system, which was becoming increasingly difficult to identify due to the proliferation of structured finance products and credit risk transfer instruments; • the risk-bearing ability of the ultimate risk-holders in these chains. However, it would be fair to say that few, if any – including market participants and public authorities – were able to foresee the magnitude and severity of the crisis. In retrospect, it became clear that the crisis was greatly intensified by a myriad of unknown connections and interdependencies between financial intermediaries, within and outside the banking system, including some non-regulated financial sectors. Sophisticated market participants and investors were also apparently unaware of the degree of interconnectedness in the financial system. Otherwise, their behaviour in the months leading up to the summer of 2007 might have shown some anticipation of the developments (e.g. they might have seized some contrarian investment opportunities). In particular,  • the magnitude of the large off-balance-sheet exposures of banks to the US sub-prime-related structured finance products was widely unknown; • little information existed about the extent and implications of the activities of new financial entities – conduits and other structured investment vehicles – which are linked through management and liquidity arrangements to banks; • the probability that the various intertwined vulnerabilities could materialise simultaneously and combine in the way they eventually did was perceived as being very close to zero; • the extent of inter-linkages between financial intermediaries and across markets was not fully appreciated, and the possibility of tensions in one specific segment of the credit market spreading rapidly to other markets and continents was not foreseen. For more than two years now, we have been discussing the need for major improvements in supervisory and regulatory frameworks to respond to the weaknesses that came to light as the crisis unfolded. I will not address these issues again today. I will approach the question from the point of view of central banks and ask: what influenced their ability to raise market awareness with respect to building vulnerabilities within the financial system? And can we rely on the ESRB to repair this problem in the future? The information at the disposal of central banks and other bodies with financial stability competencies enabled them to point to growing risks and vulnerabilities, but it did not allow a deeper understanding of the interconnections in the financial system and of the potential magnitude of the detected risks. As a result, the discussion of the risks in their public communications or publications tended to be mostly of a qualitative nature, and generally did not involve a clear risk prioritisation exercise, and therefore had a potentially smaller impact on market behaviour.  Another important element was that risk assessments were generally not made with the specific aim of suggesting appropriate remedial policy actions in terms of prudential policies or regulation. Recommendations, mostly formulated in broad terms, tended to target market participants’ behaviour (e.g. proposing mitigating actions), but they were more muted regarding policy measures that could be taken in the prudential and regulatory area. One reason for this is, again, the information base. The formulation of concrete policy recommendations (e.g. with respect to capital buffers or funding-related issues) would need to be backed by rigorous quantitative assessments, for which publicly available information is generally not sufficient. Along the same lines, and perhaps as a result of the deficient information base, very limited research and analytical efforts have been pooled in the central banking community with a view to supporting policy suggestions in the prudential and regulatory area.  BIS Review 115/2009 9 
4.  Turning the clock back But let me turn the question around and ask: what if the Risk Board had existed in 2006-07? Would this have prevented the financial crisis? This is a difficult question because the modus operandi of the ESRB is still to be defined. It is also difficult to know whether the agreed framework and operational processes will prove to be effective. However, if the ESRB is given the appropriate information base, if it combines central banking and supervisory expertise and is supported by a sound analytical framework and can produce solid risk assessments and policy recommendations, the answer should be positive. Policy-makers, regulators, academics and market participants have learnt an enormous amount from the crisis. As the turmoil spread, they learnt about the functioning of the financial system and the links between the financial system and the real sector. In particular, the crisis highlighted the importance of the shadow banking system in fuelling credit into the economy, of indirect links between the banking and insurance sectors, as well as of fragilities in the securitisation market, just to name a few. However, it seems appropriate to ask: would a pre-crisis ESRB have closely monitored the Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) markets? Would it have been fully aware of conduits and special investment vehicles (SIVs)? Against this background, the financial crisis has triggered a number of initiatives to improve the monitoring of the shadow banking system. These include calls for mandatory reporting by financial institutions (e.g. hedge funds with significant volumes of assets under management) as well as the reporting of amendments to the accounting treatment of conduits and SIVs to ensure greater transparency with respect to links to sponsors, for example. These initiatives are expected to contribute to a better coverage of the non-regulated financial sector, coupled with a greater awareness of the business models and topics that were overlooked in the past. This information would not have been available to a pre-crisis ESRB. The crisis has also stressed the importance of developing ways to measure systemic risk, as it clearly showed that – both for market participants and regulators – without proper measurement there can be no proper management. A comprehensive strand of work relating to complementary measures of risk, capturing elements of leverage, liquidity, correlation of positions, concentration of exposures, has been initiated both by the private and public sectors. Prior to the summer of 2007, there was less emphasis on the need for targeted and adequate measurement of variables, including a critical stance on systemic risk, for supervisory and financial stability purposes. The crisis has also shown that firm-level data on financial intermediaries, including of a supervisory nature, might be critical to identify institutions of potential systemic relevance that warrant closer monitoring and to understand interdependencies among firms and markets – interdependencies which, if impaired, could have a strong impact on the overall stability of the financial system.  The key data requirements relate to: i) the possibility of joint failures of institutions resulting from their common exposures at a single point in time (these exposures could derive from shocks that come from outside the financial system or inter-linkages among intermediaries), and ii) the fact that, over time, the dynamics of the financial system and of the real economy reinforce each other, increasing the amplitude of booms and busts, and undermining stability in both the financial sector and the real economy. The financial crisis has shown that monitoring aggregate data is insufficient and may not accurately indicate the vulnerabilities hidden in the financial system and that there is the need to link micro data to macroeconomic risks. As such, firm-level data (as opposed to, for example, estimates based on country or sector aggregates) have been recognised as essential for more accurate assessments of the potential impact of risks materialising, e.g. estimating the amount of losses for the financial 10 BIS Review 115/2009 
sector, as well as for conducting system-wide stress testing, contagion analysis, or the assessment of feedback loops between the real and financial sectors.  In the pre-turmoil period, supervisory authorities were more concerned about overburdening institutions with reporting requirements than with enforcing adequate disclosure. As such, an ESRB established before the summer of 2007, but with access to the same information base as the one available to central banks at the time, might not have made substantially different systemic risk assessments. In addition to the importance of having a more comprehensive information base, the crisis has led to a significant revamping of research into systemic risk and to greater input into the formulation of related policy recommendations. As I just mentioned, in addition to improvements in macro stress-testing techniques and the early warning signal literature, more attention is being paid to contagion and spill-over models, especially for the banking sector, to macro-financial risk-based flow-of-funds approach using contingent claims analysis, and to research tools to support regulatory and supervisory policy recommendations.  One area in which a pre-crisis ESRB could have made a difference is in the conduct of country-specific analysis. Generally, ECB financial stability assessments focus on the euro area as a whole and rarely make distinctions between euro area countries. They mainly consider the risks and vulnerabilities common to most euro area countries; there is little analysis, let alone formulation, of policy recommendations, at country level. While this helps to distil the elements of the analysis relevant to the euro zone, country-specific vulnerabilities might end up receiving insufficient attention.  The ESRB will have a clear mandate to pursue country analysis and to provide country-specific policy recommendations if deemed necessary. If a task of this kind had been carried out by an independent and impartial body before the crisis, it could have signalled growing vulnerabilities in EU countries. Risk warnings about fragilities related to foreign currency lending, about particularly highly leveraged sectors in some countries, or overvaluation in a number of EU housing markets could have been louder. I would add, though, that none of these elements triggered the financial crisis – rather, they intensified it as the crisis spread to the EU financial system. The crisis also calls for improved coordination and cooperation between the international bodies responsible for safeguarding financial stability at all levels of the analysis. Cooperation between the ESRB, the Financial Stability Board and the IMF, for example, will probably be fruitful in the future, helping to raise awareness of growing vulnerabilities at global level that could not surface as prominently in an EU-focused financial stability surveillance exercise. Cooperation in the risk detection and risk assessment tasks would involve, for example, sharing of technical expertise and of findings from market and policy intelligence efforts. In addition, the ESRB may use these international bodies as a sounding board for its risk assessments, risk warnings and policy recommendations. An ESRB with an EU-wide focus established prior to the summer of 2007 would not have had access to the stepped-up co-operation at global level or to the wealth of information and analysis on the global environment that should be at its disposal as soon as it starts functioning in 2010.  Final remarks While the ESRB has a better chance of achieving its mandate now than it would have had earlier this decade, its tasks will be difficult and its challenges considerable.  In particular regarding the issuance of risk warnings, the credibility of the ESRB will rest upon the minimisation and balancing of so-called type I errors and type II errors. Type I errors entail the possibility of identifying those risks that subsequently do not materialise, while type II errors relate to the possibility of failing to identify risks that subsequently do materialise. Identifying a long list of potential systemic risks to financial stability could minimise the BIS Review 115/2009 11 
probability of making type II errors but may lead to accusations of “crying wolf”. The opposite could lead to an important risk to the EU financial system being overlooked, which if it materialised, could harm the ESRB’s reputation. Both the rigour of the checks for potential sources of risk and vulnerability, and the quality of the risk assessments (based on the information made available to the ESRB) should have a substantive influence on the credibility and effectiveness of the Board’s work. Addressing the type I-type II error trade-off by selecting which risks merit risk warnings can only be done by combining a comprehensive and strict monitoring of all potential sources of risk with a well-informed and detailed risk assessment. Expertise in the analysis of financial sector issues, market and public intelligence provided by the EU authorities represented in the ESRB will be considered invaluable. However, assessments of a qualitative nature should, to the extent possible, be complemented by quantitative impact assessments, which will also facilitate the task of prioritising the risks and the decision to issue risk warnings.  In short, if the European Systemic Risk Board is to really strengthen macro-prudential supervision in Europe, four conditions need to be fulfilled. First, a clear legislative framework must be created to underpin the work of the ESRB and the supporting role of the ECB. It should be noted that last June the European Council clearly indicated that the ECB should provide the secretarial, logistical, administrative and analytical support to the ESRB. Second, all parties involved in the preparation of ESRB risk assessments and potential risk warnings need to do the necessary analysis and research to bring our understanding of systemic risk and macro-prudential regulation to a new level, and to find common languages and frameworks. Third, in addition to improving the analytical tools supporting risk surveillance and risk assessment, more detailed and accurate information – to back up ESRB risk warnings – is essential. It should include better data coverage of non-regulated financial sectors, as well as more granular information on key node-institutions in the financial system and on potential inter-linkages between them. The ability to formulate concrete policy recommendations, as opposed to general recommendations, depends greatly on access to critical information. Finally, risk warnings and recommendations made by the ESRB have to be translated into concrete action, in particular by the national supervisory authorities. To conclude, the European Systemic Risk Board can be compared to a doctor who examines a patient, asking him about his ailment and suggesting that some tests be done. The doctor then makes a diagnosis and eventually recommends some medicines. It’s up to the patient to abide by the doctor’s recommendation. The doctor is not in a position to take direct action. He is not allowed to intervene, even when things get really bad, as in the case of a risk of contagion and the patient has to be put in quarantine. He might be the best doctor in the world, but his treatment will only be as good as the quality and completeness of the patient’s replies – and the patient’s willingness to take the medicines prescribed. This is the way in which the ESRB has been constructed in Europe. Its success will largely depend on the compliance of its “patients”, who hopefully have learned the lessons of this crisis. Thank you for your attention. 12 BIS Review 115/2009 
Perks Ligoya: Co-ordinated regulations for the SADC region Address by Dr Perks Ligoya, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi, at the Conference for the Committee of Insurance, Securities and Non-Bank Financial Authorities, Lilongwe, 17 September 2009. *      *      * The Chairperson, Committee of Insurance, Securities, and Non bank financial Authorities,  Mr Patrick Mhango  The Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of Malawi, Mrs Mary Nkosi The General Manager, Reserve Bank of Malawi, Dr Wilson Banda Distinguished delegates Ladies and gentlemen, It gives me pleasure and honour to grace this important occasion. The Reserve Bank of Malawi is honoured to host this year’s conference for the Committee of Insurance, Securities, and Non bank financial Authorities (CISNA) and in this regard I would like to welcome all delegates particularly those who have travelled from regional member countries to participate in this event. Chairperson, Ladies and Gentlemen,  I wish to commend all CISNA members for your continued interest and dedication to the SADC mission. Your attendance in such large numbers is clear testimony of your desire to achieve economic integration in the SADC region. We in Malawi acknowledge benefits of regional integration which, I am glad to say, include systematic growth and development of the financial sector in general, and of insurance, securities, pension and microfinance subsectors, in particular.  Chairperson, Ladies and Gentlemen, The financial sector is a catalyst of economic growth and all effort to develop and deepen this sector remains a key public policy challenge. In this regard, I find the role of CISNA to be consistent with aspirations of our Governments. CISNA supports initiatives toward the creation of a strong base of domestic non-bank financial institutions, particularly those specialising in the mobilisation of long-term savings, for example life insurance, pensions and collective investment schemes. In addition, CISNA supports measures to increase access to quality insurance and other risk management products by households and entities in the region. CISNA also addresses issues pertaining to market infrastructure and liquidity of capital markets in the region. This is a critical function because assurance of liquidity acts as a catalyst for greater participation of investors, both local and foreign. These noble goals are supported by SADC governments through protocols which aim at promoting financial markets. Chairperson, Ladies and Gentlemen, CISNA plays a very important role in the improvement and harmonization of regulations for the SADC region. Sound and well co-ordinated regulations promote and maintain confidence in regional financial systems. Allow me, therefore, to commend CISNA’s efforts in harmonising standards in regional markets, particularly in insurance, pensions, and capital markets.  Chairperson, Ladies and Gentlemen,  You may wish to know what Malawi is doing with respect to improving the regulatory environment for our financial sector and non-banks, in particular. The process of formulating financial sector bills is in its final stages. These include the Financial Services, the Retirement Funds, the Microfinance, the Financial Cooperatives, and the Securities Bills. BIS Review 114/2009 1 
There are also Payment Systems and Credit Reference Bureau Bills being processed which will also facilitate and support further development of the financial sector. In addition, the Insurance Act and the Banking Act have undergone rigorous scrutiny and review. Once these bills are passed into laws, they will provide us with a stronger mandate and enabling regulatory frameworks for the regulation and supervision of the entire financial sector. I therefore wish to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice for their useful contribution in the formulation of these bills. The Reserve Bank has, however, been the lead institution the formulation of these bills and I thank the team involved. I wish to encourage them not to relax but to continue working hard until these bills are enacted into laws.  Upon enactment of the bills, the Reserve Bank is expected to take on board the regulation and supervision of microfinance and pension plans, in addition to insurance, capital markets and banks. I must say, we are aware of the challenges lying ahead. However, it is my hope that conferences of this nature do provide solutions to such challenges. I therefore call upon all the distinguished delegates to consider this conference as a rare opportunity for sharing experiences on regulation and supervision of non-bank financial institutions.  Chairperson, Ladies and Gentlemen,  You may ask yourselves why SADC, and indeed Malawi, should bother about enabling regulatory frameworks? Recall an African saying which goes “Umanena Chatsitsa Dzaye Kuti Njobvu Ithyoke Mnyanga.” If we consider the recent financial crisis, then the question would be “where did countries slip”? Many countries in the developed world are now calling for a review of the regulatory infrastructure because the general feeling is that it caused the financial crisis. Recent developments in global financial markets strongly suggest the importance of effective regulatory regimes for financial markets. Misguided regulation can have adverse repercussions on the financial sector, and indeed the entire economy. It is for this reason that SADC must maintain high standards of regulation for our financial markets. The Chairperson, Ladies and Gentlemen, I note from the conference program that you will also reflect on the impact of the financial crisis on the SADC region. This is commendable as it is a subject of interest to everyone.  With these remarks, it is now my pleasure and privilege to declare the conference for the Committee of Insurance, Securities and Non bank financial Authorities officially open. Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank you for your attention. 2 BIS Review 114/2009 
Jürgen Stark: Short address at the opening ceremony for the “Language of Money” exhibition Speech by Mr Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Museum für Kommunikation, Berlin, 24 September 2009. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished ambassadors and members of parliament, I am delighted to be here with you in these wonderful premises of the Museum für Kommunikation in Berlin, the oldest former postal museum in the world, and to be able to open the “Language of Money” exhibition. It is with great pleasure that President Trichet acts on behalf of the European Central Bank as a patron of the “Language of Money” exhibition and he deeply regrets not being able to attend today’s opening ceremony in person.  The European Central Bank appreciates and supports activities aimed at educating the public in financial and economic matters and the exhibition which we will see tonight contributes to this goal. It explains the different forms that money took in past societies and the role of money nowadays. The language of money added a new word to its vocabulary in December 1995 and this new word was the euro. You might recall the debate that was had at the time – the name “ECU” did not sound particularly good in German while, for the French, it was the name of an ancient coin. It was decided that choosing the word euro ought to favour no language in particular. This created a solid foundation for the new currency. However, not only the "professional euro-sceptics", but many others too would not have predicted that the euro would be such a success.  The euro came into being on 1 January 1999 and it is now the currency in 16 Member States of the European Union. With the creation of the euro, it became clear that a currency could represent a decisive step on the long path towards an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe.  Since the euro’s introduction, Europeans have benefited from price stability. This is a great success story. The maintenance of price stability, which constitutes the primary goal of the ECB, benefits all citizens of the euro area directly. It protects income and savings, and helps reduce borrowing costs, thus promoting investment and economic growth, which are prerequisites for job creation and prosperity. In recent months, we have seen another of the euro’s benefits during the financial crisis. The euro protected the euro area from internal exchange rate tensions as well as from political ones, as it had done on previous occasions.  As the euro banknotes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002, they became one of the most tangible symbols of Europe. The euro has quickly become an integral part of the everyday lives of citizens within the euro area and it is now used by almost 330 million Europeans on a daily basis. Some 12.5 billion euro banknotes are currently in circulation in Europe and beyond, with a total face value of more than €750 billion. Today, the euro is an internationally accepted currency. People have confidence in the euro – confidence that others accept the currency, that this money is “valid” and that its stability will be sustained over the long term. This confidence is crucial for a currency to thrive. These days, with the euro as our currency, we hardly give a thought to how much it has changed our everyday lives; we can travel without paying a commission to exchange money within the euro area or transfer money within this area and pay the same fee as for a national transfer. In all euro area countries, we can simply hand over some cash or give the cashier a payment card or have the amount due transferred from our bank account to another account with one click of a mouse. However, we should not forget that it has not always been this BIS Review 114/2009 1 
easy. In this respect, the exhibition is a worthwhile attempt to make people more familiar with the language of money, as money is an integral part of our society.  The importance of money in the modern economy is such that it is crucial to be proactive in educating all citizens about how to deal with their own financial affairs in a responsible and cautious manner. This exhibition explains the various forms that money can take. I should also like to take this opportunity to highlight the fruitful cooperation between the European Central Bank and the Museum für Kommunikation which has given the ECB the opportunity to display its “Euro Exhibition” in the museum’s premises from 20 November 2009 until 17 January 2010. I do not want to reveal too many details at this stage, but, as you may have a chance to discover for yourselves later this year, the “Euro Exhibition” features a common theme that will naturally complement the exhibition on the “Language of Money”. It will tell you all about the euro banknotes and how to detect counterfeits in an interactive and entertaining manner. You will be able to learn how the euro aids communication and connection between the people in Europe and the rest of the world. I should therefore like to warmly invite you to this exhibition, which opens on 20 November here at the Museum für Kommunikation in Berlin, before it continues its journey around Europe, having already been shown in Italy, Slovakia and Spain.  I should like to take this opportunity to wish you a very enjoyable and informative experience during your visit to the “Language of Money” exhibition and to once again congratulate the Museum für Kommunikation in Berlin on this valuable initiative. 2 BIS Review 114/2009 
Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Current challenges confronting central banks Opening and keynote address by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the SEACEN-BNM Banking and Financial Law School 2009 "Current Challenges in Central Banking – Legal Perspective", Lanai Kijang, 24 September 2009. *      *      * It is my great pleasure to speak at the 5th Banking and Financial Law School 2009, jointly organized by the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN) Research and Training Centre, the Institute of Bankers Malaysia and Bank Negara Malaysia. The theme for this year's Banking and Financial Law School on "the legal perspective of the current challenges in Central Banking" has particular relevance in the present environment. Indeed, global attention is now focussed on an overhaul of the financial architecture in the efforts to address the fundamental weaknesses that have surfaced in this recent global financial crisis.  The current policy debates cover a wide ranging set of issues that include far-reaching regulatory reforms to strengthen the foundations for financial stability, institutional arrangements to achieve more efficient functioning of financial markets, effective coordination of financial stability measures and greater clarity of central bank mandates in promoting monetary and financial stability. The theme of this conference also has special relevance to us at Bank Negara Malaysia, as our new Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009 will come into force later this year. We are very honoured to host the conference for this year and are pleased to welcome so many distinguished members of the legal fraternity, in particular, from other parts of the world to join us at this forum.  My remarks today will focus on three key challenges confronting Central Banks, and how the legal aspects impact the effectiveness of Central Banks. The first relates to building the capacity to manage the increasing uncertainties generated by financial innovation, the increasing prominence of the non-regulated sector and the increasing interconnectedness between financial institutions and markets. Such developments have not only resulted in the emergence of new risks to the financial system but have also changed the dynamics of how risks in the financial system are transmitted to the real economy. In this environment, it is vital to have a legal and regulatory framework that is robust and dynamic enough to enable the central bank to respond to these developments.  The second challenge concerns the effective implementation of financial safety nets and the effective coordination of the different components of the safety net to maintain public confidence and to support continuous financial intermediation. Appropriate legislation and regulations that ensure credibility and integrity of the safety nets are an essential part of maintaining financial stability.  The third relates to the increasingly and highly complex financial and economic integration associated with globalisation. This has resulted in a significant expansion in cross-border financial activities and introduced new sources of risks to domestic financial systems. The recent crisis raised many issues for which clear solutions, or even consensus, have yet to emerge, including on the propensity for home bias in the policy responses, suitable approaches to cross-border resolutions, and the significant challenge of coordinating policies across different legal and institutional frameworks. This is an area where the legal framework remains highly fragmented. A sustainable solution will require legal reforms in particular, to provide certainty and clarity in dealing with crises. As events in the current global environment have demonstrated, central banking has become significantly more challenging. The issues confronting central banks today are far more diverse and complex, prompting the re-examination of the role of central banks, the capacity to manage and contain risks to monetary and financial stability, and the governance BIS Review 113/2009 1 
arrangements and the policy instruments that are needed to support the effectiveness of central banks.  The new Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009 which was passed by Parliament in July this year represents the culmination of more than two years work to address the issues and challenges that are confronting Central Banks in this rapidly changing environment. The Act elaborates extensively giving greater clarity on the mandates for which we are accountable and providing enhanced powers to undertake these mandates. In the principal objective of promoting monetary stability, it is recognised that price stability is to be achieved in an environment of sustainable growth of the economy. Consideration is thus given to the sustained implications of monetary stability measures on the real economy. The law therefore requires the Bank to take a balanced view to avoid the adoption of rigid frameworks that may result in strong biases that would lead to a fundamental and sustained damage to the economy. This balance is also extended to the explicit role of the Bank in developing an inclusive financial system in its responsibility to develop a sound and progressive financial system. These considerations are particularly important for emerging market economies so as to ensure balanced economic progress and development. The new Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009 also institutionalises the autonomy for the formulation of monetary policy, thus providing for the integrity and credibility of the decisions made. It also provides for greater flexibility in monetary policy implementation, allowing for a diversified range of instruments that can now be deployed for the implementation of monetary policy. As financial markets trend towards greater sophistication and demonstrate periods of extreme volatility, central banks must have commensurate capabilities to conduct monetary policy operations in order to maintain price stability. Equally important is the mandate to provide oversight over the money and foreign exchange market to ensure the orderly development and functioning of the markets. These necessary powers are however, combined with a system of checks and balances to enable the Bank to act decisively, but yet having in place safeguards so as to enhance transparency and accountability.  More extensive powers to achieve financial stability In the area of financial stability, our new Central Bank Act incorporates an explicit mandate of the Central Bank for financial stability. This mandate is articulated in terms of the risks to financial stability that includes risks that disrupts the financial intermediation process (including the orderly functioning of the financial markets), or which affects public confidence. The Act also provides comprehensive provisions for heightened surveillance, pre-emptive actions and expanded resolution powers to facilitate the swift and orderly resolution of financial crises. The Bank may also take appropriate intervention actions to avert risks that stem from unregulated entities.  The Act further acknowledges the importance of coordinated policy measures across different agencies whose actions can affect financial stability. Accordingly, the new Act provides for cooperation arrangements with other supervisory authorities and the ability of the Central Bank to make recommendations to such authorities on measures or safeguards for promoting financial stability. These new powers are complemented by strengthened institutional arrangements in the form of the establishment of a Financial Stability Executive Committee that will be formed to ensure the effective coordination of regulatory authorities in financial resolution. Enhanced governance and accountability framework  With these enhanced powers, the governance and accountability framework in the Act has also been strengthened considerably. This relates to the enhanced role of the Board of Directors' in the oversight of the management of the Bank. In providing enhanced powers to the Central Bank to address financial stability issues and the strengthening of the oversight 2 BIS Review 113/2009 
function of the Bank, correspondingly, focus has also been given to governance, internal controls and risk management by the Bank. For this purpose, the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009 empowers the Board to establish three specific committees, namely the Board Governance Committee, Board Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee that are chaired by a non-executive director, to ensure the independence of the oversight on the functioning of the Bank. A comprehensive financial system safety net  Let me now turn to the second key area confronting central banks, namely the need to have in place an effective financial safety net. The global experience in these recent two decades has shown that crises have continued to plague the world and have resulted in massive costs to the economy. Financial safety nets serve two primary purposes, that is to avert risks to financial stability and to reduce the costs to the financial system and economy in the event of a crisis. They also serve an important social purpose of protecting savers and investors. The first component of the financial safety net is the existence of an effective regulatory and supervisory system to ensure the sound management of financial institutions and the ability to deal with problems affecting financial stability. This includes adequate powers and instruments to mitigate losses to the system in the event of a crisis, restore stability and ensure the continuity of the financial intermediation process. The second is the lender of last resort facility that is provided by central banks to address liquidity stresses faced by financial institutions. Thirdly, is the deposit insurance scheme that provides a guarantee on deposits to protect the savings of small depositors and reduce the prospects for disruptions that could threaten the stability of the financial system.  The effectiveness of the financial safety net depends on several factors. They include the capacity of central banks and supervisory authorities to assess risks, the effective coordination between the different components of the safety net, clear communication strategies and a strong and comprehensive legal framework that supports the operation of the safety net. In Malaysia, the Malaysia Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (MDIC Act) which establishes the Malaysian Deposit Insurance Corporation (MDIC) provides comprehensive intervention powers for the protection of depositors. This is complemented by an extensive operating framework developed between the Central Bank and the MDIC which clearly sets out the responsibilities and obligations of both agencies in promoting financial stability and in financial resolution. In the area of consumer protection, amendments to Malaysia's financial services legislation are also being put in place to provide for the establishment, roles and functions of a financial ombudsman to deal expediently and efficiently with disputes concerning financial services between consumers and the financial institutions. Let me now turn to the challenges arising from greater financial globalisation and the growing importance of international cooperation in ensuring sustainable economic and financial integration across national borders. In this environment regulators are confronted with the challenge of adapting regulatory and legal norms from a nation-centric system to norms that are more reflective of international business and finance. The issue is how to complement the domestic agenda and the international agenda. Regulatory problems arise not only because of the need for domestic regulators – operating within diverse national regulatory norms and cultures – to cooperate and coordinate in the domestic environment but also across jurisdictions.  Operational and legal issues in cross-border resolution arise where the regulatory frameworks of different countries do not provide for a common solution in areas such as the unwinding of financial transactions and the enforceability of secured parties' rights to collateral in the foreign jurisdiction. Failure to address such resolution issues promptly, generally within a matter of days, can lead to increased uncertainty and potential cross-border conflicts. Authorities must also have access to information that is not regularly BIS Review 113/2009 3 
exchanged in the normal course of supervisory cooperation. This needs to be supported by consistent requirements for the coordinated execution of regulatory actions. Equally important is an effective legal infrastructure for the mediation of claims against insolvent institutions with international operations Concurrence among regulatory authorities on key elements of effective resolutions would be an important step forward. Greater harmonization and clarity about the triggers for action, the tools to return insured funds quickly to depositors, the authority to implement a quick resolution, and the legal powers to restructure and continue key banking functions would allow for more effective crisis management. Hence, it is not just about opening our borders; we need to examine how our domestic regulatory framework interfaces with that of other countries. International cooperation The regional cooperation among central banks in East Asia have advanced significantly in this recent decade in the aftermath of the Asian Financial crisis. The focus of cooperation has been in the areas of financial stability, financial markets and payment and settlement systems. The participation in the working, technical and high level committees have contributed towards efforts to facilitate the adoption of international standards for banking supervision and financial stability taking into consideration the regional perspective. It has also contributed towards identifying supervisory priorities and areas of concern that will have an impact on financial stability, and towards improving techniques relating to supervision and surveillance. Challenges pertaining to cross-border issues such as regulatory arbitrage, competition laws, regulatory harmonisation are, however, yet to be fully resolved. The new Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009 gives Bank Negara additional flexibility and the mandate to engage in international cooperation. The Act allows for the Bank to engage with foreign supervisory authorities to coordinate and cooperate on financial stability measures. The new constituent law also incorporates a specific provision for the Bank to participate and provide appropriate resources in arrangements, schemes, programmes, or initiatives with any other central banks or international financial institutions or authorities to promote bilateral, regional and international monetary, financial or economic co-operation.  Conclusion In conclusion, the supporting legal framework for central banking and the financial system is a key element to addressing the challenges faced by central banks. I have highlighted three areas which are currently very relevant in the current global financial system. Central banks in the advanced financial systems have resorted to unorthodox measures to prevent a systemic collapse of the global financial system. While action has been based on the sense of urgency and to avoid a total collapse of the system, in the aftermath of the crisis, an extensive review of the legislation needs to be made. The more challenging part is to effectively address cross-border issues facing national financial systems. Regardless of whether we are in a state of crisis, these challenges will continue to be relevant given that conditions will continue to be dynamic and the trend towards a more globalised world will not reverse.  On this highly complex subject, this two day conference will likely generate highly engaging discussions. I wish the Banking and Financial Law School a highly productive outcome and hope that your stay in Malaysia will be enjoyable and memorable.  4 BIS Review 113/2009 
Njuguna Ndung’u: Central Bank of Kenya’s new website – improving communication Speech by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, at the official launch of the Central Bank of Kenya’s new website, Nairobi, 1 September 2009. *      *      * Mr. Mutua Kilaka, Financial Secretary, Ministry of Finance; Dr. Geoffrey Mwau, Economic Secretary, Ministry of Finance; Dr. Bitange Ndemo, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Information & Communication; Board Members here present; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen: You are all welcome to the launch of the new CBK website today. Let me at this early juncture thank our Chief Guest, Mr. Mutua Kilaka for accepting to launch our new website and to all our distinguished guests for joining the Central Bank fraternity in marking this occasion. Ladies and Gentlemen, it is important to note from the very onset that central banking has undergone dramatic changes in recent decades and many central banks now post and communicate their policies and forecasts in their websites. Conventional wisdom in central banking previously held that monetary policymakers should say as little as possible and say it cryptically. In recent years, the understanding of central bank transparency and communication has changed dramatically. On its part, the Central Bank of Kenya has employed a wide range of communication channels to ensure it efficiently and effectively communicates with the market as well as target audience. The launch of our new website today marks a major milestone towards the achievement of the Bank’s vision of becoming a world class, modern Central Bank. Our new website is also part of the Bank’s communication strategy aimed at improving Central Bank communication platform and policy. Ladies & Gentlemen, Central Bank communication is important for financial market participants as it forms the basis for their extrapolations regarding current and future policy actions that might impact the value of their financial assets. So far, communication between the Central Bank and financial markets has worked fairly well. Market participants have learnt over time to distinguish between information and “noise”. The Central Bank, on its part, has remained committed to provide markets with information while avoiding the “noise”. It has become increasingly clear to us that managing public expectations through effective communication is a central part of monetary policy and indeed, of central banking. This is an important aspect of formulating and communicating policy. Public expectations are more likely to help foster economic stability when the public has a clear understanding of what the Central Bank’s goals are, how the Central Bank thinks the economy works and how it is likely to respond to various economic circumstances. Our new website has been designed to enhance communication with the financial and other markets by providing accurate and timely information. The feedback mechanism demonstrated today will serve to ensure that the Bank stays in touch with public expectations and is responsive to the needs of the market and the general public. The new site also has a chart tool that will assist researchers and students analyze time series and other information available on the website to track policy and economic performance. We believe that our website should not only be a communication tool but also a resource that adds value to those who visit it. We encourage our website visitors to utilize these tools. Ladies & Gentlemen, our communication with the public has to be simple, clear and credible. The sole use of English in our communication has, unfortunately, disenfranchised a good BIS Review 113/2009 1 
number of Kenyans who only speak and understand Kiswahili. The critical challenge we face is in developing a communication infrastructure and strategy that will effectively communicate to a wide audience. The development of a Kiswahili version on our new website is a first step towards ensuring that the Bank is responsive to the demands of a target audience that dominantly speaks the national language. On the strength of this initiative, the Bank will consider publishing sections of the weekly bulletin and monthly economic review in Kiswahili. We will also continue to publish exhaustive analyses and commentaries on our website and offer assessments regarding future economic developments. The Bank also recognizes the critical role that the media plays in educating the public on financial and economic issues. Our new website has dedicated a link for media houses to access information that will facilitate their role. It is encouraging to note that some media houses have published staff commentaries and analyses carried on our website. This collaboration will ensure that the public receives information that is complete and correct. In conclusion, let me observe that in uncertain economic times, communication is not only an instrument, it is also an asset valued by the public. The Central Bank, the media and other institutions have an obligation to communicate effectively while being aware of the adverse effects that misinformation can have on financial market participants, households and businesses. We have positioned our website as the primary tool for Central Bank communication and encourage members of the public to visit it and give us their feedback. On our part, we shall strive to constantly enhance our communication infrastructure to meet the demands of our target audience. With these few remarks, it is my singular honour to call upon the Mr. Mutua Kilaka, Financial Secretary, Ministry of Finance to give his remarks and officially launch our website. Bwana Kilaka. Karibu Sana. 2 BIS Review 113/2009 
David Longworth: Promoting Canada's economic and financial well-being Remarks by Mr David Longworth, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Greater Summerside Chamber of Commerce, Summerside, Prince Edward Island, 23 September 2009.  *      *      * Good morning. It's a pleasure to be here. I'd like to thank the Greater Summerside Chamber of Commerce for hosting this event.  In addition to Michael O'Brien, the Bank of Canada's Director for Prince Edward Island, I'm here with Allan Paquet and David Amirault, who are the Bank's representatives in the Atlantic provinces for, respectively, currency and economics. Allan and David are the Bank's eyes and ears for this region, and they help us to keep on top of various currency and economic developments. For example, David has been monitoring how the global recession and price movements have been affecting PEI industries such as the fishery and tourism. I'd like to take this opportunity today to describe the Bank of Canada's work in very general terms. Until recently, some people were given to thinking that central banking is – what shall I say? – a staid business. But the past two years have proven to be extremely interesting, not only for us at the Bank of Canada, but for all our central bank colleagues around the world. The Bank's mandate is to promote Canada's economic and financial well-being. Clearly, this is an important mandate, and we are determined to demonstrate excellence as we work to fulfill it. We conduct leading-edge research and analysis, and, in doing so, we aim to be "second to none" among the world's central banks.  To fulfill our mandate, we work in four main areas of responsibility: currency, funds management, financial system, and monetary policy.  For each of these areas, the Bank's approach is much the same. First, we have a clear objective. Second, we tend to take a longer-term view of things. Third, we make ourselves accountable by being transparent about the tools we use, the actions we take, and the outcomes of our actions. And, finally, we keep the big picture in mind. In my remarks today, I'll talk about each area of responsibility, with particular emphasis on the last two – financial system and monetary policy. Currency Bank notes are the Bank's most tangible product, and, despite the prevalence of credit and debit cards and other means of payment, the demand for cash continues to grow. The objective of our currency function is to provide Canadians with bank notes that are readily accepted and secure against counterfeiting. In fact, we quantified this goal as fewer than 100 counterfeit notes detected annually per million notes in circulation, and we are now meeting this standard. But we intend to make further progress, and our new goal is fewer than 50 counterfeits detected annually per million notes in circulation. For some time, the Bank has been developing Canada's next bank note series, which we expect to start issuing in late 2011. Planning for a new series of bank notes is a complex job, and so necessitates taking a long view. Our anti-counterfeiting strategy is also a long-term proposition. It contains four elements. The first is to develop bank notes that are ever-more difficult to counterfeit. The second is to increase the routine verification of bank notes by retailers – our regional staff play an important role here by helping in the training of retailers and cash handlers. The third element of the strategy is to maintain the high quality of bank BIS Review 113/2009 1 
notes in circulation. And the fourth is to promote the deterrence of counterfeiting by law-enforcement officers and prosecutors. Regional staff also play key roles in supporting these last two elements of the strategy by liaising with financial institutions and with law-enforcement agencies.  As part of its deterrence work, the Bank has established an annual "Law Enforcement Award of Excellence for Counterfeit Deterrence." This year, the award was presented in Charlottetown to the RCMP's National Anti-Counterfeiting Bureau during the conference of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. Transparency is also important in our currency work. In addition to reporting on the incidence of counterfeiting vis-à-vis our targets, we communicate regularly with the public and retailers about the security features in our bank notes, and we publish the costs of the currency program in our annual report. As to keeping the big picture in mind – well, currency is only one of several means of payment. The Bank conducts research on the factors that influence choices in means of payment, and we monitor trends. This helps us to understand the role of bank notes in transactions, and to forecast demand. I'll now say a few words about the Bank's second area of responsibility: funds management. Funds management The Bank of Canada is the federal government's banker, fiscal agent, and adviser on funds management. The objective of this work is to provide these services effectively and efficiently. The responsibility includes managing Canada's foreign exchange reserves, the government's cash, and, in collaboration with the Department of Finance, the public debt, including Canada Savings Bonds, which go on sale this year on October 5. As part of this responsibility, the Bank also gives advice to the Department of Finance on these issues, as well as on issues that have arisen in the context of the financial crisis. For example, our advice fed into the design of the Insured Mortgage Purchase Program, which allowed the federal government to buy pools of insured mortgages through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, as well as the design of the Canadian Secured Credit Facility, which was set up to purchase asset-backed securities. Managing and providing advice on debt and reserves also require taking a long view. Generally speaking, the management of financial assets and liabilities requires a forward-looking risk-management framework, as well as long-term strategies.  And of course it's essential to be completely transparent when it comes to managing government funds and public money. The Bank discusses the various tools it uses and reports on the operations and actions it carries out to manage financial assets and the outstanding stock of federal debt. It does this via its own website, the Department of Finance's website, and in the Bank's annual report.  Finally, in our funds-management work, we always look at the big picture. The range and complexity of operations and the need to carefully manage risk require us to consider a very broad picture when we develop our framework for the governance of funds management and formulate our policies.  Now I'll turn to the Bank of Canada's third area of responsibility – the financial system.  Financial system  As recent events have made clear, a sound financial system is essential to a well-functioning economy. The objective of the Bank's work here is to promote the stability and efficiency of the financial system, both domestically and globally.  2 BIS Review 113/2009 
To achieve this objective, we again take the long view. Together with other policy-makers in Canada and abroad, the Bank strives to develop, and contribute to, policy that will help to sustain a stable and efficient financial system over time. This long-term focus aids in creating and maintaining an environment in which risks can be properly assessed and sound investment decisions effectively made. That said, we also have to be nimble, and react quickly to market developments. For example, since the onset of the financial crisis, we have provided considerable liquidity to the Canadian financial system, in a variety of forms. We currently auction liquidity three times a week. It is extremely important for a central bank to be transparent in its financial system work. In our Financial System Review we communicate, on a regular basis, our assessment of the key risks and vulnerabilities, as well as our analysis of certain policy issues. We also provide clear information about our operations. For example, as the Bank provided liquidity, we communicated clearly and in a timely fashion, the relevant policies and principles, the facilities we were using, and the scale of our operations, as well as the status of key markets.  Financial markets have improved to such an extent that the demand for our term liquidity facilities has been waning. Of the three facilities that we offer, there is currently no demand for the Term Loan Facility, demand for the facility for Private Sector Instruments has recently been half of what we have been auctioning, and even demand for Term Purchase and Resale Agreements, our "workhorse" facility, has declined as conditions in funding markets have improved. Against this background, the Bank announced yesterday that the first two facilities will expire at the end of October, and that the auctions for the third facility will now be held bi-weekly instead of weekly. Of course, the financial system has many interdependent elements, and we again must keep the big picture in mind. This is especially true in our monitoring of the financial system, in our assessment of risks, and in our policy analysis. In the current context, two aspects of our policy work are worth noting. First, there were times during the financial crisis when liquidity dried up in almost all financial markets. However, not all markets are critical to the proper functioning of the financial system, so the Bank has been working to identify "core" markets, markets that, through appropriate policies, we would strive to keep operating without interruption, even during a shock. Second, because the regulatory system has tended to focus more on individual financial institutions than on interdependencies or systemic risk, the Bank of Canada, like many other central banks, has been looking at ways to strengthen financial regulation by adding a "macroprudential" orientation – that is, more focus on the system as a whole.  I'll turn now to the Bank's fourth and final area of responsibility: monetary policy. Monetary policy Monetary policy can get complicated, but the objective is straightforward: it's to foster confidence in the value of money by keeping inflation low, stable, and predictable. In an agreement with the government of Canada, the Bank has an inflation target of 2 per cent, which makes this objective very explicit. By its very nature, monetary policy work necessitates having a long view. The Bank achieves the inflation target by raising or lowering the target for the overnight interest rate which, in turn, influences other interest rates, and, ultimately, the overall demand for goods and services. This sequence of events takes time, and monetary policy typically tries to influence inflation 6 to 8 quarters into the future. Put differently, monetary policy works with a significant lag, so, when we make our interest rate decisions, we rely on various indicators of future inflation, and take a medium-term view of the economy.  Low, stable, and predictable inflation brings about real benefits. It allows consumers, businesses, and investors to read price signals clearly, and thus to make financial decisions with confidence. It allows businesses to make long-term investments which, in turn, BIS Review 113/2009 3 
contributes to sustained job creation. And, importantly, it helps to make the economy more resilient to shocks. Many of you will remember the days of high and variable inflation, and can therefore appreciate the progress we've made. Since 1995, total CPI inflation has averaged 2 per cent per year. That's a good record, but the Bank is always looking at ways to strengthen its tools and the outcomes of monetary policy.  In response to the global financial crisis and recession, the Bank's monetary policy has been very aggressive, and since April of this year, the target for the overnight rate has been one quarter of one per cent – that's effectively as low as it can go. In other words, we cannot lower our policy rate any further to provide economic stimulus. Recognizing the possibility that additional stimulus might be required, we researched and identified three additional monetary policy tools that we could use. The Bank has not used the first two tools – quantitative and credit easing, which involve the purchase of assets – but they remain available to us.  We have, however, employed the third tool identified, and that is the use of "conditional statements" about the future path of monetary policy. In our April monetary policy decision, we said that, conditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate could be expected to remain at its current, very low level until the end of the second quarter of 2010. This longer-term guidance helps to influence interest rates at longer maturities.  The Bank has also been examining whether the inflation-control framework might be improved. Specifically, in advance of the next agreement that we'll sign with the federal government in 2011, we've been studying whether 2 per cent is the best target, and whether the target should be (as it currently is) the rate of inflation or the path of the price level.  All to say, our monetary policy work really does take a long view of things.  Now a word about transparency in monetary policy. I've spoken about the tools we use to achieve the inflation target. With regard to our actions, we make our policy rate decisions eight times a year on a fixed schedule, issue a press release each time, and, four times a year, explain our analysis and projections in detail in our Monetary Policy Reports. The outcome of monetary policy – total CPI inflation – is measurable, and our performance is transparent. I should add a word about "core" inflation. The more volatile price components of the CPI – such as fruit, vegetables, and gasoline, as well as the effect of changes in indirect taxes – can cause a good deal of temporary movement in total CPI inflation, so the Bank of Canada uses a core measure of inflation, which excludes these volatile components, as a useful guide to policy. The core measure of inflation helps us to "see through" short-term volatility when we make our policy decisions. As to keeping the big picture in mind: monetary policy focuses on the Canadian economy as a whole, and aims to achieve a national inflation rate. Of course, to get a sense of the national economy, we need to closely monitor regional developments. We have five regional offices across the country, including the Atlantic region office in Halifax, from which our staff go out to visit businesses and gather information on issues related to the economy. We communicate the highlights of this information in our quarterly Business Outlook Survey, which is available on our website. So those are the four areas of responsibility in which the Bank of Canada works to carry out its mandate.  Before I conclude, I'll say a few words about the economic outlook and the monetary policy decision announced on 10 September. The press release that accompanied the announcement noted that, following a deep, synchronous, global recession, recent indicators point to the start of a recovery in the major economies, supported by aggressive policy stimulus and the stabilization of global financial markets. In Canada, stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, improved financial conditions, 4 BIS Review 113/2009 
firmer commodity prices, and a rebound in business and consumer confidence are supporting the growth of domestic demand. Combined with recent information on inventory adjustments and automotive production, this suggests that GDP growth in the second half of 2009 could be stronger than we projected back in July. Total CPI inflation is expected to trough in the current quarter before returning to the 2 per cent target in the second quarter of 2011 as aggregate supply and demand return to balance. The Bank said that, conditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate could be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. The underlying macroeconomic risks to the projection were judged to be roughly balanced. We also noted that persistent strength in the Canadian dollar remains a risk to growth and to the return of inflation to target, and that the Bank retained considerable flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates.  Finally, it would be timely to mention that, earlier this week, the Bank launched its new medium-term plan. The plan sets out the key priorities for the Bank over the next three years, discusses relevant trends and challenges, and lists the measures by which we will gauge our performance and make ourselves accountable. This plan, which will soon be posted on our website, guides our work over the medium term. It shows that having clear objectives, taking the long view, being transparent, and keeping the big picture in mind, will continue to be our approach in the years ahead. Conclusion The past two years have been difficult for many Canadians. The financial crisis and the recession have taken an economic toll, and they have tested our confidence.  However, Canadians can have confidence in their central bank. Specifically, you can be sure that the Bank of Canada will continue to promote the country's economic and financial welfare, communicate its objectives clearly, and stand accountable for its actions. And we will continue to demonstrate a commitment to excellence in all our work. These commitments will help to strengthen the economy in both good times and bad, and they will help to sustain a stable and efficient financial system. BIS Review 113/2009 5 
Njuguna Ndung’u: Financial sector collaboration Opening remarks by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, at the breakfast meeting for domestic financial sector regulators, Nairobi, 31 August 2009. *      *      * Hon. Deputy Prime Minister and minister for Finance Board Members and Chief Executive Officers of RBA, CMA and IRA, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is my pleasure to be with you this morning and I am indeed honored to be accorded this opportunity to give brief remarks at this important breakfast meeting where the Domestic Financial Sector Regulators will be signing the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on financial sector Collaboration. At the onset, allow me to extend my gratitude to the Hon. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance for agreeing to grace the ceremony and deliver a key note address. In the same token, let me take this opportunity to recognise the work of The Technical Committee on Collaboration which has been instrumental in organising the event. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Monetary Affairs Committee is a caucus of Central Bank Governors under the East African Community Monetary Union which is mandated, among others, to harmonize regulatory regimes and supervisory frameworks in the region in the banking sectors. During the 12th Monetary Affairs Committee (MAC) Governors’ Meeting held in Kigali, Rwanda in May 2009, my fellow Governors and I celebrated the execution of the MOU amongst the five Central Banks, which was put into effect in early 2009. It was indeed pleasing for Governors to note that the Bank of Uganda had already signed an MOU with other domestic financial sector regulators in Uganda. Other MAC Governors were therefore urged to implement a similar arrangement with their respective domestic regulators by June 2010. This is to demonstrate that collaboration amongst domestic regulators is in line with regional aspirations. Consequently the celebrations that we mark today will enable CBK achieve a milestone set by MAC Governors ahead of the set time of June 2010. I cannot thank my fellow domestic regulators enough. But for the Kenyan side, let me commend RBA and Edward Odundo for the time and effort he has put on this initiative. As you are aware, there has been increased integration of economic and financial markets globally. Globalization is creating new business opportunities and opening new markets. However, the forces of globalization and the ensuing competition are prompting financial companies to engage in business operations that make group management and risk aggregation more challenging. Similarly, a new concept of cross-ownership and trading is emerging in our market, thus blurring sector boundaries and product lines. For example, we have banks that want to offer bancassurance while insurance companies are underwriting financial risks that were once a domain of investment banks. As a result, it is becoming increasingly difficult for one regulator to set up a regulatory regime without taking into consideration the impact it bears on the other financial sub-sectors. In the same vein, we are increasingly seeing banks acquiring brokerage firms in the capital market. Harmonisation of regulatory regimes in the entire financial sector is therefore critical in order to offer consistency and maintain financial stability. The ongoing global financial crisis has only served to underscore the inter-linkages of financial systems. The crisis has demonstrated that risks and shocks that originate from one area can be transmitted internally within a group or externally through converging products, markets or cross borders. In this regard, financial sector regulators should base their supervision on a consolidated basis by reviewing risks across the entire financial spectrum rather than purely on an industry solo basis. BIS Review 112/2009 1 
Ladies and Gentlemen, before I conclude my remarks, allow me, on behalf of my fellow regulators, and on my own behalf, to express our sincere gratitude to all the guests who responded to our invitation and set aside time to grace this ceremony. I am sure also, the totality of the financial market will appreciate this move by the regulators. Finally, Ladies and Gentlemen, being aware of the task ahead of us, let me take this opportunity to invite our chief guest to address this gathering. Welcome Deputy Prime Minister, Hon. Uhuru Kenyatta. 2 BIS Review 112/2009 
Lars E O Svensson: Flexible inflation targeting – lessons from the financial crisis Speech by Mr Lars E O Svensson, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the workshop “Towards a new framework for monetary policy? Lessons from the crisis”, organized by the Netherlands Bank, Amsterdam, 21 September 2009. I am grateful to Claes Berg, Ylva Hedén, Jonas Niemeyer, Virginia Queijo von Heideken, Annika Svensson, Ulf Söderström, Staffan Viotti, Anders Vredin, Karl Walentin and, especially, Björn Lagerwall, for comments and help with the speech. The views presented here are my own and not necessarily those of other members of the Riksbank’s executive board or staff. *      *      * 1.  Introduction The financial crisis has raised some questions regarding monetary policy and how it should be conducted in relation to financial conditions such as credit growth, asset prices, imbalances, the risk of creating bubbles and so on. I will discuss two particular questions: Has monetary policy contributed to the conditions for the crisis? Do the lessons from the crisis justify any changes in the way best-practice monetary policy should be conducted? I will lay out my pre-crisis view of best-practice monetary policy – flexible inflation targeting – and its relation to financial stability and asset prices, discuss the role of monetary policy in possibly contributing to the current financial crisis and, finally, present my conclusions on whether flexible inflation targeting needs to be modified in the light of the crisis.  2.  Flexible inflation targeting The Riksbank and all the other inflation-targeting central banks conduct flexible inflation targeting rather than strict inflation targeting. Flexible inflation targeting means that monetary policy aims at stabilizing both inflation around the inflation target and the real economy, whereas strict inflation targeting aims at stabilizing inflation only, without regard to the stability of the real economy, what Mervyn King (1997) has described as being an “inflation nutter”. By stabilizing the real economy I mean stabilizing resource utilization around a normal level, keeping in mind that monetary policy cannot affect the long-term level of resource utilization. Because of the time lags between monetary-policy actions and their effect on inflation and the real economy, effective flexible inflation targeting has to rely on forecasts of inflation and the real economy. Flexible inflation targeting can be described as “forecast targeting”: The central bank chooses a policy-rate path so that the forecast of inflation and resource utilization “looks good.” By a forecast that looks good I mean a forecast either in which inflation is already on target and resource utilization is already normal, or in which inflation is approaching the target and resource utilization is approaching a normal level at an appropriate pace. More precisely, it means a forecast for inflation and resource utilization that as effectively as possible stabilizes inflation around the inflation target and resource utilization around its normal level. In the event of conflicting objectives, it achieves a reasonable compromise between the stability of inflation and the stability of resource BIS Review 112/2009 1 
utilization.1 Different central banks express this in slightly different words. The Riksbank has often used the term “well-balanced” monetary policy.2The forecasts of inflation and the real economy are then conditional on the central bank’s view of the transmission mechanism, an estimate of the current state of the economy and a forecast of important exogenous variables. The central bank uses all relevant information that has an impact on the forecast of inflation and the real economy. In this framework, the central bank takes financial conditions such as credit growth, asset prices, imbalances, potential bubbles and so on into account only to the extent that they have an impact on the forecast of inflation and resource utilization. Inflation and resource utilization are target variables here, that is, variables that are arguments of the central bank’s loss function. Hence, financial conditions are not target variables. Instead, they are only indicators, as they provide information about the state of the economy, the transmission mechanism and exogenous shocks to the central bank. Financial conditions then affect policy rates only to the extent that they have an impact on the forecast of inflation and resource utilization.33.  Financial stability as a rarely binding constraint – a pre-crisis view What is the role of financial stability in a pre-crisis view of flexible inflation targeting? Maintaining financial stability, including a well-functioning payment system, is, explicitly or implicitly, an important objective for central banks. In my overview of best-practice monetary policy in Svensson (2002), long before the crisis but during an ongoing debate about monetary policy and asset prices, I briefly discussed how this objective can be reconciled with flexible inflation targeting, how conflicts can arise and how they could be handled.4One question is whether financial stability belongs in the loss function for the central bank, together with inflation and resource utilization. I argued that a good way of handling this additional objective is as a constraint on monetary policy rather than as a separate target variable that appears in the loss function. The idea is that financial stability is normally pursued with different instruments, such as supervision and regulation, and is normally not a concern for monetary policy. Under normal circumstances, at least in industrialized countries, financial stability is good and does not impose any constraints on monetary policy. Only rarely, when financial crises occur, does financial stability impose constraints on monetary policy and force the central bank to modify its decisions. The typical constraint that I had in mind was that monetary policy would have to be temporarily modified in a more expansionary direction, for instance, in order to improve the situation for a fragile financial sector, perhaps winning some time for a financial sector clean-                                                 1  2  The idea that inflation targeting implies that the inflation forecast can be seen as an intermediate target was introduced in King (1994). The term “inflation-forecast targeting” was introduced in Svensson (1997), and the term “forecast targeting” in Svensson (2005). See Woodford (2007a, b) for more discussion and analysis of forecast targeting. 3  Several central banks who do not call themselves inflation targeters effectively do conduct flexible inflation targeting, although they may not be quite as transparent about their inflation target, the role of stability of the real economy, etc. 4  See Goodfriend (2007) for a presentation of the conventional wisdom about pre-crisis monetary policy. See Bean (2003) for a more detailed pre-crisis discussion of inflation targeting, financial imbalances and asset prices. 2 BIS Review 112/2009 
up and reform. Interestingly and paradoxically, the constraints financial stability has imposed on monetary policy recently have rather been in the opposite direction to the one I anticipated and have prevented the central banks from lowering the policy rate all the way to zero, or even below, because of concerns about the financial sector. The financial crisis and the deep recession that has followed it have motivated large cuts in the policy rate. At the same time, concerns about the possible problems for the financial market apparently made the Bank of England decide to go no lower than 50 basis points and initially, in April 2009, prevented the Riksbank from going below 50 basis points, although the Riksbank later in July lowered the policy rate to 25 basis points.5How does the central bank know whether the constraint binds or not? I thought that it would know by continually monitoring the state of the financial sector. In some countries, the central bank publishes a regular Financial Stability Report of the type pioneered by the Bank of England and the Riksbank. These reports include an analysis of indicators of the state of the financial sector, in particular early-warning indicators of potential future problems. They serve to assure the general public and economic agents that everything is well in the financial sector when this is the case. They also serve as early warnings of the agents' concerns and for the financial-regulation authorities when problems show up on the horizon. Early action could then prevent any financial instability from materializing, thus limiting the probability of future threats to financial stability and future binding constraints on monetary policy. The idea of considering financial stability as a possible constraint on monetary policy rather than a target is consistent with the general idea of seeing financial stability, from a monetary-policy point of view, as an aspect of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, where a reduction in financial stability typically changes the transmission mechanism and makes it less efficient. Asset prices and bubbles The previous discussion has focused on what the central bank should do when it faces an ongoing crisis, or receives signals that a crisis is underway. A related issue is to what extent the central bank should take account of asset prices and, in particular, potential asset-price bubbles. In the forecast targeting framework described above, asset prices will affect policy to the extent they are deemed to affect the forecasts of the central bank's target variables, that is, inflation and resource utilization. Suppose, however, that a large asset-price increase is deemed to be fragile and a possible bubble, with a significant risk for a future collapse. Suppose further that a future collapse is deemed to have undesirable consequences for future inflation and resource utilization. Then the bank faces a delicate situation. It is possible that a policy-rate path with a higher policy-rate in the near future will be deemed to dampen asset-price increases in the near future and also reduce the risk or size of a collapse in the more distant future, thus undershooting the inflation target in the near term but providing a more stable development of inflation and resource utilization in the medium and longer term. These are examples of situations when the central bank may choose to respond to asset-price developments. However, the reason for these responses is that the central bank is concerned with the repercussions for inflation and resource utilization, not with the asset prices as such. That is, asset prices are not target variables; they do not enter the loss function. It goes without saying that in most realistic situations it will be very difficult to judge whether a particular asset-price movement is a bubble or is grounded in expectations about reasonable                                                  5  See the box “Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates” in the February 2009 Inflation Report (Bank of England 2009, p. 44). My own view is that the “zero interest-rate mystique” may have been somewhat exaggerated, see the discussion in the Riksbank’s minutes of its September 2009 policy meeting (Sveriges Riksbank 2009). BIS Review 112/2009 3 
fundamentals, and whether there are repercussions on inflation and resource utilization that motivate adjustment of the policy-rate path.6 This is obviously an area where good judgment is crucial. There is no scope for any mechanical adjustment of asset prices or bubbles. The central bank's reaction will not be stable but shift with its judgment and, counter to substantial parts of the literature, I do not believe that it is productive to discuss these issues directly in terms of the central bank's reaction function, for instance as modifications of a Taylor rule (Svensson 2003b, 2005). Asset-price movements and asset-price bubbles may directly threaten financial stability and cause the financial-stability constraints on monetary policy to bind. Thus, the central bank may want to respond to asset price developments that increase the risk of financial instability in the future. Again, in many realistic situations, the difficulty in making such judgments will be very great and there will be insufficient information for taking such preemptive action in many cases. Now, is there any reason to modify this view of monetary policy and financial stability given the experience of the financial crisis so far? Let me approach this question by asking what the causes of the financial crisis are, what the role of monetary policy is in causing the crisis and whether a different monetary policy was warranted and could have prevented or reduced the size of the crisis. 4.  The role of monetary policy in the financial crisis As I see it, the crisis was mainly caused by conditions that had very little to do with monetary policy and were mostly due to regulatory failures and, to some extent, to specific circumstances, including the U.S. housing policy to support home ownership for low-income households.7 The macro conditions preceding the crisis included low world real interest rates due to global imbalances, as well as the Great Moderation with a long period of very stable growth and stable low inflation, which led to a systematic underestimation of risk and very low risk premia in financial markets. There were distorted incentives for commercial and investment banks to increase leverage that were made possible by lax regulation and supervision and the lack of an appropriate bank resolution regime, as well as distorted incentives to exercise less due diligence in loan origination because of securitisation and to conduct regulatory arbitrage by setting up off-balance-sheet entities which for various specific reasons ended up still effectively remaining on the balance sheet. There were also distorted incentives for traders and fund managers to take excessive risks because of myopic and asymmetric remuneration contracts. There were eventually enormous information problems in assessing the risks of extremely complex asset-backed securities, and there was a huge underestimation of the potential for correlated systemic risks. None of these causes had anything to do with monetary policy, except that monetary policy may have contributed to the Great Moderation. So what was the potential role of monetary policy in contributing to the crisis? The main argument blaming monetary policy for the crisis is that policy rates in the U.S. were kept too                                                  6  Kohn (2006, 2008) specifies three conditions that should be fulfilled for central banks to take “extra action” to deal with a possible asset-price bubble: “First, policymakers must be able to identify bubbles in a timely fashion with reasonable confidence. Second, a somewhat tighter monetary policy must have a high probability that it will help to check at least some of the speculative activity. And third, the expected improvement in future economic performance that would result from the curtailment of the bubble must be sufficiently great.” He concludes, also in 2008 and after thorough considerations, that those conditions would rarely be met. 7  See Bean (2009) for an extensive and excellent discussion of the crisis, including the credit expansion and housing boom, the macroeconomic antecedents, the distorted incentives, the information problems, the amplification and propagation of the crisis into the real economy, the policy responses and the lessons for monetary policy and economics generally. 4 BIS Review 112/2009 
low during the period 2001-2005, which would have contributed to the build-up of excessive credit growth and a house-price bubble (Taylor 2007). There are two relevant questions in this context about U.S. monetary policy during 2001-2005. First, was the low interest rate reasonable given the information available at the time? Second, could a different monetary policy with higher interest rates have prevented the crisis? The first question, whether the low interest rate was reasonable given the available information, is the relevant one when evaluating monetary policy. It is more relevant to evaluate policy taking into account the information available ex ante to the policymaker rather than information ex post that was unknown to the policymaker (see Svensson 2009 on evaluating monetary policy ex ante and ex post).8 During this time, given the information available, there was a genuine and well-motivated fear of the U.S. falling into a Japanese-style deflationary liquidity trap, and the optimal policy in such a situation is a very expansionary monetary policy.9 It may be that, in retrospect, the risk of deflation was exaggerated, but it was impossible to know this ex ante. Hence, I consider the expansionary policy very appropriate and, adding some ex post evaluation, one can note that it did not lead ex post to very high inflation and an overheated economy. The second question, whether a different monetary policy could have prevented the crisis, is relevant when assessing to what extent monetary policy can be blamed for causing the crisis, notwithstanding if it was reasonable from an exante perspective. The credit growth and the housing boom in the U.S. and elsewhere were very powerful. However, I believe that somewhat higher interest rates would have made little or no difference. In order to stop the credit growth and housing boom, interest rates would probably have had to be raised very high so as to cause considerable damage to the real economy. They could have thrown the U.S. right into Japanese-style deflation and eventually a liquidity trap. Certainly higher interest rates would have had no impact on the regulatory problems, distorted incentives and information problems mentioned above (although they could have ended the Great Moderation with a deep recession and deflation).10However, perhaps it is possible that the Fed’s emphasis on its readiness to relax monetary policy aggressively in the wake of a sharp fall in asset prices (Greenspan 2002) may have induced expectations of a floor under future asset prices and contributed to the asset-price boom (the “Greenspan Put”; see Miller, Weller and Zhang, 2002). Arguably, this is more a communication issue rather than one of actual policy, and less emphasis on the readiness to clean up after a sharp fall in asset prices might have been a preferable alternative. 5.  Conclusion: does flexible inflation targeting need to be modified in light of the crisis? What conclusions can we draw from the financial crisis so far about the conduct of monetary policy and any need to modify the framework of flexible inflation targeting?                                                  8  I remember this period very vividly, because I was fortunate to have the opportunity to discuss and debate the problems of current monetary policy, deflation and liquidity traps in a group of great economists at Princeton University that included Ben Bernanke (before he left to be a Governor at the Federal Reserve Board), Alan Blinder, Paul Krugman, Chris Sims and Michael Woodford. 9  See Svensson (2003a) for a discussion of policy options before and in a liquidity trap. 10  Kohn (2008), after extensive discussion, concludes that there is insufficient evidence that low interest rates would have contributed much to the house-price boom and that higher interest rates would have had much dampening effect on it. Del Negro, Marco, and Christopher Otrok (2007) find small effects of Fed monetary policy on house prices during 2001-2005, whereas Iacoviello, Matteo, and Stefano Neri (2008) find larger effects, although their including the Regulation-Q period in their sample may increase the apparent monetary policy effect on housing. BIS Review 112/2009 5 
One obvious conclusion is that price stability is not enough to achieve financial stability (Carney 2009, White 2006). Good flexible inflation targeting by itself does not achieve financial stability, if anyone ever believed that. Specific policies and instruments are needed to ensure financial stability. Another conclusion is that interest-rate policy is not enough to achieve financial stability. Interest rates are too blunt an instrument for that, and attempts to use interest rates for financial stability purposes would cause considerable collateral damage to inflation and the real economy. Instead, the best instruments to achieve financial stability are supervision and regulation, including appropriate bank resolution regimes. In many countries, the responsibility for these instruments rests on other authorities than the central bank. Generally, to the extent financial instability depends on specific distortions, good regulation should aim to attack these distortions as close to the source as possible. To counter the observed procyclicality of existing regulation, macro-prudential regulation that is contingent on the business cycle and financial indicators may need to be introduced to induce better financial stability. Possible macro-prudential regulation includes variable capital, margin, and equity/loan requirements. As expressed by Bean (2009), “the best approach is likely to involve a portfolio of instruments”. What are the specific conclusions for flexible inflation targeting? One old conclusion is that consideration of the impact of financial factors on the forecast of inflation and resource utilization may require longer forecast horizons. Several inflation-targeting central banks (including the Bank of England, Norges Bank and the Riksbank) have for other reasons already extended their forecast horizon from the previously common two years to three years. There is nothing that in principle prevents an inflation targeter from considering forecasts beyond a three-year horizon, but in practice there is usually little information about anything at longer horizons except the tendency to revert to the long-term average. What about “leaning against the wind” (as advocated by, for instance, Borio and White, 2003, and Cecchetti, Genberg and Wadhwani, 2002), the idea that central banks should raise the interest rate more than what appears to be warranted by inflation and resource utilization to counter rapid credit growth and rising asset prices? It has sometimes not been quite clear whether advocates of leaning against the wind mean that credit growth and asset prices should be considered targets and enter the explicit or implicit loss functions alongside inflation and resource utilization, or whether they mean that credit growth and asset prices should still be considered just indicators and are emphasized only because credit growth and asset prices may have potential negative effects on inflation and resource utilization at a longer horizon. In the latter case, leaning against the wind is a way to improve the stability of inflation and resource utilization in the longer run. Then it is completely consistent with flexible inflation targeting. However, in line with the previous discussion, other instruments than interest rates are likely to be much more effective in avoiding excessive credit growth and asset-price booms, since interest rates that are high enough to have a noticeable effect on credit growth and asset prices may have strong negative effects on inflation and resource utilization, and a central bank will probably rarely have sufficient information about the likely beneficial longer-horizon effects on inflation and resource utilization for the trade-off to be worthwhile and motivated. One important lesson from the financial crisis is that financial factors may have a very strong and deteriorating effect on the transmission mechanism, making standard interest-rate policy much less effective. This motivates more research on how to incorporate financial factors in the standard models of the transmission mechanism used by central banks, and a rapidly increasing volume of such research is now being produced by academic and central-bank researchers and presented at an increasing number of conferences on financial factors and monetary policy. Important questions include how potential output and neutral real interest rates are affected by financial factors and financial distortions (Curdia and Woodford 2009, Walsh 2009), and what impact financial factors have on the general equilibrium effects of 6 BIS Review 112/2009 
alternative policy-rate paths on inflation and resource utilization forecasts.11 Before such extensions to the modelling framework are operational, policymakers and staff have to improvise and apply unusual amounts of judgment on the effects of the financial crisis on the transmission mechanism. Even with much better analytical foundations concerning the role of financial factors in the transmission mechanism, there will of course, as always, be considerable scope for the application of good judgment in monetary policy. In the end, my main conclusion so far from the crisis is that flexible inflation targeting, applied in the right way and using all the information about financial factors that is relevant for the forecast of inflation and resource utilization at any horizon, remains the best-practice monetary policy before, during, and after the financial crisis. But a better theoretical, empirical and operational understanding of the role of financial factors in the transmission mechanism is urgently required and needs much work, work that is already underway in academia and in central banks. The outcome might very well be that financial factors are considered to have a larger role in affecting the transmission mechanism and as indicators of future inflation and resource utilization. If so, central banks would end up responding more to financial indicators, in the sense of adjusting the policy rate and policyrate path more to a given change in a financial indicator. However, this would not mean that financial factors and indicators have become independent targets besides inflation and resource utilization in the explicit or implicit central-bank loss function. Instead, it would be a matter of responding appropriately to financial indicators in order to over time best stabilize inflation around the inflation target and resource utilization around a normal level.12References Bank of England (2009), Inflation Report, February 2009, www.bankofengland.co.uk.

Curdia and Woodford (2009) present a model where the second-order welfare approximation is a standard quadratic loss function of inflation and the output gap between output and potential output, but where potential output is affected by financial factors. Then inflation and the output gap remain the target variables, with and without financial factors. The neutral rate in the model, that is, the real rate consistent with output equal to potential output, is then also affected by financial factors. 12  See Svensson (2003b) for further discussion of the important distinction between the response variables in the policy reaction function (the variables that the central bank responds to) and the target variables in the loss function (the variables that the central bank “targets” and wants to stabilize at their target levels). The optimal policy consists of responding to the determinants of the forecasts of the target variables, not necessarily to the target variables themselves (unless they happen to be main determinants of future realizations of themselves).

Njuguna Ndung’u: Credit information sharing to enhance financial sector development Address by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, at the launch of the Banking Credit Information Sharing Implementation Project, Nairobi, 27 August 2009. *      *      * Mr. Martin Oduor-Otieno, Chairman, Kenya Bankers Association; Mr. John Wanyela, Executive Director, Kenya Bankers Association; Chief Executives of Commercial Banks here present; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen: I am pleased to join you this morning on this important occasion to launch the Banking Credit Information Sharing Project. Allow me therefore to extend my gratitude to the Kenya Bankers Association for facilitating this project and the invitation. The importance of this function cannot be overemphasised and I am delighted at the excellent turnout of the banking fraternity. The Banking (Credit Reference Bureau) Regulations 2008 were published in July 2008 and launched at this very venue in September 2008. The Regulations paved the way for the licensing and surveillance of Credit Reference Bureaus (CRB) by the Central Bank of Kenya. These Bureaus will collate credit information from institutions licensed under the Banking Act. I am pleased to report that since the Regulations became operational in February 2009, there has been considerable interest by potential investors. I do believe that interest is for those who cherish the importance of the development of information capital. The Central Bank has so far received three applications for CRB licenses, two from local investors (Credit Reference Bureau Africa and Metropol) and one from a South African based regional player – Compuscan. Accordingly the Central Bank has this week issued a letter of intent to the first applicant, Credit Reference Bureau Africa. This is an approval in principle to conduct credit reference bureau business. The Bureau will commence operations on completion of an independent third party system and security audit and an onsite inspection by CBK. The letter of intent was granted after a detailed due diligence of the application to ensure all statutory and prudential requirements were met. The Central Bank wishes to reassure Kenyans that it shall rigorously assess all applications to ensure the integrity of the envisaged credit information sharing mechanism. Ladies and Gentlemen: The launch of this project today by the banking sector is therefore very timely. The overarching objective of the project is to co-ordinate the efforts of all players so as to build a sustainable and holistic information sharing mechanism. The Central Bank renders its full support to this project and we expect that all banks will also commit to implementing all the agreed milestones. Credit information sharing offers Kenya an opportunity to promote access to affordable credit to more Kenyans because information lowers the risk premium and search costs. There is indeed a clear and direct linkage between access to credit and economic development. Allow me to highlight four key benefits that the Central Bank sees accruing from this initiative. First, credit information sharing will facilitate the development of information capital. The risk premium associated with information asymmetry and search costs will decline. Second, information capital will change the current collateral technology. Credit by the banking sector in Kenya has to a large extent been underwritten by physical collateral such as land. Borrowers without access to such collateral have been constrained in accessing credit. Credit information sharing will enable borrowers build a track record that can be used in accessing credit. This will be especially pertinent to those borrowers in the informal and BIS Review 111/2009 1 
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) who have a track record and good performance to use it to access credit. The SME sector is very important to the industrial development of this country and the Vision 2030. Ladies and Gentlemen: The third benefit is to enhance information symmetry and support financial development. The existing state of information asymmetry between borrowers and banks is a constraint to innovation. Two important outcomes in information asymmetry: moral hazard problems from the borrowers and adverse selection from the banks. These two problems could punish the economy with low provision of credit. We have also seen that there is adverse selection among banks as well. Fourth, in a segmented market like ours, some segments remain untapped because banks do not have adequate information to price suitable products. In part this has also contributed to the high cost of credit. Borrowers have had to bear a “risk premium” because of this lack of information. It is therefore the Central Bank’s expectation that savings arising from the increased credit information shall translate to lower cost of credit. In turn, more Kenyans will be able to access credit from banks. The current level of interest rates is a combination of costs (like information search costs), risk premium and of course banks’ profit margin. High interest rates also give rise to default risks. The risk premium and search costs can be minimized by information symmetry and reduce Non-Performing Loans. As you will recall the Kenyan banking sector was saddled with a huge non performing loan portfolio in the 1980s and 1990s. Part of the burden was occasioned by “serial defaulters” and inadequate incentives to have a good credit history. The days of “serial defaulters” are definitely numbered with the advent of credit information sharing. More importantly, we expect that there will be incentives for good credit behaviour that will attract competitive pricing of credit facilities. The message to Kenyans is that now more than ever before, there will certainly be benefits accruing from adhering to the contractual terms of loans. I am sure the other institutions in Kenya will deal with appropriate definition of property rights and contract enforcements to further reduce the risk premium. Ladies and Gentlemen: In a nutshell, credit information sharing will increase vibrancy in the market for the borrowers and lenders. Borrowers will be able to access enhanced facilities as they grow their credit histories and track record. Conversely credit providers will be able to develop new and competitive products that will tap into previously unserved and underserved market niches with the power of available information. This can only impact positively on the banking sector and the Kenyan economy as a whole. As I draw to a close, let me recognize that the banking sector credit information sharing initiative will serve as a model for other credit providers. We must move with speed to have the mechanism up and running and begin to rope in other financial and non financial credit providers. This will allow the full benefits of credit information sharing to the whole economy. I therefore urge all banks to support this initiative which the Central Bank is unreservedly committed to. It is now my distinguished duty to officially launch the Banking Credit Information Sharing Implementation Project. Thank you. 2 BIS Review 111/2009 
Caleb M Fundanga: Improving financial inclusion in Zambia Remarks by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the Celpay Mobile Banking Conference, Lusaka, 16-17 September 2009. *      *      * The Chairman of the Board, Celpay Zambia, Dr Jacob Mwanza; The Chief executive Officer, Celpay International, Mr L. Muchenje; Chief Executive Officers and Representatives of Banks and Financial Institutions present; Distinguished Invited Guests and Resource Persons; Members of the Press; Ladies and Gentlemen I wish to express my gratitude to Celpay Zambia Limited and in particular to Dr Jacob Mwanza, the Chairman of the Board, for inviting me to speak at this important conference. I am informed that the conference aims to pave the way for the future of mobile banking in the quest to improve financial inclusion in our country. Mr Chairman, the need to promote wider access to financial services through innovative products by financial institutions and other market players cannot be overemphasized. Financial services are a critical tool to ensure that entrepreneurs step onto the economic growth ladder and create a brighter future by tapping their own creativity in income generating activities. The provision of financial services to the majority of our people especially the small and micro entrepreneurs who are financially excluded is a key element in alleviating poverty in the country. Improved access to financial services enables availability of funds for investment in income generating activities that ensure that the public lay a foundation for better standards of living. Indeed financial services are instrumental for broader human development, as people invest in themselves and seek protection from external shocks. Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, as you are no doubt aware, the results arising from the 2005 FinScope demand side study which aimed at measuring access, usage, perceptions and the demand patterns on financial services offered in Zambia were not encouraging. The findings of the study indicated that only 33.7% of the adult population was financially served. This entailed that 66.3% of the Zambian population were financially excluded or not using banks or other financial institutions. Furthermore, the supply side study conducted in 2007 also highlighted a number of weaknesses in the financial sector including, limited outreach of banks and financial institutions to the general populace, high spreads between deposit and lending rates, excessive collateral requirements and poorly managed cost structures which contribute to limiting outreach. As a consequence of the low levels of access to financial services, the Bank of Zambia adopted financial inclusiveness as one of its strategic objectives to ensure improved levels of access for all. In this regard, it is gratifying to note that following the survey, commercial banks and other non-bank financial institutions including Celpay have increasingly become receptive to the calls for increased provision of financial services. A number of banks and financial services providers have increased their branch networks, lending to small and medium-sized enterprises have been increased while financial products specifically designed to meet the financing needs of the lower end of the market in both rural and peri-urban areas have been introduced. One such product that banks and other institutions in the telecommunication sector have strived to promote in order to increase inclusion is mobile banking. As you are no doubt aware, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, mobile banking represents a significantly cheaper alternative to conventional branch based banking as it allows financial institutions and other commercial players to offer financial services outside the traditional BIS Review 111/2009 1 
brick and mortar bank concept. Mobile banking uses channels such as retail agents and mobile phones to increase financial outreach to the un-banked communities. Mobile banking has revolutionalised banking worldwide and I am glad to note that Zambia is playing a leading role in the development of the mobile banking industry in the SADC region. As you may be aware, there are three operational mobile payments companies that have successfully penetrated the market in the past seven years. While a number of banks now offer mobile banking solutions. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) website recently carried an article wherein, it was acknowledged that Africa has the fastest growing mobile banking market in the world. The significance of the article was not only the growth of the industry but the acknowledgement that most of the operators are local companies. However, in acknowledging this growth and the important contribution of mobile banking to extending financial services to the poor, consumer protection should be taken as an integral component of any business model that is developed. To this end, the Bank of Zambia working with other key stakeholders such as the Communications Authority will play its role in ensuring that the provision of an enabling regulatory environment is carefully balanced with the need to protect consumers. Mr. Chairman, the Celpay conference on mobile banking could not have come at a more opportune time when the country is facing numerous challenges arising from the impact of the recent financial and economic crisis. Due to the underperformance of various sectors of the economy during the period of the crisis, provision of financial services was somehow curtailed while non-performing loans has been on the rise. In order to ameliorate the effects of this downturn and further improve financial inclusion, it is imperative to develop cost effective innovative products such as mobile banking. It is therefore expected that this conference will come up with solutions that will enhance the extension of banking services to the poor and at affordable rates. Ladies and Gentlemen, recent statistics on telecommunications indicate that there are about three million subscribers across the three mobile networks currently licensed to operate in Zambia. This extensive coverage obviously offers a great opportunity to enhance the standards of living of our people. As we embrace mobile banking, the primary objective of Zambia’s mobile banking framework should be to empower the millions of citizens who do not have access to conventional banking. The essential spirit of mobile banking should be financial inclusion. In this regard, facilitating mobile banking will contribute to the distribution of resources to productive activities such as farming as well as directing resources to areas where there are most needed. In addition the policy framework should be flexible enough to allow the industry players to explore various business models. To this end the National Payment Systems Act of 2007 has provided a platform for businesses involved in mobile banking and money transmission to be designated. The need for effective regulation to ensure a stable financial sector and protection of consumers is vital. Nevertheless, regulation should facilitate and not impede development and must create an optimal, dynamic and agile banking environment. As Regulators we must therefore be open minded to new market solutions while the developers need to constantly engage the regulator in their product development. In stressing the need for effective regulation, I must emphasise the need for providers to observe the mandate and requirements of their licences. Mobile services providers must not perform banking services as this is the domain of licensed banks. Finally, I also wish to stress that mobile service providers and mobile banking solutions developers need to have in place robust business continuity plans that will ensure minimum disruption to services in the event of disasters. It is not unusual for one to be turned away at customers counters on account of the lack of basic facilities due to for instance power failure or link failure when these can be mitigated where there are proper contingency plans in 2 BIS Review 111/2009 
place. The Bank of Zambia will therefore ensure that sound business continuity plans are in place when evaluating new applications. Ladies and Gentlemen, as we develop these well meaning products, I wish to appeal to the service providers to ensure that investment in such infrastructure is complemented by investment in financial literacy. We need to ensure that we are providing individuals and communities with the level of financial education needed to grasp both the benefits and pitfalls of their easier access to financial services. This will in part minimize the risks associated with such innovative products as people will only make better judgments about their financial affairs if they understand the risks and returns associated with the product and services at their disposal. It is also apparent that financial illiteracy is more costly as people who make poor financial decisions will inevitably end up with a far lower standard of living than was otherwise achievable. Mr. Chairman, I wish to conclude by applauding Celpay’s initiative to host the first ever mobile conference in Zambia. The deliberations and recommendations of this conference will be keenly followed as the need to leverage access to financial services through the mobile phone is of paramount importance. Mobile banking will lead to increased outreach, increased efficiency and productivity as well as increased returns for businesses. Let me once again assure you, Mr. Chairman that, the Bank of Zambia is committed to providing an enabling environment through appropriate regulation for banks and financial businesses that wish to promote financial inclusion. We appreciate the Mobile Banking initiative by Celpay Zambia Limited and look forward to greater investment in financial inclusion in our beloved country. I thank you. BIS Review 111/2009 3 
V K Sharma: Supervising in a crisis environment Address by Mr V K Sharma, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Annual Regulators’ Roundtable, organized by the International Credit Union Regulators’ Network, Barcelona, 30-31 July 2009. *      *      * I thank International Credit Union Regulators Network for inviting me to this Regulators Roundtable to share our experience of Supervising in Crisis Environment. I greatly appreciate the selection of the topic, the relevance of which cannot be over emphasized today. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India are akin to Credit Unions as they are member-driven and are essentially community-based. However, unlike credit unions, UCBs are also permitted to accept deposits from non-members and are part of the payments systems.  As the banking, including the urban cooperative banking, sector in India was not affected by the recent global financial crisis, I will share today with this distinguished and august audience the learning curve experienced, not long ago, in dealing with our own kind of crisis. However, I would presently demonstrate how the Reserve Bank, instead of adopting any well-trodden course of action, customized its response, keeping in view the sector-specific problems. I would then review the impact of RBI’s approach and strategies for the UCBs and also discuss the ongoing efforts for strengthening the sector. But I must admit that regulating and supervising the UCB sector has been a far more formidable challenge than regulating and supervising the commercial banking sector.  Background In the year 2004, 38% of the approximately 1926 urban cooperative banks in India were assessed as weak or sick. The deposits of the sector began to show a declining trend and by 2005 the Non Performing Assets rose to 23.2%. In order to address this rather critical situation, several measures were initiated which were both short term as well as long term and far-reaching in nature and which also I propose to discuss today.  Genesis of the crisis  A. Rapid growth of the sector In the period of 15 years, between 1991 and 2004, the UCB sector had witnessed unprecedented growth. From 1306 urban cooperative banks in 1991, the number of banks increased to 1926 in the year 2004, representing a growth of 47 percent i.e. 620 banks were added in 15 years (not counting for the banks that collapsed in that period). As against this, in the previous 25 years i.e. between 1966 and 1991 only 200 new banks had come up.  This spectacular growth of UCBs since 1991, resulted in increasing their penetration, but ironically, also led to certain weaknesses in the sector that adversely affected public perception and thereby, their competitiveness. The weakening of public confidence in UCB sector began with a crisis in 2001 faced by a large multi-state bank in the prosperous state of Gujarat, when there was a sudden “run” on the bank, following rumours of its large exposure to a leading stock broker who had suffered huge losses in the stock market. The large-scale withdrawal of deposits within a short time resulted in severe liquidity problems for the bank which at that time held about US $ 160 million equivalent of inter-bank deposits from over 200 UCBs in the State and from other States, which obviously posed a systemic risk. The Gujarat episode was followed by another major crisis in the state of Andhra Pradesh in 2002, BIS Review 111/2009 1 
when one of the largest banks in the state faced a run, following a newspaper report of an inquiry into the affairs of the bank by the State Registrar of Cooperative Societies. The bank was in a weak position, and ultimately, after attempts at its revival failed, its license was cancelled by the Reserve Bank in 2004.The decline in public confidence in the UCB sector deepened in the aftermath of the crisis in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh and concomitantly, the position of UCBs generally deteriorated which was reflected in the RBI’s on-site assessment of the banks.  In this context, I may mention that as part of its on-site inspection, Reserve Bank has a system of categorizing banks into four grades based on parameters of capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, compliance with CRR/SLR requirements and adherence to RBI guidelines. While Grade I & II banks have no major supervisory concerns, the other two grades indicate presence of supervisory concerns to varying degrees. As on June 30, 2004, 732 out of 1919 UCBs were categorised in Grade III or IV, signifying weakness and sickness. The deteriorating position of UCBs was reflected in the public perception and deposits of the sector declined for the first time since its documented history in 2004-2005 by 4.7%.  In addition to the impact of too rapid a growth, discussed above, there are certain structural aspects of the sector which were a cause of concern for supervisors and as I discuss these, you will notice, that some of these are also, not unique to India. B. Heterogeneity There is significant degree of heterogeneity in terms of size, geographical distribution, performance, financial strength as also in the IT and human resources endowment of the UCBs. While on the one hand, there are a number of small neighbourhood unit banks functioning for mutual interest of their members, there are several large UCBs with a wide network of branches, large number of depositors and borrowers on the other, many of whom are medium/large corporates. In the latter, while the cooperative structure exists only as an organizational arrangement, their business model and goals are more like commercial banks. The extent of heterogeneity can be gauged by the fact that 30.7% of the UCBs hold only 2.2% of deposits while at the top end, only 16 banks account for 28.8% of the total deposits of the sector. Incidentally, despite the differences in size, a “one size fits all” approach to regulation and supervision existed with all UCBs being subjected to the same regulatory and supervisory framework as it was for commercial banks. C. Dual control  Another feature of the UCB sector in India is the duality of control. UCBs are regulated and supervised by both the State Governments, through the Registrars of Co-operative Societies, and by the Reserve Bank of India. While the State Registrars exercise powers with regard to incorporation, registration, management, amalgamation, reconstruction or liquidation, in the case of banks having presence in more than one state, the Central Registrar of Co-operative Societies, on behalf of the Central Government, exercises such powers. The banking related functions such as issue of license to start new banks, or branches, matters relating to interest rates, policies on loans and investments, prudential norms etc. are regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India. It was often our experience that the effectiveness of regulatory and supervisory measures got diluted because of inadequate response from State Government. Reserve Bank’s requisition to State Government to supersede the board of a bank, for example, would get acted upon with inordinate delay by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, in case the State Government did not share RBI’s perception about the competence of the board. There was thus no doubt that this was another issue which needed to be addressed as part of the strategy for effectively handling the crisis in the sector. 2 BIS Review 111/2009 
D. Business model – corporate governance issues  Most of the problems faced by the sector arose from lack of good governance in UCBs, as indeed, incidentally, but significantly, was also the case, in the recent global financial crisis, with large global banks. Besides, in India, unlike a company, shareholders/members of a UCB, are generally the debtors of the bank. While this would be an appropriate framework for governance for a cooperative society, which accepts deposits only from members/shareholders, it leads to distortion in the business model when applied to a cooperative bank, which solicits deposits from non-members as well. As majority of the share holders are borrowers in UCBs, the elected management would have an incentive to pursue policies which are more borrower oriented that may not always be in the best interests of depositors. Also, unlike in the case of companies, the shares of which are listed on a stock exchange and can change hands without affecting the capital base, in the case of UCBs, the shareholders can withdraw their contribution to capital and shrink the capital of the bank and thereby limit its ability to increase risk weighted assets and expand business.  Response strategy Keeping in view the characteristics of the UCB sector, Reserve Bank initiated a series of measures to resolve the structural problems and strengthen the banks. In what follows, I set out the initiatives of the Reserve Bank in dealing with the crisis. A. Withholding of new bank and branch licenses  Licensing norms for UCBs were eased in May 1993 and within 8 years i.e. by June 2004, more than 800 banks mushroomed and close to one third of these newly licensed UCBs became financially weak within a short period of 2-3 years. There was, thus, a need to moderate the pace of growth of this sector and it was, therefore, decided in June 2004 to stop issue of licenses for new banks and branches until a suitable framework for regulation and supervision was in place for the already large number of UCBs. B.  Vision document for UCBs Recognizing the systemic risk concerns, Reserve Bank reviewed the entire gamut of legislative, regulatory and supervisory framework for these banks, and in March 2005, brought out a draft “Vision Document for UCBs”. The vision document, discussed the characteristics of the sector, analyzed the problems afflicting the banks and proposed the following regulatory and supervisory strategies for dealing with the problems affecting the sector:  a) Nuanced and granular approach to supervision and regulation  Highlighting the heterogeneity of the sector, the Vision Document observed that the “one size fits all” approach to regulation and supervision of UCBs needed to be abjured and a multi-layered regulatory and supervisory approach be adopted keeping in view the heterogeneity of the sector. Accordingly, it was decided that banks with deposits less than Rs.1 billion (equivalent to US $ 20 million), and whose branches are limited to a small area i.e. Tier-I banks which more closely epitomized the cooperative spirit, be placed under simplified prudential regulation for some time in order to enable them to gradually gain in strength so that over a period of 3 years they could be brought at par with all other banks for the purposes of regulation. Accordingly, the Tier-I banks have been placed under the 180-day delinquency norm while Tier II banks are under the 90-day norm as applicable to commercial banks. The Tier-I banks are, however, required to make adequate provisions in the intervening period to enable them to migrate to the 90-day norm in future. Further, lower provisioning requirements were stipulated for Tier-I compared to Tier-II banks which is also intended to provide a measure of relief to the small UCBs, as lower provisioning would BIS Review 111/2009 3 
translate into higher profits that could, in turn, be used, during the transition period, to shore up the capital base of the banks.  b)  Consultative approach to supervision – TAFCUB In order to address the problem of Dual Control, Reserve Bank in 2001-2002, suggested that a new Apex Supervisory body be constituted for the UCB sector, comprising representatives of Central / State Governments, RBI and experts from the field. However, since it did not materialize, Reserve Bank proposed the amendment of Banking Regulation Act for providing powers to RBI over the UCBs similar to those that are available in respect of commercial banks. When even the 2nd suggestion did not materialise, the Reserve Bank in the Vision document for UCBs proposed the adoption of a coordinated approach to deciding the future set up of weak and sick banks in each state. To this end, Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between RBI and respective state governments and Central Government, in the case of multi-state urban cooperative banks, to achieve greater convergence of approach of the two agencies tasked with the regulation and supervision of UCBs. As part of the MoU, it was decided to set up of State Level Task Force for Urban Co-operative Banks (TAFCUBs) comprising representatives of RBI, State Government and national and state level federation/association of UCBs. TAFCUB was tasked with the responsibility of identifying the potentially viable and non viable UCBs in the state and providing a revival plan for the former, and a non disruptive exit route for the latter, set of banks. The exit route could include merger/amalgamation with stronger banks, conversion into societies, or ultimately, only as a last resort, through liquidation. Based on recommendations of TAFCUBs, supervisory actions that have been initiated include merger of unviable banks with financially strong UCBs, cancellation of license of unviable banks and rejection of license applications of unlicensed cooperative banks, which were being allowed to conduct banking business pending rejection of license application by RBI, as per the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Cooperative Societies (AACS). Significantly, the number of unlicensed banks dramatically dropped from 1066 in 1977 to a mere 58 as of date! The access to consolidated information from local and national level federations of the banks, as also from the regulators and supervisors, made TAFCUB an effective instrument for consolidating the sector through quick and non-disruptive exit of unviable banks and revival of the viable ones. As recommendations of the TAFCUBs, had the consent of all stakeholders including the Reserve Bank of India, they lent themselves to speedy implementation by all concerned. The first TAFCUB was set up in June 2005 and its success in taking of difficult decisions in a transparent manner and the consequent turning around of banks, has led to its adoption practically in all the states. c) Information technology As part of the MoU signed with the states, RBI committed itself to facilitating IT and human resources development initiatives in UCBs. On the technology front, a beginning was made by RBI with the development of software that facilitates compilation and submission of all supervisory and regulatory returns by UCBs to RBI, electronically. The software also allows banks to analyse their own data and it is, therefore, being used as a powerful management information tool by many banks. The data submitted by banks are subjected to analysis by supervisors, inter alia, with the objective of tracking incipient stress faced by banks as also for identifying outlier banks. This off-site surveillance mechanism also acts as a Decision Support System, as data presented in an analysed form facilitates informed decision-making in addition to facilitating a technology-driven system for focussed and continuous supervision of UCBs, which was one of the important objectives set out by the Vision Document. I understand that a presentation on the Off-site surveillance system for UCBs was also made before this group in July 2008 at Hongkong.  Recognising the vast scope for use of IT, the Reserve Bank constituted a Working Group comprising members from State Government, UCB Sector and RBI to examine “the various 4 BIS Review 111/2009 
areas where IT support could be provided to the UCBs by the Reserve Bank.” The report of the Group is being examined for implementation and I hope that the same would give a major fillip to the competitiveness and strength of the UCBs through extensive use of IT.  d) Human resources initiatives In order to upgrade the skills of officials of UCBs and enhance professionalism, training programs are conducted by RBI in all important areas of banking for Directors, Chief Executive Officers and other officials of UCBs. Training programmes are organized at Regional centres and training imparted in local/regional languages to enable local staff absorb training without any difficulty. These programs for UCBs are conducted free of cost and by now over 2000 officials have so far been trained under this major initiative. C.  Measures for improving corporate governance While extending necessary support for up-gradation of professional skills of Directors, the Reserve Bank also advised banks to induct at least 2 professional directors on their Boards, with a view to ensuring that Boards have the requisite skill and competence to review and assess management performance. In states that have signed MoU with the Reserve Bank, guidelines for adopting “fit and proper” criteria for appointment of CEOs have also been implemented. These emphasize the track record and integrity of the candidate apart from certain eligibility criteria like minimum qualification and age for being CEO of an urban cooperative bank. An indicative list of dos and don’ts has also been formulated to serve as a guide to directors to enable them to play their role more effectively. The need for the directors to maintain “arms” length from the day-to-day operations of the bank is also highlighted in the dos and don'ts prescribed by Reserve Bank. Connected lending to directors, their family members and associated business firms, in UCBs has been banned, except for loans against securities like fixed deposits etc. The Reserve Bank has also circulated a list of best practices followed by well-run banks for others to emulate. Further, banks have also been advised to constitute Audit Committee of the Board and State Governments, as per the MOU signed with RBI, are committed to get statutory audit of larger UCBs conducted by Chartered Accountants. In order to ensure that the financial statements reflect a true and fair picture of banks’ financial position, not only is RBI emphasizing on professionalization of audit, but is also providing training to state government auditors. D.  Consolidation in the UCB sector Consolidation in the sector through the process of merger of weaker entities with stronger ones was set in motion in 2005 by providing transparent and objective guidelines for granting no-objection to merger proposals as a strategy for providing non-disruptive exit for the weaker banks. A four-member external Expert Group has been set up to vet merger proposals, with a view to providing a transparent mechanism and impartial inputs. TAFCUBs have representatives from the sector who also provide local level inputs on banks that are on the lookout for taking over other weak banks as part of their inorganic growth strategy. In all 82 merger proposals have been approved so far, of which 71 mergers have already materialized in the last 4 years. E.  Problem bank resolution: customized solutions Apart from encouraging voluntary mergers, various other strategies have been adopted for problem bank resolution. Restructuring of liabilities involving conversion of a part of the deposits into equity has been done recently in the case of systemically important banks.  BIS Review 111/2009 5 
In one case, the depositors of a bank were encouraged to convert entire interest credited to the deposits, from the date of placing the bank under restrictive directions, into equity. As a result, the extent of outside liabilities was reduced and the bank became solvent. As this conversion included amount eligible for insurance cover from Deposit Insurance Corporation, it was also agreed to allow the capital contribution by the small depositors to be added back to their deposits for reckoning insurance cover should a need arise to liquidate the bank before it attained full solvency. In another case, a part of the deposits were allowed to be converted to equity/ perpetual debt instruments. Also, to ensure that the net worth of the bank turned positive after re-structuring and it had liquid assets adequate to meet the statutory pre-emption, the cash pay outs were suitably adjusted with different levels of sacrifice by the depositors. Another strategy for problem bank resolution was drawing up schemes for acquisition of a weak UCB by a strong UCB and exploring possibilities of funding the gap between valuation accepted by the acquiring bank and the actual deposit liabilities by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation. In certain cases, UCBs have also been able to turn around by taking advantage of the property boom and disposing of surplus land and buildings. F. Incentives for good banks While tackling the weak banks was one part of the response strategy, it was felt that encouraging strong banks with incentives by way of newer/additional business opportunities could complement the efforts in building up a strong sector. With this objective in view, the Reserve Bank has been encouraging financially sound and well managed UCBs in the States that have signed MoU, with business development opportunities, such as opening of new branches (including offsite and onsite ATMs), currency chests, opportunities for forex, insurance, mutual fund businesses, extension of area of operations to the entire state, besides providing training in I.T and support for upgrading human resources for all banks in MoU states, including the strong ones. G. New initiatives for strengthening UCBs In India, UCBs are working on stand-alone basis at the grassroots level of the financial system. Being comparatively small, it is difficult for such entities to compete with commercial banks and establish market share. Looking at various successful federal models existing internationally, especially in Europe and USA, a need was felt for strong inter-cooperative bonding and co-operation and a centralized apex institution that will be in a position to channelize their resources, aggregate their needs and also lend credibility through mutual support in the financial markets. Besides, the federated model gives options to UCBs to raise capital through subsidiaries etc. The Reserve Bank is examining the prospect of such an arrangement which may further act as a bulwark in crisis situation and strengthen supervision through Self Regulatory Organizations.  Impact of recent initiatives: restoration of public confidence A quick analysis of the impact of the above measures shows that there is a positive change in public perception about the UCBs. Consequently, not only the larger depositors but also better quality borrowers are getting attracted to these banks. The quality of assets and grade-wise distribution of UCBs over the last few years reflect the improvement in the overall position of the UCB sector: 6 BIS Review 111/2009

We recognized the risk of distancing ourselves from the regulated entities and sought to develop close communication not only with other stakeholders but also with the banks. This gave us an intimate feel of the sector and facilitated formulation of realistic and customized responses. Our next policy goal is to raise the awareness among UCBs of the need for the induction of depositors as regular members, at least, those with deposits above a threshold, which would make for a better balance in the governance of urban cooperative banks and help further boost public confidence. The key to the success of the UCB model would appear to lie in not only adopting a member centric approach, but also taking depositors on board.  BIS Review 111/2009 7 
Concluding remarks I have traced the evolution of UCBs over time, their unique structure, strengths and weaknesses. I also discussed the crisis that the sector faced and the multi-pronged response strategy of the Reserve Bank in dealing with the same. Once again, I would like to thank ICURN for inviting me to share the lessons/takeaways from the Indian experience in handling the crisis of the UCB sector. I welcome your views on our response strategy towards strengthening this important sector of the Indian financial system and would take any questions that you may have now or anytime during the course of this conference. Thank you all so very much. 8 BIS Review 111/2009 
Anselmo L S Teng: Conference on human resources issues (opening remarks) Welcome remarks by Mr Anselmo L S Teng, Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Macao, on behalf of Mr Francis Tam, Secretary for Economy and Finance of the MSAR, at the 12th Conference of Central Banks of Portuguese Speaking Territories on Human Resources, Macao, 14 September 2009.  *      *      * Dear Delegates,  Ladies and Gentlemen,  Good morning!  On behalf of the Macao Special Administrative Region, I would like to convey our warm and heartfelt thanks to all delegates and guests who have come a long way from Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, São Tomé e Principé, East Timor and Guinea-Bissau to Macao where the East and the West meet.  I personally feel that this conference has been convened at an opportune moment. The recent financial tsunami started exactly one year ago. Crumbling of the international financial system was averted through the strenuous and concerted efforts of central banks round the world. Through quantitative easing and generous fiscal policy, the world economy appears to have been stabilized, particularly the emerging markets. As we all know, human resources is an important pillar in supporting a stable economy. I am sure that this conference will contribute towards such direction.  Macao has not been immune to the devastating financial crisis. GDP contracted 7.6% in the 4th quarter of 2008 but growth rate for 2008 was a positive 13.2%. The first half year of 2009 saw a decrease of 12.8%. However, due to the spillover effect of the huge stimulus package of China, our economy has become stabilized in the second quarter. Unemployment rate has been kept to an enviable 3.7%. The impetus for our economy comes mainly from services, particularly the tourism services sector.  The China economy ranked 3rd in the world in 2008. The Portuguese speaking countries are a market of more than 200 million consumers and are in possession of abundant natural resources. They need consumer goods of reasonable price and capital for development. China and the Portuguese speaking countries thus make a good match economically.  Due to its historical heritage and strong connection with Portugal, Macao has developed as a service platform for economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese speaking countries. The first Economic and Commercial Cooperation Forum of China and Portuguese Speaking Countries was held in Macao in 2003. In 2006, a ministerial meeting of the Forum provided a clear outline for the purpose. The standing secretariat for the Forum has been domiciled in Macao to carry out every endeavour to fulfil the objectives of the Forum.  Ladies and gentlemen, the recent worldwide recession has been caused by the financial sectors of developed economies. It is therefore imperative that errors which have triggered this financial crisis should be rectified so that such fallout will not repeat again. As we all know, human assets are the backbone of a financial institution. A stable financial system free of any systemic risk should comprise responsible and ethical institutions which in turn should be staffed by professionally competent and ethically conscious practitioners. It is therefore a timely event to hold a conference with such a theme which will no doubt impart useful and practical knowledge to all participants. Through discussions and interactions, we shall emerge with fresh ideas and visionary thinking conducive to maintaining a stable financial system. Macao feels honoured to host such a conference for Central Banks of Portuguese BIS Review 110/2009 1 
speaking territories. In view of the background I have mentioned above, I hope Macao will continue to host similar conferences, meetings and seminars which are in line with the service platform function of Macao in economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese speaking countries.  Last but not the least, I do hope our guests from afar will, after the exhausting meeting, squeeze out some time to walk around Macao to appreciate the harmony arising from a mix of nostalgia, modernity, east and west cultures.  Finally, I wish you a very happy stay in Macao and hope you will all return home with a good impression of the Macao Special Administrative Region.  Thank you. 2 BIS Review 110/2009 
Jan F Qvigstad: Comments on Lars E O Svensson's lecture "Policy expectations and policy evaluations – the role of transparency and communication" Speech by Mr Jan F Qvigstad, Deputy Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the conference "Ten Years of Riksbank Independence", Stockholm, 11 September 2009. *      *      * Introduction It was a great pleasure to accept the invitation to discuss professor and fellow central bank deputy governor Lars Svensson’s lecture in connection with the tenth anniversary of Riksbank independence. In his lecture, Lars Svensson discussed communication, credibility and monetary policy evaluation. He looks at general issues for central banks seeking to influence key rate expectations, using the Riksbank as an example.1 I will not venture to remark on the Riksbank’s assessments but will offer my comments on the same issues in the light of Norges Bank’s experience of interest rate forecasts.  There are a number of similarities between the communication strategies of the Riksbank and Norges Bank. And underlying these strategies is a model developed by, among others, Lars Svensson. In his lecture today, he described how to arrive at an interest rate path that “looks good”. He showed, as he has on many previous occasions, that this can be formalised by finding the interest rate path that minimises a given loss function. When does the interest rate “look good”? Svensson raises the issue of whether monetary policy is well balanced, not only ex-post but also ex-ante. In his presentation today, he presents a system for evaluating and ranking different policy alternatives, showing how Taylor diagrams can be used to evaluate whether one interest rate forecast results in lower volatility in inflation and the output gap than another. If a forecast results in inflation closer to target and a narrower output gap through the forecast period, this forecast is selected. On other occasions, the choice between two forecasts can be more problematic. The forecast that is selected will depend on preference and the considerations that are given weight. I completely agree with Lars Svensson that policymakers must rank the different policy alternatives based on their preferences. In some cases, policymakers may wish to keep the interest rate high while in others a low interest rate may be preferred. However, it is equally important to take account of preferences over time, i.e. having a system to check whether the preferences underlying the baseline scenario in one report are the same as those of the previous report. And once preferences have been formalised in a loss function, it is relatively simple to find the optimal interest rate path for a given model. The choice of path will then depend on policymakers’ preferences. A policymaker’s preferences may of course change over time, but I am in favour of basing the analysis on the same set of preferences as previously. This approach will contribute to consistency in communication over time.                                                  1  Cf. Woodford’s (2005) formulation: ” For not only do expectations matter, […] very little else matters.” BIS Review 110/2009 1 
Criteria for a “good” interest rate path Inspired by Svensson, Norges Bank has developed a set of criteria for a “good” interest rate path. The intention is to make it easier for others to understand how we think, although the criteria also define the agenda for the internal discussion.2The first criterion for a good interest rate path is to set the interest rate with a view to bringing inflation back to target in the medium term following a shock. The primary objective is to achieve the inflation target.  The second criterion reflects the flexibility of inflation targeting. There are many routes to the objective. Which one should we choose? According to the criteria, emphasis should be placed on finding an interest rate path that also stabilises output and employment.  So far, our approach tracks Svensson’s theoretical approach fairly closely, with some deviation from the analytical method he presents in his article. The most important difference is that we have chosen to focus directly on the target, using a loss function to describe monetary policy. The approach proposed in the article primarily relies on a description of policy under different rules followed by calculation of the loss using the loss function. Because the model is primarily a model and reality is primarily reality, some tailoring is required to connect model and reality. Some additional criteria have therefore been formulated. These criteria are necessary because our models are uncertain and because confidence in monetary policy cannot always be taken for granted. The criteria do not conflict with Svensson’s monetary policy research, but can be regarded as a bridge between the model and reality.  Allow me to show you how the criteria were used in the work on the March Monetary Policy Report by outlining the thought process involved. Although the charts I will be presenting are a simplification , they serve to illustrate our working methods. Norges Bank’s assessment of the current situation and the forecasts – with below-target inflation and a considerably negative output gap – might, under criteria 1 and 2, indicate in isolation that the interest rate should be set very low and even be negative towards the end of 2009. This is illustrated by the green line. However, the Executive Board chose to take a less drastic course of action on the basis of the other criteria taken into consideration. Criterion 3 states that previous methods of operation should be taken into account and that the interest rate should normally only be changed gradually. With emphasis on interest rate smoothing in the loss function (i.e. criteria 1+2+3), the result is the black line. This interest rate path is still low, and lower than the path that was in fact chosen. Criterion 4 states that monetary policy should be robust and criterion 5 that cross-checking should be carried out. In a turbulent economic situation, we were uncertain whether our model was the right one for the Norwegian economy and wanted to guard against model misspecifications. In an economy where unemployment is around 3 per cent and inflation is on target, setting the interest rate as low as zero was regarded as going too far. A practical approach to model uncertainty is to cross-check using simple monetary policy rules such as the Taylor rule (criterion 5). In addition to the basic Taylor rule, we usually employ a variation of this rule involving external interest rates, and a rule where the output gap is replaced by GDP growth. A mechanical application of the Taylor rule would have resulted in a forecast approximately as indicated by the blue line in the diagram, i.e. considerably higher than the interest rate path that was chosen. A higher interest rate path would also have resulted in more negative output and inflation gaps. Achieving the inflation target would have taken ten years.                                                   2  See Holmsen et al. (2008) for a discussion of the implementation and communication of optimal monetary policy. 2 BIS Review 110/2009 
An interval for the interest rate is determined based on the criteria, where optimal policy (with interest rate smoothing) defines the lower boundary and the Taylor rule yields the upper boundary. After an overall assessment, the interest rate forecast indicated by the red line was selected. The interest rate decision, in Norway as elsewhere, is based on discussion by a board. Criteria 3, 4 and 5 introduce conditions that cannot easily be observed. We have to apply judgement. The criteria contribute to consistency and structure the discussion. The Riksbank also applies judgement when selecting the interest rate path. But Svensson does not discuss possible shortcomings in the macroeconomic model. In Chart 10, he shows how the various interest rate paths, differing by around ½ percentage point in the period to summer, could result in differences in the inflation rate of close to 4 percentage points as early as next autumn. Monetary policy seems to be having a very strong impact. It would be interesting to hear whether he thinks that relying so heavily on such a model in interest rate setting is robust, and how possible errors in the model should be guarded against. We also know from experience that market participants’ perceptions can differ from ours, particularly somewhat further ahead. There can be a variety of reasons for these differences and Svensson discusses a number of them. It would also be useful to study the volatility surrounding publication of key macroeconomic variables. We would prefer to see lower volatility around monetary policy meetings, and that any surprises are postponed to a time closer to the publication of new macroeconomic data. Solberg Johansen (2008) – winner of the Bertil Ohlin prize for best thesis in international economics at the Stockholm School of Economics – examines volatility in the yield curve. Her findings provide some support for a decrease in volatility around monetary policy meetings, but no strong evidence to suggest that financial market volatility around the publication of new data has changed after Norges Bank began to publish interest rate forecasts. Another study that might provide useful input is Ehrmann and Fratzscher’s (2007) analysis of developments in US market rates in the period between monetary policy meetings under two different communication regimes. I will close by concurring with Blinder and colleagues (2008) when they write that: “… the publication of projected paths for the central bank’s policy rate appears to be the “new frontier” in central bank communication. But it has been practised in so few countries for so few years that we have little empirical knowledge of its effects as yet. As more data accumulates, this should be a high-priority area for future research.” It is reassuring to know that the economist that has begun this important work is Lars Svensson.

T T Mboweni: Reflections on some economic and social developments in South Africa in the past 15 years Address by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the 10th Annual Steve Biko Memorial Lecture, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, 10 September 2009. *      *      * Introduction I wish to express my gratitude to the Steve Biko Foundation, the Biko family and the University Cape Town for extending this invitation to deliver the 10th Annual Steve Biko Memorial Lecture. I am particularly humbled to belong to the club of those who have previously addressed this august gathering. September 2009 marks the 32nd anniversary of the murder in detention of Bantu Stephen Biko. It is, therefore, a fitting tribute to Steve Biko to hold this event in September, South Africa’s heritage month. This is particularly so because the threat of forgetting who we are, where we come from and how we got to be where we are looms ever larger, particularly for the younger generations. I never met Steve Biko personally, having been a teenager in Limpopo by the time he departed this world. His teachings, though, had a profound influence on me. That was the period historians referred to as a period of political lull. My ultimate involvement in politics stemmed, in part, from some of those efforts of the black consciousness movement to “conscientise” the masses and revive political activism. Indeed, as Archbishop Desmond Tutu writes in his preface to Steve Biko’s I write what I like: “Black Consciousness sought to awaken in us the sense of our infinitive value and worth in the sight of God because we were all created in God’s image, so that our worth is intrinsic to who we are and not dependent on biological irrelevancies such as ethnicity, skin colour or race. Black Consciousness helped to exorcise the horrible demons of self-hatred and self-contempt that made blacks suck up to whites whilst treating fellow blacks as the scum they thought themselves to be. Black Consciousness aroused in us the knowledge of our share in what St Paul called the glorious liberty of the children of God, urging us to enter into that splendid heritage.”1Inflation To break a bit with tradition, the thrust of my address tonight will be on economic issues. In particular, I will share a few observations and thoughts on selected macroeconomic developments in South Africa in the past 15 years. From 9 November 2009 I will no longer be allowed to comment on monetary policy. As the outgoing governor, however, I will take advantage of this platform to remind you of a few truths, one being that no central bank worth its salt can ever tolerate high inflation. Price stability may not be a sufficient condition but I maintain that it is a necessary condition for a solid foundation for sustainable growth and prosperity. I would like to believe that Steve Biko would have been gratified by the fairly contained pace of inflation over the past 15 years, knowing the dire consequences of inflation for the poor – those who are usually least able to hedge against inflation – in particular. Since 1994 average headline inflation has amounted to approximately 6,5 per cent per annum. Over the                                                  1  Steve Biko, I write what I like, A selected of his writings. BIS Review 109/2009 1 
preceding 15 years, 1979 to 1994, it had averaged almost 14 per cent per annum. Inflation has been uneven over the period, though, induced typically by significant changes in key exogenous drivers of inflation, such as oil prices. Secondly, the recent upsurge in strike action has led to some commentators describing the wave as a “winter of discontent”. In this regard, I would like to comment on some worrying trends in the settlements reached. Wage settlements above the projected rate of inflation and in excess of productivity gains tend to undermine the fight against high inflation. They lead to labour cost increases way above those of trade competitors and, therefore, loss of competitiveness. Though I will discuss the labour market in much depth later, I need to refer briefly to our labour laws. Many commentators have described the labour market as rigid and inflexible. As the country’s first post-1994 Minister of Labour, some of the blame has been pointed in my direction. I am the first to admit that some things could have been done differently. Hindsight, however, is useful only when it improves our foresight. I would like to take this opportunity to espouse some of the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings behind the Labour Relations Act. The labour movement regarded me as a hero then. Social ills The break with tradition, however, cannot be complete when addressing such an established forum. I will, therefore, digress slightly and venture an opinion on a few matters not related to economics and central banking. The shameful xenophobic tendencies we witnessed last year should have caused all South Africans to exclaim: “Oh, beloved country, what would Steve Biko have said?” At the height of the attacks on foreigners most of us were notable by our silence and inaction. Sadly, such indifference, anger, hatred and violence towards foreigners, particularly black Africans, still finds expression among many South Africans. This is at a time when we seek to accelerate economic integration in the SADC region, with all the lofty ideals of establishing a free trade area by last year (2008), a customs union by next year (2010), a common market and a monetary union by, respectively, 2015 and 2016. The ultimate objective of SADC is to build a region in which there will be a high degree of harmonisation and rationalisation to enable the pooling of resources in order to achieve collective selfreliance and improve the living standards of the people of the region. At central bank level, an important milestone has been the completion of the drafting of the proposed SADC central bank model law, which will pave the way for the harmonisation of legal and regulatory frameworks. Steve Biko observed that the most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed. Indeed, the liberation of the oppressed is not only political, economic and social, but involves psychological liberation as well. Can we claim to have liberated our minds when the daily statistics of rape and other forms of violence against women and children leave us questioning the very essence of our humanity? This cannot be what Steve Biko envisioned when he wrote: “We have set out on a quest for true humanity, and somewhere on the distant horizon we can see the glittering prize. Let us march forth with courage and determination, drawing strength from our common plight and brotherhood. In time we shall be in a position to bestow upon South Africa the greatest gift possible – a more human face.”2Delivering this lecture three years ago, Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu asked: “What has come over us? Perhaps we did not realise just how apartheid has damaged us so that we seem to have lost our sense of right and wrong, so that when we go on strike as is our                                                  2  Ibid. 2 BIS Review 109/2009 
right to do, we are not appalled that some of us can chuck people out of moving trains because they did not join the strike, or why is it common practice now to trash, to go on the rampage? Striking municipal workers empty trash on the streets, other strikers break shop windows, loot and trash the premises? Even our students on strike will often destroy the very facilities they need for their studies. What has happened to us? It seems as if we have perverted our freedom, our rights into licence, into being irresponsible. Rights go hand in hand with responsibility, with dignity, with respect for oneself and for the other.”3  We can pose exactly the same questions today when the Bus Rapid Transit system, a bold attempt to improve public transport, leads commuters in Johannesburg being inconvenienced by a stayaway from some in the taxi industry hell-bent on holding the country to ransom whenever they are not having it their way and perceive a threat to shrink their market share. They will even go to the extent of firing live bullets at buses ferrying commuters. We are witnessing social ills that are partly rooted in our history as well as in unintended consequences of policy interventions during the post-apartheid period. Health professionals abandon the sick in dire need of medical attention. Teachers abandon learners in favour of this it the other demand, usually very close to exams. Shopping at malls has become risking life and limb as marauding mobs, armed and ready to shoot to kill, strike brazenly and with such frequency. Striking municipal workers still trash our cities. Soldiers – those entrusted with the defence of the country and the constitutional order – disobey a court order and run riot near the Union Buildings, some of them armed. The scenes – the resultant mayhem and police firing at soldiers – would make responsible citizens to be very afraid and exclaim: “Oh, beloved country, what would Steve Biko have said about all those developments?” Economic growth Having been willing to give everything for the ideal of a democratic society, Steve Biko would have observed the progress of the country since democracy was introduced in 1994 with the greatest interest. In fact, he would have done more than that: he would certainly have been leading rather than observing, shaping events rather than being shaped by them. In reviewing the past 15 years in the South African economy, and with the wisdom acquired over the years, he might have chosen to draw up a balance sheet of assets and liabilities, the positives and the negatives encountered over this period. One of the highlights of the performance of the country has been the unprecedented levels of economic growth attained since the turn of the century. Calculated at constant 2000 prices, real gross domestic product per capita rose by more than 28 per cent, from R20 214 in 1994 to R25 897 in 2008.4 Similarly, real gross national income per capita, which also allows for the effect of changes in the terms of trade on real income, rose by more than 29 per cent over this period. The level of real gross domestic product expanded by 63 per cent over the period 1994 to 2008, giving an indication of how much the overall cake had grown on a cumulative basis. The pace of growth, however, was uneven. Economic growth, however, has not yielded the most desirable results as far as employment creation is concerned. Researchers assert that improved income levels since 1994 were more driven by welfare transfers than labour market absorption. Up to 2005, growth in employment largely tracked real GDP growth, albeit at a less than sufficient pace to meet the                                                  3  Steve Bantu Biko Memorial Lecture, delivered by Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, University of Cape Town, 26 September 2006. 4  Unless stated otherwise, data is from the Quarterly Bulletin of the South African Reserve Bank (various issues) and the SARS Customs and Excise database. BIS Review 109/2009 3 
rapid growth of the labour force. The revised Labour Force Survey estimates, for instance, reveal that between March 2001 and March 2007 the absorption rate trended downwards from 45,8 per cent to 44,1 per cent.5 Even more disheartening is the number of discouraged job seekers which grew from 1 725 000 to 2 511 000 over the same period. Females were more adversely affected than males by all these disappointing labour market outcomes. Even though the demand side of the labour market has been disappointing, some strides have been made in enhancing the quality of labour supply. This, however, has not been even throughout all education levels. The proportion of the population aged 20 years and older without any schooling dropped from 19,1 percent in 1996 to 10,3 per cent in 2007, while the share of those with some secondary education increased from 33,6 per cent to 40,1 per cent.6At the post-matric levels, however, the improvements are less dramatic. Over the ten years starting in 1996, the population over 20 years of age which completed higher education grew marginally from 7,1 to 9,1 per cent7.7 Sadly, reality dictates that it is the quality of labour that determines employability. Evidence shows that growth in inequality is partly attributable to the fact that skilled workers were more favoured by growth in job opportunities. Since the beginning of the new dispensation, our school system performed better in producing standard grade than higher grade matric passes in mathematics. Standard grade passes increased from 75 543 to 123 813 between 1997 and 2007. Higher grade passes dipped from an initial 29 475 to 19 327 in 2000 and recovered to 25 415 passes in 2007. Although the total number of graduates increased from 578 134 in 2000 to 741 380 in 2006, the share of science, engineering and technology graduates moved marginally from 25,5 per cent to 28,5 per cent over the same period.8Opening up to the international community Increased globalisation has been one of the defining characteristics of the world economy over the last two decades. The advent of democracy in 1994 ushered in a new era in South Africa’s economic history. At the heart of this process was the integration of the domestic economy into the world economy. Prior to 1994, apartheid South Africa faced large-scale international financial sanctions and isolation. This stifled economic activity in numerous ways. For instance, access to foreign sources of finance was blocked in the mid-1980s, resulting in a debt standstill in 1985 as South Africa could no longer roll over its foreign borrowing and honour its commitments. Unable to tap foreign savings, South Africa had to finance all its investment from its own domestic savings, and was therefore forced to run surpluses on the current account of the balance of payments. This, in turn, implied generally strict economic policy settings aimed at moderating domestic income and expenditure, thereby reducing imports. With the transition to democracy, international sanctions were lifted away as the global community embraced South Africa. Whereas from 1985 to 1993 net outflows of financial capital averaging 2,4 per cent of gross domestic product were recorded, financial inflows have subsequently been registered in every year but one. The average net inflow from 1994 to 2008 amounted to 3,2 per cent of gross domestic product, augmenting domestic savings and making it possible to import more and grow faster.                                                  5  Statistics South Africa.

Significant reform of our trade policies has resulted in trade as a ratio of GDP increasing from around 40 per cent in the early 1990s to around 70 per cent in 2008. The nature of our trading relations has also changed significantly. In the early to mid-1990s, the developed countries – most notably those in Europe – accounted for around 60 per cent of South Africa’s trade. Since then our export markets have diversified, with countries in Africa and Asia gaining in prominence. Around 25 per cent of our total exports are sold in Asian markets. India and China’s rise in the global economy has been one of the main reasons for the rise in the demand for commodities. The two currently account for around 13 per cent of South Africa’s exports. The normalisation of international relations also involved a programme to gradually phase out exchange control. Up to March 1995 the so-called financial rand system applied to investment by non-residents. This not only inhibited outflows of financial capital, but also inflows. With the abolition of the financial rand system in March 1995, the country moved from two prices for foreign currency to a single price, thereby removing a dispensation prone to abuse, fraud and corruption. Moreover, while the door was opened for capital movements in both directions, it so happens that, subsequently, inflows have exceeded outflows quite substantially. The confidence in ourselves which was demonstrated by liberalising capital flows has been rewarded. Further exchange control reforms of the past 15 years include allowing South African individuals to invest money abroad, or as foreign-currency denominated investments with South African institutions. The applicable allowance was raised over time and currently the maximum amount per individual is R2 million. A more liberal approach has also been adopted as far as investment by South African companies abroad is concerned. Such investments have contributed to development, competition and growth on the African continent and elsewhere. Furthermore, a number of prominent South African companies have been allowed to shift their primary listing to foreign securities exchanges, thereby making it easier for them to borrow money or issue shares in those markets. People who had previously illegally built up foreign assets were also granted amnesty to declare and legalise such asset holdings. Numerous persons made use of this opportunity. South Africa seems to have benefited considerably from the greater freedom – with greater responsibility – which its citizens enjoy in the international arena. Both foreign assets and liabilities have risen considerably. Foreign currency markets have become more liquid. Under these circumstances the South African Reserve Bank has also been able to work down its oversold forward position in the market for foreign currency – its international liquidity position has changed from a negative US$25,2 billion at the end of 1994 to a positive US$36,9 billion at present. Apart from this, imports of goods and services have risen from 20 per cent of gross domestic product in 1994 to 38 per cent in 2008, while the corresponding ratio for exports has risen from 22 per cent to 35 per cent over the period. Government finance: reallocating resources to social spending In the area of government finance remarkable progress has been made over the past 15 years. In 1994 expenditure by the South African government had a significant racial bias. While significant additional expenditure was called for to correct this imbalance, government faced significant constraints: national government debt, for instance, was 50 per cent of GDP and debt service costs absorbed a considerable amount of funds. Mindful of the need to structure national finances in a sustainable way, government decided to do the right thing rather than go the macroeconomic populist route. Government expenditure and debt were kept under control, the capacity of the South African Revenue Service to collect taxes efficiently was enhanced, and an environment conducive to economic growth was fostered. Progress was made on all these fronts, with the growing economy expanding the tax base and the formidable Revenue Service ensuring that the fiscus received what was due to it. The buoyant tax revenue growth over the past 15 years BIS Review 109/2009 5 
made it possible to raise government expenditure and transfers quite substantially while, at the same time, keeping the budget deficit small enough to reduce the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product to 24 per cent in the second quarter of 2009. This prudent approach paid off recently when the international economic crisis led to a contraction in economic activity in South Africa. Low levels of government debt made it possible to adopt a much more expansionary fiscal policy stance under the circumstances, despite subdued tax revenues. Although this is set to raise the government debt ratio over the next few years, such increase is warranted in the interest of supporting economic activity and employment. While an expansionary fiscal policy stance can bolster economic activity, it is crucial to simultaneously ensure that the expenditure incurred is productive. Much can and must still be done in this area. For instance, as highlighted by ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe in an address on 2 September, the micro-organisation of school education leaves much to be desired, with actual teaching in township and rural schools averaging only three-and-a-half hours per day. To correct this is not rocket science, but would need sustained good organisation and discipline. Throwing money at the problem would not in itself be helpful.  Financial sector developments In the area of finance the period from 1994 onward brought numerous opportunities, as major impediments to the majority of the population’s interaction with the financial system were removed. The demise of racially-based restrictions on the ownership of real estate, for instance, opened avenues for borrowing towards home-ownership and farming, and for using such fixed property as collateral. However, the removal of legal impediments alone is not enough to move rapidly to a satisfactory state of affairs. As the saying goes, the only place where one would find “houses” before “jobs” is in the dictionary. While considerable progress has been made with the extension of home and land ownership through government programmes and initiatives in the private financial sector, not enough jobs (and accompanying remuneration flows) have been forthcoming to support sustainable home-ownership on the larger scale needed. This has also held back the extent of deposits or investments with, and borrowing from, the financial sector. Nevertheless, the extent to which jobs were created and to which previously “unbanked” persons became “banked” was sufficient to raise considerably the amount of money and bank credit in the economy relative to the nominal gross domestic product. For instance, in 1994 the broadly defined money supply, M3, amounted to around 47 per cent of annualised nominal gross domestic product. Currently the same ratio is approximately 83 per cent. The many South Africans who did get a job frequently found that, in the wake of their new salary or wage flows, they received numerous offers to take up credit. Many of them became overextended, as suggested by the increase in the overall ratio of household debt to annualised disposable income from 56 per cent in 1994 to more than 76 per cent by mid-2009. So much friction was generated by this dispensation and government had to introduce the National Credit Act in 2007 to improve consumer protection. This is accomplished through measures such as enhanced disclosure in credit contracts and thorough screening of prospective borrowers’ ability to repay debt before granting a new loan. Fixed capital formation It is gratifying to note the considerable strengthening of fixed capital formation in the South African economy. In 1994 capital expenditure was barely 15 per cent of gross domestic product. It took a long time to gain the momentum and put in place the processes necessary 6 BIS Review 109/2009 
to raise capital spending, but since around 2003 this has started to happen. Currently fixed capital expenditure amounts to almost 25 per cent of gross domestic product. This says much about the self-confidence gained by South Africans and about the forward-looking focus of our society – characteristics which Steve Biko would have embraced and promoted with tireless energy. Socio-economic trends South Africa has come a long way in terms of rebuilding and healing from the legacies of the apartheid past. We all recognise that a lot still needs to be done. However, we can only learn by replicating what evidently works and reviewing what does not. A clear message emerging from socio-economic trends in the post-1994 period is that we should pay closer attention to policy implementation in terms of sequencing and understanding complementarities between macroeconomic and sectoral interventions. From the socio-economic point of view, we can point out with pride that significant ground has been gained in improving the living conditions of ordinary South Africans. After the turn of the century the overall levels of poverty showed a definite downward trend, albeit gradual. The proportion of the population living below the Income and Expenditure Survey poverty line of R250 per month (at constant 2007 prices) increased from 31 per cent in 1995 to 38 per cent in 2000, and dipped thereafter to 23 per cent in 2005.9Similarly, the levels of inequality peaked in 2000 and began to decline somewhat thereafter. The total Gini coefficient rose from 0,672 in 1993 to 0,685 in 1999 before trending downwards to 0,660 in 2007.10 Inter- and intra-racial trends, however, remain worrisome. Although inequality has eased somewhat since 2000, among Africans it remains the highest compared with other population groups. Furthermore, according to the All Media and Products Survey data, notwithstanding the low base, the share of income accruing to Africans marginally gained ground against that of other population groups, rising from nearly 32 per cent to 39 per cent over the 10-year period between 1994 and 2004.11These trends are due more to the expansion of households receiving social grants. Whereas the year-on-year growth in welfare payments before 2000 averaged about 6 per cent, it soared to 40,4 per cent in 2001, thereafter decelerating to around 29 per cent to 2005 and 3,4 per cent in 2007. The total number of social grant beneficiaries expanded six fold from 2,409 million in 1996 to 12,386 million 2007. Nearly two-thirds, or just over 8 million of these recipients, were children.12While no one can dispute the positive impact social grants have made on poverty, we need to interrogate the sustainability of the social welfare grant approach in the long run. I fully appreciate the need for the state and society to provide welfare support to citizens who are physically or mentally incapacitated due to illness, disability, or old age. But when millions of our people depend on social grants for sustenance, and urban legend has it that teenagers go to the extent of falling pregnant so as to gain access to grants, we need to ask ourselves, as I think Steve Biko would: are we not running the risk of these social grants becoming an end in themselves and thus nurturing a dependency syndrome, destroying the fabric of our society?                                                  9  Ibid. 10 Ibid. 11  Van der Berg, S., et. al.

We have also witnessed notable improvements in living conditions of households. The number of households living in formal dwellings rose from 64 per cent in 1996 and peaked at 73,6 per cent in 2004 before moderating to 70,5 per cent in 2007. Access to services such as water and electricity also expanded. The proportion of households using electricity as the main source of energy increased significantly from nearly 58 per cent to 80 percent between 1996 and 2007. Access to piped water rose from 84,5 per cent in 1996 to 88,6 per cent of households in 2007.13 Very commendable. Conclusion Steve Biko would be pleased to see South Africa emerging among the best performing economies on the global platform. He would be proud with our constitutional dispensation and Bill of Rights in which the rights for all are enshrined; the emerging Black middle class; the equitably structured welfare benefits; and the general decline in poverty. He would frown upon us for the failure to adequately intervene to address the spread of HIV and AIDS, and many social ills such as crime and, more specifically, rape and other forms of violence against women and children; the continuing racial and cultural intolerance as well as xenophobia. Steve Biko was most concerned about our worldview and value systems. For him this was more than just a manifestation of material well-being. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me therefore to argue that, apart from the need to strengthen our family and community systems, we should not lose sight of revitalising our knowledge systems which are essentially broader than preparing our children to be economically productive, asset-backed citizens of the future. Our knowledge system needs a complete overhaul in which the youth grow to understand their authentic history (less the romance), their cultural progressive value system and what it means to be a good citizen. The groundbreaking work done by such prominent South African anthropologists as Dr Harriet Ngubane should be celebrated and replicated. The growing unemployment rate combined with the partly undesirable inequality trends can be fertile ground for exacerbating polarisation among South Africans, leading to social tension across racial, class and gender lines. The current global economic recession adds to our woes. It is eroding some of the achievements we have made in stabilising the economy, broadening economic participation and improving the living conditions of many South Africans. In conclusion, the current financial crisis and global recession nevertheless gives us the opportunity to re-evaluate our craft in dovetailing macroeconomic policy with industrial, trade and other strategic sectoral policies to ensure that future economic growth translates into tangible and sustainable well-being for all, especially our rural communities, women, youth and other marginalised sectors of society. More fundamentally, we are struggling to realise broad-based transformation of political freedom into economic, social and cultural freedom with the required degree of integrity, loyalty and professionalism. If we can overcome these challenges, we would have surely achieved some but not all the wishes of our fallen visionaries like Steve Biko. “Keep the Faith”! Thank you.                                                  13  Statistics South Africa. Community Survey 2007, Pretoria , 2007. 8 BIS Review 109/2009 
Njuguna Ndung’u: Taming of inflation and food security Opening remarks by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya and Chairman of the Monetary Policy Committee, during the Monetary Policy Committee Seminar on “Taming inflation and food security”, The Kenya School of Monetary Studies, Nairobi, 14 August 2009. *      *      * Permanent Secretaries: Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Planning, National Development and Vision 2030; Ministry of Agriculture; Ministry of Trade; Ministry of Special Programmes; Representatives of our Development Partners; Chairmen and Heads of Government Parastatals; Representatives of the Private Sector; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen; It gives me great pleasure to be with you today during this important seminar on “Taming Inflation and Food Security”. Let me take this opportunity from the onset to warmly welcome you all to the Kenya School of Monetary Studies (KSMS). As you may all be aware, the Bank’s principal objective is to formulate and implement monetary policy directed at achieving and maintaining stability in the general level of prices, as well as supporting the economic policy of the Government including its objectives of growth and employment. Price stability is an important signal to the economy and provides a stable planning horizon to predict future prices and perhaps returns. Most coordination failures occur due to the inability to forecast future prices or calculate, for example, return on investment. This seminar comes at a time when the country is just recovering from the effects of high inflation arising from supply side factors caused by several shocks. These shocks have an international as well as domestic dimension. They include volatile oil prices, commodity prices and drought conditions which continue to pose a challenge to the achievement of the Bank’s core mandate of price stability. Given these outcomes – that shocks tend to affect domestic prices upwards and domestic output downwards, simultaneously – we have to rethink the appropriate measure of inflation and how to target or contain it.  But also, appropriately computing and reporting inflation becomes very critical – the information processed from the reported numbers on inflation leads directly to cost of living adjustment (COLA) requests even at CBK! Usually, the CBK must have some inflation target. But also this has to be consistent with inflation experience or profile for the general public as well as create the required consistency of the monetary framework and economic growth profile. This workshop should help in defining the appropriate inflation indicator. The emphasis that seems to converge is to come up with a single measure of inflation that can be easily explained, analyzed and related to economic outcomes. But of course different economic constituencies will understand this in terms of how it affects them. Alternatively we may want to focus on measures that will say exactly what they mean. These include: a) Food inflation. b) “Core” inflation – (define what is core). c) Inflation (takes care of all the above) – National inflation indicator. BIS Review 109/2009 1 
d) For CBK, we would prefer a non-tradable goods price index to compute our inflation index that responds or is affected by monetary policy directly and also links to the exchange rate and the issues of competitiveness. For your information, Ladies and Gentleman, many countries are currently publishing statistics on tradable and non-tradable inflation as part of their dissemination of inflation data. This allows central banks to easily compute the profile of real exchange rate. e) Finally, we want an inflation index that comes close to measuring or reflecting the cost of living. The question is, how can this be done and at least cost by KNBS and how other players in this process can partner. But why do we want several indicators of inflation to be developed? At the outset, money or the demand side is just one factor or driving force on inflation. The other one is on the supply side. Monetary policy becomes passive when supply side factors drive the domestic prices and so inflation. This means that several indicators can also bring in a wealth of information to be processed. The experience; the achievement of the inflation target has been constrained by increased volatility in food prices and other exogenous shocks. In particular, the overall month-on-month inflation increased from 9.67 percent in January 2007 to 11.1 percent in June 2007, and to 31.5 percent in May 2008 before declining gradually to 17.79 percent in July 2009. On the other hand, CBK underlying inflation declined from 5.15 percent in January 2007 to 4.90 percent in June 2007 before rising to 7.90 percent in July 2009. The issues and questions raised by such volatility in one measure of inflation thus attract policy debate and action. It is important to note that the rising overall inflation rate during the period was attributed mainly to food prices which account for 50.5 percent of the overall consumer price index basket. The rising food prices have been attributed mainly to drought, supply constraints and lack of cultivation by farmers in Kenya’s grain basket in the Rift Valley who were displaced following the post poll crisis in January 2008. Food inflation has been quite volatile and erratic since January 2007, increasing from 11.8 percent to 15.9 percent in December 2007, 44.2 percent in May 2008 and declining to 24.4 percent in July 2009. The volatility of food inflation was the highest during the period and using a measure of volatility stood at 10.72 percent compared with 8.98 percent and 6.19 percent for fuel and transport & communication inflation rates, respectively. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank is concerned that the prevailing famine and drought in the country will result in a spike in inflation and so an appropriate policy response is required. The solution; most studies have advocated for improved agricultural productivity as the most effective way of addressing food crises associated with higher international prices and food security concerns. But this has to be supported by an appropriate infrastructure for processing, storage and transportation of food. In this regard, it is our hope that this seminar will seek to achieve the following objectives: a) Agree on how best to report inflation. b) Review the sources, magnitude and structure of inflation in Kenya, to gain a better understanding of its dynamics. c) Come up with feasible solutions to the food supply problem. d) Deliberate on possible action plans among key stakeholders to keep inflation low and stable. This seminar is therefore expected to come up with resolutions that would form a basis for a long term policy on domestic prices and food security in Kenya. We still have to contend ourselves with a three-dimensional solution: food production; food processing; food storage and transportation. 2 BIS Review 109/2009 
Let me underscore the important role of partnership between the stakeholder-institutions represented here today in addressing the challenges of inflation. It is my hope that such partnerships will involve regular consultations, sharing information and strategies geared towards seeking solutions to supply constraints or challenges to food production and distribution with the overall objective of achieving price stability. This workshop should re-define and strengthen future partnership and the responsibility for each institution. On behalf of the Central Bank of Kenya and the Monetary Policy Committee, let me express my sincere gratitude to the presenters, discussants and all participants who responded to our invitation and have graced us with their presence at this seminar. I am sure they will provide a good platform to share information and discuss feasible solutions. Ladies and Gentlemen, I now take this opportunity to declare this seminar officially open. I wish you all fruitful deliberations. Thank you. BIS Review 109/2009 3 
Jürgen Stark: Monetary and fiscal policy – criteria and timing for the phasing out of crisis measures Speech by Mr Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the 80th Kieler Konjunkturgespräch, Berlin, 15 September 2009. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, A year ago today the investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection. This dramatic event has had adverse effects on the world economy, including the euro area. It has led to the most severe and synchronised economic downturn since the 1930s. But recent information is encouraging. The massive response to the crisis on the part of governments and central banks seems to be bearing fruit. Available data suggest that the free fall in economic activity has come to a halt and the global recession is bottoming out. However, uncertainty remains high, with data on economic activity likely to remain volatile.  The key challenge in the period ahead will be to unwind in a timely manner the extraordinary and unprecedented measures taken in response to the crisis. The criteria and timing for the phasing out of the crisis measures will be the main topic of my speech today. But first, I will start by giving you a brief overview of the current economic outlook on the basis of the Governing Council’s assessment. I will then describe the measures implemented by the ECB and fiscal authorities in more detail.  The economic outlook  Given recent developments, there are reasons for cautious optimism regarding the outlook for economic activity. Economic activity turned out better than expected in the second quarter of 2009.  As regards the future, the economic recovery is likely to be very gradual. The revival of global trade, the rebuilding of inventories and the positive impact of policy stimulus and liquidity support measures are expected to be the main drivers of economic activity, and we may see a positive quarter on quarter growth rate already in the third quarter this year. But the quarterly growth pattern might be very uneven, and the uncertainty surrounding this outlook remains unusually high, given that some of the factors supporting growth are temporary in nature.  This outlook is broadly in line with the September 2009 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for growth in the euro area, which have been revised upwards compared with the June 2009 Eurosystem staff projections. This is the first upward revision since March 2007. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. On the upside, the positive impact of the policy measures implemented may be stronger than expected. Confidence may improve faster than assumed. On the downside, the financial sector is still strained, and we cannot rule out the possibility that a stronger or more protracted negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector may develop. Concerns also relate to a renewed increase in international commodity prices, an intensification of protectionist pressures and a disorderly correction of global imbalances.  As regards prices, annual inflation rates turned negative this summer. However, this is a temporary phenomenon, which was largely driven by past developments in energy prices. Annual inflation rates are expected to turn positive again within the next few months, but to remain relatively subdued. This is confirmed by both our economic and monetary analysis.  BIS Review 109/2009 1 
This inflation outlook is consistent with the September 2009 ECB staff projections, which have been revised slightly upwards compared with the June projections, mainly owing to higher energy prices. The Governing Council considers the risks to this outlook to be broadly balanced. On the downside, the downward pressure on prices could be stronger than expected, due to the sharp contraction in economic activity over the past year and the modest scale of the recovery which is foreseen. On the upside, renewed increases in oil prices and stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes in the wake of fiscal consolidation efforts cannot be ruled out.  The ECB’s policy response  Let me briefly recall how the ECB has responded to the intensification of the crisis a year ago. First of all, with inflationary pressures receding rapidly since last autumn, we have reduced the rate at the main refinancing operations by 325 basis points to the lowest levels seen since the start of Monetary Union. The Governing Council regards the current rates as appropriate. In addition, we have taken a number of non-standard measures in order to: • First, support the orderly functioning of the money market;  • Second, ease funding conditions for banks and thereby enhance the flow of credit to the economy above and beyond what could be achieved through policy interest rate reductions alone. • Third, improve market liquidity in important segments of the private debt securities market.  These measures have come to be known as our “enhanced credit support approach”. Its focus has been on banks, as they are the main source of funding in the euro area economy. Overall, our approach comprises five main building blocks:  • First, the full accommodation of banks’ liquidity requests at a fixed rate.  • Second, the expansion of the list of assets eligible as collateral. • Third, the lengthening of the maturities of long-term refinancing operations.  • Fourth, the provision of liquidity in foreign currencies.  • And finally, financial market support through outright purchases of covered bonds in order to stimulate a market that has traditionally been an important source of funding for banks.  This is the only decision we have taken which directly affects a market segment other than the money market, and the total sum allocated to the programme – €60 billion – may appear modest compared with asset purchases performed by some other central banks. Our planned purchases amount to about 5% of the eligible outstanding covered bonds. Let me emphasise that we have very deliberately refrained from buying government bonds, so as to safeguard our independence from political influence. For the same reason, we have implemented our measures without any form of government guarantee.  The implementation of the non-standard measures has led to a significant increase in the size of the Eurosystem balance sheet. By the end of August 2009, the simplified balance sheet of the Eurosystem stood at around €1,500 billion – about 16% of euro area GDP. Compared with its size in July 2007, shortly before the outbreak of the financial turmoil, the balance sheet is currently about two-thirds larger. It is difficult to assess the impact of our measures precisely, but we are satisfied that spreads in the money market have declined significantly since last autumn and are now back to the 2 BIS Review 109/2009 
levels seen before the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Together with the policy rate cuts, this has contributed to a substantial decline in lending rates to households and firms. For example, the interest rate offered by monetary financial institutions (MFIs) on loans to households for house purchase with a floating rate and an initial rate fixation of up to one year has about halved since October last year.  The subdued developments in lending have attracted some attention, particularly given that our measures were designed to support lending activity. However, if we consider how credit has developed during economic downturns in the past, the recent developments in credit appear to be broadly in line with the recent developments in economic activity and the current outlook. In particular, in the past loans to firms have tended to lag turning points in the business cycle. One explanation for this may be that firms tend to use their own funds first and only afterwards resort to external financing, which leads to low demand for credit around the turning point. Based on past experience, the current levelling-off of loans to households would normally be associated with a further contraction in loans to firms until at least early 2010. Having said this, we will of course continue to monitor the developments in credit very closely in the period ahead, especially with a view to assessing to what extent supply-side constraints have the potential to limit the availability of credit.  Fiscal policy response to the crisis Let me now move on to the fiscal policy response to the crisis. Fiscal policies have played an important role in containing the adverse impact of the financial and economic crisis. Euro area governments have demonstrated their ability to take rapid and coordinated steps both to support the financial system and to stimulate economic activity. Government support for the banking sector represents a key element in the stabilisation of the whole financial system and the prevention of a further detrimental impact on the real economy. The measures adopted in response to the financial crisis consist of various types of financial assistance, including government guarantees for interbank lending, recapitalisation of financial institutions, increased coverage of retail deposit insurance and asset relief schemes. As well as addressing the sources of the crisis by supporting systemically important financial institutions, fiscal policies have provided extensive stimulus to aggregate demand. As a first line of defence, a significant fiscal impulse has been, and continues to be, delivered via automatic stabilisers, which are relatively strong in the euro area. At the same time, European governments have agreed to adopt expansionary fiscal measures in order to mitigate the effects of the economic downturn.  The past few decades have been characterised by a considerable degree of scepticism towards the effectiveness of fiscal policies that go beyond the operation of automatic stabilisers. In some respects, recent calls from academics and policy-makers alike for fiscal activism represent a shift in this paradigm. This has also led to a re-emergence of old disputes between academic macroeconomists.  It must be stressed, however, that the government measures adopted in response to the economic crisis carry considerable fiscal costs. The effectiveness of fiscal stimuli crucially depends on the expectations and reactions of economic agents. In this context, the perception of the measures as being temporary and trust in the sustainability of fiscal policies are crucial. So far, fiscal activism seems to have been reasonably well coordinated, timely and targeted. But the challenge of ensuring that the measures are temporary remains. The determination of euro area governments to avoid further fiscal stimuli is welcome. However, the current support measures cannot be sustained forever. Timely and credible exit strategies for withdrawing the existing fiscal stimuli must be developed and communicated as soon as possible.  BIS Review 109/2009 3 
To this end, central banks and fiscal authorities will have to be prepared to unwind their extraordinary support measures.  The phasing-out of crisis measures Let me be clear: the fact that we are discussing exit strategies by no means implies that we are about to implement them. But for them to be effective, we need to be transparent. Otherwise, investors may become fearful of inflation and concerned about the sustainability of public finances. This would no doubt push up long-term interest rates. For the same reasons, households might expect higher taxes in the future and raise the share of their income that they would rather save than spend. All these effects would, of course, jeopardise the gradual recovery and undermine the effectiveness of the policy stimulus. Monetary policy As regards our area of responsibility, we are well prepared to phase out the measures we took in response to the crisis. The way these measures were implemented provides us with reasonable flexibility in unwinding them. For example, unless we decide otherwise, the maturity and size of our operations will automatically decrease, starting next year.  Consistent with our mandate to maintain price stability, we have applied certain criteria in implementing the credit support measures and interest rate decisions. In unwinding our support we will continue to apply those criteria. Not least thanks to our political independence and our credibility, we are well equipped to act in a timely manner when the need arises.  Two elements appear to be key. First, of course, we need to have a goal in mind. Second, we need to think about how to manage the transition from where we are now towards that goal.  As regards the decision parameters, the first area concerns the withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus in terms of the key ECB interest rates. The criterion for how and when to withdraw the stimulus will be our assessment of risks to price stability.  The second area relates to the phasing-out of the liquidity and credit support that we provide to banks. In this case the instrument is the size and maturity composition of our liquidity-providing operations. The criterion for phasing out these operations will be our assessment of the financial situation and, specifically, how funding risk evolves, without compromising our price stability mandate.  These two areas are interrelated. However, our interest rate decisions are guided exclusively by our assessment of risks to price stability. Our credit support measures have in addition been driven by the goal of alleviating funding risk and thereby forestalling a wider systemic crisis which would jeopardise our primary objective of price stability.  The interest rate instrument and the size and maturity composition of our liquidity-providing operations are instruments that can be used independently of each other, but only to a certain extent and not continually for different purposes. Specifically, concerns about funding support must not come to dominate monetary policy considerations.  The level of our key interest rates will, as always, be adjusted in response to changes in the outlook for price stability. But, because our non-standard measures were targeted at specific problems in the money market, our decisions about how and when to unwind them will also depend on how funding risk evolves. We would expect a gradual recovery in funding markets and further improvements in credit conditions for the non-financial sector to go hand in hand with the establishment of a sustained economic recovery. But it is impossible to forecast these developments with any certainty.  4 BIS Review 109/2009 
A scenario cannot be entirely ruled out where upside risks to price stability emerge while the problems in money markets persist. We might then have to maintain the structure and size of our balance sheet. But, at the same time, we would have to raise interest rates to counter upside risks to price stability. We would be confronted with the need to steer money market interest rates to higher levels while excess liquidity continued to prevail in money markets.  It is therefore crucial to monitor the sources of funding constraints for banks. We need to judge whether these funding constraints relate to individual banks rather than to the functioning of the money market and the banking system as a whole. Our operational framework is not designed to counter funding problems at the individual bank level. Rather, our funding support is designed to alleviate funding risk to the extent that it is systemic.  Therefore, we would seek to re-establish the key features of the operational framework that was in place before the crisis and to revert to a situation in which the one-week main refinancing operation is the main tool for steering short-term money market rates and we are “rate-takers” in the longer-term money market. Based on our economic and monetary analyses, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. We will ensure that the measures taken are unwound in a timely fashion and the liquidity provided is absorbed in order to counter effectively any threat to price stability. To sum up the monetary policy considerations: the monetary policy measures and non-standard measures taken during the financial crisis have been effective in alleviating funding concerns of banks. But we need to be aware that, if the measures are maintained for too long, there can be negative side effects.  Both central bank and fiscal measures may contribute to weaken the incentives for banks to clear troubled assets from their balance sheets and to monitor their credit risk carefully. This, in turn, may reinforce the very problems that currently impair the functioning of the financial system. In a low interest rate environment this can foster lending to unprofitable business. That, in turn, would harm the growth potential of the economy and thereby prepare the ground for weak growth to persist.  Very low interest rates can also hamper the functioning of the money market: The lower money market interest rates are, the lower the incentive for banks to trade funds in the market rather than depositing them safely with the central bank. Market participants might change their behaviour and get accustomed to the non-standard measures, which would be detrimental to the recovery of money markets. On our part, as soon as upside risks to price stability emerge, and with a view to avoid to contribute to the emergence of another asset price bubble, we would have to act accordingly.  For all these reasons, it is paramount to have a clear exit strategy in place.  Fiscal policy The ECB’s exit strategy follows naturally from our mandate and independence from political influence. The credibility we enjoy is illustrated by the fact that long-term inflation expectations have remained firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s definition of price stability throughout the crisis.  Fiscal authorities are not in the same position. One indication of this is the widening of government bond spreads in the euro area vis-à-vis German ten-year bunds since last autumn, which signals market doubts about the fiscal authorities’ resolve to bring fiscal policy back onto a sustainable path. Let me therefore briefly elaborate on why it is important that governments commit to clear exit strategies. In principle, unsustainable fiscal policies represent an upside risk to price stability as the possibility cannot be ruled out that debt-burdened governments may resort to monetary BIS Review 109/2009 5 
financing. But let me be clear: this is not an option for governments in the euro area. However, high inflation in other countries would also make it more difficult to preserve price stability here. Second, while governments bolstered private confidence via financial and economic support in the crisis phase, in the exit phase confidence must be preserved via the timely and credible withdrawal of the unsustainable stimulus measures. Exit strategies may reduce market concerns about fiscal sustainability, and they may help to limit Ricardian behaviour on the part of consumers, which could otherwise offset the impact of the fiscal stimulus. Third, recent calls for a persistently greater role for government owing to failures in market systems must be rejected. Historical experience shows that the market principle remains by far the best basis for an economic system, although we know that markets need rules and that the existing regulatory and supervisory framework has to be enhanced. The role of government should be scaled down after the crisis. No matter how serious the current crisis is, governments should ultimately cease to perform non-government tasks and the private sector should step in again. Fourth, fiscal positions in most euro area countries represents a challenge for the Stability and Growth Pact. Any weakening of the peer pressure mechanism on which the fiscal framework rests must be avoided. Full compliance with the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact is necessary in order to preserve confidence in the whole framework and contribute to the credibility of fiscal exit strategies in individual countries. Fifth, the fiscal costs of crisis measures are expected to be considerable. Government support for the financial sector gives rise to government debt and extensive contingent liabilities owing to government guarantees. The effects of automatic stabilisers and discretionary fiscal stimuli lead to a sharp deterioration in fiscal balances. All these factors, together with the expected adverse fiscal impact of population ageing, pose considerable risks to fiscal sustainability. It appears unlikely that countries will be able to rely on strong GDP growth to reduce their debt burdens. In this respect, unwinding fiscal stimuli, while necessary, is clearly insufficient to restore sustainable public finances. The structural adjustment of fiscal policies to the new economic environment will be needed. Moreover, potential costs stemming from guarantees provided to the banking sector should be taken into account.  Finally, the phasing-out of most non-standard monetary policy measures is highly predictable and withdrawal will be communicated in due time. The same level of transparency should apply to fiscal policies. Governments should provide a clear and credible medium-term timetable for fiscal exit strategies in order to help maintain a predictable environment, both for economic agents and for the conduct of monetary policy. General principles for fiscal exit strategies Based on these considerations, governments should develop and communicate ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies as soon as possible. Structural adjustment will have to be implemented in order to reduce high debt ratios and return public finances to a sustainable path. The timing, pace and sequence of the exit strategy is starting to be a major challenge. Let me summarise the main criteria for the fiscal exit strategy and the main principles on which they should be based. First, as regards involvement in the financial sector, the primary criterion for the exit strategy is the condition of the banking sector. Given the vital role of the banking system, the timing and sequence of the withdrawal of the assistance provided to the financial sector is of the utmost importance and, in the short to medium run, even more challenging than the task of unwinding fiscal stimuli. A balance between the need to safeguard financial stability and the need to restore market principles must be maintained. The stability of the banking sector must not be put at risk. However, the over-long involvement of governments will change the 6 BIS Review 109/2009 
behaviour of market participants and may have detrimental effects to competition in the banking sector and lead to an ineffective allocation of resources. Second, as regards the exit from high government deficit and debt, governments should ensure that the withdrawal of fiscal measures starts no later than the economic recovery. Part of this job will be done automatically via fiscal stabilisers and some fiscal stimulus measures are designed to be temporary. Additional fiscal adjustment is, however, needed. The phasing-out of stimuli to support demand should be closely linked to the pick-up in economic activity. Given the current economic outlook and projected public deficit and debt developments, euro area governments have decided to refrain from additional expansionary measures. This decision is very welcome. However, they have not so far committed to clear fiscal exit strategies. Exit strategies should be set out in the context of current and forthcoming excessive deficit procedures and within the next round of stability programmes. Otherwise, persistent high deficits and debts would contribute to high risk premia on government bond interest rates. Higher sovereign real long-term interest rates may then be transmitted to the rest of the economy and crowd out private demand. Third, the timing and pace of consolidation should take into account additional criteria such as growth prospects after the crisis, the size of government deficits and debts and the prospects for long-term sustainability. Given the substantial effort needed, structural adjustments should be significantly more ambitious than the benchmark of 0.5% of GDP per annum would suggest and should differ across countries. Debt simulations show that while a no-policy-change scenario implies an explosion of government debts, even a 0.5 percentage point structural adjustment would not be sufficient to bring debt ratios to the level of 60% of GDP over an acceptable time horizon. In particular, highly indebted countries and those with a sharp deterioration in their fiscal balances should therefore make a consolidation effort of at least 1 percentage point per annum. Fourth, the consolidation strategies should be designed in line with the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, which constitute the appropriate and credible framework for fiscal policy coordination in the euro area. The Pact provides for a degree of flexibility that is sufficient for the current circumstances. Any loosening of the framework beyond that level is not warranted, as it may pose the risk of eroding the incentive mechanisms. Fiscal strategies should respect deadlines for the correction of excessive deficits set by the ECOFIN Council in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. Fifth, in any case, fiscal consolidation cannot be limited to the correction of excessive deficits. The pace of consolidation needs to be maintained and stepped up in good times until the medium-term objectives are achieved.  The crisis has clearly demonstrated that countries that failed to build up safety margins during good times had little or no capacity to counter the economic downturn. In this respect, medium-term objectives must be sufficiently ambitious in order to create room for manoeuvre in fiscal terms before the next economic downturn and to prepare public finances for future expenditure associated with population ageing. All efforts should be made to ensure that the opportunity to consolidate public finances during the forthcoming good times are not missed again in some countries. Before concluding, I would like to emphasise that the institutional framework of the euro area leaves no room for an coordination between the single monetary policy of the ECB and the national fiscal policies. The Treaty sets up a clear allocation of responsibilities between monetary policy and national fiscal policies, with a view to ensuring a smooth functioning of monetary union. The institutional framework grants to the Eurosystem full independence from political influence and interference and assigns to the ECB the primary objective of maintaining price stability. At the same time, fiscal authorities are responsible for safeguarding the sustainability of public finances.  This does not mean that there are no interactions. The Governing Council has always welcomed a constructive and open exchange of information on the current economic BIS Review 109/2009 7 
situation and structural reforms with other bodies and institutions at the European level. The outlook for fiscal policy plays a key role in our projections for economic activity and our assessment of risks to price stability. In the same way, because our policy decisions are exclusively based on our assessment of risks to price stability, our responses can be predicted by fiscal authorities. The channels for the exchange of information between fiscal and monetary authorities are also well developed. But there cannot and will not be any pre-commitment to a particular course of monetary policy action. This would undermine the ECB’s independence and therefore violate our mandate.  From a fiscal policy point of view, it should be noted that although the exit from monetary measures will be uniform across the euro area, it is likely to have asymmetric fiscal impacts given the current substantial heterogeneity of fiscal positions. A potential increase in market interest rates will have a much stronger impact on highly indebted countries, in particular those with outstanding government bonds with short maturities. The need for fiscal flexibility under a single monetary policy places a clear premium on timely and credible fiscal consolidation in all euro area member countries. Conclusion  To conclude, in response to the crisis, governments and central banks across the globe have taken immediate and unprecedented measures. Governments have implemented measures to rescue the banking sector and stimulate the economy. Central banks have lowered rates to very low levels in response to receding inflationary pressures and risks; and they have provided ample liquidity to the banking system, so as to support the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The key questions are when and how to phase out these measures once the overall situation starts to return to normal.  This is the most challenging task for both governments and central banks. But I am confident that the ECB’s broad-based monetary policy strategy, which has shown itself to be robust and forward-looking, will continue to serve us well in handling this challenge. The fact that our risk assessment is rooted in both economic and monetary analysis ensures that all relevant information is taken into account.  The crisis is not yet over. The time to exit has not yet come. But I can assure you that we will continue to monitor very closely all developments in the period ahead, in order to be in the best possible position to continue to deliver on our task of maintaining price stability over the medium term, and thereby support the purchasing power of euro area citizens.  8 BIS Review 109/2009

BIS Review 168/2009 1 Masaaki Shirakawa: Macroprudence and the central bank Speech by Mr Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Seminar of the Securities Analysts Association of Japan, Tokyo, 22 December 2009. *      *      * Introduction It is my honor to speak today at the Securities Analysts Association of Japan. I believe that most of you here today have been directly or indirectly involved in the securities market, and that, needless to say, efforts by many related parties are essential for the sound growth of the securities market. One critical element of such efforts is the expert provision of securities analysis, and in this, securities analysts have been playing an important role. The Securities Analysts Association of Japan was established in 1962 in order to train such securities analysts, and since then has consistently and greatly contributed to the development of Japan’s securities market. So let me start by expressing herewith my sincere respect for the Association’s many years of effort. Sparked by the recent global financial crisis, there have been active discussions on how to prevent a recurrence of such a crisis. Those discussions cover securities market as well as financial markets more generally and the financial system. Last week, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), for example, announced a package of proposals on capital adequacy rules and liquidity regulations and made this available for consultation until mid-April 2010.1 Given that the recent crisis originated in the United States and Europe, there appear to be some mixed feelings at Japanese financial institutions about the discussions in progress. However, any instability in the global financial system inevitably affects Japanese financial institutions. Moreover, just as one of the causes of the recent crisis was that concerned parties in the United States and Europe had not sufficiently learned the lessons from the bubble and financial crisis in Japan and the Asian financial crisis, so Japanese financial institutions might face similar problems in the future if they fail to sufficiently learn the lessons from the recent financial crisis in the United States and Europe. For this reason, it is important for Japanese financial institutions to actively take part in these discussions. Because discussions revolve around a large number of issues, it is difficult to summarize them in a few simple words. However, when it comes to lessons from the crisis and measures to prevent a recurrence, the most important keywords in my view are “liquidity” and “macroprudence.” Against this background, today I would like to focus on the role of “macroprudence” and discuss initiatives by the Bank as well as efforts that private market participants and public authorities should make to ensure the stability of the financial system.2                                                  1  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, “Strengthening the Resilience of the Banking Sector” and “International Framework for Liquidity Risk Measurement, Standards and Monitoring,” Consultative Documents, December 2009. 2  On the importance of the concept of liquidity in discussing the causes of and policy responses to the recent crisis, see Shirakawa, M., “Liquidity” and “Payment and Settlement Systems”, speech given at the Center for Advanced Research in Finance, The University of Tokyo, November 2008, and Borio, C., “Ten Propositions about Liquidity Crises,” BIS Working Papers, No. 293, November 2009. 
2 BIS Review 168/2009 I. Microprudence and macroprudence I should start with an explanation of the concept of “macroprudence,” but in order to do so, it is useful to first explain the concept of “microprudence,” with which it contrasts. It could be said that microprudence describes the conventional ideas behind the policy approach to ensure financial system stability. Simplifying somewhat, microprudence consists of the idea that if the management of individual financial institutions is sound, the financial system, which is the aggregate of individual financial institutions, should be stable, and regulations and supervision should therefore focus on realizing soundness at such micro level. On the other hand, the idea underlying the concept of macroprudence is that stability of the financial system cannot be achieved solely by such micro-level efforts, and that it is necessary to assess risks in the financial system as a whole by taking account of the interconnectedness of economic activities, financial markets, and the behavior of financial institutions, and to take conscious steps to base institutional design and policy responses on such assessments. As I will discuss in detail later, relying on only one of the two approaches is not sufficient to ensure financial system stability. Rather, both approaches are necessary, and one of the key lessons from the recent global financial crisis is that we need to pay greater heed to the approach that incorporates what the term “macroprudence” seeks to capture. In order to see what this means specifically, let us consider the background of the recent financial crisis. Background of the global financial crisis The recent financial crisis may have reached a global scale and involved new financial products and players, but essentially it is a classic example of the rise and collapse of an economic bubble.3 In the period preceding the recent crisis, especially around the mid-2000s, the United States and some European economies experienced a large-scale credit bubble. It was the bursting of that credit bubble that triggered the financial crisis, which was further aggravated by the failure of Lehman Brothers in the autumn of 2008. During the bubble period, risk-taking was excessive. Looking at the behavior of financial institutions, for example, this involved the accumulation of excessive leverage and maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities. Typically, excessive leverage is taken to refer to an increase in debt beyond a point where there is an appropriate balance between capital and debt. More generally, however, excessive leverage can be taken to mean excessive risk-taking, including off-balance transactions, relative to the capital base. At a time of financial crisis, excessive leverage will show itself in capital shortages and solvency problems suffered by financial institutions. On the other hand, the term “maturity mismatch” refers to the financing of long-term assets using short-term debt, and in the run-up to the recent financial crisis, there was a considerable increase in such mismatches. A typical example of this is structured investment vehicles (SIVs). These SIVs invested in medium- to long-term securitized products related to subprime mortgages and raised funds by issuing short-term asset-backed commercial papers with those securitized products as underlying assets. However, once some kind of a shock occurs, funding becomes difficult, and such liquidity risks materialize not only in terms of the domestic currency but also in terms of foreign currencies. In the recent global financial crisis, apart from the United States, U.S. dollar liquidity risk was particularly serious for European financial institutions and, as you will know, Japanese financial institutions, too, faced shortages of U.S. dollar funds from the autumn of 2008 through the beginning of 2009. Once there is a liquidity shortage, financial institutions are forced to sell their assets, resulting in a fall in asset prices, and, for financial institutions as a whole, further intensifies liquidity shortages. Thus, during the financial crisis, the                                                  3  The extent of the financial crisis, however, has differed across regions, and financial systems in Asia, including Japan’s, have proved to be relatively robust. For details, see Shirakawa, M., “Reforming the Framework of Financial Regulation and Supervision: An International and Asian Perspective,” speech given at the Bank Negara Malaysia – Bank for International Settlements High Level Seminar in Malaysia, December 2009. 
BIS Review 168/2009 3 negative spiral intensified as capital shortages and liquidity shortages mutually affected each other. Responses based on microprudence Crises – as I just discussed – appear in the shape of capital and liquidity shortages suffered by financial institutions. Therefore, a natural regulatory and supervisory approach to prevent the recurrence of a crisis is to sufficiently raise the minimum levels of required capital and liquidity financial institutions should hold. This approach focuses on reducing the possibility that individual financial institutions fail and could therefore be described as a response based on microprudence. With regard to capital shortages suffered by financial institutions, the recent crisis revealed a variety of issues. One of these is that the most remarkable increase in leverage took place not in the traditional banking business but outside the banking business. For example, financial institutions held securitized products on their trading books, for which risk weightings under capital adequacy regulations are small, although they later turned out to be highly risky financial products. While the size of trading books was less than 10 percent of total assets for Japanese financial institutions, for some financial institutions in the United States and Europe, it reached about 40 percent. Consequently, when risk-asset based capital ratios were used as a yardstick, major financial institutions’ leverage, at least superficially, did not seem that excessive, and their capital bases appeared sufficient. Investments in securitized products by major financial institutions were carried out through SIVs they had set up, and the funding for these SIVs was provided through credit from their parent financial institutions. As a result, as later revealed, risks were shouldered by the parent financial institutions themselves. In a case such as this, the necessary regulatory and supervisory response would have been to accurately gauge the risks carried by financial institutions and the necessary capital, and to require individual financial institutions to hold more capital. Can problems be solved through microprudence alone? Such regulatory and supervisory responses based on microprudence are necessary and their importance should not be underestimated. As I will explain in detail later, the Bank also conducts on-site examinations and off-site monitoring of financial institutions, carrying out various examinations of financial institutions’ capital, liquidity, and risk management, and giving necessary advice. However, I believe that the recent global financial crisis has shown that it is difficult to achieve financial system stability and to contribute to the sustainable growth of the economy, which is the ultimate aim of financial system stability, relying only on such regulation and supervision based on microprudential principles. The first reason is that without considering the relationship between economic and financial activities, it is essentially impossible to determine the optimal level of capital and liquidity requirements. If absolute priority is given to financial system stability, then capital and liquidity requirements inevitably have to be raised significantly, but the inherent role expected of financial institutions is to engage in leveraging and maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities. Financial institutions carry out financial intermediary functions with a certain amount of capital, raising funds with short-term debt instruments and investing in long-term assets, and provide value added through the provision of liquidity and settlement services. If financial institutions cannot properly fulfill their financial functions, the economy will not grow. Of course, in reality, a capital adequacy ratio of 100 percent is not required, but as highlighted here, conventional regulation and supervision has also in fact been based on some sort of macroeconomic assessment of the relationship between the financial system and economic activity as well as the interaction between financial systems. However, I believe that efforts to take such a macroeconomic perspective into account in a more systematic manner have been insufficient. 
4 BIS Review 168/2009 The second reason why I think microprudence alone is insufficient is that financial institutions’ incentives are greatly affected by macroeconomic factors. On this point, I recall the famous remark made before the surfacing of the subprime mortgage problem by the then CEO of a major financial institution that “while the music is playing, you have to dance.” If, in the future, benign economic conditions similar to that time, namely high economic growth, low inflation, low interest rates, and low market volatility continue for a long time, would managers of financial institutions and investors choose different management and investment strategies? Moreover, even if one were to choose a different strategy oneself, what strategy would one expect competitors to take? Following this line of reasoning, it becomes clear that there will always be someone who takes on the risks. Ultimately, the risks in the financial system as a whole are affected not only by micro-level incentives but to a great extent also by macro-level incentives, that is, the economic and financial environment. If we follow this line of reasoning, in order to ensure the stability of the financial system, microprudence, which secures the soundness of individual financial institutions, and macroprudence, which pays attention to risks to the financial system as a whole, are both equally necessary. II. Macroprudential perspectives There are various ways in which to assess risks in the financial system as a whole from a macroprudential perspective, that is, from a perspective that pays attention to the interconnectedness between economic activity, financial markets, and financial institutions’ behavior. Recently, two perspectives or “dimensions” have been recognized as important: the first concerns the cross-sectional risk at a particular point in time, while the second concerns the evolution of risk in the future. The cross-sectional dimension The “cross-sectional dimension” concerns risks in the financial system as a whole at a particular point in time and particularly focuses on the interconnectedness of the risks of each financial institution’s portfolio and financial products. When the loans and investments of a financial institution are concentrated in a specific industry, the financial institution assumes a large risk. The concentration of loans to the real estate industry is a classic example. And what goes for a specific financial institution goes also for the financial system as a whole. Even if the exposure of each individual financial institution is not concentrated in a specific industry, if many financial institutions are taking similar positions, the financial system as a whole assumes a large risk. If there is a shock that affects the value of a specific type of exposure, for example, the value of real estate, financial institutions will try to reduce their exposure to such assets all at the same time, but when all financial institutions take the same action, such a reduction of exposure will be difficult. Under these circumstances, market liquidity of the assets in question and funding liquidity decline significantly, and that will further exacerbate losses. Such herding behavior is called “crowded trade” and can arise for a variety of reasons. While it typically arises through a convergence of market participants’ view of economic prospects, it can also be spurred by a convergence of risk management methods. As financial techniques advance, the management of risk also becomes more complicated. In this situation, the incentive for financial institutions that do not have sufficient resources to develop their own risk management methods to adopt the risk management methods developed by other financial institutions increases. When this kind of situation becomes widespread, not only does financial institutions’ exposure to types of assets become similar, but market swings also become volatile as the timing of transactions becomes more synchronized. 
BIS Review 168/2009 5 The time dimension The second macroprudential dimension, the “time dimension,” concerns dynamic changes in risks, focusing on how risks inherent in the financial system change over time. In the run-up to a crisis, as seen in the period prior to the recent crisis, benign economic conditions continue for some time, economic actors become too optimistic in their risk assessment, and their risk tolerance increases. As a result, as economic actors’ risk-taking stance becomes more aggressive, asset prices rise and leverage increases, leading to even more aggressive risk-taking stances. Our understanding of such endogenous changes in the risk-taking stance, that is, the risk-taking channel, is extremely limited. What is clear, however, is that such changes are greatly influenced by the economic and financial environment, as I mentioned earlier. Financial imbalances that accumulate in the process of risk-taking cannot be sustained indefinitely and eventually balance sheet adjustments will take place. Such adjustments proceed gradually in the beginning. However, triggered by some kind of a shock, a crisis will emerge in the form of funding liquidity shortages and become more severe as confidence among market participants in each other collapses. This phenomenon that the profit-seeking behavior of financial institutions amplifies the financial and economic cycle is referred to as “procyclicality” and is another important dimension of assessment apart from the aforementioned cross-sectional network perspective. III. Approaches taking account of macroprudence With the importance of macroprudence having been recognized, what sort of approaches should central banks and regulatory and supervisory authorities take to protect the stability of the financial system? Monetary policy First, it is necessary for the central bank to take a macroprudential perspective in the conduct of monetary policy. Needless to say, the purpose of monetary policy is to contribute to sustainable growth through price stability. Looking back at price developments in the past quarter century, inflation gradually declined and it can be said that many central banks have been successful in terms of achieving price stability. However, in terms of financial system stability, the frequency of bubbles and financial crises has increased in the past quarter century, with major episodes including Japan’s financial crisis following the burst of the bubble, the East Asian financial crisis, the credit bubble in the United States and Europe, and the recent global financial crisis. Moreover, ironically, all these bubbles arose in an environment of low inflation. While the causes of bubbles are complex, one major cause in all cases has been the emergence of a sense, amid continued benign economic conditions of high growth, low inflation, and low interest rates, that liquidity is always available at the drop of a hat. While I do not think that accommodative monetary conditions alone can lead to a bubble, it seems that it also cannot be denied that expectations of a prolonged accommodative monetary environment lead to excessive leverage and maturity mismatches, thereby accelerating the generation of a bubble. Price stability is an extremely important policy objective for a central bank, but if a central bank conducts monetary policy by just watching short-term price developments, this may induce large economic fluctuations and result in harming price stability in the medium- to long-term. Although a frequently used phrase in this context is that there is “a trade-off between price stability and financial system stability,” this should in fact be understood in the sense that the true trade-off lies between “current economic stability and future economic stability.” The intensified discussions following the recent financial crisis on the appropriate monetary policy framework, including discussions in countries that have adopted inflation targeting, reflect these considerations. Therefore, in the conduct of monetary policy, it is necessary to get into the habit of assessing the economy both through the lens of price developments and through the lens of financial 
6 BIS Review 168/2009 imbalances. This is exactly what the Bank of Japan with its assessment of monetary policy from “two perspectives” aims at. Financial supervision based on risk assessment of the financial system as a whole Second, I would like to emphasize the importance of proper supervision. The experience of the recent crisis reconfirmed that the behavior of financial institutions sometimes becomes excessive, and proper supervision is necessary to prevent that from happening. In this context, it is of course important for supervisory authorities to assess the soundness of individual financial institutions by focusing on risks unique to those financial institutions and to provide the appropriate supervision. In addition, it is also important to assess, while noting the “dimensions” I have explained, the risk in the financial system as a whole and utilize the information gained to conduct supervision of individual institutions. This may be a typical example of “easier said than done,” but it represents an unavoidable challenge. Designing financial regulation and supervision The third point concerns the design of financial regulation and supervision taking account of a macroprudential perspective. Various discussions on this issue are going on at the moment and one of them focuses on reviewing capital adequacy requirements from the perspective of mitigating procyclicality. Concerning capital adequacy ratios for banks, one issue that has been identified is the procyclicality caused by the decrease in credit risk during an economic boom and the increase in credit risk during a recession, but profits and losses related to financial market transactions show a similar procyclical tendency. When benign financial and economic conditions continue for a certain period, the market risk being estimated by using data obtained during that period is likely to underestimate the actual size of the risk. As a result, during an economic boom, financial institutions lend aggressively as their capital bases increase due to high profits, leading to further increases in lending through, for example, a further rise in asset prices. Similarly, the reverse occurs during a recession. Discussions are therefore underway on how to mitigate such procyclicality, with ideas including the lengthening of the period assets are included in risk accounting to avoid excessive fluctuation in risk-weighted assets and whether to introduce a framework for countercyclical capital buffers. The underlying idea of such a framework is to implement capital adequacy rules in a countercyclical manner by requiring financial institutions to build up capital when economic conditions are favorable, which could then be drawn down when economic conditions deteriorate. I believe that proposals to use capital adequacy regulations to mitigate procyclicality and reinforce capital bases go in the right direction and are likely to contribute to financial system stability. However, from a macroeconomic perspective, it must be avoided that the strengthening of regulations impairs economic stability. For this reason, it is important to secure flexibility, for example, in the procedure and timing of the implementation of new capital adequacy rules by taking financial and economic conditions in countries around the world into account. In this regard, as also articulated in the consultative proposals for the review of rules recently released by the Basel Committee, the new rules should be implemented once financial conditions have improved and economic recovery is ensured. The accounting system The accounting system is also an element affecting the behavior of financial institutions in addition to monetary policy and financial regulation and supervision. The accounting system directly affects the assessment and profitability of assets held by financial institutions. For instance, from autumn 2008, as the functioning of markets declined, prices of securitized products fell all at once, leading to concerns about capital shortages at financial institutions. This further paralyzed market functioning and intensified the downward 
BIS Review 168/2009 7 spiral. This course of events illustrated once more that the method of assessing financial products and the accounting system overall affect financial institutions’ behavior and the financial system. Therefore, various international discussions are taking place to design a system in the field of accounting that could contribute to financial system stability. For example, it was shown that when market liquidity appeared to have dried up, it was possible to value financial assets at prices calculated by models. There are also proposals regarding a revision of loan loss provisions. The reason is that current accrual basis accounting methods tend to reinforce procyclicality as banks’ profits are rapidly squeezed when economic conditions deteriorate because banks have to increase provisions. While provisioning methods on the basis of expected losses, which allow for earlier recognition of future losses, are currently being discussed, my view is that it is necessary to consider such proposals from a variety of aspects, such as to what degree they would fulfill the intended goal of mitigating procyclicality, whether they can be put into practice, and whether they will be able to ensure transparency, which after all is the primary role of accounting. IV. The role of the Bank of Japan Having explained the role of macroprudence, I would now like to explain the role of the Bank in ensuring stability of the financial system. I would like to emphasize the following five points in particular. The first point is that the Bank of Japan not only aims at price stability but also financial system stability. The Bank of Japan Act clearly stipulates that one of the Bank’s institutional objectives is “to ensure smooth settlement of funds among banks and other financial institutions, thereby contributing to the maintenance of stability of the financial system.” The fact that the Bank of Japan during the recent financial crisis decided to implement measures that are extraordinary for a central bank, such as the purchase of stocks held by financial institutions and the provision of subordinated loans, was ultimately to achieve the objective stipulated in the Bank of Japan Act. The second point is that the Bank plays the role of “lender of last resort.” The Bank of Japan is “the bank of banks” and can contribute to ensuring financial system stability by providing funds as the lender of last resort when it judges this to be necessary to prevent the materialization of systemic risk. To avoid that the provision of funds gives rise to moral hazard, the Bank has clarified its basic thinking in the form of the so-called “four principles for special loans.” The third point is that the Bank collects various types of information from financial institutions to secure the objective of ensuring the stability of the financial system. While macroprudence is important, as a prerequisite for that, microprudence is also critical. As long as the Bank extends loans to financial institutions as the “lender of last resort,” it needs to have sufficient knowledge of financial institutions’ business performance and the quality of their assets. For this reason, the Bank of Japan Act grants the Bank the right to conduct on-site examinations of financial institutions that have deposit accounts with the Bank. Of course, it is conceivable that a situation arises where, by the time a financial institution comes to the Bank, it is already too late. Therefore, in conducting on-site examinations, the Bank not only carries out inspections but also provides various kinds of advice and guidance when the need arises. In addition to conducting such on-site examinations, the Bank also strives to gauge the business performance and risk management, such as the liquidity management, of a wide range of financial institutions, including securities companies, through daily off-site monitoring. At a time that financial markets are undergoing substantial changes, it is important to have a channel for obtaining information directly from financial institutions – something that was strongly reaffirmed in the phase from the autumn of 2008 onward. The fourth point is that the Bank conducts risk assessments of the financial system as a whole. The Bank analyzes and assesses the financial system as a whole from a macroprudential perspective by making use of information from individual financial 
8 BIS Review 168/2009 institutions as well as information obtained through its daily monetary policy operations and operation of the payment and settlement system. At the same time, the Bank strives to use the macro-assessment obtained in this way to inform its on-site examinations and off-site monitoring. However, although everyone would agree that integrating macro and micro perspectives is an important task, to do this properly, research is indispensable. Because they are charged with the conduct of monetary policy, the necessary organizational culture to assess the economic situation based on macroeconomic analyses is well established within central banks. As for us at the Bank of Japan, we will continue to attach great importance to the information and insights we gather through on-site examinations, off-site monitoring, and the Bank’s banking business, and to strive to accurately gauge the risks to the financial system as a whole through our macroeconomic analyses and research activities. The fifth point is that the Bank is participating in the international discussions on regulation and supervision and is engaged in the review of such regulation and supervision. Reflecting the globalization of finance, there is a growing tendency for the broad framework of financial regulation and supervision to be determined in international discussions. The Bank, together with the Financial Services Agency (FSA), has been taking part in discussions on financial regulatory and supervisory reform at various international forums such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board, and I myself have been attending many of those forums. Given that a robust global financial system is in the common interest of all countries, I believe it is critical for each country to contribute to the construction of internationally consistent rules and to establish a regulatory and supervisory framework that properly reflects differences between countries, such as in their financial structure. The Bank will continue to make contributions in these areas. When comparing systems to ensure financial system stability immediately before the recent crisis from a central bank’s point of view, countries can be divided into two groups. In one, which includes the United States, Italy, the Netherlands, and many Asian countries, regulation and supervision was carried out by the central bank, either alone or in cooperation with other authorities. In the other group, which includes the United Kingdom and Australia, the central bank was not involved in regulation and supervision. Japan could be regarded as falling in between these two groups: the Bank of Japan does not have regulatory authority over financial institutions, but, as mentioned earlier, based on provisions in the Bank of Japan Act, it conducts on-site examinations of financial institutions and provides various kinds of advice and guidance when the need arises. Financial regulatory and supervisory systems around the world have been decided upon reflecting differences in countries’ financial structure, stage of economic development, and historical background, and thus there is no uniform set-up that is correct for all countries. Be that as it may, the recent crisis has shown clearly that it is indispensable for central banks to be involved in one form or another in ensuring the stability of the financial system and that central banks should play a significant role in the area of macroprudential supervision. Here in Japan, we have a system where the FSA, which is in charge of financial administration dealing with regulation and supervision, and the Bank of Japan, which is the central bank, cooperate with each other and each fulfills its respective functions to ensure the stability of the financial system. While it seems fair to say that Japan’s financial system has remained relatively stable compared with those of the United States and Europe during the recent crisis, the Bank will, in cooperation with the FSA, continue to strive to ensure the stability of the financial system. Closing remarks In closing, I would like to say a few words about the importance of information infrastructure in ensuring financial system stability. In order to analyze the financial system as a whole, it is essential to have information that is accessible to investors and other market participants. On this point, disclosure regarding risks inherent in individual financial institutions and specific 
BIS Review 168/2009 9 financial products is critical. In addition, from a macroprudential perspective the importance of statistics that cover financial markets as a whole needs to be underscored. At the beginning, I pointed out as one of the causes of the recent global financial crisis the widening of maturity mismatches at financial institutions with regard to liquidity and the lack of a habit to check such developments on a macro basis. Although, with the crisis having erupted, we now have the benefit of hindsight, the locational banking statistics released quarterly by the Bank for International Settlements do show a remarkable increase in U.S. dollar maturity mismatches for financial institutions from advanced economies, and particularly European economies, in recent years.4 Moreover, although the experience of past bubbles clearly shows that fluctuations in real estate prices have a great impact on the financial system, in Japan, for example, little price information on real estate transactions has been gathered and the statistics in this field are far from satisfactory. Although the compilation of such statistics places a burden on those providing the data, such data represents one critical part of the information necessary to ensure the stability of the financial system. While I have pointed out the importance of disclosure information and statistics concerning financial institutions and financial products, it goes without saying that what is ultimately required is a proper analysis based on such information. During the recent crisis, trust in credit rating information declined. Regarding credit ratings, various problems have been highlighted.5 But while these are indeed important issues, it would not be very balanced to criticize only credit ratings. I mentioned that when thinking about macroprudence, two dimensions are important, that is, the cross-sectional dimension and the time dimension, but to properly reflect these two dimensions in the analysis of securities seems like a particularly difficult challenge. However, if this challenge is not addressed, the value of micro analysis also declines. At any rate, it goes without saying that the role played by securities analysts, who are experts in this kind of analysis, is substantial. One major element that underpins liquidity in financial markets is variety, and in that regard the role of securities analysts who provide variety of analysis based on their independent judgment is quite important. Information is given meaning through the knowledge, experience, and philosophy of experts, and in this regard, too, we have high hopes and expectations of securities analysts. Thank you.                                                  4  For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see the March 2009 issue of the Financial Markets Report. 5  See, for example, “Stocktaking on the Use of Credit Ratings” by the Joint Forum under the aegis of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, June 2009. 
BIS Review 168/2009 1 Ivan Iskrov: Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory capacity of the financial regulators Opening remarks by Mr Ivan Iskrov, Governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, at the official opening ceremony of the Twinning Project “Strengthening the Regulatory and Supervisory Capacity of the Financial Regulators”, Podgorica, Montenegro, 15 December 2009. *      *      * Dear Twinning Partners,  Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, We have gathered here to start the Twinning Project “Strengthening the Regulatory and Supervisory Capacity of the Financial Regulators” funded by the European Union. It is my pleasure and privilege as the Governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, which is the lead institution managing this project, to express on behalf of the management of the BNB our strong commitment to work with the twinning partners during the next 18 months to achieve the targeted results. In times of trouble when all financial supervisors are under severe pressure and when many projects in the financial sector tendered by the European Commission failed to find interest among EU member states, we are committing our resources, our best experts, expertise and knowledge to this project. The Republic of Bulgaria supports the European prospects for the Western Balkans, and Montenegro in particular. We strongly believe that our joint work will contribute to the country’s progress on the path of European integration.  It is by all means a very ambitious project that includes more than 55 activities and benchmarks, more than 10 directives to be transposed, several legal acts to be prepared, and many internal procedures to be created for a better supervision that complies with the international best practices.  This project comes at a very specific moment for the global financial sector. It aims to create conditions for long term economic stability and growth by strengthening the regulatory and supervisory frameworks of the capital and financial markets and by improving the institutional and regulatory capacities of the financial sector regulators to supervise financial markets and institutions in line with the EU acquis. Therefore, the objectives of the Twinning Project are fully in line with the main lesson from the crisis – that stability and growth cannot be maintained without a stable and well functioning financial sector.  First, let me present our consortium and the project team. The consortium unites the experience of a Еurosystem central bank (De Netherlandsche Bank) – with a proven track record of successful technical assistance projects for accession country institutions – together with the expertise of the Bulgarian National Bank and the Financial Supervision Commission, both having the most recent and relevant experience in EU harmonization in a new Member State. This combination of experience is further strengthened by the long-standing and successful cooperation between the consortium members. The advantage of having a consortium is that it offers larger experience and a broader pull of experts from the twinning partner institutions. The three consortium members have completed many successful twinning projects in the financial sector and have gained a sound project management capacity.  We have strongly committed ourselves to this project for various reasons. We are encouraged by the progress achieved by the financial supervision authorities in Montenegro in bringing financial sector regulation closer to the EU requirements. Also, there are many signs of already built cooperation with the Montenegrin authorities that need further strengthening. Bulgaria, the Netherlands and Montenegro are in the same IMF constituency 
2 BIS Review 168/2009 which has created good mutual knowledge of their economies and fostered long-term cooperation on financial issues. We consider our experience relevant to Montenegro not only because of the scale of the economy, but also because of the similarities of the supervisory structures. In the accession process we have learnt several major lessons. Bulgaria did not ask for any transitional periods or derogations concerning the banking sector acquis communautaire. Furthermore, all EU directives in this sector were transposed in time and most of them long before the deadlines. This approach has turned to be a success since the early adoption of the EU rules in financial supervision contributed to the smooth functioning of the financial market and fostered the stability of the financial system. One of the main keys to the smooth transition in the accession process is the cooperation between the institutions involved in financial regulation and supervision. The respect for the independence of financial supervision authorities and the cooperation between them is an important indicator for the preparedness for EU accession. I would like to emphasise in particular the requirement for institutional financial and personal independence of the central bank as stipulated in article 130 of the Lisbon Treaty.  Let me now turn to the challenges ahead of our project. First of all, the EU response to the crisis envisages fundamental changes in both the legal and institutional frameworks of financial regulation. Most of the EU directives and regulations are currently being changed. (Mr. Simeonov will talk about these later) This is a challenge for our project, and I would like to suggest that we take into consideration the latest EU acquis communautaire in our joint work. That is why we included in our team the experts who are members of the EU committees and working groups in the area of financial supervision, including the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, Economic and Financial Committee, Financial Services Committee, Committee of European Securities Regulators, where all these novelties are constructed. This will help the project to benefit from the most recent developments in the EU financial supervision policies and legal framework. The other challenge is related with the ongoing crisis which calls for an immediate response from the national authorities and is of utmost importance. Therefore, I believe we have to focus our activities as much as possible on helping the Montenegrin authorities in addressing the challenges of the crisis. Last but not least, our Project will be implemented by 7 authorities – three of them from EU member states and four from the beneficiary country. The strong commitment and cooperation between the partners is a prerequisite for our success. I would like to thank our twinning partners for the cooperation we have already established, owing to which this project came to its successful start and will further develop to its ultimate success. I would also like to thank in particular the Central Bank of Montenegro, for providing the facilities and hosting our resident twinning advisor for the next 18 months. I wish success to all of you and to our joint project. 
BIS Review 168/2009 1 Njuguna Ndung’u: Developments in the Kenyan domestic bond market Remarks by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, during the Launch of the Automated Trading System (ATS) for Treasury bonds, Nairobi Stock Exchange, Nairobi, 7 December 2009. *      *      * The Chairman of the Nairobi Stock Exchange, Mr. Eddy Njoroge, The Chief Executive Officer, Capital Markets Authority, Mrs. Stella Kilonzo, The Chief Executive Officer, Nairobi Stock Exchange, Mr. Peter Mwangi, The Chief Executive Officer, Central Depository and Settlement Corporation, Mrs. Rose Mambo, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen. Good Morning. It gives me great pleasure to be with you this morning at the official launch of he Automated Trading System (ATS) for Treasury bonds. This indeed is a major milestone in the development of domestic bond market. 1. Market reforms The Central Bank of Kenya and other stakeholders have so far undertaken significant reforms in the domestic bond market. These initiatives, which include the introduction of the ATS, are aimed at enhancing the safety and efficiency in the processing of secondary trading of Government securities as ell as other securities among other market activities. 2. The ATS project The ATS project was initiated by the Central Bank of Kenya, the Nairobi Stock Exchange and the Capital Markets Authority. The two institutions constituted Technical Committee to oversee the automation of trading of Treasury bonds through the NSE. The main objective of this initiative was to make bonds trading secure, efficient and a vibrant market. The expected improvement in market activity will also improve market liquidity and encourage more investors to participate in the bond market. The Technical Committee, in consultation with key stakeholders, has developed operating rules and guidelines for the proposed automated trading of bonds through the NSE; an integrated operating system; an interface that links the Central Bank’s CDS Registry and KEPSS (RTGS) payments system with the NSE’s ATS trading platform to facilitate automated trading, settlement and delivery of bonds on a Delivery versus Payment (DvP) basis. 3. Main highlights of the ATS The following are the main highlights of the system: i. CBK remains the Registry for Government of Kenya securities. ii. Trading of Treasury bonds continues to take place at the NSE, and hence does not cater for Over the Counter (OTC) trading. 
2 BIS Review 168/2009 iii. Stock brokers will continue to exercise their role as agents of the investors in placing sale and buy trade orders. iv. Cash settlement of all trades through this system will take place through the Kenya Electronic Payment and Settlement System (KEPSS) also known as Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) domiciled at the Central Bank of Kenya. v. The trading process will be premised on a Delivery versus Payment (DvP) arrangement. vi. Transactions Settlement Cycle will be at T+3, but parties can opt to shorten this period. It is our sincere hope and expectation that the roll out of automated trading for Treasury bonds, together with the recent automation of corporate bond trading, will mark the turning point for trading of Fixed Income Securities at the Bourse. This also comes at a time when re-opening of benchmark bonds has been very successful, creating adequate liquidity around each bond. This fits in very well with the roadmap for capital markets development as envisaged in Vision 2030. 4. Recent trading developments I am pleased to note that since the roll out of this new system on 27th November, 2009, the market has witnessed renewed interest and enthusiasm from bond traders. As of today, we have recorded 11 completed trades totaling Kes.1.72 billion and 16 trades totaling to Kes.2.235 billion are at various stages of processing. As we successfully move away from the manual/open outcry method of trading in Treasury bonds to the new system, we expect to see more activity in this segment of the market. We trust that market players will carry out their functions professionally, observing the highest standards of integrity and transparency so that the investing public can reap full benefits arising from the same. We at the Central Bank will continue to review the operations of the system and related processes to ensure that it meets the expectations of investors and conforms to best practice in the market. 5. Appreciation Finally, may I take this opportunity to thank all stakeholders and members of the ATS Technical Committee for working tirelessly to ensure that the project succeeds. Thank you all for your attention. 
BIS Review 168/2009 1 Anna Maria Tarantola: Supervision of foreign banks in Italy Remarks by Ms Anna Maria Tarantola, Deputy Director General of the Bank of Italy, at the 25th Anniversary of the Foundation of the Association of Foreign Banks in Italy, Milan, 20 November 2009. *      *      * 1. Introduction I am happy to participate in this seminar marking the quarter century since the foundation of the Association of Foreign Banks in Italy. I witnessed the beginning of the association with the encouragement of Guido Rosa, Vittorio Foroni Lo Faro and Remigio Saracino, who were always ready to bring up the problems that foreign banks, mainly present with branches back then, encountered in Italy. These twenty-five intense years have seen a succession of phases of growth and recession, enormous changes in finance and the real economy, the opening up of national markets, the steady integration of the main financial systems and the introduction of the euro. The last two years have been particularly difficult, marked by a deep and far-reaching crisis that, in the financial sector, has made evident distorted incentives, opportunistic behaviour and widespread vulnerabilities which often had not been fully perceived. The crisis now seems to be loosening its grip. The main international institutions agree, on the basis of the latest cyclical indicators, that economic activity has stopped contracting; the improvement in the indicators of consumer and business confidence suggest the coming months will bring a recovery, though a slow one. The state of the financial system has also improved; the wholesale and retail markets, fundamental for the procurement of funds and the exchange of financial products, appear to be gradually getting back into gear. But we are far from the pre-crisis levels of output and employment. In many countries, including Italy, the magnitude of the crisis and its effects on the real economy are such that years of rapid growth will be needed to return to those levels. The weak international recovery we are seeing is mainly driven by the support measures put in place by the governments of the main countries. The expansion is proceeding at a faster pace in the emerging countries, in particular those of Asia, which have shown a greater capacity to resist and react – perhaps in part because of the lessons learned in the crisis at the end of the last millennium. Hopefully, careful and consistent economic policies will enable this wave of recovery to extend fully to the advanced economies and Italy. In the financial field, the major items on the agenda are two: to swiftly put into place a new regulatory and supervisory framework that remedies the deficiencies brought out by the crisis, and to make the financial system fully operational again so as to ensure, in Italy as elsewhere, the flow of resources needed to accompany and sustain the economic recovery. The process of stabilizing and strengthening the financial system and rewriting the rules is proceeding according to the calendar set by the leaders of the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The set of reforms, once enacted, should increase the financial system’s resilience to shocks, encourage the development of models for intermediation oriented to long-term results, and eliminate the incentives for excessive risk-taking by stimulating more far-sighted behaviour based on the sound and prudent management of intermediaries.  Concerns that the banking system will be unable to provide sufficient support to the economy are particularly strong in Italy, not least because of the financial structure of our small and medium-sized enterprises, heavily dependent on bank credit and historically skewed towards short-term debt. The crisis can – and must – be an opportunity for resolute action to 
2 BIS Review 168/2009 rebalance the structure of firms’ liabilities. In their selection activity, banks must be able to assess firms’ long-term growth potential, to assist them in their development. In this context, the contribution of foreign banks can be significant, especially in some segments of the economy. In Italy today, the branches and subsidiaries of foreign intermediaries account for one fifth of all bank intermediation, a share comparable to that of many other advanced economies. An analysis of the past is useful not only to identify the contribution that foreign banks have made to their host markets – in terms of competitiveness, innovation and the quality and quantity of services provided – but also to outline their possible future contribution. This has several determinants: the types of foreign intermediaries, their business model, their objectives, their results and the impact on prices.  The Bank of Italy is following these matters closely; indeed, it could not do otherwise. I will therefore retrace some of the stages of the success story of foreign banks’ expanding role in Italy and highlight the difficulties that must be overcome so that this progress may continue to the benefit of the Italian economy, and the implications for the Bank of Italy.  2. Internationalization There are several reasons why a bank may decide to enter foreign markets: i) to take advantage of the host country’s growth potential and thereby tap new profit opportunities; ii) to follow its own customers abroad; and iii) to diversify its activity. A recent survey by the European Central Bank of the drivers of the international expansion of the largest European banking groups highlighted two main factors. Some 80 per cent of the respondents declared that expansion abroad was aimed at exploiting growth opportunities in the host market and thereby increasing profit margins, while 59 per cent cited the need to provide services to their customers operating abroad;1 business diversification was a less important goal. In the past decade the integration of international financial systems has intensified and extended to the banking system. In many countries the number and the market share of foreign intermediaries have grown as a result of the expansion of banking groups’ activities beyond national borders and the increase in cross-border mergers and acquisitions. The process, initially involving the financial markets of the emerging countries, has spread to the mature economies, albeit to a more limited extent.2  In the European Union, cross-border bank mergers and acquisitions have increased in both number and value. Between 2005 and 2007 more than 350 were carried out, largely between intermediaries from different countries. The trend abated in 2008, owing to the international financial crisis, but it did not come to a halt, with cross-border mergers and acquisitions down in number but up in value from the previous year.3  At the end of 2007 branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks accounted for a little less than 30 per cent of total bank assets in the European Union. Foreign banks have a particularly large market share in the United Kingdom, where it exceeds 50 per cent thanks above all to London’s central role in international finance. It is also large in the European Union’s new member countries, in connection with the acquisition of major local banks by foreign intermediaries. In the euro-area countries, foreign banks’ share of total assets averages about 20 per cent. The share of loans granted by non-domestic institutions has doubled in                                                  1  European Central Bank, EU Banking Structures, 2008. 2  Committee on the Global Financial System, Foreign direct investment in the financial sector of emerging market economies, Bank for International Settlements, 2004. 3  European Central Bank, Financial Integration in Europe, 2009. 
BIS Review 168/2009 3 the last ten years, rising from just under 4 to about 8 per cent of outstanding loans to EU residents (from 26 to 37 per cent for bank and financial counterparties). Foreign banks are major players in the economies of central and eastern Europe, where they contributed to the privatization of the banking system after the collapse of communism. In those countries the leading international banks raised the efficiency of the financial system with transfers of know-how and technology, improved the allocation of credit and brought stability after the severe financial crises of the early 1990s. However, the recent financial crisis has revealed the risks deriving from the excessive concentration of the credit markets and their vulnerability to events originating in the foreign banks’ home countries. In the mature economies of Europe, the nature of the benefits and risks generated by the integration of banking systems is similar but their scale is smaller. Within the European Union we have seen a reduction in interest rate differentials and convergence towards the most competitive levels. 3. Foreign banks in Italy I said that foreign banks are spurred to enter a country by the growth prospects of specific market segments in which the host-country’s intermediaries do not enjoy locational advantages or are lagging in adapting their supply. Our own history provides more than one example of this. The number of foreign intermediaries in Italy has risen continually in the last twenty-five years, from just over thirty in the mid-1980s to more than one hundred today. Their market share is significant. In 2007, the latest year for which we have data for an international comparison, their share of total bank assets was 17.4 per cent, higher than the corresponding figures in Germany, France and Spain (11.1, 12.9 and 11.6 per cent, respectively). It declined slightly in the first half of this year, to 16 per cent, owing to the international financial crisis and the exit of some intermediaries from the Italian market. Foreign banks’ reasons for entering Italy have changed over the years. A first substantial inflow dates from the late 1970s and early 1980s, in parallel with the growth in world trade and the business expansion of multinational corporations. Many foreign banks began to operate in Italy through branches, mainly in order to serve prime customers on the spot. Another factor of no small importance was their objective of taking advantage of the administrative constraints then burdening the operations of Italian banks. In particular, foreign intermediaries could exploit their parent banks’ foreign currency funding, which they used to make foreign currency loans to both non-bank customers and Italian banks, and the possibility of raising funds at moderate costs on the interbank market. Foreign banks accounted for about 4 per cent of total assets, with a higher market share for loans to non-bank customers and for commitments and contingent liabilities. The profit margins they achieved on both loans and investments were substantial, especially compared with those obtaining in their home countries. In this first phase, marked by strong regulatory constraints on the activity of Italian banks, foreign intermediaries helped decisively to expand the range of services, especially financial services, offered to customers. On the other hand, their scant presence in retail banking markets limited their contribution to the growth in competition. Starting in the mid-1980s the Italian banking system underwent progressive liberalization and modernization whose milestones were the removal of the ceiling on the growth in bank lending, the abolition of the securities investment requirement and the lifting of the restrictions on branching. All this affected the activity of the foreign banks, which contracted – significantly in several instances – in some business segments. By 1990 their share of total assets had fallen to 2.6 per cent and that of loans to non-bank customers to 3 per cent. 
4 BIS Review 168/2009 In response to these developments, foreign intermediaries moved increasingly into wholesale financial markets, which were relatively backward at the time but with good potential for growth: they quickly expanded their presence in securities business, asset management services, correspondent banking (cash management for customers, as well as hedging and foreign exchange transactions) and investment banking (in particular raising funds directly on the capital market by placing equity and bond issues and syndicated loans). In the mid-1990s, the foreign banks’ off-balance-sheet transactions exceeded 42 per cent of the system’s total, mainly owing to the large volume of forward business in securities and derivatives. Throughout this phase, the most popular type of establishment was still the branch, which was more flexible and better suited to supply policies centred on specific ranges of services geared to a limited time horizon. When, in the 1990s, the European regulatory framework was completed with the institution of freedom of establishment and home country control, a level playing field was created for the activity of local banks and foreign banks and competition intensified further. The creation of a single banking market in Europe drastically altered entry procedures for EC banks, which now had a quicker method of access – simple notification to the Bank of Italy – that obviated the need for endowment funds for their branches. Supervision of the foreign establishments of EU banks was entrusted to the home country authorities, except in respect of liquidity. The process of integration accelerated with the introduction of the single currency, which acted as a catalyst for the main corporate projects of industrial and financial reorganization. Partly as a result of these developments, foreign institutions have entered the Italian market in greater numbers in recent years, and increasingly in traditional banking business, seeking to exploit not only the growth potential of the retail and mid-corporate sectors but also Italian households’ considerable saving capacity. Entry into the retail market was achieved mainly by takeovers of local banks and financial companies, not least to gain the competitive advantage stemming from local roots and close customer relations. Subsidiaries of foreign banks operate as networks of their international groups they belong to; their commercial policies are geared to expansion, to enlarging the network and strengthening links with the product companies of the foreign parents. Between 1990 and 2005, the market share of foreign intermediaries rose from 2.6 to 8 per cent of total assets. It has expanded further since then, to around 16 per cent in the first half of 2009. There has been a substantial increase in foreign intermediaries’ lending to households (Table 2). Operators specializing in mortgage lending and consumer credit using credit scoring techniques have entered the Italian market. This development, which facilitated households’ access to these forms of finance, also led to innovations in the types of contracts,4 longer durations, higher loan ceilings, and a larger percentage of financial risk than the Italian average. In the first half of this year, 15 per cent of the mortgage lending market and 28 per cent of the personal finance market were accounted for by foreign banks, compared with 0.2 and 7.7 per cent in 1990. Their customer deposits have also increased, albeit more slowly than lending, rising from 1 per cent of the total in 1990 to over 9 per cent in 2008. Currently, foreign banks are present in Italy in a wide variety of formats (branches, subsidiaries, significant shareholdings); they occupy a leading role for a broad selection of                                                  4  Casolaro, L., L. Gambacorta, and L. Guiso (2005), “Regulation, formal and informal enforcement and the development of the household loan market. Lesson from Italy”, Bank of Italy Working papers (Temi di discussione) no. 560, September. 
BIS Review 168/2009 5 products ranging from corporate banking services to wholesale market operations and clearing and settlement services, from project finance to asset management and financial advice, and from leasing to traditional banking.  In certain segments, such as depositary bank services, local government financing and consulting, and the structuring and sale of derivative instruments, foreign banks play a major role. Their branches and subsidiaries account for almost a quarter of the total securities held for custody, a share that may increase significantly if and when the sales announced by several large Italian groups go through. It is important that the advantages of the possible economies of scale be passed onto customers and that the services provided be effectively adapted to the needs of Italian operators. The Italian branches of foreign banks have seen their profits suffer as a result of the crisis since their business tends to be concentrated in the investment banking sector, which has borne the brunt of the downturn. Their earnings have become negative. Subsidiaries, on the other hand, have had generally positive results. All of them were profitable in 2008 and in some cases their gross income and gross operating profit increased. These results are particularly important when compared with those of the foreign parent companies, many of which sustained heavy losses and a substantial rise in allocations to provisions. The reason for the better performance of Italian subsidiaries is their focus on retail banking. Cost-cutting measures, including downsizing, also contributed. The differences between the types of business of branches and subsidiaries are reflected in the recent performance of lending by the two categories. In the case of branches, for a long period, and until the summer of 2008, the rate of growth in lending was over 20 per cent, owing to the sharp expansion of syndicated loans to medium-large firms and financial companies; it then progressively contracted, to turn negative by 5.6 per cent in September 2009, as a result of the impact of the crisis on wholesale operations. By contrast, subsidiaries continued to record higher rates of growth than the system average, for lending to both households and firms. Empirical analyses by the Bank of Italy5 indicate that foreign banks have helped to increase customer mobility, particularly in the case of households, and encouraged product innovation. The increased competition led to a drop in interest rates on medium and long-term mortgage loans to households. The annual reduction averaged about 15 basis points over the period 1997–2006 and 18 basis points in the last five years. More recently, the average collateral on medium and long-term loans has also decreased, presumably as a result of rising loan-to-value ratios. The entry of foreign banks does not appear, however, to have affected the interest rates applied to firms, either on short or on medium-to-long-term financing. This is probably due to the difficulty foreign banks have in evaluating projects to be financed because of their lack of local roots and hence of a close relationship with borrowers. Even in the case of firms, however, the presence of foreign banks has been accompanied recently by a tendency to reduce the collateral on medium and long-term loans.                                                  5  Infante L. and P. Rossi (2009), “The Retail Activity of Foreign Banks in Italy: Effects on Credit Supply to Households and Firms”, Bank of Italy Working papers (Temi di discussione) no. 714, June. 
6 BIS Review 168/2009 4. Supervision The changes in the presence of foreign banks operating in Italy and in their business models have led to major alterations in the approach taken by supervision. These developments have been strongly influenced by the progress of international financial integration, above all in Europe. In the single European market the principle of home-country control means that branches of banks from other member states are subject to a significantly different supervisory model from that applied to subsidiaries established under Italian law. Controls on the former are entrusted almost entirely to the home-country authorities, with the notable exception of liquidity risk, which is monitored by the host country. The Bank of Italy monitors liquidity risk in various ways; since September 2008 controls have been tightened and banks are now required to maintain a positive net liquidity position on maturities up to one month. When the strains were at their height, direct steps were taken in respect of foreign parent banks, with the help of the relevant supervisory authorities. Specific measures of an extraordinary nature can be adopted for branches of foreign banks with a significant volume of deposits raised in Italy. The Bank of Italy’s supervision of branches includes important controls on the transparency of banking services offered to customers and against money-laundering, about which I will say more shortly. Controls on subsidiaries are more intensive and resemble those applied to Italian banks. In keeping with the new prudential framework established in the Basel II Accord these must be coordinated between the home- and host-country authorities. This highly ramified supervisory system involving various authorities with different powers makes the task of supervision a complex and difficult one, in a setting in which foreign intermediaries are exposed to an expanding array of risks, including operational and reputational risks. As in its supervision of Italian banks, the Bank of Italy increasingly directs and calibrates its activity based on risks and their importance. To comprehend their evolution and impact, it has held more meetings with the subsidiaries of foreign groups. This dialogue is useful for a timely and in-depth analysis of operational choices, in the context of those taken at group level, and of the risk management and control systems. Inspections, including those of a partial nature, have been intensified. A start has been made on action to strengthen internal control systems, which were found to be inadequate in some cases. The reaction has been positive, but the process of adapting to higher standards is not yet complete. The corporate culture of several big financial groups requires a thorough rethinking in order to forge a new relationship between business units and control functions. These controls must be assigned greater importance than in the past. The performance of depositary banks’ activities require organizational structures and working processes capable of curtailing the operational and reputational risks to which custodians are subject. The regulatory framework governing this sector in Italy fosters reliable and transparent conduct: for example, the distinction between management companies and depositary banks makes it easier to control their operations, the quality of valuations and the actual amount of assets held for custody. This arrangement has prevented the emergence of similar risks to those seen in other systems. Efforts must continue to make this activity even more effective and secure for customers. Derivatives business can expose banks to major legal and reputational risks, as the numerous ongoing legal disputes testify. For some time now we have intensified our activity on this front, both by reminding banks of the need for proper conduct and careful risk assessment, and through the monitoring of the phenomenon, including via targeted on-site controls. We must not lower our guard. One aspect that can condition supervisory activity is the availability of full information on the activity of foreign branches, and to some extent also of the subsidiaries present in Italy, when 
BIS Review 168/2009 7 their role is merely to distribute products developed abroad, often in London. In these cases it becomes difficult to obtain, even during on-site examinations, the documentation needed to reconstruct the operations of the foreign intermediary in Italy; in some cases the transactions in question are complex, exposing banks to high operational, legal and reputational risks that are difficult to quantify. In accordance with the division of responsibilities under Community legislation, there is a need for greater cooperation between foreign intermediaries and the authorities of the countries in which they offer their services. Improvements in transparency are necessary: foreign intermediaries must also comply with the advertising obligations, follow the rules on contracts and, in general, set up customer relations on a completely correct basis. It is essential, in particular, that a careful selection be made of agents responsible for distributing credit cards, a sector in which several foreign banks are very active. A qualitative leap is also called for on the sensitive issue of money laundering, with a greater commitment by top management, more intensive staff training and more stringent controls. At times we have found the phenomenon to be underestimated by foreign parent banks when setting up programmes for organizing and reorganizing their Italian units. The supervision of foreign banks must reconcile the requirements of control over institutions that can have systemic importance in the national territory with the powers of the supervisory authority in the country where the parent company is established. This is a delicate process, requiring a balanced and pragmatic approach. The Bank of Italy has stepped up the activity it performs in the colleges of supervisors. In addition to validating internal risk-measurement systems, the colleges’ activities have gradually – and not without difficulty – been extended to broader issues, concerned with the very stability of cross-border banking groups. 5. Developments in regulation and supervision The integration of the markets and the broad process of internationalization can facilitate the spread of instability, even if localized at first, and require a coordinated response. This is why it is essential not only to proceed rapidly to introduce new common rules for the financial sector, aimed at reducing the risk of systemic crises, but also to achieve greater homogeneity in their actual application and to strengthen cooperation between national supervisory authorities. The proposals for reform of the rules touch on numerous issues: the capital adequacy of banks, the size of the regulatory perimeter, the planning of measures to attenuate the pro-cyclicality of banking activity, capital buffers, the introduction of limits on the financial leverage of intermediaries, the improvement of corporate governance and executive compensation mechanisms, the role of systemically important intermediaries, integration between macro-prudential and micro-prudential supervision, and international coordination between authorities in supervising cross-border institutions. Effective supervision of international groups and the institution of a truly integrated monitoring process will require overcoming the divergences still found between the approaches of the various authorities, especially in the definition of the scope of consolidation for banking groups, the application of Basel Pillar 2, the treatment of liquidity risk, the reporting of off-balance-sheet vehicles, accounting standards and prudential reporting. The FSB, under the leadership of the Governor of the Bank of Italy, has concluded that the international college of supervisors is the most suitable instrument for strengthening cooperation and information exchange among the national supervisory authorities involved in the oversight of cross-border groups. This instrument, already current within the European Union and amply utilized in Italy, will be reinforced in the near future and extended to all cross-border groups. To make action more effective, a clear legislative framework and a precise definition of the powers and duties of colleges are necessary. For the most part, they have worked well as the place for information exchange but have not developed a real 
8 BIS Review 168/2009 capability for the joint assessment of the risks of groups and their components or for the effective coordination of supervisory action. Colleges’ decision-making powers need to be reinforced, with machinery for settling disputes and a powerful coordinating role for the consolidated supervisor. This process should be complemented by greater recognition of the role of the parent company under Community legislation on banking groups to establish a proper distribution of costs and benefits among all the components of the group. The Italian law on banking groups can offer useful points of reference here. In addition, colleges need to become the forum for the integrated risk assessment of groups and their main components, in order to plan supervisory action and corrective intervention. This requires the development of common methodologies and the sharing of information, including through central databases accessible to all the authorities within the college, to favour joint monitoring of the main risks. There have been problems in the management of crises involving cross-border groups. In particular, what is lacking is agreement on the method for sharing the costs of intervention. In practice, government support has gone exclusively to the national members of troubled groups and not to sustain the group as a whole. Supervisory colleges have not played a central role when group crises have occurred, as would have been desirable. Even in cases in which cooperation was thought to have produced a good degree of uniformity in regulatory approaches, national needs and practices prevailed. The “too-big-to-fail” syndrome is currently under discussion in international fora, with various proposed remedies, including the imposition of additional capital requirements and other, more radical proposals for reducing the size and interdependence of group structures with global systemic relevance. The debate is still just beginning, and the eventual results could have a considerable impact on market integration. The European Commission has worked up a set of proposals to improve cooperation among national supervisors, harmonize crisis management and resolution measures and clarify the standards for sharing the costs of banking crises among countries. The most significant proposals are for: enhancing the quality and quantity of information that home and host supervisors exchange, both in normal times and in crises; host supervisors’ participation in colleges, including when the case involves important branches or subsidiaries; creating a new European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS) grouping three sectoral agencies (the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities Markets Authority), for more effective supervision over the major European groups; and forming a new European Systemic Risk Board, in order to sharpen the macro-prudential focus of supervisory policy. A few weeks ago the Commission released a consultation document setting out its projects for enhancing supervisory authorities’ early intervention at ailing banks, and their crisis management and resolution. The idea is to revise European company and bankruptcy law, together with compulsory deposit insurance schemes, and, more generally, the financing of crisis intervention measures. The set of regulatory changes under consideration, once implemented, will have significant impact on the conduct of banking supervision over national and foreign intermediaries alike and on the roles and responsibilities of the various authorities. There will be a period of intense dialogue with intermediaries, whose organizational and business models could be affected. 6. Conclusion I believe that the Italian experience over the past twenty-five years has been positive on the whole. Foreign banks have significantly enlarged their presence in Italy and helped spread 
BIS Review 168/2009 9 new business models, different even from those of their own home markets. These foreign intermediaries contributed substantially to the growth of the Italian banking industry in terms of innovation, service quality and quantity, and stiffer competition. Italian savers and investors benefited. The contribution was greater in some market segments, less noticeable in others. During the recent crisis, in Italy – unlike other countries – the presence of foreign banks did not cause strains or inflict losses on Italian savers and investors. However, more highly diversified lines of business and the rapidly evolving external environment have increased risk exposure, especially in some segments. The Bank of Italy has accordingly adjusted supervisory approaches and instruments to guarantee the continued effectiveness of its action, adapted to the evolution of risks. In recent years the chief focus has been on liquidity, operational, legal and reputational risks. The closer integration of financial markets heightens the danger of contagion. The debate on the effectiveness of supervision over the major cross-border groups, with their often over-complex organization, is still under way. Obviously, this is a question that ranges beyond national confines. If the crisis was – unquestionably – global, then the review and reinforcement of the supervisory architecture needs to be as internationally coordinated as possible. The regulatory response to cure a financial system that has proven to be borderless and highly interconnected cannot be marked by divergent national emphases and approaches. It must follow common guidelines and methods of application based on shared principles. Otherwise, we would be leaving ourselves open to regulatory arbitrage and opportunism on the part of the large global players. In this new framework there cannot and must not be any room for supervisors to favour their own financial marketplace by light regulation. There is now broad international consensus on the need for common rules, uniform supervisory measures, severe and cogent enforcement, enhancement of the role of supervisory colleges and cooperation among authorities. Hopefully, this consensus will translate rapidly into practical action. The Bank of Italy is convinced that stepped-up cooperation and collaboration is the best way to minimize the risk of new crises and avoid the recurrence of the severe damage sustained in the last two years.  As the authority responsible for prudential supervision in Italy, we scrupulously apply the rules agreed on internationally and in Europe, in tandem with especially careful and severe controls. This we do every day. Recent experience has shown that it is necessary to maintain this course.

BIS Review 167/2009 1 Philipp Hildebrand: Review of the international financial system Introductory remarks by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 10 December 2009. *      *      * 1. Introduction  At the news conference in June of this year we spoke of a gradual calming in the general financial market environment, although the outlook remains uncertain. Since then we have seen a majority of banks returning to profitability. The horror stories being reported almost daily just over a year ago have now disappeared. It is very tempting just to go back to business as usual.  However, we must not forget that – just over a year ago now – the international financial system was on the brink of collapse. Support packages of an unprecedented size were being put together for the banks. Exceptional monetary and fiscal measures were required to combat the dramatic plunge in the global economy – measures which have had to be kept in place to the current time. Only by a narrow margin was a complete collapse of the financial system avoided and the danger of a major depression averted.  This experience has clearly shown us all that the principle of sustainability needs to be a much more dominant element in the development of the international financial system than it was previously. This serves the interests of governments and taxpayers; but it is also in the fundamental interests of the financial system itself, since it is not impossible that a future crisis could outstrip the resources of monetary and fiscal policy, thus rendering it impossible to rescue systemically important banks.  2. International approach  Consequently, there is broad international consensus between the relevant authorities on what the objectives of future regulatory measures should be. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), in which Switzerland is an active participant, has clearly formulated these objectives. The financial system must be brought to the point where it contributes to sustained economic growth. Never again must it be allowed to combine such high risks with such minimal safety buffers. Moreover, steps must be taken to avoid profits being privatised while losses are borne by the public at large.  In essence, there are two ways of achieving this goal. The first approach is to adopt preventative measures aimed at reducing the probability of a bank collapse or a systemic crisis. This can be done by increasing safety buffers – for example, by imposing higher capital and liquidity requirements. The second approach is to take steps designed to reduce the costs of a crisis once it has already occurred.  2.1 Prevention  At the international level, the implementation of preventative measures is already well advanced, in that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision – in coordination with decisions by the G20 and the FSB – has decided on important measures in the fields of capital and liquidity regulation. The consultation package on this matter will be published in early 2010.  The measures designed to strengthen capital include stricter calibration of risk weights to determine the regulatory capital, improvement in the quality of this capital buffer and a direct limitation on the level of debt (leverage ratio). The combined effect of all these measures will 
2 BIS Review 167/2009 be analysed by the Basel Committee during the course of 2010 in order to calibrate the overall capital requirements.  Liquidity regulation measures are aimed at securing financial institutions’ flow of liquidity, particularly during times of crisis. The Basel Committee is proposing a global minimum standard for liquidity regulation. This is to ensure that financial institutions build up a liquidity buffer which allows them to remain liquid in short-term and medium-term stress scenarios.  In line with the decisions of the Basel Committee, we have already implemented stricter risk-weighted capital requirements in Switzerland, supplemented by a leverage ratio. The capital requirements are designed to be anticyclical, i.e. in good times, banks are required to build up a capital buffer in excess of a given minimum level. By contrast, in bad times, the capital buffer is permitted to fall below that level. A new liquidity regulation is currently in the test and calibration phase. This regulation takes into account all balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet items that are of relevance in liquidity considerations, and is based – as far as possible – on internal bank liquidity management principles. It makes the big banks more resilient to disturbances in the interbank market or larger-scale withdrawals of deposits. It promotes longer-term financing as well as higher-rated securities that are capable of generating liquidity even in a stressed market environment. The new regulation is due to come into force in the second quarter of 2010.  These advances and the broad consensus achieved at the international level can certainly be regarded as positive achievements. However, so far they only apply to preventative measures. As mentioned previously, these measures serve to reduce the probability of a crisis, but cannot always prevent its occurrence. Another crisis is inevitable and we must be prepared for it.  3. Resolution measures needed; “too big to fail” is biggest challenge Consequently, we need tools that will substantially reduce the costs of a crisis. The legacy of the current crisis is a banking system with large international institutions that now enjoy a virtual state guarantee. The fact that systemically important banks enjoy such a guarantee is now openly recognised to be a problem by the banking sector, too. A guarantee of this kind contradicts the basic principle of the market economy and presents us with a situation that cannot be tolerated. It must be possible for any financial institution, even a large one, to fail, without threatening the future of either the financial system or the real economy.  In the last two years, the risks presented by systemically important banks to the stability of the financial system and the economy in general have become only too evident.  First, in principle, systemically important institutions have an incentive to enter into excessive risks (moral hazard). Should these risks materialise, this can lead to losses of unimaginable dimensions, as has indeed occurred. Second, the potential costs of supporting systemically important banks are enormous. Third, the larger the systemically important institutions compared to the size of a country’s economy, the greater the likelihood that the costs in question will exceed the capacity of that individual country to bear them (the “too big to rescue” issue).  The leaders of the G20 countries were quick to recognise the significance of these risks and they asked the Financial Stability Board to elaborate proposals before the end of October 2010 on how the “too big to fail” and “too big to rescue” issues could be addressed.  In its interim report on this matter published at the beginning of November 2009, the FSB focuses on three elements. At the same time, it is closely monitoring the development of additional proposals at national and international level.  From the point of view of the FSB, the possibility of conducting an orderly resolution of a failing cross-border financial institution is an important element in finding a solution to the “too big to fail” and “too big to rescue” issues. Effective communication between the relevant 
BIS Review 167/2009 3 supervisory authorities as well as forward-looking elaboration of emergency procedures are indispensible in this process. Internationally recognised regulations for the dissolution of systemically important institutions that can be enforced under any jurisdiction are no doubt a splendid objective. In the real world, however, different national regulations will continue to exist in this field. From our point of view, reciprocal recognition of national regulations that are mutually compatible, and the associated adjustment of structures and processes, are a more realistic objective.  The second element proposed by the FSB is to supplement the increased capital and liquidity requirements with various measures that address the organisational structures of systemically important financial institutions. Measures of this kind could, for instance, create the possibility of extracting operations that were important for the economy and liquidating the remaining operations.  The third element in the solution envisaged by the FSB is a financial market infrastructure whose design ensures that, as far as possible, it minimises destabilising effects in the event of a bank collapse. Central counterparties can play a special role in this respect. Thus, in markets cleared through a central counterparty, all market participants have just one single counterparty, rather than numerous bilateral business relationships, and the complexity of the financial system is significantly reduced. What is even more important, however, is the fact that, in the event of a bank collapse, a central counterparty guarantees that it will fulfil the commitments it has entered into with respect to the other market participants, thereby eliminating the traditional domino effect. That is why, together with other central banks and supervisory authorities, the SNB is supporting the banks’ ongoing efforts to clear a larger part of the enormous over-the-counter derivatives market through central counterparties. These central counterparties come at a cost, since it goes without saying that they must run a very sound risk management system. For even a central counterparty could be threatened with failure. Since the consequences of such an event would be catastrophic, central counterparties need to command sufficient financial resources to ensure that they can withstand the failure of the largest market participant, even in extreme market conditions.  4. Political responsibility  The SNB is investing substantial resources in actively carrying forward the approaches to solving the “too big to fail” and “too big to rescue” issues that have just been outlined – not just in international bodies like the FSB or the Basel Committee, but also at the national level, in conjunction with FINMA. The reasons for this are obvious. Given the particular importance of the banking sector, with two big banks which hold a key position in the domestic loan and deposit market, the “too big to fail” and “too big to rescue” issues have particular significance for Switzerland.  Consequently, we need to be very conscious of the fact that measures may be needed over and above any international standard. For this reason we are dependent upon political support in order to make our financial system more resistant and more stable with regard to the “too big to fail” and the “too big to rescue” issues. If this succeeds, the competitive position of the Swiss banking sector will be reinforced in the long-term as a result of increased safety, reliability and credibility. The fact that the Swiss Federal Council has appointed a commission of experts on the subject of “too big to fail” is an important step, which we welcome. The willingness of the big banks to participate actively in elaborating solutions to the “too big to fail” and “too big to rescue” issues is also welcome. These latest developments clearly show how urgent the problems are.  Ladies and gentlemen, if we do not manage to fundamentally reform the financial system, it is to be feared that a future crisis of even greater dimensions will trigger such a strong protectionist and regulatory reaction that the damage done will extend even to the market economy to which we owe our prosperity. We owe it to future generations to take action against this danger. Doing nothing is not an option.  
BIS Review 167/2009 1 Norman T L Chan: The risk of asset-price bubbles Speech by Mr Norman TL Chan, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the Hong Kong Economic Summit, Hong Kong, 14 December 2009. *      *      * Introduction 1. I am very honoured to have this opportunity to speak to you today at the Hong Kong Economic Summit. Potential risks of an asset bubble 2. Recently, many people in Hong Kong have become concerned about the emergence of an asset-price bubble. As we all know, interest rates are now very low due to the extremely loose monetary policies around the world. Attracted by a promising outlook for economic recovery, large amounts of funds have flowed into Asia, including Hong Kong. From October last year up to now, more than HK$640 billion have flowed into the Hong Kong dollar. This will certainly exert an upward pressure on local asset markets. I am sure you are all aware that the Hong Kong asset markets have become very active again. In particular, the prices of residential properties rose for 10 consecutive months from the beginning of this year, and prices and turnover have returned to levels we saw before the financial crisis. Many people are asking whether there is already a bubble. 3. Bull markets normally occur in times of rapid economic growth, abundant liquidity and strong investment sentiment. However, as to how far a bull market can develop before it becomes a bubble, there is no easy answer. There is a view in the international community that it is very difficult to identify an asset bubble before it materialises or even after it has already formed. This is true to a certain extent. For example, property prices in Hong Kong have increased nearly 20-fold in the past 30 years. Flats in the Taikoo Shing, a large residential estate on Hong Kong Island, were sold for only $300-400 a square foot in the 70’s when they were built. The prices then spiralled upwards to over $1,000 a square foot in the 80’s and reached a peak of nearly $10,000 a square foot in 1997. Although there have been ups and downs in property prices in Hong Kong in the past 30 years, the trend has basically been up. During each upward leg, ordinary middle-class households usually felt that prices were too high and difficult to afford, and there were always questions about whether a bubble had developed in the property market. However, with the benefit of hindsight, the rises in the 70’s and 80’s were not the result of bubbles but were supported by economic fundamentals, including growth in productivity and household incomes. A real and massive bubble did occur in the 90’s as a result of a bull market. However, many people at that time tried to explain the irrational surges in prices as being part of the “Hong Kong miracle”. The bubble and its subsequent bursting in the third quarter of 1997 dealt a severe blow to Hong Kong. We experienced an economic contraction for five consecutive quarters and property prices plunged by more than 60%. Many families found themselves trapped in “negative equity”, and the unemployment rate was above 8%. Hong Kong began to recover in 2003 after six years’ hard struggle. I am sure that this experience is still fresh in our memory. 4. Japan is another good example. It enjoyed rapid economic development after World War II, quickly becoming a powerful industrial nation. During the late 80’s when its stock and property markets were booming, a huge bubble was created, which we only realised afterwards. Few people spotted the emergence of a bubble at the time, and the extraordinary and irrational exuberance was interpreted as the “Japanese miracle”. We all know now that what a disaster this “Japanese miracle” was for its people. Twenty years on, the Nikkei Index still hovers around the 10,000 level, only a quarter of its peak of 39,000, while the average residential land price in six major cities is equivalent to only a third of its level two decades 
2 BIS Review 167/2009 ago. Of course, there are other structural problems that have prevented a Japanese recovery for such a long period. 5. The current global financial crisis was caused by the bursting of the property bubble in the US, which left many financial institutions under stress. For those who take the view that asset bubbles cannot be identified with certainty, it is neither appropriate nor necessary for the government to take action to burst them. Support for this view comes from the stock market crash in 1987 and the collapse of the IT bubble in 2000. In both cases, central banks were able to stabilise the financial market rapidly by aggressively cutting interest rates and injecting large amounts of liquidity into the market, and the economy and employment quickly resumed their upward paths. But the situation may be very different this time. Because the property and financial markets were closely inter-locked, risks were dispersed by the bundling of sub-prime securities and other financial derivatives, and a large bubble formed. The bursting of this bubble caused great damage to the European and US economies and people in Europe and America have had to pay an unprecedented price. The US government used US$700 billion to bail out banks and car manufacturers, and the UK government spent GBP 76 billion on rescuing the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Bank alone. Many European governments have also bailed out their banking systems, including the injection of capital into large banks by the Dutch and Belgian governments. 6. Based on experience in Asia in the past two decades, I believe asset-price bubbles, rather than inflation, pose the greatest risk to financial stability. My reasons for thinking this are many and complex, and we may discuss them on another occasion. I am not saying that inflation is not a concern for Asia. But I believe it is more important to address the harm that might be caused by asset-price bubbles. Although I agree it is difficult to predict the occurrence of an asset-price bubble, I am certain that once a bubble is created, it will grow with immense power and suppressing it will be difficult. The bigger the bubble, the greater the devastation it will cause when it bursts. The best way to avoid the damage and heavy cost is to prevent the occurrence of a bubble or to contain it before it’s too late. To do this, we have to make decisions at the early stage of a bubble’s formation, not later. More importantly, when a bubble is taking shape, we have to take appropriate and effective steps to stop it getting too big. Prudent risk management 7. The current extremely loose monetary policies around the world and the large inflows of funds provide an ideal environment and provided nourishment for the formation of asset-price bubbles in Asia. So the risk of asset-price bubbles is not small. But Hong Kong cannot raise interest rates as it wishes, and even if we could, this would attract more hot money with undesirable consequences. So Hong Kong, like many other small and open economies, has to resort to other means to prevent the bubble from growing too large. 8. So what methods and tools should we use? For the property market, it is obvious that if there is a bottleneck or an imbalance in the supply of land, we have to deal with it. But the factors affecting demand, supply and prices of properties are very complex. Sometimes property prices rise not because there is a shortage of residential flats to satisfy housing demand, but because people expect that the market will continue to rise making it better to buy now to reap short-term profit or hold on for bigger gains in the long run. Currently in Hong Kong, the rapid surge in luxury-property prices may not necessarily be caused by insufficient supply of high-end residential flats, since rentals have not moved up in proportion with the prices. Actually, the increases were caused by the fact that many investors, including those from Mainland China, were optimistic about the outlook for future prices. 9. Apart from regulating the supply of land, another method that has long been used in Hong Kong to reduce the risk of bubbles in the property market is for banks to act as gatekeepers in preventing sharp increases in mortgage lending. The regulatory measures implemented by HKMA on 23 October that tightened the loan-to-value ratio for luxury 
BIS Review 167/2009 3 properties priced at HK$20 million or more to 60% serve this purpose. Some may argue that since many buyers of luxury properties are wealthy, they may not need to apply for mortgages and therefore the HKMA’s measures may not have the expected effect. I agree that this would be the case if all property buyers used their savings and did not need to borrow from banks. However, I do not believe that none of the purchasers of luxury properties borrow from banks. Some buyers do not approach banks for mortgages because they still have time before completing the transactions, or because they do not intend to hold the flats for a long time. I also do not believe that the markets for small and medium-sized residential flats could have become so active without abundant credit from banks. I therefore believe that the prudential measures that we have taken and good risk management by banks will help stop asset-price bubbles from forming. 10. While banks will help to control the risks, members of the public and corporations in Hong Kong also need to be more alert. They should consider what they can afford and not borrow too much at a time when interest rates are so low to avoid getting into financial difficulties when interest rates rise again. But I can see that this is not easy. As hot money continues to flow into Hong Kong, it pushes the market higher. If this continues, people may get into a mistaken mindset that the market can only go up and overlook the risk that capital and hot would might one day reverse course without warning. 11. Finally, I would like to share with you an article I read last week. The article pointed out the differences between an asset-price bubble and a bull market. The author was of the view that people who don’t manage to enter the stock market in time or don’t dare to do so when the market has gone up will regard it as a bubble and will support the government taking measures to cool things down; but investors who have entered the market will see the increases as a bull market. Price increases can be interpreted in many ways. Well, a non-mainstream view like this may have some merit and, right or wrong, it illustrates the difficulty of dealing with asset-price bubbles, particularly the courage needed to make decisions at critical moments. Whether these decisions are correct or not is difficult to say with total confidence and certainty beforehand, and mistakes may be made. But we cannot avoid mistakes by not making decisions because the damage to society of an asset-price bubble is too great to ignore. And we should not just rely on the government to stop the bubble expanding. It requires the involvement of banks, corporations and individuals – they need to be more risk-conscious and self-disciplined. My colleagues at the HKMA and I will do our best, and I invite everyone to work hard together to meet the challenges brought about by the global financial tsunami. 
BIS Review 167/2009 1 Ewart S Williams: Preparing enhanced insurance regulations for Trinidad and Tobago Speaking notes by Mr Ewart S Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, for the “Public Consultation of the Draft Insurance Bill & Accompanying Regulations”, Port-of-Spain, 10 December 2009. *      *      * Introduction Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  My role is to make a few introductory remarks to get the main discussion going. Obviously we all would like this to be a serious working session and not an opportunity for speech-making.  Let me start by saying how delighted I am to be with you this morning as today’s Public Consultation which marks the final phase of a process that started roughly five years ago. As you would recall the regulation of the insurance sector was transferred from the Office of the Supervisor of Insurance in the Ministry of Finance, to the Central Bank in 2004.  The process of preparing a new Insurance Act has been a collaborative approach between the Central Bank and a stakeholders’ Committee, comprising members of ATTIC, the Brokers Association and other industry consultants.  This collaborative approach bears testimony to the firm commitment of the Central Bank to ensuring that the legislation for the sector strikes the right balance between international best practices and local market conditions and circumstances.  Prior to April 2004, the Central Bank had oversight of 6 commercial banks and 15 non-banks. After the shift in regulatory authority, the Bank took on responsibility for 51 insurance companies, and 256 registered pension plans. This was a major undertaking and necessitated a significant increase in staffing and infrastructural requirements, including training.  The insurance sector, as you know, is a major contributor to the domestic economy. It accounts for close to $40 billion, second only to the $88 billion for commercial banks. The sector is a major repository for private savings and by covering risks and unexpected developments; it facilitates private and public sector activity. In short, the industry is one of enormous economic and social value and critical to our developmental efforts.  The legislation that underpins insurance activity in Trinidad and Tobago is grossly outdated. The basic Act dates back to 1966 and was modified in 1980. As all of you know better than I, the insurance industry of today bears little resemblance to that of 1966 or even 1980.  As I am sure you know, inadequate financial regulation or regulatory failure has been widely cited as one of the factors behind the international financial crisis of 2008–2009. As a consequence of this global financial crisis comprehensive reforms are underway to address the weaknesses which were exposed in the regulatory regimes of most developed countries.  On the domestic front, the events of early 2009, which saw the Central Bank intervening in two insurance companies and an investment bank in the same group, served to reinforce the need for enhanced regulation of the sector. These events propelled the enactment of few amendments to the Insurance Act in February 2009. These amendments were needed to treat with some urgent immediate issues and covered: (i) quarterly reporting; 
2 BIS Review 167/2009 (ii) ensuring that the Statutory Fund is sufficient to provide policyholder protection on an ongoing basis, rather than only at the end of the year as required by the previous legislation; (iii) timely corrective action by replacing a cumbersome, time consuming intervention regime with a more flexible and effective process that allowed for the issuance of compliance directions, and (iv) authorizing the sharing of information with other regulators. It is absolutely vital that our laws and regulations keep abreast of wider market developments. Indeed, even in the absence of any problems there is always a need for legislative review. In most developed jurisdictions, periodic reviews are written into legislation to ensure that it remains current since financial innovation will eventually outpace and weaken legislative provisions.  As noted earlier, the Bank has engaged in extensive consultation with stakeholders in the insurance industry. This process began in October 2004 and was a major departure from the way the legislation was formulated in the past. The close collaboration and consultation with the industry has served to enhance the quality of the draft legislation which we are discussing today.  Ladies and Gentlemen, it is important to emphasize that in the first instance, the most important reason for upgrading our insurance legislation is to protect the policy holder. That is why, for example, the draft legislation requires an increase in capital for insurance companies. Obviously, something must be wrong when companies are required to hold only $1–3 million in capital, while they mobilise policy-holders’ funds totalling hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. We recognise that many companies have held way beyond the statutory minimum capital. The draft legislation also seeks to ensure that insurance companies correctly value their liabilities so that they could hold adequate reserves to protect their policy-holders. Currently there are no prescribed actuarial standards for insurance in Trinidad and Tobago. This has resulted in serious under-estimation of liabilities and reserves and also makes it difficult to make inter-company comparisons. The draft legislation recognises that some insurance companies would be content with more traditional and safer modes of operations, while others would engage in more risky activities. For this reason, the draft proposes a risk-based capital regime. The greater the level of risk, the larger the capital requirement.  And very importantly the draft legislation seeks to give some authority to the Central Bank to promote compliance. Thus it is proposed that the Central Bank be given the authority to require timely corrective action and to impose sanctions including fines, when these are deemed appropriate. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, regulation is a continuously evolving process. The reforms to the insurance legislation, which we propose to discuss with you today, will bring our regulatory framework closer in line with international standards and will promote a more transparent and reliable regulatory structure.  It has been a long journey to reach to this point but the journey has been paved with a great deal of healthy dialogue and “give and take” between the insurance industry and the Central Bank. I believe this was possible because at the end of the day, we share a common goal as we strive towards a more robust and better regulated industry. Similar to past consultations I anticipate that today’s dialogue will be fruitful and will occur in an 
BIS Review 167/2009 3 atmosphere of mutual trust and respect so that at the end of the process, the result would be legislation of which we can all be proud.  I will now pass you back to the Moderator who will introduce Mr. Carl Hiralal, the Inspector of Financial Institutions, to discuss the highlights of the draft Bill in greater detail. 
BIS Review 166/2009 1 Jean-Pierre Roth: The financial crisis is receding – what will the future bring? Summary of a speech by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Centro di Studi Bancari, Vezia, 15 December 2009. The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * After the financial crisis, the global economy will enter a phase of weak economic growth. Unemployment levels in the industrialised countries will be comparatively high. Public finances in these countries have been heavily depleted, both by the crisis and by the needs arising from the ageing of their populations, and will need to be consolidated. In monetary terms, inflation will remain under control, at least in those countries whose central banks enjoy a strong level of independence. Switzerland is comparatively well equipped to meet these challenges. Its public finances are in a healthy state and it is sufficiently open to the world to participate in its most dynamic markets. With its tradition of high quality and cutting-edge technology, Switzerland is well positioned to react to specific market requirements. Moreover, it can draw on considerable financial resources and, thanks to the openness of its labour market, also has easy access to labour resources, without which growth would not be possible. Switzerland’s only major drawback is the fact that it is a lightweight in the geopolitical arena, which makes it almost impossible for it to defend itself against protectionist tendencies and discriminatory measures taken by big countries.  The Swiss government must therefore take a strong stand on behalf of free trade, while also ensuring that the private sector operates within the best possible framework for its further development. Ultimately, our future welfare depends on the vitality of the private sector, not on any state intervention. 
BIS Review 166/2009 1 Patrick Honohan: Regulatory policy development and new regulatory activity Introductory statement by Mr Patrick Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank & Financial Services Authority of Ireland, to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs, Dublin, 15 December 2009. *      *      * Mr Patrick Honohan was accompanied by Martin Moloney, Secretary to the Financial Regulatory Authority, and Joe Doherty, Head of the Central Bank’s Legal Unit. I would like to highlight a number of key areas which currently dominate regulatory policy development and new regulatory activity.  1. Resolving the crisis  First and foremost in the magnitude of its impact is the resolution of the current banking crisis. The weakened financial position of the banks and the extensive government guarantee provided to their depositors and other claimants clearly calls for exceptional measures here. There has been greatly intensified and, indeed what has been termed, “intrusive” supervision of the operations of the main banks covered by the guarantee. This involves on-site presence on a daily basis by several regulatory staff in each of the institutions covered by the government guarantee. They have been sitting in as observers on key decision-making committees in each of these banks as well as conducting a number of specific investigations and reviews.  The government’s crisis resolution strategy involves cleaning out a very large block of troubled property-related loans from the banks’ balance sheets and replacing them with NAMA bonds guaranteed by the government. This will ease the banks’ ability to mobilise funds for their ongoing operations. At the same time, since these loans are to be purchased by NAMA at “long-term economic values” (not far above current market prices), the purchases will serve to crystallise losses on the banks’ books in amounts likely to be in excess of the provisions already taken. This is likely to give rise to a need for measures to increase the banks’ cushion of capital, needed to absorb any future losses. To the extent that needed capital cannot be sourced by the banks themselves, the government has indicated that it will be prepared to make the necessary investments. Quantifying the needs and the possibilities is an important task here in which the regulatory staff are centrally involved.  2. Ensuring safe and sound finance  Quite apart from this problem of crisis management, there is the ongoing task of ensuring the safe and sound operation of financial firms in Ireland, both those dealing with the domestic market and those primarily concerned with the export of financial services through the IFSC.  Some of this safety and soundness work is routine in character, requiring precision, predictability and efficiency: for example the authorisation of investment fund prospectuses. Many thousands of such funds are given a standardised vetting by our staff before they can be listed, and in this way some degree of protection is provided to the investors in these funds.  Other parts of what I call the safety-and-soundness work is more qualitative and judgmental. Regulation attempts to limit reckless or self-dealing behaviour by financial firms both (i) ex ante in advance by vetting the persons in charge for their fitness and propriety, and by checking on compliance with clear rules of behaviour and (ii) ex post by means of penalties if 
2 BIS Review 166/2009 it is discovered that violations have been committed. We are on the lookout for ways of improving both dimensions.  (i) Thousands of financial firms in Ireland are regulated entities. Experience worldwide shows how hard it is for regulators to detect all fraudulent behaviour on the part of financial firm management. Very often important breakthroughs are made thanks to the revelations of whistleblowers. Transparency International, for example, has in a recent report highlighted this issue for our financial system. We are seeking the introduction of a statutory regime to encourage whistleblowers and to provide a specific process for them.  (ii) Enforcement of clear rules is crucial and I am determined that there will not be any reluctance on the part of the regulatory staff to pursue violations. There will of course be full cooperation with any criminal prosecutions, where they arise, and (otherwise) impose the appropriate administrative sanctions. For this reason, following discussions with Matthew Elderfield, the new head of financial supervision, who will be starting in a few weeks, we have decided to make a senior appointment to take charge of enforcement. As you know there have been high-profile allegations of wrongdoing in the context of the banking crisis. I do not wish to talk in any detail about these (indeed I cannot do so) beyond saying that, detailed investigations of these are in progress and the regulatory staff have contributed vigorously to this process.  More generally, there will be an increase in staffing and the introduction of new internal structures in what is rapidly becoming a unitary central banking organisation without artificial and unnecessary internal barriers. With Matthew Elderfield, who brings his own considerable experience and skills to upgrading and restructuring regulation in Ireland, we have been planning details of the new structures and approaches that will be adopted.  As far as structures are concerned, I can mention that, in addition to the Enforcement role, we have just announced the creation of new senior level positions with responsibility for markets supervision and policy and risk.  Supervision will be calibrated to the risks posed by the different firms in the sector and will involve applying the existing rule-book, strengthened as necessary to plug the holes revealed by the crisis. In particular, we will not be slow to implement new stronger rules, being developed as we speak, by international bodies such as the Basel Committee.  Despite the extensive powers already available to the regulatory authorities, it would be useful and appropriate to have clarity on a number of additional points; these are being discussed at present with the Department of Finance with a view to their inclusion in the proposed legislation restructuring the Central Bank. One particular area relates to the requirements of confidentiality, which (as they are currently being interpreted) seem to go well beyond what is necessary or appropriate for the purpose of ensuring privacy of customers and commercial interests. As things stand, the regulatory staff can end up appearing passive and defensive when called to speak on specific issues in public.  A final aspect of safety and soundness to which I would like to refer is the admission of large and complex export-oriented firms into the Irish market. I welcome the participation of foreign-owned firms – both those aiming to supply the domestic market and those that are export-oriented – they provide competition and business opportunities. But the crisis has revealed the reputational risks to Ireland of having a failure in such an entity. This means that we have to redouble our efforts to ensure that only sound institutions are allowed to enter and that they are comprehensively supervised to ensure that they continue to be sound. I will certainly not allow Ireland to become a soft option for firms or activities that are no longer welcome elsewhere. This means more supervisory staff with the necessary skill levels; these can be paid for by a levy on the supervised firms (I think we should move towards a 100% chargeback basis). I also feel, though, that specific steps need to be taken to ensure that 
BIS Review 166/2009 3 there is no expectation that the state would come in to take exceptional steps to rescue such entities.  3. Consumer protection  Consumer protection cannot and will not be ignored in the regulatory structure. Failures here are not as spectacular as a solvency crisis, but can be as damaging to the affected consumers. There will be no downgrading of this aspect of the regulatory work. The statutory codes of conduct for mortgage and SME lending are already, I believe, making some impact on what are difficult current issues; and the Law Reform Commission also made valuable recommendations – but I feel that more will be needed.  In this area a central concern is of course that of achieving an improvement in the flow of credit to SMEs. To an extent this would generally not be considered part of the remit of the financial regulator, conflicting as it can so easily with the requirement of safety and soundness, but wearing my wider hat as Governor, it is right that I should be alert to possible policy changes that might help here. To be sure, the financial restructuring of the banks will help set them on a course that gives them not only the financial resources but the incentive to focus on new business, but experience elsewhere shows how slow recovering banks are to get lending going smoothly again.  We know that credit is not growing and that spreads have widened. At least some of this reflects the poor creditworthiness in present market conditions of many loan applicants. The difficulty is that second-guessing banks on their credit appraisal decisions and on their pricing of credit risk is, under present circumstances, fraught with threats to the Exchequer, which will largely absorb any additional credit losses incurred by the banks. This is a challenge for which I have found no ideal solution. It may be that the banks could improve their loan appraisal technology: there have been many advances in this area in other countries, which have not been fully exploited by our banks given their concentration in recent times on property-related lending. Perhaps the credit review system announced in the budget, with its comply or explain mechanism, if well implemented, can be the catalyst for such improvements.  4. Understanding what happened The failures of the Irish banking system have rocked the economy and the public finances, with severe effects impacting almost all members of society. As the acute phase of crisis management and resolution draws to a close, it is time to start thinking how we might learn the lessons about our society that an understanding of the crisis can give us. Now that we have the prospect of the banks emerging, in the coming months, with a strong financial underpinning and renewed management, an imminent recurrence does not seem to be on the cards. We understand some of what happened, but some of it is still hard to understand. At the Central Bank we have, I believe, taken important lessons on board and are making significant improvements in the way financial regulation and financial stability work is conducted. I expect that the Oireachtas will, in time, decide to authorise some form of inquiry to try to understand the deeper, underlying causes of this crisis so that wider lessons can be learnt for the future. In considering how best to do this, I suggest that new models need to be explored. The crisis is not simply a question of discovering who did what and who knew what. Uncovering the deep roots of the crisis will require expertise and broad social scientific understanding more than merely forensic skills.  
BIS Review 166/2009 1 Gane A Simbe: Developing strategies for talent management in Pacific Public Services – the challenges of the current environment Speech by Mr Gane A Simbe, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Solomon Islands, at the 7th Pacific Public Service Commissioners’ Conference, Honiara, 29 September 2009. *      *      * Introduction Distinguished Public Service Commissioners, invited dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you for inviting me to share some thoughts towards this challenging topic on your theme: “Developing Strategies for Talent Management in the Pacific Public Services”. My talk will focus on The Challenges of the Current Environment that Pacific Islands countries face concerning brain-drain and suggest some observations to stimulate your discussions on this issue. Definitions In the context of my presentation, I will define the terms “challenges of the current environment” in two senses. First, is the challenge faced by Public Service Commission on how to manage, the “high flyer” individuals with talents and skills, who can choose to seek better value for their skills than working for the Public Services if their expectations are not met. This freedom to choose to leave, and seek opportunities elsewhere, renders the Public Service Commission powerless to stop and can leave shortfalls in the service delivery of the government. The second angle of my definition refers to the question of affordability that Public Service Commissioners and their governments face in trying to compete in the skills market for the best, skilled and talented workers; those with skills and talents that a country wants to retain for its national interests. Affordability is one of the key solutions for retaining, and attracting clever and skilled professionals but affordability is one of the major problems for most Pacific Island Public Service Commissions. Skilled and talented professionals are scarce resources Like all other resources, skilled and talented professionals for us in the Pacific are a scarce resource, and require proper management. Despite the fact that the training of these talented professionals are the outcomes of government strategic planning and budgets, unfortunately, the governments or the Public Service Commission for that matter, do not have the control over how the individuals exercise their rights and freedom to market their skills and talents. We also know that companies and organizations outside of the public service too are looking for these skilled and talented professionals. These organizations know that success or failure in achieving their business goals and delivering of their products or services is depended on employing the right skills. As a consequence there is competition among organizations for skilled and talented professionals. And they are prepared to pay for the skills and talent they require. So the challenge faced by the Pacific Public Service Commission is to be able to compete in the skills market for the best people with the talents to enable delivery of government services, needed by the citizens. 
2 BIS Review 166/2009 Management of a skilled and talented employee is a difficult undertaking Management of skilled and talented employees is not an easy task. As Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones in an article titled –“Leading Clever People” (Harvard Business Review, March 2007) observed, talented people are difficult to manage and please. They are restless; they are easily bored, they want to solve problems and not interested in pleasing their bosses or are led by them. They resent bureaucratic bottlenecks that slow or delay them from achieving their results. Skilled and talented people know that you as an employer cannot go without them. They know how much their skills are worth in the market; because they are members of their professional bodies that supply them with market information for their skills. They cannot be fooled too with fancy titles and positions that do not come with attractive remuneration packages. Lastly, skilled and talented employees are always hunted down by companies and organizations that are prepared to pay more for their skills than what you are currently paying them. Our own experience in the Central Bank of Solomon Islands demonstrates the difficulties of managing clever people. For years we have been spending a good portion of our budget directly sponsoring our officers to receive Masters Degree level education from Universities in Australia to meet the skill gaps that we have identified to enable the Bank meet its legal mandate to conduct its monetary policy responsibilities. Unfortunately, we have lost most of these individuals to organizations who offer more for their talents than what we can offer. Indeed it is not a good feeling when you have invested millions of dollars to train an officer but leaves without due regard for what you have done for him as an individual. But this is the challenge and the cost of the freedom and mobility of the educated individuals to choose the best deals for their skills. As noted in the World Health Organization (WHO) presentation to Ministers of Health for Pacific Countries held in Samoa in 2005 that examined why Pacific Health Personnel migrate, unless the conditions are favorable, skilled professionals will leave because of low pay, poor working conditions, shortage of supplies and equipment; and lack of or limited educational opportunities for professional development and advancements. In Solomon Islands, there is currently a Special Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry looking at the quality of health services provided by our National Referral Hospital. What is obvious from the hearings is that the shortages of skilled doctors, health professionals, equipments and instruments are the causes of our poor health service delivery and unfortunately this is directly linked to the question of affordability. The challenge of affordability This leads me to the second challenge facing Pacific Public Service Commissions regarding skills and talent management. It is the challenge of affordability. It is the ability of the Public Service Commission to be able to match what the market is willing to pay and attract the skills and talents that it wants to retain in its workforce. Unfortunately, the question of affordability is not as easy an option to some, if not, most Pacific Island countries because of resource constraints of their economies. The amount of money available to governments from their tax bases is not sufficient to offer attractive remuneration packages to compete in the skills market and meet other pressing social services for the population at large. Furthermore, the Public Service is already the largest employer in many of the Pacific Island countries, and reducing the numbers of Public Service employees in order to make savings to hire the most needed skilled workers can be counterproductive, especially if you are dealing with public servants who are members of a strong and influential trade union. 
BIS Review 166/2009 3 The effects of the global economic recession that countries in the region have experienced since the last half of 2008 have also compounded the difficulties faced by small island countries to the question of affordability. Until the global economy recovers, the small island economies in the region grow; there will be tremendous pressure to raise tax revenue to finance the human resources needs and other operational costs of our countries. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) in its Pacific Monitor report released in August this year, projects that five of the Pacific economics will experience negative growth this year and one country will not grow at all. What this means is that governments in the region are continuously under pressure to raise the revenue to provide the needed social services to their population. Economies do not grow overnight and the impact of the global economic recession and the projected negative growth will affect the affordability of Pacific Islands governments to compete for the best skills and talents required by their Public Services. What can Public Services Commission do to manage this problem? So, what can Public Service Commissions in the Pacific Islands countries do to resolve this question of brain-drain which really is a question of affordability? If our governments can pay the remuneration packages like other competitors, we might find the answer to the question. Otherwise governments in the region will need to be creative in finding ways to manage this issue. I offer the following suggestions for your considerations. First, Public Service Commissioners must break the rules when setting the remunerations packages for skilled and talented professionals or employees that the Public Service must employ to deliver the services needed by the community. The Public Service Commissioners and their respective governments must remunerate those with needed talent and skills equal to the market remuneration package others are prepared to pay for the same skills. In other words, the pay structure for talent and skills identified as essential for effective delivery of government services and policy goals must be different from the general public servant pay structure. (May be a good “break the rule” option is to apply George Orwell’s famous line in his book Animal Farm…“all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.” So that we can restate it as “all public servants are equal, but some public servants are more equal than others”.). Whilst all this sounds possible, I must warn that it is not an easy option to take in an environment where there are strong unions representing the interests of their members and where affordability is not easy to come by. But social service delivery to the public suffers if those specialized skills are not available because the country cannot afford to pay for them. The second consideration is for the Public Service Commissioners to be more creative in creating an employment environment that would attract skilled and talented people to want to work for the Public Service. I call these the non monetary factors, although funds must be spent to make them happen. Public Service Commissioners must provide clean and attractive office environment for the officers to work in. This includes the provisions of proper equipments that can enhance productivity. Shorten the length of time it takes to hire successful candidates: skilled and talented people cannot wait for months to receive their letter of acceptances. They will find employment somewhere else if we are slow to process their engagement. Ensure that your newly recruited workers do not have to wait for months before they are put on the payroll and paid for their services. It is demeaning for a professional with family members waiting months for his pay to be processed. Talented and skilled workers just 
4 BIS Review 166/2009 cannot tolerate inefficiency that our bureaucratic procedures unfortunately require to be adhered to. Public Service Commissioners and their supporting technical teams must continuously scan the market to ensure that the remuneration of those with talents that are required is within the market price for the skills and talents. This means actively involved in communicating with the professional bodies that represent the interests of the public service employees to ensure that their concerns are addressed in an honest and professional manner. Public Service Commissioners must actively ensure that their officers are rewarded for their performance, and benefit from organized trainings that would enhance the officers’ abilities. These can be challenging issues, because they will certainly mean securing more finance and changing of procedures. But if Public Services must compete for the best talents in the market these are necessary changes to tackle as part of their strategies for talent management in the Public Service. Conclusion In conclusion, the challenge faced by Pacific Public Service Commissioners in addressing brain-drain and managing the mobility of talented and skilled professionals is made more difficult when affordability is the key barrier. Graeme Dobel of ABC Radio Australia sums the issue in stating that “a free person with skills is still a free person”. We are dealing with free individuals whose choices to market their skills to bring the maximum benefit to themselves will cause them to leave their Public Service employment. Public Service Commissioners must therefore be creative in finding solutions for attracting and retaining talented individuals. This means we must have to make some necessary changes in the manner we handle the remuneration packages and working conditions for the skilled and talented professionals we want to attract and retain. Thank you for listening and I wish you all success in your conference. References Asian Development Bank, 2008. Pacific Monitor, WWW.adb.org/Pacific Monitor.

BIS Review 166/2009 1 Ric Battellino: Some comments on bank funding Remarks by Mr Ric Battellino, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the 22nd Australasian Finance & Banking Conference, Sydney,16 December 2009. *      *      * I would like to thank Michael Davies, Anna Brown and Tegan Hanrick, who undertook the research for this talk. One of the widely drawn lessons from the financial crisis is that banks should source more of their funding from deposits and less from short-term debt markets.  I want to spend some time today talking about this, focusing in particular on:  • how significant are the benefits of such a shift?  • how feasible is it for banks to shift their funding sources?  • what is the impact on banks’ cost of funds? and  • what are the implications for the level of interest rates?  Bank funding  Banks in Australia have reasonably diverse funding bases: deposits account for 43 per cent of funding, split fairly evenly between households and businesses; domestic capital markets provide a further 19 per cent of funding; and foreign capital markets 28 per cent. Securitisation and equity account for 3 per cent and 7 per cent of funding respectively (Graph 1).  Graph 1   Since mid 2007, the share of banks’ funding that has come from deposits has risen by 5 percentage points, with increases in both household and business deposits. Banks have used these funds to replace some of their short-term capital market debt. The increased use of deposit funding has been evident in both the major banks and in the regional banks. The foreign-owned banks, in contrast, have experienced a fall in the proportion of funding coming from domestic deposits (Graph 2). 
2 BIS Review 166/2009 Graph 2  How stable are bank deposits? Assessing the relative stability of banks’ various funding sources is not straightforward, as there can be significant variation even within each category of funding. For example, government-guaranteed deposits are “stickier” than non-guaranteed deposits, household deposits tend to be stickier than corporate and institutional deposits, while internet deposits are less stable than other at-call deposits. Deposits from corporates and other financial institutions are unlikely to be much more stable than short-term debt, particularly in a crisis. Offshore capital market funding can be less stable than domestic capital market funding, as during crises investors often have a strong home bias.  The behavioural maturity of a given funding source can also be very different from the contractual maturity, especially during financial crises. It is the behavioural maturity that matters most, and during a severe crisis this can shorten significantly for many funding sources. This is because banks can come under pressure to allow term deposits to be redeemed early and to buy back short-term capital market debt. While a bank could try to enforce the contractual maturity on its funding, the reality is that, unless the bank is already in great difficulty, this could draw attention to itself and accentuate its problems.  Another issue is that the behaviour of new depositors attracted through more competitive pricing may also be very different from that of existing depositors. These new deposits are likely to be more price sensitive and less stable. The benefit, in terms of funding stability, which comes from increasing deposits through competitive pricing, may therefore be somewhat illusory.  How do Australian banks compare internationally? There is a common perception that banks in Australia make less use of deposits to fund themselves than do banks in other countries. However, the difference between Australian banks and their overseas peers is sometimes exaggerated by inconsistencies in the data across countries.  Table 1 contains some data the Reserve Bank has put together on deposit funding for the major banks in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. We have tried to make the data as consistent as possible although they are probably still a long way from being fully consistent. The data show that, contrary to popular 
BIS Review 166/2009 3 perception, the share of funding from deposits for the major banks in Australia is similar to that for the major banks in Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.1  Table 1 Share of domestic and foreign deposits in total funding1 December 2008, per cent  Major banks Australia 61 Canada  77 Germany  56 Japan  69 United Kingdom  60 United States  56 1  Data based on the major banks in each country. Deposits include CDs. Total funding equals total liabilities, excluding derivative liabilities.  Sources: central banks, national statistical agencies, banks’ financial statements, Standard and Poor’s, RBA.  Another commonly quoted metric used to support the case that Australian banks are underweight deposits is the relatively high ratio of loans to deposits in Australia. The ratio for the major banks in Australia is around 130 per cent, whereas in most overseas countries the ratio varies between 80 per cent and 100 per cent (Table 2). However, as I have noted, this is not due to Australian banks having lower deposit funding. The high ratio of loans to deposits reflects differences in asset composition. Banks in Australia mainly have loans on the asset side of their balance sheet, whereas banks overseas often have large holdings of debt securities. This results in a higher ratio of loans to deposits in Australia. But, rather than being a weakness, I would regard this as a strength of the Australian banks, as events of the past couple of years have shown that holdings of securities can be more risky than loans. Table 2 Ratio of loans to deposits1 December 2008, per cent  Major banks Australia 131 Canada  91 Germany  97 Japan  79 United Kingdom  89 United States  96 1  Data based on the major banks in each country.

To allow international comparisons, the figures for deposits in the table include CDs and are for the banking group, and hence include overseas as well as domestic operations. The denominator used to measure total funding is on-balance sheet liabilities (excluding derivatives) rather than total funding including equity and securitisation. 
4 BIS Review 166/2009 How far can banks lift their deposit ratios? An individual bank has a large amount of discretion in the way it funds itself, as it can bid more aggressively for the type of funds it wants and compete them away from other banks. The banking sector as a whole, however, has much less flexibility. For the banking sector as a whole to increase its use of deposit funding, it needs to be able to induce a shift in the structure of the financial system away from financing through capital markets to on-balance sheet funding through the banking sector. Put another way, for the banking system as a whole, the share of deposits in total funding can increase only to the extent that investors reduce their holdings of securities and place the proceeds on deposit with banks.  There are limits to the extent this can happen since there are a range of structural, economic and cultural factors that shape the composition of a financial system, and these do not change quickly. In fact, the trend in most economies is for savings over time to move away from simple instruments such as bank deposits towards debt securities and equities.  To try to shift savings back to deposits would require a reversal of these trends, and there must be doubts about how feasible that would be. There is also the question of whether it would be sensible from the point of view of the overall functioning of the economy and the financial system.  As I noted earlier, over the past year Australian banks as a whole have managed to increase the share of their funding that comes from deposits. However, the bulk of this occurred during the period of high risk aversion late last year and early this year, when investor perceptions were that bank deposits were safer than debt securities and unit trusts. Over the past six months, as risk appetite among investors has returned, the deposit funding share of banks has stopped rising. It would seem that banks have largely exhausted the available opportunities to induce investors to increase their holdings of bank deposits. The so-called “deposit war” among banks is producing very attractive interest rates for depositors but little net benefit for the banking system as a whole in terms of increasing deposit funding.  What is happening to the cost of deposits? The increased competition by banks for deposits has added substantially to their cost of funds. It used to be the case that on average banks paid about 125 basis points less than the cash rate on deposits. Now they are paying interest rates that are on average in line with the cash rate (Graph 3). In the case of term deposit “specials”, which are the main vehicle through which banks are currently competing for deposits, interest rates can be as much as several hundred points above the cash rate. Graph 3  
BIS Review 166/2009 5 Table 3 shows how the cost of various types of funding for the major banks has changed, relative to the cash rate, since the start of the financial crisis in mid 2007. It shows that the cost of new deposits has risen on average by 147 basis points relative to the cash rate over that period. This rise was mainly driven by an increase of about 250 basis points in the relative cost of term deposits. The cost of short-term debt relative to the cash rate has not changed much over the period, while the cost of new long-term debt has risen by 173 basis points relative to the cash rate. Table 3 Estimated change in cost of new funds relative to  the cash rate – major banks Since July 2007  Basis points Deposits  147 – transactions 250 – savings  36 – term  250 Short-term debt (incl CDs) 13 Long-term debt  173 Total 108 Source: RBA.  The table indicates that the push by banks to increase the share of their funding that comes from deposits has added substantially to their costs. At the same time, the cost of long-term debt has risen sharply relative to the cash rate because of the global crisis.  These changes in banks’ cost of funds relative to the cash rate have meant that the relationship between bank lending rates and the cash rate has also become looser. It is difficult for banks to adjust their lending rates in line with changes in the cash rate when the cost of their funds is rising substantially relative to the cash rate.  We estimate that if banks had not adjusted their lending interest rates to reflect their higher cost of funds over the past couple of years, they would now be incurring losses (Graph 4). That would have threatened their ability to keep raising funds and, in turn, their capacity to lend. In the event, early in the financial crisis, banks did not pass on all of the increase in their cost of funds, but recently increases in lending rates have run ahead of the cost of funds. Banks’ margins are now a little wider than at the start of the crisis, and therefore are adding to profits. 
6 BIS Review 166/2009 Graph 4  The margin between the cash rate and banks’ lending rates receives considerable public attention. This is understandable because changes in it are very visible. This margin, however, can change for many reasons, so it is difficult to interpret. A widening in it might be due to banks making unjustified increases in their lending rates, or it might reflect market developments that have pushed up banks’ cost of funds relative to the cash rate.  Some have argued that variability in this margin means that monetary policy is less effective. This, however, misses the very important point that the Reserve Bank takes account of the changing relativities between the cash rate and other interest rates when setting the cash rate. Other things equal, if interest rates in the economy are rising relative to the cash rate, there is less need for the cash rate to rise.  The more relevant margin is that between the average interest rate on bank loans and the average cost of the funds used by banks to finance their loans. This is usually referred to as banks’ net interest margin.  Between 2000 and 2007, the net interest margin on the major banks’ Australian operations had narrowed by about 100 basis points (Graph 5). This was driven by competition, and was made possible by sizeable reductions in banks’ operating costs over that period, which allowed banks to continue operating profitably despite falling margins. Graph 5  
BIS Review 166/2009 7 As I mentioned, early in the financial crisis, the banks’ net interest margin was squeezed further, as the cost of funds rose sharply and banks did not fully pass this on to interest rates on loans. Over the past year or so, however, margins have widened again, and they are now about 20 basis points above pre-crisis levels.  This recent widening in the net interest margin has been largely due to wider margins on banks’ business lending. The margin on variable housing loans is much the same today as it was at the start of the crisis; it had fallen until recently and the increase in home loan interest rates in December restored it to around its pre-crisis level.  Margins on business loans, however, are now substantially higher than they were immediately before the crisis. This comes after a prolonged period when margins on business loans had narrowed.  Margins on business loans tend to vary over the economic cycle, reflecting changes in perceptions of risk by banks. During periods of a strong economy, banks tend to cut their margins as they see business loans as being less risky. In contrast, when the economic and business outlook is uncertain and loan losses are rising, as has been the case over the past couple of years, banks see loans as being more risky and margins widen.  With the economy and business climate now improving, the economic justification for wider margins on loans is becoming less compelling, so it would be reasonable to assume that, in a competitive banking sector, we should see margins level out soon. Over the past couple of months, there have been some signs that this is starting to occur.  What does this mean for monetary policy? As I have noted, over the past couple of years, the interest rates that matter in the economy – the rates on housing and business loans and the rates on deposits and debt securities – have all risen relative to the cash rate (Graph 6). The Reserve Bank has taken these changing relativities into account in its monetary policy decisions.  Graph 6  One of the implications of doing so, however, is that it has altered the relativity of the cash rate compared with its historical ranges. I want to end with a few words on this, and what it means for the interpretation of monetary policy settings.  
8 BIS Review 166/2009 As you know, the cash rate is currently 3.75 per cent. This is still 50 basis points below the previous cyclical low of 4.25 per cent in 2001. On the surface this might suggest that the cash rate is still unusually low. However, with other interest rates in the economy having risen by at least 100 basis points relative to the cash rate over the past couple of years, they are now above their previous cyclical lows.  Another way to think about this is that the current level of deposit rates, housing loan rates and business loan rates would have been consistent, before the crisis, with a cash rate of at least 4.75 per cent.  Taking these considerations into account, it would be reasonable to conclude that the overall stance of monetary policy is now back in the normal range, though in the expansionary segment of that range.  The appropriateness of this will be monitored by the Reserve Bank over the months ahead in the light of the data becoming available on economic activity and inflation. 
BIS Review 165/2009 1 Jean-Claude Trichet: Systemic risk Text of the Clare Distinguished Lecture in Economics and Public Policy by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, organised by Clare College, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, 10 December 2009. *      *      *  Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to have been invited by Clare College, Cambridge, to give this lecture in economics and public policy. One of the greatest challenges for economics and public policy at this time is to restore financial and economic stability, and to improve the future functioning of financial systems. A pre-condition for meeting this challenge is a deep understanding of the nature of systemic risk. And that is the topic I have chosen for this lecture. Systemic risk in Europe’s financial system is a very important issue for the European Central Bank. And as an institution of the 27, through its General Council in particular, the ECB is one of the continent’s guardians of economic stability. We are charged in particular with maintaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term. But the ECB is also an active participant in the new agenda of financial stability. As you will be aware, restoring financial stability and containing systemic risk in the future are at the heart of the supervisory and regulatory reforms currently being discussed here in Europe and elsewhere.  I am particularly pleased to give this lecture at Cambridge University, which has been an intellectual “powerhouse” for centuries. It is said that the university has more Nobel Prize winners associated with it than any other institution.  Perhaps the most well known Nobel Laureate from Clare College is James Watson, who, together with Francis Crick, derived the structure of DNA. DNA incorporates the building blocks of life. As the recent instability illustrates, we economists still need to achieve as clear an understanding of the building blocks of financial systems – not simply the institutions small and large that populate them, but also the fundamentals of the rules and incentives that drive their behaviour; and, particularly, how they combine and interact with each other in the presence of amplification mechanisms stemming from leverage and other forces.  Let me mention two more recent Nobel laureates in economics whose work relates to my topic today. In 1996, James Mirrlees of Trinity College won the Nobel Prize for his contributions to the economic theory of incentives under incomplete information. In 2001 Joseph Stiglitz, who spent time in Cambridge in the 1960s, won the Prize for his analysis of the functioning of markets when information is asymmetrically distributed.1 I shall argue in my lecture that such information problems and the incentives that they provide for economic behaviour are one important element in the phenomenon of systemic risk, and therefore in the wide transmission of financial instability.  The nature of systemic risk So what is systemic risk? In the context of our natural environment, it is the threat that the actions of millions of individuals, all acting in pursuit of their own interests, can cause a breakdown of the world’s ecosystem, a global catastrophe which will ultimately damage                                                  1  Stiglitz, J.E. and A. Weiss (1981), “Credit rationing in markets with imperfect information”, American Economic Review. 
2 BIS Review 165/2009 everyone. This, of course, is the topic of the international climate change negotiations this week and next in Copenhagen. Similarly, in the context of our economic environment, it is the threat that developments in the financial system can cause a seizing-up or breakdown of this system and trigger massive damages to the real economy. Such developments can stem from the failure of large and interconnected institutions, from endogenous imbalances that add up over time, or from a sizable unexpected event. A seizing-up of the financial system ( or large parts of it ( is what we experienced last autumn. The consequence was an economic freefall, a surge in unemployment and a massive increase in public debt.  So what is it about financial systems that make them prone to systemic risk? The financial system is composed of intermediaries, markets and the infrastructure of payment, settlement and trading mechanisms that support them. Intermediaries are connected with each other through direct transactions, as in interbank markets, and through similar investment and financing decisions with third parties such as other intermediaries or end investors.  Financial markets, in turn, are connected with each other through the trading activities of financial intermediaries and through end investors active in more than one market. Systemic risk within the financial system relates to the risk that these inter-connections and similarities render emerging financial instability widespread in the system. Even if the original problem seems more contained, important amplification mechanisms can be at work.  This complex network of financial connections is extended through the savings and financing needs of all economic sectors, notably non-financial firms, households and the government. By reallocating savings from individuals and sectors with a surplus of funds to individuals and sectors in need of funds, the financial system plays a central role in the economy. So, systemic risk, in a broader sense, relates to the risk that widespread instabilities in the financial system translate into adverse effects on growth and welfare in the economy at large. How is it that financial instability can be triggered by initially self-contained events, which are then transmitted so widely that the fallout ultimately reaches systemic dimensions?  ECB research by Philipp Hartmann and others, which has investigated systemic risk for at least a decade, suggests that there are three particularly important ways in which this can happen.2  The first is contagion. The failure of one financial intermediary can lead to failures of other financial intermediaries, even when the latter have not invested in the same risks and are not subject to the same original shock as the former.3  Second, widespread financial imbalances can build up over time and then unwind abruptly. Hyman Minsky described how in good times consumption and investment increase, generating income, which fuels the financing of more consumption and investment but also the neglect of increasing risks. Even small events can then lead to a re-pricing of risk and an                                                  2  See de Bandt, O. and P.

BIS Review 165/2009 3 endogenous unravelling of the credit boom, which then adversely affects many intermediaries and markets at the same time.4  Third, negative aggregate shocks can adversely affect intermediaries and markets simultaneously. Historical research has shown that many banking crises were related to economic downturns.5 Note that the three mechanisms can happen independently or they can reinforce each other.  There are a number of features of financial systems that make them particularly prone to these forms of systemic risk. Let me just highlight three key ones.  The first pervasive feature of financial systems is what we call externalities. They particularly relate to the complex and dynamic network of exposures among major intermediaries. What in tranquil times is an efficient mechanism to share risk, can, in times of stress, become a dangerous channel for transmitting instability. Two contracting parties do not have an incentive to take account of the effects of their risk-taking on third parties. As a consequence, the risk at the level of the system may be higher than the sum of individual risks.  The second key feature of financial systems is asymmetric information. Financial systems allocate funds from agents who have them but possess no specific knowledge about promising investment opportunities, to agents who have knowledge about the opportunities but not the funds to engage in them. This creates an agency problem between the two parties, which may be handled more or less well through the underlying financial contracts. If contracts are incomplete and negative news arrive on some of the investment projects, but information asymmetries do not allow lenders to judge whether this also affects other investment projects, funding may evaporate for all projects alike.  The special nature of financial systems is not simply characterised by the presence of these two imperfections. Externalities and information problems are also present in other economic sectors. The additional problem in the financial system is that they can result in the third feature: powerful feedback and amplification mechanisms, which render their implications more severe and widespread. Illiquid assets, maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities and leverage amplify the force with which problems of one intermediary are pushed through the complex network of exposures. Sizable amounts of debt relative to capital and short-term funding have more dramatic effects in situations of stress.  For example, intermediaries’ losses can trigger “fire sales” of already largely illiquid assets, which reduce their values and cause losses to other intermediaries, as for example described in research on contagion by Hyun Shin and his co-authors.6 Moreover, funding and market illiquidity can reinforce each other, leading to vicious liquidity spirals multiplying the initial shocks.7 These effects are further amplified due to asymmetric information. In the aggregate, they lead to the nonlinear adjustments that are so characteristic of financial instability. The fact that such adjustments are nonlinear is particularly important for research and makes                                                  4  Minsky, H.

4 BIS Review 165/2009 modelling extremely difficult.8 Such adjustments may cause violent regime changes, pushing the system from a state of tranquillity to a state of turmoil.  One key element in phases of turmoil and crisis is speed. The rapidity of unfolding developments is often not modelled explicitly, but it is one of the greatest challenges for policy makers. Financial crises are by no means new phenomena, but the speed of their transmission has accelerated tremendously over the past few decades. While the unfolding of the sovereign debt crises in the 1980’s occurred over the course of years, the Asian Financial crisis developed, at its peak, over months rather than years. The last intensification of the present crisis, starting in mid-September last year, has spread around the globe in the course of half-days. Many factors have contributed to this acceleration, including the process of global financial integration, the increasing leverage in institutions, the technological advancements that allow for an instantaneous transmission of information world-wide and the accumulation over a long period of time of unsustainable global imbalances. In the eco-systems of our natural environment, feedback mechanisms are often prevalent, too. As soon as one part of the system is adversely affected, this can take the form of an adverse feedback look destabilising the system as a whole.  Amplification effects are not only important in the transmission of instability, but also in the build-up of imbalances that sow the seeds of systemic risk. A very important phenomenon in this regard is herd behaviour in investment. For example, investment managers and loan officers may sometimes ignore valuable private information in order to mimic others when their own evaluation, their own remuneration or their own external reputation depends on their performance relative to the rest of the market.9 This behaviour is individually rational but socially wasteful. Here at the University of Cambridge, the famous analogy that John Maynard Keynes made between newspaper beauty contests and financial market behaviour comes to mind.10 I am also convinced that one of the main reasons behind herd behaviour in financial markets in general, particularly in times of crisis, is a lack of transparency. The fostering of transparency as concerns financial institutions, financial markets and financial products is therefore one essential policy lesson from the present crisis. Our latest experience with systemic risk Let me now apply the relevant elements of this framework on how to think about systemic risk to the present crisis. A particularly relevant source of systemic risk was the build-up of widespread financial imbalances – the second form of systemic risk I described – in the period of 2003 to 2007. The years prior to 2007 were characterised by low financial market volatility and risk premia, rapid financial innovation in credit markets, low interest rates across the maturity spectrum and ample liquidity conditions.  In particular, rapid financial innovation led to securitisation techniques with thus far unknown complexities and to long and uncontrollable chains of intermediaries between originators and final investors. Ratings agencies gained global power as the pricing of securitisation tranches was largely based on their assessment, while leverage mounted ever higher and a shadow banking system developed up largely unregulated.                                                   8  For a recent example, see O. Castrén and I.

Stein (1990), “Herd behaviour and investment”, American Economic Review. 10  He noted that competitors did not have to pick “those faces, which he himself finds prettiest, but those that he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors” (Keynes, J.M. (1936), “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money”, Macmillan Cambridge University Press). 
BIS Review 165/2009 5 At the same time, mark-to-market accounting rules became increasingly widespread, while unsustainable external deficits and surpluses in some major economies paved the way for macroeconomic imbalances at the global level. Information began to flow instantaneously around the globe and raised competitive pressure on all financial market participants.  In this environment, banks and other investors engaged in a “search for yield” with the help of the new credit products and investment vehicles, circumventing existing regulations. The pace of this herd behaviour into ever more complicated forms of securitisation far exceeded the market’s capacity to solve a number of open issues of valuation, risk management and incentives.  The result were widespread financial potential instabilities in the form of a highly complex, opaque and – as it turned out later – illiquid system of credit risk distribution. Many investors were either ignorant or imprudent with regard to the risks that they had acquired. Contrary to conventional wisdom, this distribution led to much less diversification than thought and to some surprising concentrations of risks in a number of large and complex financial institutions. While mortgage market exposures, including those in US sub-prime mortgages, were part of the problem, it later turned out that the problem of bad assets was much more widespread.  The underlying risks started to materialise when house prices declined, delinquencies in US sub-prime mortgage markets rose, and the so-called “special purpose vehicles” that held highly concentrated exposures to these markets came under pressure. In June and July 2007, credit default swap premia started to increase sharply, rating agencies downgraded a large number of asset-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations. Even AAA-rated CDO index tranches declined below par value.  The eventual instability became systemic for the first time when money markets became impaired in early August 2007. The re-pricing of risks made the major intermediaries active in interbank markets aware that they might experience further losses in the future and that the same might apply to their counterparties. Given the lack of transparency of the credit risk distribution system, asymmetric information was omnipresent. It became difficult for intermediaries to distinguish good assets and counterparties from bad ones.  This led banks to hoard liquidity as a protection against the risk of their own assets and counterparties becoming illiquid, rather than lending available funds in money markets.11 Such malfunctioning of the interbank markets makes the problem immediately systemic, as all major banks depend on those markets. For central banks, there was no alternative to making sizable liquidity interventions aimed at keeping the system afloat.  While this first phase of what we described at the time as “market turmoil” was indeed very challenging, the dramatic transition to a full-blown systemic crisis happened in September 2008. The failure of a very large US investment bank, in conjunction with other news and a series of events that increased uncertainty, led to a widespread loss of confidence in the financial system.  As a consequence, the economic outlook worsened dramatically. The economic models in use were not able to predict the sharp downward revisions of growth figures that followed over the subsequent seven months.  The events of September 2008 clearly showed that in economic policy, we have no good understanding of the very rapid transition to an eventual systemic crisis. In this sense, we                                                  11  See, for example, Cassola, N., M. Drehmann, P. Hartmann, M. Lo Duca and M.

6 BIS Review 165/2009 were left alone. Policy-makers had to rely on informal information, real-time data releases and their own wisdom and judgements on how the situation was evolving.  What have we learned from this experience in terms of identifying those structural trends in financial systems that are important for systemic risk?  First, we need much more analysis of the implications of the business models of major intermediaries for the system as a whole. Some of the crucial factors, whose relative importance has shifted over time, include originate-to-distribute models, rising maturity mismatches and the combination of proprietary trading and investment advice.  Second, in line with previous experiences we have been reminded that the very fast growth of innovative financial instruments and new financial intermediaries, in particular off-balance sheet vehicles, can imply significant risks.  Third, financial integration needs to be accompanied by reform of supervisory and regulatory approaches and institutions. Major reforms in this area are currently being discussed in the European Council and European Parliament, including the establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board.12  Fourth, advancing financial consolidation raises the question of how to regulate and, in the event, wind down large and complex financial intermediaries whose disorderly failure could pose systemic risks.  Fifth and finally, as financial sectors develop, households may take greater risks, for example in mortgage markets and, more broadly, in their pension investments. While this also raises issues of consumer protection, from a systemic perspective, it becomes increasingly important to know how resilient the household sector and consumption can be in such a situation.13  Macro-prudential supervision: a policy response to systemic risk  I have discussed the nature of systemic risk and our latest experience of it in the present crisis. Let me now turn to the question of how policy-makers can respond to systemic risk. Today, I want to focus particularly on the challenges for policy-makers of detecting risks of systemic instability materialising in the future, and of then containing these risks.  Detecting systemic risks early is the task of macro-prudential supervision. I would like to focus on the analytical issues underlying this policy and stress three approaches, linking them to the three forms of systemic risk I discussed at the start of my lecture.  First, there are large and complex financial intermediaries, or like-minded clusters of financial institutions, that play prominent roles in the financial system. We can describe them as particularly important “nodes” in the financial network, which stand out through their risk, size and interconnectedness.14 The full understanding of their individual on- and off-balance sheet exposures and their lending and borrowing to each other is a crucial element in assessing and containing risks of contagion.                                                   12  High-level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU (2009), “Report”, Brussels, 25 February (de Larosière Report); EU Commission (2009), “Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on Community macro prudential oversight of the financial system and establishing a European Systemic Risk Board”, 23 September. 13  Ferguson, R., P. Hartmann, F. Panetta and R. Portes (2008), “International financial stability”, 9th Geneva Report on the World Economy, November, discuss the structural trends that preceded the crisis. 14  See Leitner, Y. (2005), “Financial networks: Contagion, commitment, and private sector bailouts”, Journal of Finance, for an application of network theory to the problem of financial contagion. 
BIS Review 165/2009 7 Second, the extent and diversity of investment practices across all segments of the financial system requires particular attention. For example, fast-growing credit to similar sectors or regions could be a sign of vulnerabilities building up. The imbalances might become unsustainable later and unravel in a disorderly fashion. This risk requires looking at early-warning signals in current market data. For example, aggregate credit might grow at a pace that is disproportionate to the credit required to finance sustainable investment and consumption. The complete set of important intermediaries, markets and instruments also needs to be checked for early-warning signals, since similar risks could be hidden in different parts of the financial system.  Third, current market data may not give the full picture of all relevant future scenarios. Detecting systemic risks early also requires stress-testing the system against extreme events and shocks that would surprise markets. Such macro-stress tests help to make an assessment of the resilience of financial systems against shocks that have a low probability but a highly destabilising power.15 Compared to the vision of systemic risk that I have outlined so far, two weaknesses of the supervisory and regulatory approach that we had before the crisis stand out. For one thing, the old approach focused too much on individual risks and too little on interconnections across intermediaries and markets. For another thing, it generated a lot of information about some types of intermediaries but much less on others (including the shadow banking system). This made it difficult to understand fully the pro-cyclical behaviour of the system in the aggregate.  Even if we understand the nature of systemic risk and know the basic approaches for detecting its different forms, there are very important challenges for macro-prudential supervisors. One challenge is to be able to collect all the information that is necessary to identify systemic risks early. It requires combining some micro-level data with and aggregate data from components of the financial system. This means covering major types of intermediaries, in particular large and complex ones, key markets and wholesale market infrastructures. To contain systemic risk, macro-prudential supervisors need to have a good understanding of all parts of the financial system that are relevant for the risks of contagion, the endogenous build-up and unravelling of widespread imbalances and macro shocks. Some of these data are more difficult to compile and bring together than others. There are some financial sectors about which considerably less is known than about others. Compare, for example, banks or insurance companies with non-listed highly leveraged institutions. Although nowadays individual hedge funds do not seem to be a source of significant systemic risk, it is very important that the relevance of this industry for the overall cyclicality of the financial system is assessed. A particularly complicated topic is measuring the interconnectedness among the systemically most important intermediaries.  The implication is that an effective exchange of information between the functions of macro-prudential supervision and micro-prudential supervision is an essential element of identifying and containing systemic risk. There will be strong demands on micro and macro-prudential supervisors to ensure smooth exchange of information under the post-crisis regulatory and supervisory regime we are striving to establish.  Another challenge is more of an analytical nature. The economic models we have at our disposal at present do not capture necessarily all relevant dimensions of systemic risk. For example, despite progress in developing macro-stress testing frameworks, there are still                                                  15  Sorge, M. (2004), “Stress-testing financial systems: An overview of current methodologies”, BIS Working Paper, no. 165, July. 
8 BIS Review 165/2009 limitations in how economic analysis captures the two-sided interaction between financial instability and the performance of the broader economy. Standard macroeconomic models often do not have a well developed financial sector and are linear in nature. As I have noted, systemic instability involves major nonlinearities and, in any case, cannot be analysed without proper representation of the financial sector.16  There are many good finance approaches to the topic of financial instability, but they are often not aggregate enough to capture realistic features of the macroeconomy, including for example the conduct of monetary policy. Speaking here in the intellectual “powerhouse” of the University of Cambridge, I therefore call on the academic research community to make major efforts towards a better integration of financial and macroeconomic analyses to address these limitations.17 A final challenge is given by the policy instruments available to contain systemic risks beyond monitoring and warning about them. Macro-prudential regulation is a relatively new policy area. We have much experience of how micro-prudential regulation affects the stability of financial intermediaries and markets. A much more complex matter is using regulatory tools to stabilise the financial system as a whole.  Having said that, I nevertheless see very encouraging discussions and progress on this front. For example, the 2009 Geneva Report on the World Economy on “The fundamental principles of financial regulation” points the way to how regulators can determine higher capital requirements for financial intermediaries that exhibit features enhancing systemic risk.18 Additional capital for interconnectedness, leverage, maturity mismatch and asset growth will limit the scope for the externalities I was discussing before.  New initiatives are also under way to enhance the transparency of financial activities. These will help to limit the adverse effects of imperfect and asymmetric information on systemic stability. Overall, a great deal of work is going on at the Financial Stability Board, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and at other competent bodies to strengthen the macro-prudential dimension of financial regulation. As with climate change, an effective policy response demands international coordination. Global warming has been called the biggest market failure ever; the present crisis has been perhaps the biggest financial market failure ever. We know from basic theory and practice that addressing market failure requires a major and coordinated policy response, both immediate and in the longer term.  Systemic risk and macroeconomic stabilisation policies  I have identified the endogenous build-up and subsequent unravelling of financial imbalances, as driven for example by herd behaviour in investment, leverage to finance investment exposures and complex and opaque financial contracts, as a particularly relevant                                                  16  It should be mentioned that the macroeconomic currency contagion literature discussed the transmission of breakdowns of fixed-exchange rate regimes with some nonlinear elements. See, for example, Eichengreen, B., A. Rose and C. Wyplosz (1996), Contagious currency crises: First tests, Scandinavian Journal of Economics; Buiter, W., G. Corsetti and P. Pesenti (1998), “Interpreting the EMS crisis: Country-specific and systemic issues”, Princeton Studies in International Finance; Masson, P. (1999), “Contagion: Macroeconomic models with multiple equilibria”, Journal of International Money and Finance; Drazen, A. (2000), “Political contagion in currency crises”, Krugman, P. (ed.), Currency Crises, National Bureau of Economic Research and Chicago University Press. Exchange rate surveillance as such, however, is typically outside the scope of macro-prudential supervision. 17  The Economist (2009), The state of economics, 16 July; Krugman, P.

BIS Review 165/2009 9 form of systemic risk. While macro-prudential supervision is at the forefront of preventing severe asset bubbles from emerging, this may not be sufficient, given the macroeconomic components of cycles. Therefore, macroeconomic stabilisation policies need to make their contribution to reducing pro-cyclicality.19 Macroeconomic authorities have faced the challenge posed by financial booms and busts in two ways.  First and foremost through solid institutions: the pre-emptive arm against system instability. Stability-oriented macroeconomic frameworks have ensured price stability and economic prosperity in all developed countries for the last quarter of a century. Demand and real incomes have grown steeply, but steadily. Their steady course has instilled a wide sense of security in investors and savers.20 The European stability culture can be seen as vindicated by the crisis.  However, macroeconomic stability has not been a sufficient condition for financial stability. It cannot eliminated systemic risk altogether. Macroeconomic authorities have therefore been frequently called on to provide remedial action, once booms have turned into busts. The aim of their action has been precisely to avoid the transformation of individual financial risks into systemic risk.  Ex post remedial action has often been activated as soon as the financial firestorm has threatened the stability of the economic system. But such action risks raising expectations that macroeconomic policy will always insure against tail risks, no matter how large. Expectations of this sort can contribute to an under-pricing of financial risk in subsequent phases of the financial cycles. They can encourage concentration of market positions in the financial scene.  At the same time, the instruments of counter-cyclical policy have been used so intensely – and more so from one financial cycle to the next – that authorities might have tested the extremes of their control procedures. I am borrowing here from dynamic control theory. Repeated attempts to fine tune a mechanical or electronic system after a shock sometimes leads to “instrument instability” that makes the system spiral out of manageable bounds.21 Economic and financial systems, I suspect could have some structural similarities with physical systems, leading to the same kind of “instrument instability”.  Moral hazard and policy instrument instability pose questions to which we are not in a position to a firm answer at this point in time. I would like to see these questions studied and debated in eminent academic institutions like this. Turning to actual developments, as I mentioned already, we saw perhaps the most appalling manifestation of such a threat in the autumn of 2008. In the early phase of the present financial crisis, precautionary hoarding of liquidity brought to a complete seizure of many segments of the market for credit. At the same time, panic sales of assets made market liquidity disappear. Market liquidity is high when traders can easily find a price, and that price                                                  19  See also Viñals, J. (2009), “On Monetary and Financial Stability – Past, Present And Future”, keynote speech delivered at the at the 28th SUERF Colloquium on “The Quest for Stability” at the Utrecht University School of Economics. 20  I have discussed the two-way interactions between steady macroeconomic conditions and trends in financial prices elsewhere. See Trichet, J.-C. (2008), “Risk and the Macro-economy,” keynote address at the Conference “The ECB and its Watchers X,” Frankfurt, 5 September 2008. 21  I am referring in particular to control theory as applied to economics by the engineer A. W. Philips in the 1950s. See Philips, A.W. (1957), “Stabilisation policy and the time form of lagged responses,” Economic Journal, 67, 265–277. But I do not forget that a very early attempt to import the phase transition notion into social science resulted in Friederick Engels’ famous “law of the transformation of quantity into quality”, described in his (circa 1883) work Dialectics of Nature, which provides some insight into early attempts to grapple with concepts now considered reasonably well understood. 
10 BIS Review 165/2009 is very close to what every other trader pays for the same asset at the same time. In early October 2008 the market could simply not find a value for many of those securities that had been so highly priced only few weeks before.  To avoid a cascade of counterparty defaults, governments offered generous financial guarantees and injected fresh capital into the system. Central banks increased their lending to replace the withdrawal of private lending – in interbank transactions and, sometimes, in the broader market for capital. This concerted intervention very much attenuated the downward part of the cycle and blocked channels of financial contagion. In short, it provided catastrophe insurance.  There is no doubt that macroeconomic policy-makers’ interventions have had a stabilising effect. Market compensation for risk has gradually returned to more normal levels. The free-fall of the economy has been halted and turned around. The financial crisis has not precipitated the extreme spiral of falling prices, rising debt burdens and chain bankruptcies that some economists had feared.  For what concerns monetary policy, conditions are now stable enough that we can start to withdraw some of the excess support that is now not needed to the same extent as it was in the past.22  Concluding remarks Let me draw to a close. An English proverb, echoed in many other languages, warns that sometimes, “you can’t see the wood for the trees”. Systemic risk is about seeing the wood, and not only the trees. Macro-prudential supervision, supposed to detect systemic risk and propose remedial action, has been devised because in a highly integrated and complex financial system, micro-prudential supervision alone can no longer guarantee financial stability. The main challenge in systemic risk analysis is therefore to integrate all relevant perspectives, including those of economists, supervisors, regulators, accountants, securitisation experts, rating experts, risk managers and many others to take a holistic view on the system, its dynamics and its interlinkages.  As we have seen, small things can make a big difference and seemingly self-contained initial events can lead to a system collapse. We therefore need a detailed understanding of each part of the financial system. At the same time, their complex interactions mean that we need to keep the big picture in sight, too. We must not allow the understandably narrow focus of detailed knowledge to hamper insight into the system as a whole. Like researchers on the climate and the natural environment, we need to combine the micro and macro perspectives. The academic research community can make a significant contribution in supporting policy-makers to meet these challenges. It can help to improve analytical frameworks for the early identification and assessment of systemic risks. And it can contribute to discussions on the further identification and optimal use of macro-prudential regulatory instruments.  Macro-prudential supervision is an important tool to contain systemic risks and thereby contribute to sustainable growth and prosperity. The proposed establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board next year is a very important initiative in this regard. Ensuring systemic stability will also alleviate undue pressures on monetary and fiscal policies to extend financial safety nets. The standard macroeconomic stabilisation policies can then focus more clearly                                                  22  I have drawn out the ECB’s strategy in the face of the financial crisis and our strategic plans on the way back to normalisation on several occasions in the past few months. On the ECB’s approach to the crisis, see for example my keynote address at the University of Munich, “The ECB’s enhanced credit support,” Munich, 13 July 2009.

BIS Review 165/2009 1 Mojmír Hampl: European integration – a critical economist’s view Speech by Mr Mojmír Hampl, Vice-Governor of the Czech National Bank, at the Europe at Sixty: 1949–2009, Metropolitan University, Prague, 20 November 2009. *      *      *  Ladies and gentlemen, Let me first express my deep gratitude to the organisers for inviting me to give this keynote speech today. And do not take it as a standard, politically correct opening sentence. I really mean it. For me it is quite a rare opportunity to speak frankly and openly on such an important topic, which the process of European integration certainly is, and to speak more as a scholar than a policy-maker. So I will try to do my best and to be outspoken enough to provoke questions and comments after I finish. Therefore, the usual disclaimer is more relevant than ever this time: my opinions are not necessarily the opinions of my employer. I think European integration is a process that provides a lot of food for thought for many social scientists. I will try to approach the topic from the point of view of an economist, but also a citizen and a mere mortal, sharing with you some of my concerns as to how the process of European integration has been evolving so far and where it is most likely heading. These concerns are supported by the fact that as a member of the EU’s Economic and Financial Committee, I can watch the integration process every day on-line as an insider, so to say. The title of this conference stresses the fact that European integration started 60 years ago. You know that exactly 60 years ago a completely different project, originally aimed to build up something “brand new”, also appeared quite far away from Europe – in China. What irony of fate that after these sixty years it is now the Chinese who seem to be on their way up, running fast, while the European Union is stagnating or even descending economically. What bitterness, when one realises that on its way up, China is still a desperate and crazy communist regime that has just allowed its citizens a bit more freedom in the area of economic life. Of course, a part of the explanation lies in the fact of simple economic convergence. But without any doubt, the EU is losing its momentum. Not just now, in the crisis; this is a longer process. In the EU it seems to me that we have started concentrating more on conservation or preservation of the existing wealth, rather than on wealth creation. The question of why the European Union is not as economically powerful and efficient as it would like to be, is certainly complex. However, my suspicion is that one of the answers is that the EU has started concentrating too much – and in many areas almost exclusively – on the process of deeper and deeper political integration. It is almost a mainstream ideology which states that the answer or solution to virtually any problem in the EU is more integration. Whenever we discuss problems with colleagues in Brussels, the mainstream view typically argues: we need more EU integration to solve this. And if integration has not brought what we hoped for, it means we need even more integration. We probably did not have enough of it. Well, I have some doubts about this approach, at least as regards the impact of political integration on the economy. The concept is based on a simple idea that the bigger the state, or the bigger the economy, the bigger also the wealth of the citizens of such a state or economy. This idea fails terribly when compared with simple statistics and facts. If you take a look at the correlation between the size of an economy and a measure of well-being such as GDP per capita, you will see that on average the bigger, or more populous, economies in the world are not generally richer economies. Rather, it is small open economies (including those in Europe) that tend to be richer, the only exception to this rule being the United States. So bigger does not mean richer. 
2 BIS Review 165/2009 My own hypothesis is that instead of integration of jurisdictions, competition between them might sometimes be more beneficial to economic growth. Countries should compete for investors, capital and labour force by making their tax systems, legal frameworks and other conditions as efficient and friendly as possible. Competition is sometimes useful not only on the markets, but also among jurisdictions and states. Political integration can, at some point, become an obstacle to competition, sometimes even intentionally. I think that the EU is, unfortunately, right now at this stage. What a shame. And why is that? Well, when we choose the path of political integration, we have to watch out carefully for certain pitfalls – and I am not sure we have been careful enough in this respect. A major pitfall is the effect that we can observe whenever a group of people or institutions hires someone else to do a job for them. In economics, we call it the principal-agent model, or we say that a group of principals hires an agent. The idea is that the agent will follow the directions of the principals. A simple example: the shareholders of a company choose a manager to run their company. But sometimes it happens in this model that the agent tries to turn the power structure around and to switch from one who simply follows directions to one who deliberately sets the agenda. This effort can often be successful because the agent is a relatively small group of people who hold all the relevant information and share very similar motivation, while principals tend to be much more numerous and less informed and their objectives are often highly differentiated. And so, corporate managers are often able to push through their will even if it goes against the interests of many shareholders; international organisations often take steps that their founding members do not like to see; and by the same token the EU administration is able to shape the integration process in ways that differ from what many member states previously intended. To give you just one banal illustration of this process: the remuneration of employees of international organisations and of Eurocrats is invariably higher than the remuneration they would be able to earn in similar positions at home. Therefore, the principals watch – with little joy, of course – a brain-drain in favour of their agent. Thus, an agent gets dominance over its principals and principals even contribute to this dominance. The observation that agents try to become more powerful than their principals is usually considered to be beyond the boundaries of political correctness, so we rarely hear about it. The same holds for another hindrance to proper execution of the European integration idea, namely the asymmetry among different principals, that is, among different member states of the EU. In itself, a difference in the weight of a small state and a large state may make sense; but if certain EU member states have a much bigger informal impact than others on the positions that the EU takes in international political or economic forums, the big-impact states may be tempted to “nationalise” the voice of the EU. Many attempts at nationalisation of EU positions are due to what might be called the “French complex”: Some leaders of bigger countries still have not fully absorbed the fact that their country is no longer the superpower it used to be and no longer leads the world, so they often try to abuse their EU-wide voice to support their national interests, positions and agenda. When they call for Europe to speak with “one voice”, they often seem to expect that the single voice of 500 million EU citizens will be the voice of their national leaders, articulating their national tastes and priorities. Of course, the agent, the European Commission as an executive arm of the EU, also sometimes has this temptation to define or steal the voice of the EU. Needless to say, the risk that proper integration will be derailed is particularly high when the two effects mentioned above are combined – when the EU administration ceases to behave as an agent of the less powerful principals but remains under the spell of a few very strong principals. It is fairly understandable that certain EU member states support the current, rather non-transparent way of modifying the institutional set-up: it is the only way for them to maintain or even strengthen the draconian mix I just described. 
BIS Review 165/2009 3 Given that European integration is taking place in this “European” way (in the bad sense of the word), it is no wonder that standard democratic politics has not left the national level: all formally EU-wide ideas are always translated in each individual member state into the local political context; there are no true EU-wide political parties, no true EU-wide politicians, no true EU-wide media. The debate in EU institutions rarely follows the lines that we are used to in standard political debates, such as whether we want more freedom or more redistribution. Instead, most time is spent, as I said, on procedures and institutions. The official efforts at gradual political integration thus give the impression of squaring the circle. These awkward traits in politics at the EU level then lead to some perverse implications. On the one hand, measures which would help Europe to retain a strong economic position – and here I mean especially liberalisation of markets and trade – take years or even decades to implement: the single market for services still does not exist and even the single market for labour still has fundamental exemptions. The celebrated Lisbon Strategy has turned into a farce; many of the structural reforms that it outlined would be beneficial economically, but few of them have been realised or at least enforced by the agent, the European Commission. On the other hand, the EU institutions have repeatedly shown an ability to produce bizarre pieces of legislation that would hardly ever be passed at the national level in any given member state. The famous Czech writer Milan Kundera would probably call it the “unbearable lightness of legislating”. So my suspicion is that the EU is now in a position where it is easier to integrate than to liberalise. And these are two different things in terms of long-term economic growth, as I have argued. What a shame for the EU and for us. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS Review 165/2009 1 Deepak Mohanty: Global financial crisis and monetary policy response in India Speech by Mr Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 3rd Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations-Internationale Weiterbildung und Entwicklung (ICRIER-InWEnt) Annual Conference, New Delhi, 12 November 2009. *      *      *  The assistance provided by Shri Bhupal Singh is gratefully acknowledged. I thank ICRIER and InWEnt for giving me this opportunity to speak with you this morning. In my talk, I will try to address the following set of questions: How and why was India impacted by the global financial crisis? How did monetary policy respond to the crisis? What was the impact of the policy on the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet? How did monetary transmission work? I will conclude by highlighting the challenges of exit from monetary easing.  2. The subprime crisis that emerged in the US housing mortgage market in 2007 snowballed into a global financial crisis, and a global economic recession followed. The financial landscape has changed significantly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. An important lesson, post-September 2008, is that irrespective of the degree of globalisation of a country and the soundness of its domestic policies, a financial crisis could spread to every economy.  3. The international transmission of liquidity shocks was fast and unprecedented. While falling asset prices and uncertainty about valuation of the traded instruments affected market liquidity, failure of leading global financial institutions and the deleveraging process tightened the market for funding liquidity. Given the growing risk of illiquidity cascading into solvency problems, credit and quantitative easing acquired priority in most central banks. While the global financial markets have since started showing signs of stabilisation, credit flow in advanced markets is yet to recover. The contagion from the global financial crisis warranted swift monetary and fiscal policy responses with a view to ensuring orderly functioning of markets, preserving financial stability, and moderating its adverse effects on growth.  How was India impacted by the global financial crisis? Transmission of shocks to India  4. There were two distinct phases in 2008–09 during which the transmission of global shocks – through trade, finance and expectations channels – posed different but significant challenges for the Reserve Bank. In the first half of the year, the world experienced simultaneous increase in both food and commodity prices, and there was a return of inflation after a phase of “great moderation”. Dealing with supply side sources of inflation posed challenges for the conduct of Reserve Bank’s monetary policy, particularly in the face of signs of cyclical slowdown on the one hand and the risk of spiralling headline inflation on the other. In the second half of the year, the global financial crisis and the subsequent global recession dramatically changed the nature of the challenge emanating from globalisation.  Impact on the financial markets 5. Post-Lehman, the impact of the global financial crisis unfolded in the Indian financial markets, though reversal of capital inflows and significant correction in the domestic stock markets on the back of sell-off in the equity market by the foreign institutional investors (FIIs). The withdrawal of funds from the Indian equity markets and reduced access of the Indian entities to raise funds from the international markets put significant pressure on the dollar 
2 BIS Review 165/2009 liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market. These developments created adverse expectations on the balance of payments (BoP) outlook and led to depreciation pressures on the Indian rupee and increased volatility in the foreign exchange market.  6. The banking sector was not affected as it had hardly any direct exposure to subprime assets. Moreover, banks were well capitalised and inherently sound. The reduced foreign funding and the subdued domestic capital market, however, put pressure on some segments of the financial system, such as non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) and mutual funds. Mutual funds were dependent on corporates for bulk funds. As liquidity needs of the corporates increased, redemption pressures on mutual funds rose. This translated into liquidity problems for NBFCs as mutual funds were important supplier of funds to NBFCs. Further, the demand for bank credit also increased as external sources of credit dried up for corporates. Against this background of increase in demand for liquidity, the Reserve Bank had to step in with liquidity augmenting measures such as cuts in cash reserve ratio (CRR) and increase in refinance facilities. Consequently, the pressure for funding liquidity came to rest on the banks. In this scenario, the banks continued to expand credit and meet the funds requirements of mutual funds and NBFCs aided by liquidity easing measures by the Reserve Bank. Initially, though bank credit could not fully offset the shortfall in credit from other sources. Subsequently, demand for bank credit came down as the contagion transmitted to the real economy and eroded private consumption and investment demand.  Impact on the real economy 7. Under the impact of external demand shocks, the Indian economy witnessed moderation in growth in the second half of 2008–09 in comparison with the robust growth performance in the preceding five years (8.8 per cent per annum). The deceleration in growth was particularly noticeable in negative growth in industrial output in Q4 of 2008–09; a decline for the first time since the mid-1990s (Table 1). This was on account of erosion of external demand which affected industrial performance; a reflection of increasing globalisation of the Indian industry. 8. The transmission of external demand shocks was swift and severe on export growth, which declined from a peak of about 40 per cent in Q2 of 2008–09 to (–) 15 per cent in Q3 and further to (–) 22 per cent in Q4; a contraction for the first time since 2001–02. Concurrently, domestic aggregate demand also moderated resulting from sharp deceleration in the growth of private consumption demand. In order to respond to the slowing demand, fiscal stimulus measures were undertaken by the government which included both tax cuts and increase in expenditure. This raised the fiscal deficit of the Central Government by 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2008–09. Consequently, the growth in government final consumption expenditure registered a sharp increase in Q3 and Q4 of 2008–09 (Table 2). It is, however, important to note that unlike many countries the entire fiscal stimulus in India was aimed at addressing the deficiency in aggregate demand rather than extending support to the financial sector. While this meant a deviation from the planned fiscal consolidation path as committed under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, without the stimulus the deceleration in GDP growth during 2008–09 would have been much sharper.

4 BIS Review 165/2009 Why was India impacted by the global financial crisis? 9. During the initial phases of the global crisis, the Indian financial markets remained unaffected as the direct exposure of banks to global subprime assets was negligible. The growth process being largely domestic demand driven remained broadly intact. It was then perceived that India and other EMEs were “decoupled” from the advanced economies. As indicated by Governor Dr. Subbarao “the ‘decoupling theory’ was never totally persuasive”.1 As the crisis intensified, particularly after the Lehman collapse, the global shocks first impacted the domestic financial markets and then transmitted to the real economy through the trade and finance and confidence channels.  10. Despite the dominance of domestic demand, the role of trade in conditioning the growth process in India is becoming important over time. A significant boost to global integration came through rapid growth in India’s international trade in services in the 2000s enabled by expansion in information technology which facilitated cross-border delivery of services. Progressive liberalisation of capital account initiated in the 1990s and continued through the 2000s gave further fillip to the process of financial integration. Thus the financial channel emerged as dominant factor with gross capital flows (inflows plus outflows) rising to over 50 per cent of GDP in 2008–09 from an average of about 5 per cent in the 1980s (Table 3). Given the significant degree of openness achieved since the 1990s, it is natural that the global shocks – real as well as financial – have greater impact.  Table 3: Key indicators of openness of the Indian economy (Per cent of GDP) Gross Current Year Goods Trade Services Trade Gross Current Account Gross Capital Account and Capital Account 1 2 3 4 5 6 1970s 10.0 1.3 12.7 4.2 16.9 1980s 12.7 2.5 17.2 5.4 22.6 1990s 18.8 4.1 26.7 15.1 41.8 2000s  (2000–09)  29.3  9.7  45.0  32.7  77.7 2008–09 40.2 13.2 60.5 51.0 111.5  11. With increased global integration, the Indian economy now is subject to greater influence of global business cycles. The correlation between the cyclical component of the index of industrial product (IIP) of the advanced economies and India has risen to 0.50 during the period 1991–2009 from 0.20 in during the period 1971–1990 (Chart 1).                                                  1  See Dr. D.

The traditional conduit of transmission of global shocks is trade cycles. The cyclical movement in India’s exports and world imports during the earlier period 1970–91 was not significantly synchronised with a relatively low correlation of 0.38. However, with rising exports along with a transition from primary article exports to manufacturing exports, the correlation between India’s exports and world imports has increased significantly to 0.80 during the recent period 1992–2009 (Chart 2).

Besides the synchronisation of the trade cycles, the financial channel of integration has also become prominent during the recent period. A causal analysis between the cyclical component of the Indian stock prices (BSE Sensex) and the US stock prices (S&P 500 Index) reveals that during the earlier period (1970–1991), when foreign investors could not participate in the Indian stock market, there was no causal effect of the global stock prices on the Indian markets. However, in the recent period (1992–2009), there has been greater impact from the global stock prices on domestic stock prices with the US stock prices having significant causal impact on the Indian stock prices (Table 4).

These shifts in the degree of synchronisation of the Indian trade and business cycles with the global cycles and increased financial integration in the recent period indicate that India cannot remain immune to global trends. Thus, global economic developments now have a greater influence on the domestic economy.  How did monetary policy in India respond to the global financial crisis? 15. As the crisis intensified, the Reserve Bank, like most central banks, took a number of conventional and unconventional measures to augment domestic and foreign exchange liquidity, and sharply reduced the policy rates. In a span of seven months between October 2008 and April 2009, there was unprecedented policy activism. For example: (i) the repo rate was reduced by 425 basis points to 4.75 per cent, (ii) the reverse repo rate was reduced by 275 basis points to 3.25, (iii) the cash reserve ratio (CRR) was reduced by a cumulative 400 basis points to 5.0 per cent, and (iv) the actual/potential provision of primary liquidity was of the order of Rs. 5.6 trillion (10.5 per cent of GDP). 16. There are, however, some key differences between the actions taken by the Reserve Bank of India and the central banks in many advanced countries: • First, in the process of liquidity injection the counter-parties were banks; even liquidity measures for mutual funds, NBFCs and housing finance companies were largely channeled through the banks.  • Second, there was no dilution of collateral standards which were largely government securities, unlike the mortgage securities and commercial papers in the advanced economies.  • Third, despite large liquidity injection the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet did not show unusual increase because of release of earlier sterilised liquidity.  • Fourth, availability and deployment of multiple instruments facilitated better sequencing of monetary and liquidity measures. • Finally, the experience in the use of procyclical provisioning norms and counter-cyclical regulations ahead of the global crisis helped enhance financial stability.  17. By synchronising the liquidity management operations with those of exchange rate management and non-disruptive internal debt management operations, the Reserve Bank ensured that appropriate liquidity was maintained in the system, consistent with the objective of price and financial stability. The policy stance clearly reflected the forward looking undertone, particularly the expectations of more prolonged adverse external conditions in the face of no visible risks to inflation. While the magnitude of the crisis was global in nature, the policy responses were adapted to domestic growth, inflationary and financial sector conditions.  
BIS Review 165/2009 7 How did crisis management change the reserve bank’s balance sheet? 18. As the balance of payments came under pressure in Q3 of 2008–09 due to capital outflows, it became necessary to draw down reserves to finance the shortfall and maintain orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market. This led to corresponding contraction in the base (reserve) money. The Reserve Bank, therefore, ensured the necessary expansion in net domestic assets (NDA) through conventional open market operations (OMO) involving outright purchase of government securities in the secondary market as well as provision of liquidity through repos under in its daily liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) (Chart 3). Another instrument which allowed the Reserve Bank to expand liquidity was the unwinding of the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) securities.2 The unwinding of MSS balances not only created the scope for adequate liquidity expansion by the Reserve Bank without expanding its balance sheet (Chart 4) in any significant measure, but the timing of the unwinding could also be modulated in such a way that the large borrowing programme of the government was managed smoothly without exerting undue market stress. In addition, the reduction in CRR of banks from 9 per cent to 5 per cent released Rs.1.6 trillion of primary liquidity to the banking system.

While the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet did not show unusual expansion, sharp reductions in CRR raised the money multiplier, leading to higher increase in broad money.3 The average money multiplier rose from 4.3 in March 2008 to 4.8 in March 2009, reflecting lowering of CRR (Chart 5). The increase in money multiplier ensured steady increase in money supply consistent with the liquidity requirements of the economy.                                                   2  MSS securities are essentially short-term government securities, introduced in April 2004, as an instrument of sterilisation to partly neutralise the expansionary effects of surges in capital inflows. The amount sterilised through MSS remained immobilised in the Central Government’s account with the Reserve Bank of India. As at end-September 2008, MSS amount stood over Rs. 1.7 trillion. 3  Money Multiplier can be expressed as [1+c]/(c+r], where, c is currency-deposit ratio (a behavioural variable) and r is reserve requirement ratio (a policy variable). A reduction in r leads to an increase in the money multiplier.

The liquidity injection efforts of the Reserve Bank, despite being large, could be achieved without compromising either on the eligible counterparties or on the asset quality in the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet. The liquidity requirements of non-bank financial entities were met indirectly by extending liquidity support to the designated counterparties like scheduled commercial banks and primary dealers. Liquidity expansion achieved through unwinding of MSS and reduction in reserve requirement ensured that the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet did not expand significantly, unlike in several other central banks. How did monetary transmission work?  21. In the wake of the crisis, monetary transmission broke down in several countries as risk aversion gave rise to credit crunch. As regards India, the changes in the Reserve Bank’s policy rates were quickly transmitted to the money and debt markets (Chart 6). The money market rates moved in tandem with the policy reverse repo rate. However, transmission to the credit market was slow due to several structural rigidities in the system, especially the dominance of fixed term deposit liabilities in banks’ balance sheets at fixed interest rates.

As bank deposits contracted in the past at high rates have started to mature and banks have significantly reduced their term deposit rates, the transmission of lower policy rates to the credit market has improved with a lag (Chart 7).  Chart 7:  Deposit and lending rates of public sector banks  What are the challenges of exit from monetary easing? 23. There is an active debate on the timing and sequencing of expansionary monetary stance around the world. In this context, Governor Dr. Subbarao, in his J.R.D. Tata Memorial Lecture had indicated that the current monetary and fiscal stance is not the steady state. The exit from the current monetary policy accommodation could, however, be different across countries depending on the balance of risk to growth and price stability, type of balance 
10 BIS Review 165/2009 sheet adjustment that have taken place during the crisis and the position of the economy in the business cycle. In the case of advanced countries, where central bank balance sheets have expanded substantially including the portfolio comprising of mortgage backed securities, commercial papers and corporate bonds, the exit policies may be constrained by the speed of revival and developments in the specific market segments. In contrast, the central bank accommodation in India was mainly done through unwinding of MMS and conduct of OMO including LAF and through special refinancing facilities in the banking system. Thus, the withdrawal of monetary accommodation in India should be feasible without adverse impact on specific market segments. 24. The October 2009 Review of Monetary Policy for the Year 2009–10 brought forward the challenges. To quote:  “The precise challenge for the Reserve Bank is to support the recovery process without compromising on price stability. This calls for a careful management of trade-offs. Growth drivers warrant a delayed exit, while inflation concerns call for an early exit. Premature exit will derail the fragile growth, but a delayed exit can potentially engender inflation expectations…. The balance of judgment at the current juncture is that it may be appropriate to sequence the “exit” in a calibrated way so that while the recovery process is not hampered, inflation expectations remain anchored. The “exit” process can begin with the closure of some special liquidity support measures.”  Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has begun the first phase of “exit”, by withdrawal of most of the unconventional measure taken during the crisis.  Conclusion 25. To sum up, despite sound fundamentals and no direct exposure to the sub-prime assets, India was affected by global financial crisis reflecting increasing globalisation of the Indian economy. The policy response has been swift. While fiscal stimulus cushioned the deficiency in demand, monetary policy augmented both domestic and foreign exchange liquidity. The expansionary policy stance of the Reserve Bank was manifested in significant reduction in CRR as well as the policy rates. The contraction of the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet resulting from the decline in its foreign assets necessitated active liquidity management aimed at expanding domestic assets, which was ensured through OMO including regular operations under the LAF, unwinding of MSS securities, introduction of new and scaling up of existing refinance facilities. In addition, sharp reductions in CRR besides making available primary liquidity raised the money multiplier and ensured steady increase in money supply. The liquidity injection efforts of the Reserve Bank could be achieved without compromising either on the eligible counterparties or on the asset quality in the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet. Moreover, the Reserve Bank’s balance sheet did not show unusual increase, unlike that of several other central banks.  26. At present, the focus around the world and also in India has shifted from managing the crisis to managing the recovery. The key challenge relates to the exit strategy that needs to be designed considering that the recovery is as yet fragile but there is an uptick in inflation, though largely from the supply side, which could engender inflationary expectations. Thus, the Reserve Bank has initiated the first phase of exit in its October 2009 Review of monetary policy in a calibrated manner mainly by withdrawal of unconventional measures taken during the crisis. This should help anchor inflationary expectations by reducing the overhang of liquidity without jeopardising the growth process as market liquidity remains comfortable.  Thank you. 
BIS Review 164/2009 1 Jean-Claude Trichet: Interview with De Tijd and L’Echo Interview by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, with De Tijd and L'Echo, Belgium, conducted by Messrs Wouter Vervenne, Wouter VanDriessche, Marc Lambrechts, Luc Charlier and Serge Quoidbach on 4 December 2009 and published on 10 December 2009. *      *      * Is the euro area now definitely out of recession? If so, will the expected recovery be sufficiently strong to create jobs? Jean-Claude Trichet: The second quarter of this year saw the end of the period of free fall in terms of growth. This very difficult period lasted two full quarters following the intensification of the crisis in mid-September 2008 (editor’s note: following the collapse of Lehman Brothers). As of the third quarter of 2009 we have been experiencing positive growth again. This will be the case in the fourth quarter, too. According to the projections of the Eurosystem staff, average growth next year should also be positive, albeit still modest. And with a level of uncertainty – and I should like to stress this point – that remains very high. This is related to a number of factors, primarily international. As regards employment, taking into account the “lags” usually observed after periods of recession, we could see an increase in unemployment even with growth rates returning to positive territory. We must therefore act with determination to strengthen confidence. Indeed, it was confidence that was so dramatically lacking following the events of September 2008. All of our actions today within the Governing Council of the ECB are aimed at strengthening the confidence of households and firms in the medium term. Were you aware that this confidence would be so difficult to re establish? In a cycle such as this, the decline is often much steeper than the recovery, which is slower. Hence the importance, for us, of: (i) assuring our fellow citizens that we are able to ensure price stability and thereby defend their purchasing power; and (ii) convincing firms that the financial environment will continue to incorporate a low level of inflation in the years to come, which will be reflected in medium and long-term market interest rates. Last Thursday the ECB announced the progressive phasing-out of its extraordinary measures. Does this mean that market conditions are now completely back to normal? Moreover, analysts view the details announced for the 12-month refinancing operation as a signal regarding interest rates. We always said that our non-standard measures – i.e. the measures adopted in order to take account of the highly irregular situation in the markets – would unwind naturally as the situation improved. The measures announced last Thursday reflect the improvement observed in the markets. On the question of signals regarding rates, I want to be extremely clear. The intention of the Governing Council was to give no signals at all on interest rates. We consider that the current level of interest rates is appropriate. It was therefore appropriate to index the rate on the 12-month operation. We considered that this was the best way of confirming that we had no intention of giving signals on interest rates today. I believe that the market has understood this message well. Is the banking sector in sufficiently good health, in your view? Is the worst now behind us? In this respect, too, we have experienced a dramatic period. I should first like to stress the fact that Europe as a whole – governments, national parliaments, European institutions, etc. 
2 BIS Review 164/2009 – has overcome unprecedented challenges since the Second World War. We have managed to avoid the kind of dramatic events experienced on the other side of the Atlantic. In an intense period of stress, the European apparatus, which is extremely complex, has proved resilient. This is very rarely acknowledged. And yet, it must be said that the European ship has succeeded in weathering the storm. This was in no way self-evident. Saying that, we must not allow ourselves to become complacent. We still have much to do in order to strengthen the balance sheets of financial institutions – and commercial banks in particular. We encourage them to act with determination in strengthening their balance sheets. Those institutions can turn to the market. But they can also retain their profits as reserves instead of distributing them. I believe, moreover, that a very high degree of caution should be demonstrated with regard to remuneration and the awarding of bonuses – both for ethical reasons, to avoid excessive risk-taking, and for reasons related to the need for banks to have sound finances. All of the considerable steps taken by central banks and governments – and thus by taxpayers – have had one single objective: to allow banks to continue to perform their function, which is to finance the real economy. The banks have to live up to their responsibilities. Paradoxically, haven’t some banks, such as BNP Paribas, become too big as a result of this crisis? Does that not pose a new threat? The question of knowing whether or not certain institutions in Europe and in other parts of the world are so large or so interconnected that they represent additional systemic risks is an important question which is being considered at the international level. There are various ideas on this subject. But nobody can deny that if a financial institution finds itself in a situation where it poses high risks to the whole of the system, and here it is not necessarily a question of size, it is appropriate to take measures to limit these risks.  We also have to act in such a way that the financial system as a whole is less fragile. We are working towards this, in line with the guidance of the G20. From this point of view, I am quite reassured to see that there is a global consensus, including among the emerging economies such as China or India. It is a matter of increasing the resilience of the financial system without calling into question the market economy. We all want the market economy, which produces wealth, to be much less fragile and less subject to the formation and subsequent bursting of bubbles. So this consensus is reassuring. But we have to succeed also. We all have an obligation to obtain results. I do not think that taxpayers would again accept to take the major risks that they have now taken to rescue the system. Isn’t it risky to announce already a gradual withdrawal of the exceptional liquidity measures? The Governing Council – made up of twenty-two members including myself and Guy Quaden, Governor of the Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique – must at all times carefully assess the risks of the situation. There are risks associated with unwinding too quickly the non-standard measures that we have taken, and there are risks involved with unwinding them too slowly. I could say the same thing about monetary policy itself or about fiscal policy. In any event, you have to very carefully assess all of the risks that you are taking without having an a priori bias in one direction or another. Experience has shown us how dangerous it can be to focus on short-term concerns to the detriment of economic stability and prosperity in the medium to long term. This is why central banks are independent. In this regard, at the beginning of 2004, in the same week, three Heads of State or Government asked the ECB to lower its interest rates: the German Chancellor, the President of the French Republic and the Italian Prime Minister. The Governing Council of the ECB refused to do this, clarifying that it was not warranted to reduce further interest rates, which were at the level of 2%, without putting at risk price stability in the medium term. Similarly, ten out of the twelve euro area governments publicly criticised our interest rate rise at the end of 2005. Today, there is no longer anybody suggesting that we were wrong in 
BIS Review 164/2009 3 taking the decisions that we took. This shows how strong the tendency around us is to concentrate on the short term. At last Thursday’s Governing Council meeting, we confirmed that the level of interest rates was appropriate, and we took measures to initiate gradually our strategy to exit from the crisis, while continuing to provide liquidity support to the euro area banking system for a prolonged period. We will continue to be very vigilant and to carefully assess risks of all kinds without having an a priori bias. One should never lose sight of the medium and long-term objectives and concerns.  Weren’t you expecting the banks to support the economy more? Everything that we have done, and are continuing to do, to facilitate the refinancing of banks, we are of course doing so that the banks can perform in the best possible way their function of financing the real economy. Our message to them is very clear: there must not be any significant financing difficulties resulting from the supply of credit by financial institutions. This said, the demand for credit is sluggish at the moment, which is always the case after a serious recession. Overall, we are seeing a decline in the outstanding amount of loans to non-financial corporations, owing in particular to decreasing credit demand from firms. With regard to households, outstanding credit has once again risen during the most recent months.  Aren’t you concerned to see that, on the one hand, the banks are hurrying back to the markets, once again fuelling what some people consider to be financial bubbles, and, on the other hand, are being strongly urged to lend more? One should beware of making overly simplistic judgements. The sector that we are looking at is not homogenous. Some market players seem to have completely forgotten that only a few months ago, the entire financial system was in the process of collapsing, and it was the speed and scope of the decisions of central banks, as well as governments and parliaments, which allowed us to avoid a catastrophe. These players are fortunately in the minority. The financial system as a whole understands that it is essential to do everything possible to increase the robustness of the global financial system. Are you pleased with the agreement among finance ministers on strengthening bank, insurance and market supervision at the supranational level? Some say that too much power still rests at the national level. I would like to pay tribute to the Swedish Presidency for its remarkably active, clear and very professional handling of this extremely difficult issue. Achieving a consensus among the governments of 27 countries on subjects as complex as the European Systemic Risk Board, on the one hand, and the three European micro-prudential supervisory authorities, on the other hand, is a successful outcome for the Swedish Presidency, acting on the basis of the relevant proposals by the European Commission. As is well-known, the proposed solution was not necessarily the best in the eyes of all the parties involved. It is not precisely what we ourselves suggested initially. However, it has the advantage of representing a consensus of the governments themselves. The European Parliament will now consider this matter and I have every confidence in the efficacy of its efforts.  Will you indeed be the President of the Systemic Risk Board, as has been suggested? As you know, the President of the European Systemic Risk Board will be elected by the members of the Board once it has been set up. The question is a little premature. In the United States, there is a great deal of debate concerning the Federal Reserve Act. There is talk of ending the Federal Reserve System’s supervision of large banks. Are you concerned by this? Well before the eruption of the crisis in 2008 the Governing Council of the European Central Bank said that it was important to establish a close link between the central bank and prudential banking supervision. I think that the events of the past two years have confirmed the accuracy of this position. Generally speaking, I note that there is a fairly widely held belief in Europe and worldwide that it is better to have quite a close association between the 
4 BIS Review 164/2009 central bank and prudential supervision. I have found this to be particularly evident in Belgium – and this shows the confidence placed in the Nationale Bank van België/Banque National de Belgique and its governor – but also in a great many other countries.  I would be amazed if the current debate in the United States were to lead to a Federal Reserve System that no longer had a close link with micro-prudential supervision, since this does not appear to me to be the lesson that should be drawn from the crisis at all. I would add that the ECB has very close and confident relations with the Federal Reserve System.  The IMF has warned that there are still many toxic assets on banks’ balance sheets. Is this a problem that will re-emerge at some point? I think that there are two issues. First, there is the question of the toxic assets that were revealed when the crisis erupted – the “sub-prime mortgages” in particular – and that still remain on balance sheets. This is a serious issue, although it is not perhaps the most important question facing us today. Second, there is the problem of the provisions that must be set up for loans granted by banks to their customers which are not repaid when due, owing to the crisis. I am confident that the European commercial banks will be equal to the new challenge thanks to their profits and also thanks to the reserves and provisions that they have already accumulated. But this is one of the reasons why we urge them to take every opportunity to strengthen their balance sheets, because the period ahead will also be very difficult.  For some financial assets, such as gold, we are seeing a return to risk-taking on the part of investors. Is this a parameter that the ECB takes into account in its strategy? I will not make any specific comments regarding gold.  Generally speaking, one of the fundamental lessons of the crisis is that when we underestimate financial risks and focus only on the short term, we set the stage for a future catastrophe. The new principles for bank remuneration, which the international community have agreed within the framework of the Financial Stability Board, were established precisely in order to ensure that there is no incentive for operators and traders in particular to favour the most risky attitudes and decisions, leading to illusory profits in the short term at the expense of the long-term interests of the financial enterprises concerned and the stability of the financial system as a whole. We know how much banks’ balance sheets have been affected by the provisions for bad debts linked to toxic assets. Since the market for these structured products is still in difficulty, should the banks fear further write-downs on structured products? That is a good question, but I do not believe that this is the most important problem facing European commercial banks today. With regard to toxic assets, it should be borne in mind that the accounting rules play a major role in how they are entered on balance sheets. The rules differ on each side of the Atlantic. The question of harmonising the accounting rules in Europe and the United States is an important one that must also be addressed from the perspective of a fully harmonised global market for financial services.  The Dubai crisis has caused large disparities in terms of country risk in the euro area. Greece and Ireland are currently facing long-term rates which are markedly higher than in countries with European core investors. Are you concerned about the situation in these countries? The Dubai crisis is an illustration of the extent to which the global financial markets are nervous because you only need one crisis, relatively modest, to cause them to worry again. This makes me all the more convinced that we must continue to work together to increase the robustness and resilience of the international financial system. Those who believe that such efforts are futile and that we have returned to a scenario whereby it is “business as usual” are seriously mistaken.  
BIS Review 164/2009 5 That said, I am pleased about the decisions taken by the governments in the context of the ECOFIN Council with regard to the proposal by the European Commission to remedy the situation regarding their public finances. It is essential that European governments fully restore confidence in their ability to manage their public finances in a sound and sustainable manner in the long term. This confidence is a very important factor in the recovery. As regards Greece, which you mentioned, I shall simply reiterate what I said before the European Parliament: “Given the severity of the situation, I am confident that the Greek government will take the necessary and courageous measures in the near future.” The euro has remained relatively robust against the US dollar despite the fact that the US authorities say they are in favour of a strong dollar. Are you happy with the US behaviour on the currency markets? As regard the euro, and particularly with regard to the relationship with the US dollar, I repeat what I said at the press conference following the last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. I think it is very important that the US authorities, the Secretary of the Treasury, as well as the chairman of the Federal Reserve have made it clear that a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States. A strong dollar vis-à-vis the large floating currencies is also in the interest of the stability and prosperity of the global economy. Finally, what has helped you the most in managing the crisis? What has been your goal? I believe that above all, for the ECB and the entire Eurosystem, it has been our team spirit. The Governing Council, the Executive Board, the ECB staff and all the national central banks have proven their solidarity and unity under exceptionally difficult circumstances. It is because of this that we have been able, since the beginning of the period of financial turmoil, to make a prognosis which has turned out to be right and to take the appropriate decisions for the challenges we have faced. We took those decisions very quickly because we had to, without ever losing our course: that is to say price stability in the medium term, which is our primary goal. I believe that it is the ability of the Governing Council to strictly maintain its medium and long-term price stability strategy, whilst taking quick and, where necessary, unconventional decisions, which best summarises our management of the crisis. But we cannot afford to be complacent. We are still in a difficult situation which means we must always be on our guard. I have been in such situations myself many times, and it is very important to strictly maintain a long-term strategy at the same time as managing a crisis. For example, in my country in 1992 and 1993, as Secretary of the Treasury and Governor of the Banque de France, I had to pursue a long-term strategy of competitive disinflation at the same time as being faced with monetary crises in the European exchange rate mechanism. Also, as President of the Club de Paris in the 80’s and early 90’s, we pursued a strategy of long-term debt whilst managing financial crises in the sovereign countries of Latin America and Africa, in particular. At the moment, my colleagues and I believe that one of the most important goals is to be an anchor of stability and confidence for our 330 million citizens in what is an extremely difficult period. 
BIS Review 164/2009 1 Tarisa Watanagase: Prospects and challenges for the Thai economy in 2010 Dinner talk by Dr Tarisa Watanagase, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the British Chamber of Commerce, Bangkok, 30 November 2009. *      *      * Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, First of all, I would like to thank the British Chamber of Commerce for inviting me to be here tonight. It is my pleasure to join you once again at this prominent annual gathering.  Last year we had a fruitful discussion on “What determines the future of the Thai economy”. If you may recall, I imparted on the audience some words of wisdom for all policymakers, which is to smooth short-term pain, and to achieve long-term gain. Last year’s speech took care of the latter part, in which the key message was a call for collective efforts to raise the economy’s potential output in order to achieve sustainable long-run prosperity. We, however, did not spend much time on the former part as we were yet to witness the complete fallout from the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Today, we all know that our get-together last September was at the onset of the greatest economic contraction over the last 60 years. The collapse of Lehman Brothers on Sep 15, 2008 created a gigantic shockwave in the world financial markets with its ripples subsequently evolving into an economic tsunami that wiped out so much economic well-being all over the world. Its consequences are still being felt today and the focus of policymakers has, therefore, shifted to the immediate task of giving the economy a quick resuscitation and lifting it out of the short-term slump. After the crisis, foreign direct investments from the eurozone have dropped significantly. However, despite the weakness back home, the UK’s net FDI to Thailand still managed to register a positive number of approximately 48 million USD for the first three quarters of 2009. It is, therefore, to our mutual benefit for the BCCT to have a good understanding of the outlook and challenges for the Thai economy from a policymaking standpoint. This will be the mission of my speech today and I would like to proceed in the following sequence: First, I would like to start by giving you an update on the current economic development; second, I would attempt to draw an outlook for the Thai economy for the year 2010; and third, I will outline the key challenges that await the Thai economy going forward. Ladies and Gentlemen, As you all know, the Thai economy was hard-hit by a sharp drop in the external demand caused by this global financial crisis. The spillovers from the large decline in exports were far-reaching and affected all sectors of the domestic economy, with the manufacturing sector being hardest hit. Consequently, sentiment turned gloomy as more workers started to lose their jobs. To make matter worse, the escalation of internal political tensions adversely affected private consumption and investment.  With the timely implementation of accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, the world economy has seen a quicker turnaround than originally expected. The most recent economic data indicate that the world economy has stabilized. This was shown by the fact that the recession has ended in several countries with positive quarter-on-quarter growths from the second quarter onward. More importantly, financial institutions that were the origins of the crisis have appeared to become much more stable, though not yet returned to normal. This was reflected by indexes measuring concerns on liquidity and credit risks in the financial 
2 BIS Review 164/2009 market such as the 3-month Libor spread and the external debt market spread which have continued to adjust downward. For Thailand, the green shoots started to emerge in the second quarter, owing primarily to a pick-up in the world’s demand, large government’s stimulus packages, accommodative monetary policy and strong economic fundamentals. The recovery of the world economy has augured well for Thai exports as the sector has turned into an expansion of 5.3 percent in the third quarter. As a result, the manufacturing sector in the same quarter grew by 2.6 percent, while the capacity utilization rate rose from a low of 54.8 in the first quarter to reach 62.4 percent at the end of the third quarter. In addition, domestic demand has also been boosted by accommodative monetary policy and a rise in public spending, causing private consumption and investment to grow at 1.0 percent and 3.7 percent respectively in the third quarter. As a result, the overall GDP growth for the quarter came in at 1.3 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Ladies and Gentlemen, In 2010, the Thai economy is expected to stay on the course of a gradual recovery due to two important factors. First, the continued world recovery, and second the fiscal stimulus. Let me go into each of these briefly. First, the IMF and market consensus expect the world economy to return to positive growth next year, owing primarily to monetary and fiscal policies of the industrialized economies that are expected to remain accommodative. Emerging market economies including Asia are expected to rebound faster and stronger than developed economies. This is because Asia’s financial sectors were not directly affected by the current crisis. Brighter prospect for the global economy next year means our export sector can continue to be our main growth engine going forward.  Secondly, the government spending under SP2 or the Strong Thai scheme will also continue to support the nascent recovery. As we are all aware, we cannot indefinitely rely on fiscal stimulus to keep the economy going so it is our hope that public spending will eventually crowd in private demand so that the recovery will continue after the stimulus tapers off.  Now let me turn to the risks associated with this outlook. Despite several good signals, the recovery of the world economy is still subject to a number of downside risks. In particular, the fact that unemployment rates remain high despite the pick-up in economic activities has led many people to worry that this might be a “jobless recovery”. This high unemployment, if prolonged, could have a deep and lasting impact on both consumption and the potential growth of the US economy. Moreover, consumption in the US will be adversely affected by the decline in household wealth as well as the increase in personal saving rate. Other issues which may exert downward force on the world recovery include the high level of public debt which may put upward pressure on long-term interest rates and the US and other advanced countries’ financial sectors which are still weak and may not be able to support the recovery of the economy.  On the domestic front, the downside risk comes from the ability of the government to swiftly execute the SP2 investment projects. In other words, the disbursement may not proceed as expected due to the lack of capacity to effectively implement many projects simultaneously. More importantly, political unrests which affect the stability of the coalition government may distract, disrupt, or in the worst case, discontinue the disbursement process.  Taking both upside and downside risks into consideration, the Bank of Thailand’s Monetary Policy Committee assessed that the Thai economy is expected to recover gradually, supported by better global economic outlook and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. Meanwhile, the inflationary pressure continues to be subdued for the time being. The MPC, therefore, decided to maintain the policy interest rate at 1.25 percent per year 
BIS Review 164/2009 3 during the most recent meeting. At the same time, the BOT is expecting that the Thai economy will return to a positive growth of 3.3–5.3 percent in 2010.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe we have a consensus that the worst of the global economic crisis is already behind us. At this juncture, policymakers and businesses are starting to look beyond the crisis and gauging what lies ahead. At the Bank of Thailand, we envisage the following three challenges for the post-crisis era.  First, the outlook for Thai export market will not be as good as the pre-crisis period. This is because the global financial crisis is likely to reduce both the purchasing power and the potential growth of Thailand’s major trading partners, especially the industrialized economies. Moreover, as the unemployment rates continue to increase in the G3 countries, protectionist sentiment may be intensified in an attempt to protect jobs at home.  It is a common knowledge that, since the 1997 financial crisis, Thailand has relied on exports as our primary engine of growth. This dependency is expected to continue for quite some time as our domestic demand is not large enough to substitute the purchasing power from abroad. Therefore, exporters need to be more adaptive, while policymakers need to ensure supportive policies. Having said that, it does not mean we will abandon our efforts in rebalancing our growth engine more towards domestic demand going forward. This can also be done as the balance sheet of the private sector is still in good shape. Now I would like to turn to our second challenge: As the world economic recovery begins to find more solid footing, the exit from the unconventional measures and the return of monetary policy towards the normal level becomes an increasingly important issue. Israel, Australia and Norway are already leading the way. However, it is a great challenge for policymakers to exercise an exit strategy with appropriate pace and time so as to ensure that the exit does not create unwarranted impacts on the economic recovery. On the one hand, a premature exit can derail the recovery. On the other, a delayed exit can lead to rising inflation and asset price bubbles. On top of this, the coordination of exit policy among countries is also important. For instance, the removal of deposit guarantees should be simultaneously implemented in order to avoid a disruption which may be caused by the shifting of deposits from a country that has lifted the guarantee to another country that has not.  On balance, it is expected that emerging economies including Asia are likely to recover first as our economic fundaments remain sound and the banking system is in a position to support economic recovery. As a result, interest rates in emerging market economies are expected to be raised faster than the industrialized countries. These interest rate and growth differentials against the backdrop of ample global liquidity are breeding the carry-trade behaviour with the USD as the funding currency this time. This leads us to our third challenge, which is how to prevent the surge in capital inflows from creating unwarranted instabilities such as excessive volatility in the currency market and asset price bubbles. In response to this challenge, we are beginning to see some countries such as Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and China tightening their prudential standards to cool down speculative pressure in the real estate sector. In addition, Brazil has recently imposed measure to slow down the inflows of fund into its stock market.  In the case of Thailand, net capital flows have turned positive in July and continued to remain so, causing the Thai baht to strengthen as the current account is also in surplus. Nevertheless, the Thai baht has been moving in line with other regional currencies and the Bank of Thailand remains vigilant in ensuring this continues to be the case. In order to make capital flows more balanced, we are in the process of furthering the liberalization of capital outflows. This would also increase the flexibility of our businesses in financial management.  As for the issue of asset price bubbles, while the signs of accelerating asset prices observed in many countries in Asia are not so apparent in Thailand at this time, the risk is not 
4 BIS Review 164/2009 neglected. As a matter of prudence, the Bank of Thailand will continue to closely monitor asset prices to ensure financial stability prevails in the long term.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to conclude my speech tonight by reiterating that the economic recovery in Thailand is expected to continue going forward. Nevertheless, the risk of an aftershock is not negligible due to fragile global and domestic environment. Hence, businesses and policymakers alike need to remain vigilant, but at the same time, should not be overcome by unreasonable fear. One important factor that will help speed up the process of recovery is the return of investment and trade within the country. With our economic resilience and strong economic fundamentals, I would like to assure you that Thailand remains a lucrative place to invest. Despite this difficult time, the BCCT has always been a great supporter of our investment programs, an example of which is your Thailand Means Business 2008 report which is very relevant in terms of attracting new or re-investment from British businesses. I hope that this long relationship will continue to be as good as ever or even better in the coming years.  Thank you. 
BIS Review 164/2009 1 Elizabeth A Duke: Keys to successful neighborhood stabilization Speech by Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Community Stabilization Symposium, NeighborWorks Training Institute, National Harbor, Maryland, 9 December 2009.  The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website. *      *      * Good morning. I am very pleased to be here to welcome you to the NeighborWorks' Training Institute Symposium on Community Stabilization. The Federal Reserve is co-sponsoring this event as part of a partnership we have with NeighborWorks America (NeighborWorks) to reduce the impact of foreclosures in low- and moderate-income communities. Clearly, much remains to be done to stabilize communities hard-hit by the foreclosure crisis, but we are encouraged by the work of this partnership, now in its second year. We are leveraging the resources of the Federal Reserve, particularly our data resources and our network of regional Reserve Banks across the country, to assist NeighborWorks' activities with respect to training, foreclosure counseling resources, and building the capacity of local community organizations.  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Bernanke asked me to chair the Board's Committee on Consumer and Community Affairs and to represent the Federal Reserve on the NeighborWorks Board. As a former community banker, I came to my new assignments with an understanding of the role that financial institutions, in partnership with local stakeholders, play in creating healthy sustainable communities. But I wanted to see first-hand how the economic crisis was impacting communities, how NeighborWorks was responding, and how the Reserve Banks were assisting communities under stress and the organizations that serve them. So, Community Affairs staff in the twelve Reserve Bank Districts and the community organizations they work with – including many NeighborWorks Organizations – arranged for me to tour several stressed communities across the country. And I must say, these visits have enriched my understanding of the vital work being done in local communities, and its importance for the nation's economic future.  So I thought the best way I could kick off this conference would be to tell you a little bit about what I learned on my visits, particularly as these lessons relate to community stabilization efforts. I know that most of what I say will come as no surprise to those of you who work with these issues every day. But I want to recognize the significant work you do and express my profound appreciation, especially to those who shared their experiences with me as we toured your cities and learned about your work.  Regional economic conditions matter The first lesson I learned during my travels is that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for community stabilization. The downturn in housing has affected communities in a variety of ways, depending on the underlying economics of each. Because of these variations, a stabilization strategy that is effective in an industrial city facing high unemployment is unlikely to suit a suburban community where employment has remained relatively stable.  Communities with weak underlying economies are characterized by a long trend of population loss, gradual impoverishment, and strained municipal resources. For cities like Cleveland, Detroit, and Indianapolis the increase in foreclosures over the last few years has 
2 BIS Review 164/2009 exacerbated a pre-existing vacancy problem.1 The increased rates of foreclosures and the related economic downturn have hastened a cycle of decreasing property values. Declines in state and local property and sales tax revenues result in even more vacant homes and deteriorating neighborhoods.  Many community organizations and homeowners have been frustrated by the difficulties of working with mortgage lenders and servicers, and these problems are even more exaggerated in weaker market cities. In the most devastated neighborhoods, some lenders do not even complete the foreclosure process or record the outcome of foreclosure sales because the cost of foreclosing exceeds the value of the property. Anecdotal evidence suggests that these "toxic titles" have placed significant numbers of properties in a difficult state of legal limbo.2   As a result of the high rates of abandonment, many cities such as Flint, Michigan, Cleveland, Ohio, and Youngstown, Ohio have pursued plans to "right size" by demolishing vacant properties and creating land banks. These strategies effectively align housing supply with demand and create open spaces and parkland that promote community health and sustainability. Several community organizations in Detroit, for instance, have joined together to promote an urban farming initiative that not only reclaims abandoned properties but capitalizes on the growing popularity of locally grown food. Detroit's Garden Resource Program provides hundreds of home, school, and community gardens access to resources and information that empower residents to grow, harvest, prepare, and preserve food in their backyards and neighborhoods. In 2008, the program supplied over 169 community gardens, 40 schools, and 359 families with seeds, plants, and training that produced thousands of pounds of food inside the City of Detroit.3   Even communities with strong underlying economies have not been immune to the destabilizing effects of high foreclosure rates. I visited California's Inland Empire and Los Angeles, as well as areas in Atlanta, that until recently were economically vibrant. Many coastal cities – even those with jobs and growing populations – now are in distress because of high rates of foreclosure. For instance, the Florida cities of Cape Coral, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Sarasota are among those with the highest rates of foreclosure – between 3.8 and 10 percent. These areas, and others in the West, such as Las Vegas and Phoenix, experienced very high rates of new home construction and speculative investments that resulted in unsustainable price escalation throughout the early part of this decade.4  Vacant properties are creating a different kind of problem in some California markets. Indeed, as investors sense that home prices have bottomed out, they are approaching servicers with cash offers for the bulk purchase of properties. In fact, community organizations in areas of California complain that investor interest has heated up to the point that qualified first-time homebuyers and local community organizations are being crowded out of the market.  Foreclosure rescue scams that have taken up residence in nearly every community appear to be even more prevalent in stronger market areas where retaining title to a home is more economically feasible. One counselor in Los Angeles told me that as many as 80 percent of the homeowners she counseled had been victims of rescue scams.                                                   1  Mallach, Alan.

Brookings Institute. February 2009. 
BIS Review 164/2009 3 In addition to the economic dynamics of any particular city, it is clear that, even within metropolitan areas, community stabilization issues can vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. For example, Cleveland's highest vacancy rates are primarily in its urban core, while in Atlanta, the problem of high foreclosure rates is found not only in the urban core, but also in outer suburban communities that experienced significant growth recently. For cities like Atlanta, strategies addressing high foreclosure rates must take into account wide variations in local capacity across and within metropolitan areas. Newer suburbs have not, for the most part, had time to develop the community resources and technical expertise that exist in urban centers.  Another lesson I learned in my travels is about the need to understand community dynamics. In the end, the success of any community stabilization plan depends on the dedication and expertise of local leaders like those of you here today. Cleveland's Detroit Shoreway neighborhood, for example, clearly demonstrates that with the right vision, leadership, and planning even a highly distressed community can regain its position as a dynamic and attractive neighborhood by maximizing its natural and cultural assets.  Holistic approach is key Foreclosure mitigation activities, by necessity, focus on individual houses and mortgages in an attempt to resolve legal and economic issues between borrowers, servicers, and investors. Nonetheless, after visiting with community organizations and seeing their work first-hand, it is clear to me that the most effective community stabilization approaches look beyond homes and mortgages. Successful community stabilization requires a broader vision of community, one that factors in the many elements that make a neighborhood a desirable place to live.  The bottom line is that housing alone is not sufficient to create sustainable and economically resilient communities.  I have seen several compelling examples of this kind of multi-faceted approach to community development. Atlanta's development efforts, for example, included the creation of the Center for Working Families. The Center serves people who are seeking employment and are eager to learn new skills that will help them support their families, build wealth, or start a business. The Center also offers its clients individual coaching to help them hurdle the barriers that keep them from securing and maintaining employment by providing transportation assistance, childcare subsidies, and computer literacy training. And, unlike a traditional job training and placement program, the Center's relationship with its clients continues long after they secure employment.  Nearby, in the Centennial Place neighborhood, a mixed-income, mixed-use community developed by the Atlanta Housing Authority on the site of one of the nation's first public housing complexes, I found Centennial Place Elementary School. Centennial Place is a math, science, and technology-oriented school that is breaking records as one of the top performing schools in the Atlanta school system. They have steadily improved test scores in reading and math. Students and parents alike are fully engaged in the learning process in this state-of-the-art school.  In Dallas, I was introduced to Lone Star Investment Advisors, an organization that invests in low- to moderate- income areas throughout Texas. Lone Star created a private equity fund that invests in Texas companies that are located in, or willing to move to, low-income census tracts. The fund's managers have focused on manufacturing and distribution companies that are valued at $20 million and up and can create jobs in the state's lower-income communities. Its double bottom-line approach to investments – making a profit while benefitting the community – makes it attractive to bankers with Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) obligations as well as other socially-minded investors. PrimeSource Food Service Equipment is one such business that Lone Star moved from an affluent northern Dallas 
4 BIS Review 164/2009 suburb to South Dallas, where the poverty rate is 43.6%. PrimeSource relocated over 100 employees and hired new employees from South Dallas.  In Philadelphia, I toured a supermarket that provides for one of the most basic needs in many low-income neighborhoods: fresh food. The Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative is an innovative program that works to increase the number of supermarkets and groceries in underserved communities across Pennsylvania. The initiative is supported by a partnership among The Reinvestment Fund, a non-profit developer, and two community organizations, The Food Trust and the Greater Philadelphia Urban Affairs Coalition.5 This partnership has stepped in to fill a financing need where infrastructure costs were not met by conventional financial institutions. In addition to improving the neighborhood's access to nutritious food, the supermarket initiative meets several other community needs, including job creation and lower food costs for those with limited incomes. It also provides a focal point for other vital retail needs in the community.  Other organizations are dedicated to meeting the healthcare needs of their community. Chicago's Lawndale Christian Health Center is one such organization.6 The center serves the Lawndale and Garfield communities on the West Side of Chicago by providing quality primary care services without regard to a patient's ability to pay, and in so doing, it works to eliminate the impact of healthcare disparities among the city's residents. The Lawndale Center is known for its holistic approach to healthcare: it offers not only primary medical care, including internal medicine, pediatrics, cardiology, optometry, and dentistry, but also services that support patients' psychological, spiritual, and social health. In 2006 alone, the Center accommodated more than 110,000 outpatient medical visits, 4,200 hospital visits, 840 deliveries, 8,000 dental visits, and 3,100 optometry visits.  The Center also offers programs in leadership development and organizational capacity building for the community, and it employs more than 300 people, many of whom live in the community or were attracted to the community because of the Center.  But even more impressive to me is the Center's connection to the community it serves. The Center was founded in 1984 when a group of Lawndale residents saw a need in their community and worked to fill it. Ownership of the Center is retained by community members, ensuring that it will continue to meet the needs in its neighborhood.  As these examples illustrate, a vibrant community is made up of more than houses. Neighborhoods need the right blend of housing, retail, and community services in order to remain desirable and resilient to economic cycles. Of course, the solution is not that simple. Even a neighborhood with that perfect mix of housing, retail, and services can find itself struggling. In my travels I realized that there is one characteristic shared by the communities that have coped most successfully in the economic downturn: organizational capacity.  Organizational capacity As I am sure you are aware, the relationship between organizational capacity and the success of community stabilization efforts cannot be underestimated. I have had the good fortune to observe many communities whose response to the foreclosure crisis was immediate and, ultimately, has been more effective because of the deep roots of organizations in the community and the experience they have developed over many years.  Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, where Bruce Gotschall has served as Executive Director since its founding in 1975, is probably one of the finest examples of this kind of organizational capacity. In the mid-1990s, NHS of Chicago identified predatory lending as a                                                  5  http://www.trfund.com/financing/realestate/supermarkets.html. 6  http://www.lawndale.org/index.html. 
BIS Review 164/2009 5 threat to the neighborhoods it served. In collaboration with the City of Chicago, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and many others, NHS formed the first Home Ownership Preservation Initiative (HOPI). This initiative became the model for foreclosure prevention and has been replicated across the country. Because of this experience, NHS was well-prepared to assist Chicagoans in the recent housing market downturn.  By contrast, many communities are facing the issues of vacancy, abandonment, and decay for the first time, and these communities need help to grow the human and financial capital required to address neighborhood decline. These capacities do not appear overnight, but they can be developed. As your attendance at this Training Institute demonstrates, there is a strong appetite among community organizations for information, training, and leadership development. And I am encouraged by your dedication.  As a NeighborWorks Board member, I am aware that the demand for training has grown dramatically in the last few years and I am very impressed by the breadth, depth, and quality of the Training Institute's offerings. In fact, a significant part of the Federal Reserve's partnership with NeighborWorks involves funding the development of courses designed to help community leaders address stabilization challenges, particularly with respect to the acquisition and disposition of real estate. In the first year of the partnership alone, 640 training certificates were awarded in the new community stabilization coursework, with even more community development practitioners attending workshops and events designed to highlight best practices and new programs available to stabilize communities. In addition to training sessions, practitioners can access this information on StableCommunities.org, a website developed by NeighborWorks with the Federal Reserve's support.  The role of the Federal Reserve The partnership between the Federal Reserve and NeighborWorks America is just one aspect of the Federal Reserve's effort to stabilize neighborhoods. Community Affairs staff across the Federal Reserve System are providing data analysis and technical assistance to state and local governments trying to address foreclosures in their communities. For example, the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta are collaborating on a series of capacity-building sessions for several communities in Appalachia to improve their ability to leverage federal Neighborhood Stabilization Funds. In addition, we are studying the Neighborhood Stabilization Program and interviewing some 50 program grantees nationwide to learn about the early successes and challenges to this effort to restore health to communities with high foreclosure rates.  We continue to engage in a good deal of outreach to stay informed about the challenges facing communities as this crisis evolves. Federal Reserve staff recently attended a series of meetings organized by National People's Action (NPA). These meetings, held in nine cities chosen by NPA, were designed to gather first-hand information about the impact of foreclosures in low-income communities. In each city, Fed staff met with local leaders, toured communities hit by foreclosures, and attended public meetings. In addition to giving us information about foreclosure's impact on various communities, the public meetings have been effective in drawing local press coverage, which hopefully has heightened local attention to the issues faced by residents.  The Federal Reserve is committed to continuing to identify ways in which our strengths as a research institution, combined with our network of Community Affairs outreach staff, can be leveraged to help communities recover from high numbers of foreclosures and related economic impacts.  Conclusion In conclusion, I want to thank you all for your commitment to your communities and for your attendance here today. This symposium is designed to provoke and inspire our best thinking 
6 BIS Review 164/2009 – and action – related to neighborhood stabilization. I hope that each of you finds something in today's discussion that applies to the underlying economic conditions of your neighborhood, that encourages holistic solutions to the problems your community faces, and that improves your ability to meet the demands placed on you as a leader in your community.  
BIS Review 163/2009 1 Glenn Stevens: Developments in financial regulations Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the Annual Dinner of the Australian Business Economists, Sydney, 8 December 2009. *      *      * The financial crisis that engulfed global capital markets and brought a number of important international banks close to the brink last year has been followed by a good deal of soul searching among the regulatory community. In several countries, though not in Australia, regulatory structures and/or practices have been seen as inadequate. Work is proceeding to try to establish better arrangements so as to prevent the next crisis, or, more realistically, at least make it less costly – all the while seeking to avoid doing things that make it harder to recover from this one.  I propose to offer today some information and some observations about these developments and the associated issues. I won’t go into the causes of the crisis per se; these have been covered at length before. The material offered is set in a global context, rather than an Australia-specific one. Just to be clear, if in the following paragraphs I am saying something about Australia, I will make that explicit.  Lessons from the crisis What conclusions have governments and regulators around the world drawn from this episode?  There are many. But the most important ones can be organised under five relevant headings.  First, capital: there was not enough. In the case of global banks’ trading books, a lot of risk accumulated and was not well measured. Capital held against complex structured products in particular was seriously insufficient. A good deal of risk was also supposed to be “off balance sheet”, but returned very quickly to major institutions once liquidity dried up. Moreover, some instruments were considered to be “capital” but could not really absorb losses, at least while a bank remained operating.  Second, liquidity: not enough attention had been paid to the risk that, in the event of some market shock, funding liquidity could become much more difficult. Comfortable assumptions that markets for some instruments would remain liquid proved to be unfounded.  Third, the so-called “shadow banking system”: there were systemically important activities going on outside the “regulatory perimeter”. This included the activities of investment banks, hedge funds, finance companies, money market mutual funds and institutions that often had close ties to banks, such as special purpose vehicles (SPVs), structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and conduits. These entities were typically less closely supervised or unregulated, but in some cases their risk-taking behaviour and subsequent travails had systemically significant impacts on the core financial system.  Fourth, cross-border arrangements: globally active banks and other entities operated apparently seamlessly across national borders and legal jurisdictions. But the structures to allow that were actually quite complex, and legal, supervisory and crisis-management arrangements remained nationally based. So when it came time to manage the process of deleveraging and winding up of some institutions, the degree of complexity was increased by the cross-border nature of the issues.  Finally, pro-cyclicality: the episode demonstrated – again – that the financial system imparts its own dynamic that reinforces the natural cyclical tendency in an economy. In good times, lenders and investors tend to be confident and act with less caution. Standards decline and banks come under pressure either to use “surplus” capital or return it to shareholders. 
2 163/2009 Backward-looking risk metrics present risk as low just when it is reaching dangerous levels and very high when everyone has already become much more risk averse. This all serves to fuel the boom and bust.  Many commentators have argued that accounting standards contributed to pro-cyclicality. Fair-value accounting and buoyant markets make for strong valuations that can boost recorded profit, but problems emerge when banks have to mark-to-market securities whose markets have effectively ceased to function. The incurred-loss basis for provisions – where an event has to occur before a provision can be made – promotes transparency in one sense. But it arguably inhibits the build-up of buffers in the good times to cushion against future losses, and prompts more provisioning during the turmoil, further harming profitability and confidence.  Other incentives have also been seen as adding to cyclical behaviour. Remuneration packages for some financial institutions’ executives and employees appear to have been structured in a way that may have encouraged traders and managers to take excessive risks in activities that appeared profitable in the short term but led to large losses later on.  People have also pointed to the role of earlier regulatory changes, credit ratings, the complexity of instruments and weaknesses in market infrastructure, not to mention the long period of low global interest rates, the “global imbalances” and so on as all playing a role. I don’t want to underplay those factors, but the five above are the big themes on which I want to focus today.  What is being done? Much has already been done, or is underway, to respond to these weaknesses by the various standard-setters, the Financial Stability Board and within the G20 process. Many of the responses can be organised under the same five headings.  First among them is capital regulation. Now it is worth pointing out, before going on, that it is something of a stretch to suggest, as some commentators have, that the so-called Basel II framework was to blame for the crisis. In fact the build-up to the crisis occurred under the old Basel I capital rules: most global banks did not even implement Basel II until after the crisis had begun. US banks are still not using it. Basel II is not perfect but it addresses some of the shortcomings of Basel I that were identified by the financial crisis. It allows, for example, greater differentiation between different types of risk, introduces capital charges for off-balance sheet exposures to structured investment vehicles and conduits, and creates more neutral incentives between holding assets on balance sheet and securitising them. Had Basel II been in place, it might not have prevented the crisis but it would probably have helped matters.  Nonetheless, Basel II can be improved in the light of experience during the crisis. The Basel Committee on Bank Supervision is in the process of implementing numerous changes, which essentially require more capital and higher-quality capital. It has already finalised changes to risk weights on certain exposures related to securitisation, and issued new supervisory guidance on compensation, governance, risk management and concentrations of risk.1 It has changed rules around disclosure and valuation practices, which will come into effect at the end of next year. The Committee is currently rethinking the amount of high-quality capital banks should hold, specifying what instruments should be included in that definition, and developing a non-risk-weighted simple leverage ratio as a supplement to the risk-weighted capital adequacy measures. The Committee intends to finalise this latter set of new capital                                                  1  Specifically these relate to: securitisation exposures in the trading book; sponsorship of off-balance sheet vehicles; re-securitisation exposures; and pipeline and warehousing risks with regard to securitisation exposures. 
BIS Review 163/2009 3 rules by the end of this year and calibrate them in 2010 with a detailed “quantitative impact assessment” to gauge their effects.  Second, efforts to bolster liquidity management are underway, with the Basel Committee planning to introduce a new global standard for funding liquidity soon. This is likely to require financial institutions to focus on adequate funding liquidity over longer time horizons, as well as resilience to more demanding stress scenarios. In line with this, APRA has recently released for consultation proposals to enhance liquidity risk management by authorised deposit-taking institutions in Australia.  Third, the regulatory perimeter is being extended. Some of the relatively less supervised institutions that were problematic prior to the crisis no longer exist – for example, US investment banks failed, or were converted into, or assumed by, regulated banks. But other institutions whose actions could on occasion be of systemic importance, such as hedge funds, are being subjected to more oversight.  Fourth, attempts are being made to help the cross-border issues with the creation of supervisory “colleges” for large institutions. These are designed to promote better sharing of information across countries. Agencies on the Financial Stability Board are also working on protocols for cross-border crisis management.  Regarding pro-cyclicality, proposals are being developed for the use of capital regulations that would require banks to increase capital in the good times that can then be run down during a crisis. The proposals involve introducing target counter-cyclical capital buffers, above the re-designed minimum capital requirements. The Basel Committee is also working to promote the use of more forward-looking provisioning policies based on expected losses, rather than current arrangements that base provisions on losses already incurred.  Accounting standard-setters are continuing their work on international convergence and clarity in regulation. They have issued guidance emphasising the need for judgement in valuing mark-to-market assets when markets for those assets are inactive, are working to simplify the valuation rules for financial instruments, and are seeking to close loopholes that generated incentives for off-balance sheet activities.  Some observations All of this is worthwhile work. It forms part of a comprehensive set of responses to the conclusions drawn from the crisis. Implementing it presents a very demanding schedule for regulators. I want to offer a few observations about what we might realistically expect over time. These are not criticisms, but rather nuances that are, in my view, worth noting.  The first is that the right balance needs to be struck between more regulation and more effective enforcement of existing regulation. There is no doubt that regulation can be improved after an event like this. Yet some jurisdictions ended up with very serious problems, while others did not, even though they were all, more or less, operating on the same internationally agreed framework for bank supervision. Why that was so remains a question of interest.  Secondly, on the assumption that most of these regulatory changes go ahead, one effect will presumably be to make the process of financial intermediation more costly. The intention, after all, is that lenders will operate with more capital against the risks they are taking. But capital is not free; shareholders have to be induced to supply it, and it will have to be paid for. High-quality liquid assets typically carry lower yields too, so mandating higher liquidity will have some (modest) cost as well. Admittedly it can be argued that shareholders of financial institutions will have a less risky investment and so should be prepared to accept lower returns. But customers of financial institutions – depositors and borrowers – will also pay via higher spreads between what lenders pay for funds and what they charge for loans. That is, 
4 163/2009 they will pay more ex ante to use a safer financial system, as opposed to taxpayers having to pay large costs ex post to re-capitalise a riskier system that runs into trouble.  Now of course protecting the interests of taxpayers is very important, and there is no doubt that certain types of behaviour need to be backed with much more capital, if not severely curtailed or even stopped altogether. It is appropriate that pricing play a role in achieving that.  We should try to ensure, however, that the cost is no more than necessary. The most egregious behaviour was mainly that of 30 to 40 large, globally active banks. They have imposed very large costs on their own banking systems, economies and taxpayers, and on the global economy. But there are thousands of other banks in the world whose risk appetite did not get out of control, that have remained solvent, and that have not needed public capital injections. So it will be sensible to ensure, as far as we can, that the proposed measures act effectively to constrain the worst excesses of the former without unnecessarily shackling the latter.  I am personally not persuaded of the intellectual basis of the simple overall leverage ratio. It goes against the whole thrust of the idea that capital should be allocated against economic risk – after all, the Basel risk weights are a sophisticated leverage ratio already. I have not seen persuasive evidence that the banks of countries that had a leverage ratio in place have systematically outperformed those that did not.  Nonetheless, it had already been agreed, before Australian officials joined the Basel Committee, that such a device would be introduced as a “back-stop” to prevent extreme leverage in instances where the Basel rules, for some reason, may not. Provided that it is suitably calibrated, the leverage ratio will probably not do any great harm. That is, however, a very important provision. Were it to be calibrated in a way that unnecessarily constrains the common or garden variety commercial bank, it could be unduly costly. So the calibration is important and in this regard it is critical that adequate time be allowed for the completion of the technical work in assessing the quantitative impact of this measure. That will take at least another year.  As far as the proposed counter-cyclical capital buffers are concerned, this is an appealing idea, based on the notion that it is precisely at the moment when capital appears to be abundant, profits high and the economy booming that true risk is approaching its peak. Requiring more capital to be put aside at that time, which can then support balance sheets after the cycle turns, sounds very desirable.  But we should not think it will be easy to achieve. The proposals appear to involve balancing a degree of mechanical linkage to particular variables – such as credit – with an appropriate degree of short-term flexibility. Those familiar with the old debates about rules versus discretion in monetary policy might notice an echo here. Based on experience in monetary policy, I am sceptical about the durability of hard rules, but all too familiar with how difficult it can be to deliver genuinely counter-cyclical policy. There is no reason to think it will really be easier when using prudential tools for “macro-prudential” purposes. That is not to say that we can’t devise a framework combining certain rule-like behaviour with a sensible degree of discretion, but it might take a while. In the case of monetary policy, it took a couple of decades or more.2 If one is inclined to place a good deal of importance on quality supervisory judgement – as I think we have to – as much may be achieved by adjustments to accounting arrangements for                                                  2  We ended up with a form of constrained discretion: a reasonably clear medium-term objective combined with short-term operational flexibility, and independence of the decision maker from the day-to-day political process (with accountability to legislatures). The counterpart framework for counter-cyclical capital management will, if it is to be successful, require similar elements, including the independence of the relevant decision-maker – from both the political process and the markets and institutions affected by the decisions. 
BIS Review 163/2009 5 provisions as by a complex set of variable capital ratios. What is needed is to allow banks more easily to make more forward-looking provisions when either they or the supervisor thinks they should. This is an important area of work for regulators.  One should also be realistic that while using balance sheet regulation as a macro-prudential tool may have attractions, it is no panacea. Of course there may be occasions when the setting of monetary policy is about right for most of the economy but there is a desire to calm down some over-exuberant borrowing behaviour in a particular sector. In such cases, some kind of temporary regulatory measure may well be useful. But as those with any recollection of Australian experience of the 1960s and 1970s will know, if the fundamental problem is actually that financial conditions are just too easy – that is, interest rates are too low – balance sheet regulation won’t ultimately constrain credit growth. Over time, private markets will find a way of doing the business outside of the regulated sector. Then the authorities face the question of whether or not to expand the scope of regulation to more sectors – just as we did in the 1970s. A possible outcome is that, the harder we regulate a set of institutions as a result of the last crisis, the more likely it becomes that the next crisis occurs in the hitherto unregulated part, perhaps even among institutions that do not yet exist. If the conditions are such that people want to take risk and gear up, they will find a way.  Of course, that is acceptable provided the relevant private parties can be allowed to fail without bringing down the core part of the system. Caveat emptor can apply outside of the regulated net if there are few spillovers. But if risk-taking activity goes on long enough, then sufficient leverage may well accumulate somewhere to make the ensuing deleveraging generally disruptive, placing policy-makers once again in a very awkward situation.  Too big to fail And that brings us to the most difficult of all the issues, namely that of the too-big-to-fail institution. Here the term “big” might mean a large balance sheet, or refer to interconnectedness or complexity. Or all three of the above. In some countries, the debate on this issue is now quite active. One potential response is a tax on size: much higher capital requirements for “systemic” institutions so as to lower greatly the probability of a failure of a really large firm, either by making large firms much less risky, or giving them an incentive to no longer be large. Another approach would simply be much more intensive – and intrusive – supervision of such entities. Either of these measures could be complemented by the requirement that a large firm compile a “living will”, in which it writes its own break-up/wind-down plan ahead of time – in the process, hopefully, highlighting those bits of complexity that ought to be removed while it is still alive. Before regulators even got to any of those possibilities, they would have to grapple with the practical difficulties of setting the threshold as to what constitutes “systemic”. Expect furious lobbying by the finance sector on that.  Nor is this issue just domestic in nature. It goes to the heart of what it means to have a globalised financial system. In the absence of clearly articulated rules about burden sharing, a potential failure of one of these institutions is further complicated because the frameworks for global governance and crisis resolution have not kept up with the process of globalisation itself. It is very hard for them to do so. Even in a region such as Europe where there has been six decades of continuous effort in building collective structures, the resolution of problems at entities like Fortis has, by all accounts, been very difficult.  One response to that would be to unwind the globalisation of the financial institutions and go back to having local banks just doing local business. That seems absurdly costly, though – in general, capital flows have been a tremendous force for higher living standards over the long run. It would surely be a retrograde step to shut them off. A less radical response would be subsidiarisation – where foreign banks have a presence in the form of locally capitalised and governed structures, in which local authorities could intervene in the event of a shock in another country affecting the viability of the parent. That still entails some costs in terms of efficiency, albeit ones that countries might now be prepared to tolerate. To succeed in this 
6 163/2009 approach, a country would need to have the capability and resources to ensure the viability of a local subsidiary of a failed major global institution, taking control of it if necessary. This would be at a time of tremendous damage to the relevant global brand. For many small countries this might be a big ask.  In the crisis itself, the too-big-to-fail issue presented simply as an imperative for a number of governments to prevent failures. But as the crisis recedes, and the global financial system is gradually nursed back to health, it is this issue that is going to leave the biggest lingering challenge. The Financial Stability Board will be directing particular attention to it over the coming year. It is not likely to be amenable to simple solutions, or easy ones. In the mean time, enormous moral hazard, perhaps greater than ever before, exists in the global financial system as a result of the actions – albeit essential ones in the circumstances – of 2008.  Conclusion A year ago, I wished this audience a much less interesting 2009. That wish was partly fulfilled in that 2009 was less “interesting” than 2008, though still not quite boring enough in my view.  As 2009 draws to a close, things in the global financial system look much less worrying than they did a year ago. With the sense of immediate crisis much reduced, regulators can devote more focus to the job of designing and implementing changes to regulatory frameworks – work that is better done outside a period of crisis anyway.  Realistically, the task is to reconfigure regulatory frameworks to lower the probability, and the cost, of future crises while assisting recovery from the recent one. That is every bit as difficult a challenge as getting through the immediate crisis itself. It will require very careful judgment to strike the right balance between costs and benefits of revised regulatory structures and practices, and due regard to the possibility of unintended consequences. It will also take a great deal of determination on the part of regulators to enforce arrangements adequately in future booms. And there is little doubt such booms will occur because, ultimately, the cycle of greed and fear itself cannot be regulated away. To assume that unrealistic optimism will not again, at some point, overwhelm the more sober instincts of investors, bankers, commentators and others would be a triumph of hope over experience.  But it can’t be beyond us to achieve some worthwhile reforms in this area and 2010 is a year in which we can hope to make some progress.  I wish all of you a Merry Christmas and a prosperous and stable new year.  
BIS Review 163/2009 1 Rundheersing Bheenick: Positive developments in Mauritius against the background of the financial crisis Address by Mr Rundheersing Bheenick, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the Annual Dinner in honour of Economic Operators, Port Louis, 5 December 2009. *      *      * I am delighted to welcome you all to the Annual Dinner in honour of our principal economic operators, to celebrate a year of fruitful collaboration and to reflect on the critical elements for sustaining this effective partnership.  We are delighted that His Excellency Tito Mboweni has accepted our invitation to be our special guest tonight. The Great Tito was until recently Governor of the South African Reserve Bank and is now a committed fisherman. Well may I say he is a great catch for us tonight. I first met Tito Mboweni as Governor Designate in Davos in the margins of a World Economic Forum meeting in February 1999, when I had the honour to accompany my Prime Minister as a Minister in his Cabinet.  I have gained much from this illustrious man who shared with me glimpses of his vast and rich career. I must confess that my first meeting with him as Governor was even more memorable. It happened in Washington during the IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings in October 2007. It was as close to a telling-off as a Governor ever gets from another Governor:  “My brother Governor from Mauritius”, Tito said drily, “I understand you have been on the job for nearly a year now … but you haven’t found the time to pay us a visit or to take an interest in our work in SADC”. I was cut to the quick by this stinging remark, especially as I had actually played a key role in getting Mauritius to join SADC in the first place. I am a quick learner and I learnt my lesson. Governor, you will be pleased to know that I currently luxuriate under the additional title of Chairman of the COMESA Committee of Central Bank Governors. And I had the singular honour to chair the Commonwealth Meeting of Central Bank Governors in Cyprus and report on our work to the plenary meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers. Indeed, some claim I have learnt my lesson too well! Some complain that I have taken the regional and international dimensions of the job so much to heart that I am hardly ever here. Now as Governor Mboweni steps from the limelight and has plans to pursue his great love of fishing, I invite him to elect Mauritius as his second home, so that he may indulge in his new hobby in our tranquil waters. You are most welcome Tito: it is our honour to have you with us. But, I am afraid, in this open and liberal economy we offer no “free lunches”. So we are going to ask you, a little later, to sing for your supper.  But first, on a sombre note, may I ask you to remember our good friend and colleague, Anil Gunness, late CEO of the State Bank of Mauritius, assassinated in November 2008 in the Mumbai terrorist attack whilst on official duty. His death has been a great loss to us, a terrible tragedy for his family and a mark of the uncertain times in which we live. He was a man of integrity at the height of his powers, much loved and respected by all he met. So let us not allow the assassins their victory and, in this moment of reflection, let us recall the words of Dylan Thomas:  “Though lovers be lost, Love shall not, And death shall have no dominion.” Let us rise and observe a moment of silence in his memory ... Thank you. Many of us here, last met in similar convivial circumstances in 2007, for the 40th anniversary of the Central Bank. Since then much has changed. The greatest economic and financial 
2 163/2009 crisis of our generation happened. Indeed, it is still with us. So let us take time to reflect on the last two years and try to look forward to our role in the pursuit of our Prime Minister’s challenge of Maurice Ile Durable. But as we do so, there is just one thing ahead, of which we can be sure, in the immortal words of Yogi Berra, the US baseball star:  “the future ain’t what it used to be!”  This is not the moment to go over the now well-documented blowing away of so many star players in the western banking system and its knock-on effects in the real economy. That is all available in the roaring paperback trade; and those failed econometric models are just today’s pulp fiction. So as an economist I agree, somewhat with hindsight, with Kenneth Boulding, another economist – whose textbook guided my first steps in the field and figures among my most-prized possessions. Boulding succinctly expressed what many others have been thinking too:  “Anyone who believes that exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman, or an economist!” For what lies ahead for us is, nothing less than, a rethinking of western finance, and in the words of Kevin Warsh, a Governor at the US Federal Reserve:  “We are witnessing a fundamental reassessment of the value of every asset everywhere in the world. (And) … a new financial architecture …” is taking shape before our eyes. As we look back across the debris of a collapsing western system of thought and practice on banking and financial matters, we might well ask, why did we miss the call to action before. Could the doctors in charge have saved the patient? What were the telling signs and symptoms?  The very first cough maybe? When Barings Bank, with a Royal seal of approval, was hit by their own young man in Hong Kong, who sold them down the futures and derivatives drain, while senior managers were sipping cocktails … perhaps the pink champagne with which this Governor is allegedly permanently sozzled.  If we look back, there was once a time when accountants were thought to be, if anything, rather boring, and absolutely straight: then there was Enron and Madoff. There was once a time when bankers led the field in asserting “safe as houses”; we don’t seem to hear that phrase too often now! But have we yet put in place a re-designed system to review the content of assets and their continuing value in the Books? We know Basel II is not the end of the road? But will even a Basel III be solid enough? Will the new codes of the International Accounting Standards Board, with the move away from current fair-value rules, set us up straight again? Will they reach an accord with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board, so that we have a unified western system? But while we are sorting out those books, who is keeping the accounts on the depreciation of the natural assets of the paradise isle and the costs of climate change and sea level rise? There was once a time when one could say “safe as the Bank of England”, but even that seems to have lost its currency! As we see major banks in key countries becoming wards of the state, we can’t help musing that there was once a time when bankers might have preferred defenestration to nationalisation!  Is this the end of the history of the western financial and banking model and the public/private divide? “The old order changeth, yielding place to the new ...” as Tennyson intoned in La Morte d’Arthur, and with foresight warned: “lest one good custom should corrupt the world.” There was once a time when we spoke of the promise of a stable state and an end to poverty. Even development economics followed a set of well-established principles; and 
BIS Review 163/2009 3 banking never hit the headlines. Now banking seems daily to be front page news. And over the last fortnight we at the Bank of Mauritius are contributing our fair bit as well. You know I’m not really one for conspiracy theories. But last year, when they made another James Bond film, I was reminded of the advice of Goldfinger to Bond, in that eponymous thriller:  “Mr Bond, they have a saying in Chicago – Once is happenstance; Twice is co-incidence; The third time it’s enemy action.” Obviously, we must not become paranoid and see enemies and conspirators everywhere. But, maybe we bankers here should be heeding such advice, don our flak jackets and re-examine, with our economic partners, what banking is about, and what its future role should be in the real world.  What exactly is the business we are in? I think the crisis has given some useful pointers. As bankers, we are not in the business of making money: that is where we have gone astray, giving too much latitude to the young man in Barings, or the young man in Société Générale, or the army of bonus-seekers playing hard and fast with other peoples’ money like Leeson and Kerviel. The business of banking is business. It is doing business with you, the operators in the real economy, to promote more business, and through that to secure economic and social welfare and sustainable development. The money is not an end in itself. The bottom line matters … but so does the top line. That is why I have been keen to explore another model here which brings the money closer to the action in the real economy – Islamic banking. Some of you may know I was not here last week. A pity, because they tell me there was a bit of street theatre that I missed. Last week, I was away in the Gulf States, as for some time I have been concerned that the champion we were counting on to support our move in Islamic banking, Dubai, was looking a bit wobbly and weak at the knees. I was right. And so with a few phone calls, some discreet and rapid negotiations in the Gulf, I have returned confident that we shall be signing up partners from a cash-rich Gulf state to establish a complete Sharia-compliant banking service in Mauritius. This will set a new pace for our business and banking world. And I am pleased to report that we are now a full member of the Islamic Financial Services Board, the international standard-setting body in this rapidly-developing area. Which makes us the second non-Islamic country, after Singapore, to accede to this coveted position. Islamic finance will bring a new model for banking and for business to revitalise our partnership with the real economy, in big business and in small. Watch this space. These Arab thoroughbreds move fast and are bred to be quick on the turn. For I sometimes fear the western model of banking has an inherent kamikaze conservatism; a bit slow on its feet under fire. In that sense it is rather like a former South African Archbishop’s depiction of his Church: “like a train that will not take a sharp turn” Now at this point, I must confess, I have heard mutterings that, sometimes at these events, I tend to drift a little beyond my allotted time! So let me reassure you of two things. First there will be for insomniacs a fuller version of my take on what we did this year in the Letter to Stakeholders to be issued in a few weeks’ time. It will be on our website. Which means I shall be the soul of brevity now. Second, echoing the words of Lord Birket, I do not object to people looking at their watches when I am speaking. But I do strongly object when they start shaking them to make certain they are still working! Briefly, then, I take my hat off to you all here tonight in your response, as innocent bystanders, to the financial crisis that has been shaking the world beyond our shores. Government fiscal policy has been bold, just and effective. We at the Bank have adjusted our 
4 163/2009 monetary steps to dance in perfect cadence. To some applause from the Fund and the World Bank, I must add. Our banks have been prudent and a safe harbour in the storm. The private sector and our sanguine people in the market place have managed the business of business very well. I think tonight you can all take a collective bow! For unlike the general crash, abroad, here in Mauritius these last two years have definitely not been the worst of years. Indeed, all things considered, they shine through as some of our best, showing our fortitude and good judgment in weathering the storm. For here in Mauritius there is:  • No crisis of credit, • No crisis in housing,  • No collapse of banks, and  • Regulation which is sound, just, timely and respected. What is more, here in Mauritius:  • Inflation is coming down,  • Public debt is declining, • The economy is buoyant, • Revenue is increasing,  • Growth remains positive and  • You (at least) are all pretty safe in your jobs. Here, I am reminded of the difference between recession and depression, as defined by Harry Truman: “It’s a recession when your neighbour loses his job; it’s a depression when you lose yours.” Now, as some of you may guess, I am very preoccupied these days but I am certainly not depressed.  For we are: • Improving our forecasting methods,  • Establishing more transparency, • Already rolling out added support to enterprises in distress and to SMEs,  • Seeing more efficiency and more customer-friendly services, stimulated by our smart fresh high street entrants showing the old timers a new trick or two, and • Moving towards a regional role as a clearing house for COMESA. Total assets in banks here continue to grow well, both in deposits and advances, with scarcely a whiff of the toxic fumes that are besetting our distant neighbours.  Thus, as you will appreciate from these brief remarks, my stewardship of the Bank has not been as negative as some recent press coverage might lead the uninformed observer to believe. Let me give you a few other strong positives. First, our management of foreign exchange reserves. Our net international reserves increased by nearly Rs18 billion to stand at Rs96 billion in October 2009. That’s an increase of nearly 23% since December 2006. This constitutes more that 40 weeks’ imports, as against 38 weeks of imports in December 2007, notwithstanding the rise in the value of imports during this period. Still on this topic, tiny Mauritius became the 2nd country to participate in the Fund’s gold sales this year, coming hard on the heels of the South Asian Elephant, India. 
BIS Review 163/2009 5 Second, the exchange rate. The rupee exchange rate index MERI1 and MERI2 which we rolled out last year, has declined steadily since May this year to close at around 98 in November 2009, compared to its base of 100 for Calendar Year 2007, thus indicating an appreciation of the rupee. I understand that last week Bloomberg commented that the rupee appreciated by 2% vis à vis the dollar, in spite of our “Theatre de Boulevard”. The Bank also acted as lender of last resort in foreign exchange at about this time last year when trade credit lines dried up. I am sure the grand daddy of central banking, Bagehot, would have approved. Third, banking and finance. The banking sector, which is the bread and butter of the Central Bank, has seen its profit surge by a full 50% since December 2006 to reach Rs 12.6 billion for the year ended 30 June 2009. While banks in the rest of the world are drowning in red ink, we have seen non-performing loans declining to a historical low of 2.5% in September 2009. Thus, there is scarcely a whiff of the toxic fumes that are besetting banking elsewhere. Both banking sector assets and banking deposits grew by nearly 22% between December 2006 to September 2009. And there is not a trace of any credit crunch as advances have increased by over 60% to stand at Rs 427 billion at the end of the period, of which nearly 40% was directed to the domestic market. Banks have also expanded their footprint in the country, with the number of branches going up from 177 to 202, and the number of ATM’s increasing from 326 to 376 during the last three years. Employment in the banking sector has gone up by about 30 per cent from 4,923 in December 2006 to 6,365 in September 2009. Many central banks have sent their officers to our Bank on attachment and study tours to see how we conduct business in various areas of central banking. This redounds to the credit of the institution, which is a small player but is known and respected. Of course, when I look back over the past 2½ years, I do have some regrets about what might have been but did not happen. I realize that vision is not enough to effect organizational change to make the Bank perform at optimal level. I am dismayed by the resistance which I encountered when I tried to introduce what is now being termed “dynamic provisioning” last year to provide for future expected losses, which was then sheer anathema to the accounting profession, but which is likely to become accepted as a new standard soon. Thus, the Bank missed a golden opportunity to be a pace-setter in this area in the emerging world.  Another regret is our failure as the main provider of data on banking, finance and international trade to the IMF to graduate to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standards. Had other key players in the sector shared our vision, we would have ranked with Malta and Cyprus, both of which joined the league of SDDS countries last week. All is not lost, though, as we are working hard to join this higher reporting standard so that we can rank among the best. Punching above one’s weight has always been a key driver for many of my actions. This is done more easily if the entire team shares the same mind-set and is prepared to leave their comfort zone to reach ever higher and higher. Hilary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, has been lavishing praise on our government as an economic and moral leader in Africa. The World Bank has given our economy a clean bill of health. The IMF is holding what it calls our “hybrid system of inflation targeting” as a model for other countries to emulate. And, for good measure, the Fund has re-classified our exchange rate regime as “free floating”, going up one notch above “managed floating.” We do not have the vaulting ambition to aim for the next level, which is that of a reserve currency! To a troubled world we seem to have offered some fresh tuition. Yet we should beware of hubris. So let us be warned by H G Wells, one of the founding fathers of that fine institution, LSE – much beloved of our Minister of Finance, and my daughter – who asserted over 100 years ago:  
6 163/2009 “Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe”.  Thus we must learn from the current troubles, shrewdly building on our evidence-based approach to business, banking and finance. The World Economic Forum index may put us top of the African league on probity, but we still come low on the Global list; Hilary likes our form of democracy, but the Privy Council has probed some of our political election practices and found some of our customs wanting. We may be getting along in economic growth; but what about the degradation of our natural environment and the effectiveness of our response to the risks of climate change and sea level rise?  Our lodestar must be the rule of law, and not those quaint misleading dubious customs of the past. Let us pay due respect to our electoral laws and codes, and our banking laws and regulations, and to the safe future of our natural environment. It is our commitment to these duties in business, that can best protect our state and our planet earth from degradation and our people and our leaders from unwarranted calumny.  Now, perhaps as never before, we must face the music, and press on with those reforms in our practices that will keep us resilient and on the fast track to growth with equity and justice. Or we will all face the fate of the dodo.  Finally, I must observe, that a core problem with business, as with fiscal and monetary policy, is knowing whether it will be a success. Last time I offered you the Maradonna theory of interest rates; tonight may I close by offering you the Albert Einstein theory of success. I hope this will help many in business who are addicted workaholics.  Einstein proposed a very simple formula: A= X +Y+Z, where A represents success in Life, X is work, Y is play, and Z is keeping your mouth shut. I can hear your silent imprecations that I pay some heed to that last Z element! But, before I do so, let me call upon you all, to rise and drink a toast, to a prosperous new future for banking in Mauritius, coupled firmly with the real economy and the private sector and a firm commitment in our work to face the music and dance with agility to our own Mauritian tunes.  Thank you! 
BIS Review 163/2009 1 Heng Swee Keat: New strategies for new economic realities Remarks by Mr Heng Swee Keat, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the 16th Annual World Islamic Banking Conference, Bahrain, 7 December 2009. *      *      * H.E. Governor Rasheed M. Al Maraj, Central Bank of Bahrain, H.E. Aset O. Issekeshev, Minister of Industry and Trade, Republic of Kazakhstan, Your Excellencies Distinguished guests Ladies and gentlemen 1. Good morning. I am honoured to speak at this plenary session of the 16th World Islamic Banking Conference. Global crisis and recovery 2. The theme of “New Strategies for New Economic Realities” is timely. Last year, the financial crisis that enveloped the world was unprecedented in scale, complexity and speed of transmission. Major financial institutions have failed and others continue to face significant challenges ahead. 3. The outlook seems better now than a year ago. Equity markets have rallied and credit spreads narrowed. Many Asian and GCC economies have recovered more quickly and strongly than expected with China and India leading the way. ASEAN-5 and GCC countries are expected to post small positive growth in 2009. Going into 2010, growth in ASEAN-5 and GCC is estimated to rebound sharply to 4% and 5.2% respectively. 4. However, sentiments remain volatile and investors react sharply to bad news, as recent events have shown. The global de-leveraging of financial institutions is still on-going. The IMF has highlighted that global banks and financial institutions have yet to recognize more than half of their total estimated write-downs of US$3.4 trillion. So far, growth has been supported by the massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. Indeed, studies of past crises suggest that economic recoveries in the aftermath of financial crises tended to be protracted. Many analysts therefore expect global growth to be slower in the coming years. 5. Against this backdrop, what should be the growth strategies of emerging economies, and what is the role of financial institutions, especially Islamic financial institutions? 6. Even with slower global growth, emerging Asian and Middle Eastern economies are expected to grow at higher rates than advanced economies. There are many positives working in their favour – abundant natural resources and monetary reserves; young and dynamic populations, growing consumer demand, large infrastructural programmes underway in some areas like water, energy, transport, education and healthcare. Generally, balance sheets of corporates and households are in better shape than it was in earlier years. 7. With the growing importance of emerging economies, we will see changes in the patterns of trade and development. There will be stronger “south-south” trade. The old pattern of “flying geese” development in Asian newly-industrialised economies, where developed economies bring in investment and technologies, will give way to a more variegated pattern, where companies in the emerging markets will invest in other markets. We already see many corporates from emerging markets developing disruptive technologies and business models that address market needs in very competitive ways. It will be a more diverse and vibrant landscape in the future. 
2 163/2009 8. However, growth is not to be taken for granted. Many challenges remain. Let me suggest three areas where policy makers and financial practitioners in the Middle East and Asia can work together to contribute to growth and development. 9. First, at the recently-concluded APEC meetings in Singapore, it was recognised that sustainable global growth will require structural reforms and a new growth paradigm. We can no longer rely on export-led growth in developing countries and high consumption in the developed world driven by excessive leverage and asset appreciation. Big economies like China and India have greater scope to restructure their economies and raise domestic demand. Smaller economies such as Singapore and Bahrain have to re-orientate themselves and respond nimbly to new opportunities in global markets. 10. In both the GCC and Asian regions, the funding needs to support growth and development are large. For instance, the Asian Development Bank has projected that Asia requires US$8 trillion of new infrastructure over the next decade. Such investments are important for economic growth, as well as for raising the quality of life by providing better access to education, health care and sanitation. Hence, as part of the structural reforms, governments need to put in place investment frameworks that promote and mitigate the risk of such long term investments. 11. Second, proper financing structure for such investment is crucial. Today, there is strong risk appetite for emerging market assets. National authorities are concerned with the risks of asset inflation and volatility of capital flows. But properly structured, these provide unique opportunities to channel the much-needed capital for growth and development. In this regard, Islamic finance which has its central emphasis on supporting real economic activities in trade, investment and the growth of productive capacities is especially relevant. 12. However, effective intermediation of capital requires focused attention on the management of risks. As I mentioned in my speech at the previous WIBC, many risks – including credit, market, liquidity, operational and reputational risks are common to both conventional and Islamic finance. Overly-optimistic projections of growth, or over-concentration in particular sectors, or mismatches in assets and liabilities can give rise to risks that can damage financial institutions. The crisis serves as a valuable pause from the frenzy of financial activities. This allows us to re-evaluate risk management practices in individual financial institutions, as well as the systemic linkages across institutions, instruments and markets. 13. Central banks and regulators need to cooperate closely so that risk assessments can be shared and common action taken where necessary. The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) and MAS have enjoyed very good relations, and have worked to promote Islamic Finance. The CBB is a highly-regarded central bank and integrated financial regulator. I am pleased that the MAS and CBB will be signing a Memorandum of Understanding later today to build on our existing strong relationship to enhance supervisory cooperation and information-sharing. 14. The third area relates to close interactions among industry practitioners and the development of ground knowledge. While there are many opportunities for trade and investment among emerging economies, the business linkages are only beginning to grow. Forums such as the WIBC provide a valuable platform for practitioners to build their knowledge of each region and the business leaders. At the same time, for large-scale and long-term investments such as in infrastructure, effective knowledge of partners and on-the-ground presence are important ways of mitigating risks. Recent developments in Singapore 15. Let me therefore take this opportunity to say a few words about developments in Singapore. As an international financial centre in Asia, Singapore seeks to develop Islamic finance by leveraging on our existing strengths in banking, insurance, asset management 
BIS Review 163/2009 3 and capital markets. Although relatively new, we have seen steady progress. MAS launched its Sukuk early this year. The Islamic Development Bank also issued a $200m Singapore dollar-denominated trust certificate. In May, Olam International, a local trading firm tied up with the Islamic Bank of Asia to launch a Commodity Murabaha based on agricultural trade flows. Just last month, Singapore’s Keppel T&T and Saudi Arabia’s Al Rajhi Holding Group announced an agreement to establish a joint venture asset management company to manage the world’s first Shariah-compliant data centre fund. Other Singapore companies and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are also using Shariah-compliant structures for their financing needs. 16. We were honoured to host the 5th Islamic Financial Services Board Annual Summit in May. At this Summit, MAS issued a consolidated set of guidelines to provide greater clarity and certainty on how our banking regulations apply to Islamic banking. Islamic finance was also featured when the Paris EUROPLACE International Financial Forum was held in Singapore in October. We will continue to work with fellow regulators and the private sector to fine-tune our regulatory approach and to develop the infrastructure and talent to facilitate the growth of Islamic Finance in Singapore. 17. As I mentioned earlier, bringing leaders in finance and business together to understand the developments in each region provides a valuable platform for collaboration. I am therefore pleased that MEGA Events has decided to bring the first Annual WIBC Asian Summit (Asia WIBC 2010) to Singapore. Islamic finance will provide an increasingly important bridge in the growing connectivity between the Middle East and Asia. Singapore is pleased to help catalyse deeper relations between these two high-growth regions. Asia WIBC will provide a unique platform for industry players from more established centres of Islamic finance to share their experiences. I look forward to welcoming all of you to the inaugural Asia WIBC in Singapore next June. Conclusion 18. In conclusion, the global economy is recovering gradually, though there remain many risks ahead. Emerging economies are expected to grow well, but we need to tackle the many structural challenges. Governments need to undertake structural reforms. The financial sector needs to facilitate the flow of funds into growth areas, and Islamic Finance will play an important role. By working closely to deepen risk management, and to enhance the ground knowledge in each region, we can contribute to sustainable growth. On this note, I wish you another very successful conference in Bahrain. 
BIS Review 168/2009 1 Mark Carney: Current issues in household finances Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, at The National Forum (Canadian Club of Toronto and Empire Club of Canada), Toronto, 16 December 2009. *      *      * Introduction As the holiday season approaches, our attention turns naturally to the home front. Accordingly, my comments this afternoon will focus on households. I would like to concentrate in particular on the implications of Canadian household finances for financial stability in our country.  I spoke here in Toronto a year ago, almost to the day. Then, the global financial sector crisis was buffeting the real economy. Businesses were postponing large investments, and households were hesitating over major purchases. It was clear then that 2009 would be a difficult year, and so it has proved. With more than 400,000 jobs lost and a $30 billion fall in output, the Canadian economy has suffered a deep, albeit brief, recession.  Today, the outlook has improved. While significant fragilities remain, the global economic recovery is now supported by several factors. First, feedback between financial markets and the real economy has reversed direction. In most major economies, the inventory cycle has turned and housing sectors are stabilizing. In addition, considerable fiscal expansion and monetary stimulus are supporting domestic demand.  Nonetheless, the Bank expects underlying private demand in many economies to recover only slowly, as significant balance sheet and structural adjustments have yet to run their course. In particular, the rebound in U.S. consumption is projected to be more moderate than in previous cycles. This will have direct implications for Canada. While the Canadian economy will likely grow faster than the other G-7 countries next year, the Bank expects our recovery to be more protracted and more reliant on domestic demand than usual (Chart 1). In the near term, Canada will grow despite – not because of – the pace of external activity.  The behaviour of Canadian households will thus be particularly important. Before turning to that in more detail, I would like to briefly review the challenges facing U.S. households, both for their direct impact on Canada and for the insights they offer for financial stability. U.S. household sector For a generation, U.S. households increasingly “saved” through capital appreciation rather than from current income. Over the last three decades, U.S. consumer spending grew substantially faster than national income, driving the ratio of consumption to GDP from 62 per cent to a record 70 per cent (Chart 2). In the same period, the personal savings rate fell from 11 per cent of disposable income to 1 per cent, while household debt doubled from 84 per cent of disposable income to 165 per cent.1  Financial innovations, including home equity loans and securitization, drove these trends. Initially, they increased financial system efficiency, diversified risk, and smoothed consumption. Over time, however, these financial technologies were applied increasingly indiscriminately. Prudence gave way to exuberance to the extent that the subprime-mortgage                                                  1 Household debt includes the liabilities of households, non-profit organizations, and unincorporated businesses, as the debt of the latter is ultimately a claim on the household sector. 
2 BIS Review 168/2009 market became a mainstay of the expansion.2 When the U.S. housing bubble collapsed under its own weight, households with the least resilience were the hardest hit.  An important lesson of the American experience was that the costs were not confined to the most vulnerable households. In a now-familiar chain, problems in subprime quickly spread to prime mortgages, structured products in general, core funding markets, and, ultimately, the capital bases of most major financial institutions. Eventually, virtually every financial asset in the world was repriced. Financial stability is as much about linkages as it is about specific risks. Shocks can have large, unanticipated consequences. A lengthy period of adjustment for the U.S. consumer has just begun (Chart 3). A decline of roughly 30 per cent in wealth has promoted a quadrupling of the U.S. personal savings rate to 4.5 per cent. Nonetheless, household debt levels have not fallen substantially, and consumer spending as a share of GDP actually rose to a new high of 71 per cent in the third quarter.3 Given the historic declines in net worth and the need to save for retirement, it appears clear that U.S. household savings need to remain elevated for an extended period of time.  The new equilibrium for household savings will depend on multiple factors, including wealth effects, risk aversion, the evolution of the financial system, the employment outlook, and the credibility of fiscal policy.4 The Bank currently projects that the U.S. personal savings rate will average around 5.5 per cent over the next two years. This judgment is consistent with ultimately stabilizing the U.S. net foreign liability position and rebuilding U.S. household wealth.5  This sustained, higher savings rate will produce a historically weak recovery in U.S. consumer spending and accounts for the Bank’s relatively subdued forecast for overall U.S. economic growth (Chart 4).  Canada’s household sector Canadian household finances were in better shape going into the crisis than those of Americans. The Canadian personal savings rate was higher and household debt was lower (Chart 5). The ratio of consumer spending to GDP, at 55 per cent, was below the longer-term average in Canada. As a consequence, when the crisis struck, Canadian households were less vulnerable.  Moreover, throughout the downturn, Canadian labour and housing markets held up better (Charts 6 and 7), meaning that the incomes and net worth of Canadians were not as hard hit as those of Americans (Chart 3). So, while there is no doubt the financial crisis and accompanying recession have been painful here, Canadians have had less need to increase savings to restore their balance sheets.  Still, Canadians have saved more. The personal savings rate in this country rose to an eight-year high of 5.5 per cent in the second quarter. The Bank projects that this rate will moderate only slightly over the medium term. We view the sharp increases in household savings as                                                  2 Residential investment accounted for roughly 14 per cent of GDP growth from 2003 to 2005, inclusive. Subprime mortgages accounted for 20 per cent of new mortgage originations in 2005 and more than 22 per cent in 2006. 3 It is worth noting that in an environment of rising unemployment, the savings rate of U.S. households that are working has risen even more sharply than the aggregate numbers suggest. 4  For example, Ricardian equivalence predicts that households would save more in response to higher government deficits, anticipating the future tax liabilities required to address the rising public debt. 5 To the 2002–04 average over the next five years. 
BIS Review 168/2009 3 largely precautionary, that is, reflecting uncertainty about the economic outlook and financial conditions. As the economy begins to grow again and confidence is gradually restored, we expect that some of these precautionary savings will be unwound, and that some consumers will take further advantage of unusually low borrowing rates. Indeed, our current stimulative monetary policy is meant, in part, to encourage such behaviour. Stronger growth in domestic consumption will be necessary to offset weak external demand in order to restore the Canadian economy to balance and inflation to target. Recent data have been consistent with these expectations. Going forward, there are risks, on both the upside and the downside, to this outlook for the Canadian personal savings rate. Canadian households could remain more cautious, chastened by the recent financial and economic trauma, leading to more durably elevated savings. Some of the issues brought to the fore by the crisis, such as retirement funding, could also alter household savings behaviour over the nearer term. Over the next few days, the federal, provincial, and territorial finance ministers will meet to discuss these issues, in recognition of their importance to Canadians. Finally, more protracted U.S. and global recoveries could restrain Canadian households, by affecting both the confidence and economic prospects of Canadians.  On the other hand, there is a risk that, as growth returns, the resilience of Canadian households through the crisis could lead to declines in the savings rate that are sharper, and increases in household borrowing that are larger, than the Bank has projected.  Whatever happens, the Bank’s monetary policy reaction to consumer behaviour will always be driven by its implications – taken in conjunction with all other relevant factors – for inflation over the medium-term horizon.  Households and financial stability in Canada Household finances are also important for financial system stability. As was painfully learned from the U.S. experience, a stable financial system is fundamental for the effective functioning of the economy and the financial welfare of citizens. In this regard, there are two important considerations. First, financial and price stability share common determinants but have different time horizons. Inflation continuously reflects real shocks and/or policy responses, while financial vulnerabilities are much less predictable. They develop over time and can persist for longer than expected. Simply put, behaviour consistent with price stability over the medium term could simultaneously build financial stresses over a longer horizon. Second, when evaluating the financial condition of Canadians, we need to look beyond the aggregate for possible changes in distribution of debt among households.  The Financial System Review (FSR) is a semi-annual Bank publication that examines developments in the financial system and provides an analysis of policy directions in the sector. In our most recent FSR, we judge that most of the risks to the stability of the Canadian financial system have ebbed in recent months. At the same time, our assessment of the risks related to household balance sheets is that they have increased further. As noted in the FSR, the vulnerability of Canadian households to adverse wealth and income shocks has grown in recent years. Aggregate debt levels have risen sharply relative to income. Those debt levels have continued to grow fairly rapidly this year, unusually so for a recession.6 For some households, this additional indebtedness has translated into increased                                                  6 Real consumer credit, including home equity lines of credit, has grown at a 7 per cent pace over the past year, in contrast with the outright declines during the recessions of the early 1980s and 1990s. 
4 BIS Review 168/2009 financial stress. Personal bankruptcies in Canada rose 41 per cent in the third quarter from the same period a year ago, leaving the number of bankruptcies as a proportion of the population at its highest level since 1991. Delinquency rates on loans have risen as well, with the proportion of mortgages with payments in arrears three months or more having increased by half over the past year.  Stress testing the Canadian household sector  To understand better the vulnerability of Canadian households, and the consequences for financial stability, the Bank undertakes regular stress tests. The June FSR reported on the potential impact of a more severe economic downturn on households. The results illustrated that a hypothetical increase in unemployment could produce loan losses for financial institutions representing about 10 per cent of their Tier 1 capital.7  While the near-term risks from a further sharp deterioration in labour markets have diminished, the Bank believes that overall risks to financial stability arising from the household sector have continued to increase. In particular, the combination of sustained growth of household debt relative to income and a rising interest rate environment could increase the vulnerability of households to an adverse shock. In the current FSR, the Bank conducts stress-test scenarios to examine the potential impact of growing debt and rising interest rates on the debt-service ratio of Canadian households (Table 1). We look at scenarios such as these, not because we think they are the most likely outcome, but rather to provide an assessment of downside risks that could potentially generate stress in the Canadian financial system. The simulation generates a scenario indicating that, by the middle of 2012, almost one in ten (9.6 per cent) Canadian households would have a debt-service ratio greater than 40 per cent, the threshold above which households are considered financially vulnerable (Table 2). Moreover, the percentage of debt owed by these vulnerable households would almost double. Both of these metrics are well above their recent peaks.8  While these simulation results are purely illustrative, they give pause for reflection. It would not be healthy to have almost 20 per cent of household debt extended to vulnerable households. Nor is it necessary to secure our recovery. The risks are not isolated to the most vulnerable. A shock to economic conditions could be transmitted to the broader financial system through deterioration in the credit quality of loans to households. In such an event, increased loan-loss provisions and reduced quality of the remaining loans could lead to tighter credit conditions more broadly and, in turn, to mutually reinforcing declines in real activity and in the health of the financial sector. While the broader effects are difficult to anticipate with precision, some sectors, such as retail and housing, would likely be affected more than others. Such a shock would also affect certain segments of the capital markets, such as credit card securitization. More fundamentally, strains on the household sector could also cause a more generalized rise in risk premia, with attendant negative implications for a variety of asset prices.                                                  7 This is the direct impact and excludes indirect effects from induced stress on businesses and financial markets. 8 Both these metrics peaked in 2000 when 7.4 per cent of Canadian households had a debt-service ratio greater than 40 per cent, and the percentage of debt held by these households reached almost 14 per cent. Data available goes back to 1999. 
BIS Review 168/2009 5 Conclusion At present, the risks arising from the Canadian household sector are relatively low. Indeed, by some measures, Canadian household finances appear quite healthy. The current rate of mortgage arrears, for example, remains more than one-third below its peak in the early 1990s. Going into the crisis, Canadian households carried considerably less debt than their American counterparts. That remains true today. Data released Monday show that rebounding housing and financial markets increased Canadian household net worth to 589 per cent of disposable income by the end of the third quarter, above its 10-year average.  While asset prices can rise and fall, debt endures. Moreover, the linkages between the real economy and the financial sector are complex, non-linear, and often opaque. That is why we cannot afford to be complacent. Indeed, one objective of using the FSR to profile risks to the Canadian financial system is to help prevent these risks from materializing. When risks are still manageable is precisely the best time to act. We must be vigilant, and all parties must fulfill their responsibilities. Responsibility starts with the individual. Our advice to Canadians has been consistent: We have weathered a severe crisis – one that required extraordinary fiscal and monetary measures. Extraordinary measures are the means to an end: the return to the ordinary. Although we expect the recovery to be gradual and protracted, these measures are working. Ordinary times will eventually return and, with them, more normal interest rates and costs of borrowing. It is the responsibility of households now to ensure that in the future, when the recovery takes hold and extraordinary measures are unwound, they can still service their debts.  Similarly, lenders have responsibilities. Financial institutions should actively monitor risk stemming from households and not take false comfort derived from mortgage insurance and past performance of household credit. As our simulations suggest, the overall credit profile of Canadian households could well shift if debt continues to grow at current rates. The Bank expects that Canada’s financial institutions will continue to apply their high standards of risk management, for which they are being justly lauded the world over.  Policy-makers and regulators, including the Bank of Canada, have responsibilities, as well. The Bank is working intensively with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) at the Basel Committee on the design of new international capital and liquidity standards. The Bank collaborates closely with the Department of Finance and discusses with federal agencies, as required, to monitor evolving risks and take appropriate actions. The Bank’s ongoing research and analysis of the financial system, including the work I have discussed today, is an important element of our commitment to helping ensure Canada has a resilient, secure financial system that enhances the economic and financial welfare of all Canadians.

BIS Review 168/2009 1 Mohammed Laksaci: Investment financing in Algeria  Speech by Dr Mohammed Laksaci, Governor of the Bank of Algeria, at the Japan-Arab Economic Forum, Tokyo, 7–8 December 2009. *      *      * 1. Recent economic and financial developments The deep and synchronized recession in advanced economies, which resulted from the deepening financial crisis during 2008 and which rapidly spread to many emerging and developing countries, appears to recede. Indeed, the second and third quarters of 2009 recorded the first signs of stabilization and even some signs of improvement in the global financial situation. The massive public interventions in many countries have contributed to reducing systemic risks and uncertainties in the financial markets.  However, signs of malfunctioning in the financial sector remain and commercial banks are still dependent on exceptional budgetary support and central banks, in the context of gradual recovery in some advanced countries. Ensuring sustainable growth anchored to financial stability remains a major challenge. The spill over of the impact of the global financial crisis and recession to emerging and developing countries is well established in the first half of 2009, especially in countries affected by sudden capital outflows in the context of high exposure of their banking sector to international financial markets. In response, recovery plans focussed on supporting domestic demand have been implemented in a number of emerging countries, particularly in Asia, thereby contributing to stimulating commodity export recovery in Latin America and the Middle-East. With limited exposure to international financial markets, Algeria has not been directly affected by the global financial turmoil. However, the sharp decline in oil prices over the second half of 2008 significantly impacted export and budget revenues. Despite this external shock, macroeconomic performance remained robust in 2009 with: – strong external financial position with comfortable international reserves (US$ billion146, end September 2009 ) equivalent to 3 years imports of goods and services, and low external debt; – the real effective exchange rate around its equilibrium level; – continued high growth in the non-oil sector, expected to exceed 9% in 2009 against 6.1% in 2008; – sizeable savings in the stabilization fund despite the expected first budget deficit for several years; – contained inflation, notably on account of continued absorption by the Bank of Algeria of the excess liquidity. The strong economic performance in 2009, in line with the performance of the past several years, reflects continued prudent financial policies, sustained efforts to anchor monetary stability, and progress in strengthening the resilience of the banking sector, which have supported macroeconomic stability since 2000.  2. Savings and investment financing structure Following a period of external financial imbalances and related adjustment programs during the nineties, Algeria has entered, since 2000, a period of sustained increase in savings, leading to a situation of excess savings over investment. Despite a situation of increasing 
2 BIS Review 168/2009 investment rates, the ratio of total savings to GDP reached 57% in 2008 against 48% in 2004, leading to a context of excess saving rates of 13% to 24,7% over the period. These developments have allowed sizeable reserve accumulation, particularly from 2004 (US$ billion 43) to 2008 (US$ billion 143) as a cushion against possible external shocks, including shocks of a “sudden stop” nature. Anchored to regained macroeconomic stability, a large public investment program was launched in 2001 (2001–04) followed by a larger one in 2005 (2005–09). Implementation of the two public investment programs significantly stimulated gross fixed capital formation, with public investments representing 56.5% of total investment in 2008 up from 40.8% in 2004. Over the past five years, public investments (economic and social infrastructure, housing, agriculture and water, others) amounted to US$ billion 80 (representing 51% of a total of US$ billion 156). It should be noted that foreign companies, particularly from Asia, hold a significant position in terms of implementation of the public investment programs. In parallel, the national oil company (Sonatrach) implemented ambitious annual investment plans over the past 3 years, increasing the annual investment envelope from US$ billion 4.8 in 2006 to US$ billion 8.5 in 2008. For the past 5 years, the ratio of Sonatrach’s investment to total investment reached 17.6% (17.1% in 2008). For 2009, Sonatrach’s investment program amounts to US$ billion 16.5.  Investment of the remaining sectors of the economy represented 31% of total investment over the period 2004–08. In 2008, this ratio was 26.4%, although investment in these sectors increased sharply during this year (+37.4%).  In the context of structural excess savings over investments, the structure of investment financing in Algeria over the past 5 years reflects the predominance of self-financing (82.5%) on account of the budgetary financing of the public investment programs. Indeed, with significantly increased financing capacity, domestic financing has been the sole source of public investments financing, at a time where external debt was significantly reduced, notably through advanced repayments of nearly all public external debt (which amounted to US$ billion 13.9 by end 2003). Domestic public debt has also been significantly reduced to a level representing 6.6% of GDP in 2008, down from 18.7% of GDP in 2003. In addition, available resources in the stabilization fund amounted to US$ billion 59 by end 2008, representing a sizeable self-financing capacity which allows continued implementation of the investment program (2009–10) in the context of external shocks. While Sonatrach’s investments were partly – although to a large extent – financed on the company’s own resources over the period 2001–04, accumulated savings (reaching US$ billion 18 by end 2008) have since allowed for total self-financing of the oil company’s investments, with investments in 2009 upstream and downstream significantly increasing, in view of the important opportunities in the sector and in line with the objective of achieving potential capacity. Investment in the remaining sectors of the economy have also been, to a large extent, self-financed (44.2% during the period 2004–08) while financial savings of private enterprises and households increased. The share of bank financing, mainly domestic, represented 50.5% while bond issuance covered 5.3% of financing needs.  Domestic medium and long term bank loans, which have been substantially increasing over the past 5 years, have been oriented to investments in productive non-oil sectors, notably energy and water sectors where investments have significantly increased. Anchored to relatively stable and sustainable resources, the development of credit allocation has been notable, with credit to the economy increasing by 15.7% in 2007 and 18.6% in 2008. Growth in the credit to the economy in 2009 remained strong (19.4%, twelve months increase by June 2009) at a time where many emerging economies faced bank credit contractions. Credit to private enterprises and households represents a large share of total allocated credit (54 to 55% over the past 3 years). Medium and long term (investment) credit 
BIS Review 168/2009 3 increased by 20.9% in 2008 and 12.9% in the first half of 2009, reflecting favorable domestic bank financing conditions.  In this favorable financing context, additional measures have been introduced in the Supplementary Budget Law of July 2009, aimed at further promoting credit to small and medium size enterprises (SMEs), including increasing the maximum government guaranteed credit amount. In the same vein, banks are allowed to extend credit to their affiliates up to 25% of their tier 1 capital. In addition, additional cleaning of past nonperforming loans (NPLs) to public enterprises is being completed by the Treasury. Increased capital of the banks in 2009, in the context of abundant liquidity and sustained efforts to improve credit evaluation and risk management, should stimulate further improvement in banks’ credit allocation to productive investment in support of sustained growth. In particular, domestic financing available for companies established in partnership, as encouraged through measures introduced in the Supplementary Budget Law, should provide further opportunities to banks operating in Algeria. Finally, banks’ financial soundness, as reflected in their global capital adequacy ratio (16.54% in 2008), which is key to ensuring adequate financing of productive investment, should contribute to achieving growth potential in the non-oil sectors over the period 2010–14. 3. Exchange rate regime stability and foreign investment In the context of the liberalization of the exchange rate regime, as part of the 1994–98 structural adjustments, the process of convertibility of the dinar for international current transactions was completed in September 1997 when Algeria accepted the terms of Article VIII of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Articles. In parallel, the monetary authority promulgated in 1995 the regulation on interbank exchange market and related exchange rate hedging mechanisms. The operational framework was put in place by the Bank of Algeria and exchange market operations effectively started in 1996. The current convertibility of the dinar relates to all current transactions of the balance of payments (goods, services and transfers). Regulation 07–01 of February 3, 2007 on rules applicable to current transactions with the rest of the world has clearly confirmed this convertibility through its Article 3, which stipulates that: “... payments and transfers related to international current transactions are free. They take place through licensed intermediaries”. Regarding foreign direct investments, transfers of revenues, profits, and dividends are included in the scope of current convertibility. In case of asset sale or liquidation, transfer of the proceeds takes place through licensed intermediaries without delay, commensurate with Regulation 05–03 of June 6, 2005 on foreign investments, promulgated in implementation of Article 31 of the Ordinance on investment development. It should be noted that the measures introduced in the Supplementary Budget Law of July 2009 do not affect the current convertibility regime nor do they affect capital transfers related to foreign direct investments (FDIs). The measures do not give rise to any exchange restriction. The objective of the measures is to ensure the traceability of payments related to good faith transactions, hence contributing to combating the parallel sector and ensuring that banks operating in Algeria effectively fulfil their responsibility in terms of first-level control of the transactions with the rest of the world, in line with the terms of their license. Algeria remains committed to the stability of its exchange rate regime, commensurate with its commitments in the context of Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles and the Association agreement with the European Union (EU), notably regarding current payments and capital movements. Foreign direct investment in Algeria is a relatively recent development and has notably followed the achievement of balance of payments viability. For the past six years  (2003–2008), total FDIs amounted US$ billion 8.7, of which 47.3% from EU countries and 
4 BIS Review 168/2009 25.2% from Asian and Middle-Eastern and North African countries. The share of FDIs in the hydrocarbon sector in total FDIs, which reached 55% in 2005, has gradually declined to 42% on average during the recent years. Non-hydrocarbon sectors which attracted FDIs include the banking sector, chemical industry, food industry, electricity sector, water desalination, and construction material. The exchange rate policy is conducted by the Bank of Algeria in the context of a managed float regime of the dinar vis-à-vis the currencies of Algeria’s main trade partners. Since 2004, with a real effective exchange rate (REER) around the equilibrium level as determined by the economy’s fundamentals, exchange rate policy is well in line with external stability, the latter being anchored to a notably strong net external financial position. In operational terms, the Bank of Algeria intervenes in the interbank market to ensure that movements in the nominal exchange rate do not affect the long term equilibrium of the real effective exchange rate of the dinar.  In this context, despite high volatility of consumer prices and exchange rates in trading partners, including the sharp decline in oil prices in the second half of 2008 (one of the main fundamentals in Algeria’s economy), the REER has remained near its equilibrium level and the external financial position remains comfortable. 
BIS Review 168/2009 1 Lucas Papademos: Opening remarks at the press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the December 2009 ECB Financial Stability Review Opening remarks by Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the European Central Bank, at the press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the December 2009 ECB Financial Stability Review, Frankfurt am Main, 18 December 2009. *      *      * I. Introduction My colleagues and I would like to welcome you to today’s press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the December 2009 edition of the ECB Financial Stability Review.1 The primary objective of the Review is to consider the main sources of risk to the stability of the euro area financial system and provide a comprehensive assessment of the capacity of the financial system to absorb adverse disturbances. As usual, the Review has integrated the interdepartmental work of the ECB with that of the Banking Supervision Committee (BSC) of the ESCB. It contains 14 boxes and five special feature articles that address topical financial stability issues in a more focused and analytical manner. As in the past, we have prepared a summary note that highlights some key messages of our analysis and assessment. Over the past 12 months, the extraordinary policy measures taken by central banks and governments have succeeded in restoring confidence in, and strengthening the resilience of, financial systems around the world. In particular, financial system support measures have been addressing the funding problems of key financial institutions and have bolstered their capital positions. These measures, in combination with sizeable macroeconomic policy stimuli, have set in motion a mutually-reinforcing process between financial system conditions and real economic performance, fostering improving economic prospects and a fading of systemic risk. One important reason for the lowered systemic risk has been an abatement of tail risk, which has been primarily due to the downside-protection by governments of financial institutions’ balance sheets. A recovery of risk appetite, underpinned by the reduced systemic risk, has contributed to the remarkable turnaround in the financial markets since March 2009. The improved financial conditions and the steeper yield curves have sufficiently strengthened the profitability of many financial institutions, especially the large ones, to such an extent that they have been able to absorb considerable write-downs on securities and loans, while still, on average, reporting material improvements in profitability over three consecutive quarters.  In my presentation, I will highlight the main risks identified and assessed in the Review and the associated financial stability challenges. I will start with certain sources of risk stemming from the global macro-financial environment. II. Risks in the global macro-financial environment  Over the past six months, the adjustment of global current account imbalances has continued, driven by the global economic slowdown and the overall fall in commodity prices, especially energy, from the peaks of mid-2008. The current account deficit of the US is now projected to fall to 2.6% of GDP in 2009, which is almost 2.3 percentage points lower than in the previous year. The major counterparts to the adjustment of the US current account balance have continued to be the surplus economies of eastern Asia and the oil-exporting                                                  1 The cut-off date for data included in the December 2009 FSR was 27 November 2009. 
2 BIS Review 168/2009 countries. The current account surplus of Japan is projected to narrow to 1.9% of GDP in 2009, while China’s current account surplus is forecast to decline by 2 percentage points to 7.8% GDP in 2009, as robust domestic demand has underpinned imports growth which has exceeded that of exports. However, this ongoing adjustment of global imbalances is rather fragile, as it remains largely driven by cyclical factors related to the financial crisis rather than by structural factors. Looking ahead, there is a risk of re-emergence of sizeable global imbalances stemming from various sources, including a possible widening of the US current account deficit as the economy recovers and if the substantial fiscal stimulus persists.  Turning to external risks stemming more directly from the US economy, there were some positive developments, but vulnerabilities also remain. The US housing market has shown some signs of stabilisation over recent months. Both home sales and housing construction appear to have bottomed out since earlier this year, while the decline in house prices ceased in July 2009. The Case-Shiller futures price index for ten major US cities now indicates that house prices are expected to remain broadly flat over the next three years (see Chart 1). Nevertheless, the risk of a renewed deterioration in the US housing market and, therefore, possible further losses for households’ net worth in the US and the financial sector has not disappeared. While the pace of increase in delinquencies on mortgages and in foreclosures has been slowing down, the excess stock of vacant homes remains considerable and might continue to exert downward pressure on house prices. In addition, the demand for housing has been spurred by tax credits for first-time home buyers, but this incentive has a limited time horizon.  In the US commercial property sector, developments have lagged those in the residential property market, both with regard to prices and activity. The recent steep fall in prices raises risks both for banks and other financial institutions that are directly exposed to the commercial property market and for investors in US commercial mortgage-backed securities.  The outlook for US corporate sector has stabilised since May 2009, as quarter-on-quarter profit growth has turned positive in the first half of 2009. This has mainly been due to a turnaround in the profitability of domestic financial industries (See Chart 2). As a consequence, corporate sector default rates are expected to peak. Notwithstanding the improvement in total corporate profitability, there are risks: the increase in non-financial corporate profitability has been largely due to cost-cutting measures, which could not continue indefinitely, while weak demand prospects are expected to constrain revenue growth.  The macroeconomic outlook in the non-euro area EU countries has improved, although there is still an unusually high degree of uncertainty. In many of the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries of the EU, vulnerabilities have been reduced since May, but the economic and financial situation remains fragile. In particular, further economic contraction is forecast for a number of these countries next year. In this environment, a combination of rising unemployment and falling household incomes could be expected to raise the credit risks on consumer loans and residential mortgages. Corporate default rates are likely to be high in such a context as well. Given these fragilities, the possibility of a resurfacing of risk aversion towards the region can not be excluded.  In several CEE economies, vulnerabilities stem from the fact that a sizeable proportion of outstanding bank loans are denominated in currencies other than the currency in which the borrower’s income is denominated. Such mismatched foreign exchange currency positions mostly affect households. In countries with flexible exchange rates, currency depreciations earlier this year have meant that households would have to repay larger amounts than they expected. Recent developments serve to underline the risks that exist when large stocks of foreign currency credit are outstanding. The share of foreign currency lending in many of these countries has been rising, owing to wide interest rate differentials. This has left them increasingly vulnerable to a renewed weakening of their currencies, which could trigger a significant further deterioration in banks’ asset quality. 
BIS Review 168/2009 3 The general recovery of risk appetite has benefited the hedge fund sector. By the end of October 2009, most hedge fund investment strategies have already recouped a substantial part, or even all, of the losses they suffered in 2008. Cumulative average year-to-date investment returns at the end of October 2009 of all hedge fund investment strategies had almost all signs opposite to those reported for the whole of 2008 (See Chart 3). At the same time, after significant investor outflows in earlier quarters, preliminary estimates for the third quarter of 2009 suggest that the second quarter of 2009 may have marked the end of sector-wide investor outflows.  III. Risks in the euro area non-financial sectors  Let me now focus on risks and vulnerabilities that we have identified in the non-financial sectors of the euro area economy. Despite the considerable heterogeneity at the country level, the overall macroeconomic environment in the euro area has improved over the past six months. The decline in euro area economic activity has been sharp by historical standards since the third quarter of last year, but quarterly real GDP growth has recently turned positive (see Chart 4). In addition, the latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections show a gradual recovery in 2010, although the road ahead is likely to be uneven. Among the risks stemming from the euro area non-financial sectors, I will highlight the main vulnerabilities in the corporate sector, specific fragilities in the commercial property market, and certain risks associated with the household sector. Over the past six months, corporate profitability has remained very low and leverage ratios have generally increased, intensifying the balance sheet vulnerabilities of the non-financial corporate sector. In addition, banks have continued to apply conservative lending standards, albeit at a moderating degree. Improvements in financial market conditions have allowed larger firms to partly substitute bank loans with market-based debt or equity. Looking forward over the next few months, the overall balance sheet conditions are expected to remain challenging, as firms’ access to external finance is not likely to improve significantly in the coming months, while profitability is likely to remain low. Low profitability and high leverage are putting a severe strain on firms, making them less resilient to adverse shocks. As a consequence, some measures of corporate credit risk, such as unconditional expected default frequencies, remain high for most industries although they had declined recently for most sectors. (See Chart 5). Conditions in the euro area commercial property markets have deteriorated further during the past six months and continue to be a potential source of risk to many financial institutions. Capital values – i.e. commercial property prices adjusted for capital expenditure, maintenance and depreciation – for prime property had declined by an average of 12% (year-on-year) in the third quarter of 2009. All euro area countries had recorded declining capital values compared with the third quarter of 2008. The outlook for commercial property prices and rents is uncertain because it largely depends on the future path of economic activity as developments in commercial property markets follow the business cycle rather closely (See Chart 6). Some forecasters expect continued decreases in capital values and rents throughout 2009 and 2010. Turning next to the household sector, although household indebtedness has stabilised over the past six months, the balance sheets of this sector remain a potential source of risk to financial stability. A relatively negative outlook for the labour market and household income is expected to offset, at least partly, the ongoing positive effect of the past declines in interest rates on the ability of households to service their debts. The annual rate of growth in loans to the household sector, especially for house purchase, has further moderated, in line with the weakness of economic activity, the uncertain income prospects and the marked slowdown in house prices (See Chart 7). Indeed, several euro area countries have recorded declines in house prices in the first half of 2009.  
4 BIS Review 168/2009 IV. Risks in the euro area financial system  Let me now turn to the main sources of risk in the euro area financial system. Investor appetite for risk has begun to return after the first quarter of this year, bringing with it an improvement in market liquidity and a decline in asset price volatility. The turnaround has been underpinned by government-provided downside protection of financial institutions’ balance sheets, which has reduced tail risk, improving macroeconomic news and better than expected earnings, especially by financial institutions. Against this background, the equity markets have rebounded, led by financial stocks. At the same time, historically low levels of money market interest rates have induced a hunt for yield among investors, triggering outflows from bank deposits and money market funds into riskier assets, including corporate bonds issued by lower-rated borrowers. Euro area bond and equity markets Over the past six months, euro area long-term bond yields have declined. However, in late November 2009, the slope of the euro area yield curve remained steeper than at any point in time since the launch of the euro, due to the past declines in short-term market rates (See Chart 8). Intra-euro area sovereign spreads, as well as euro area sovereign CDS spreads, have narrowed further, in some cases to pre-Lehman levels, until very recently, when a few have widened again. Looking ahead, the prospects for euro area government bonds continue to be surrounded by persistent uncertainty about future macro-financial developments. Upward risks to yields could stem from a further unwinding of flight-to-safety and flight-to-liquidity flows. In addition, slower than expected growth might increase the financing needs of euro area governments and bond markets might face difficulties in absorbing higher government bond issuance.  Euro area equity markets continue to recover from the severe decline experienced during the financial crisis, supported by market optimism about the economic recovery and diminishing risk aversion. Valuation measures based on price/earnings ratios using long-term trailing earnings figures suggest that the markets are not particularly overvalued (see Chart 9). Alternative valuation measures, based on expectations of future earnings, provide different signals. Moreover, risks for stock market prices remain, in particular those associated with an economic recovery that could turn out to be weaker than expected by markets.  The euro area banking sector Let me now turn to euro area financial institutions, starting with the large and complex banking groups. Conditions in the euro area banking sector have improved markedly in the first three quarters of 2009, on account of better-than-expected macroeconomic news and the concomitant rebound in the financial markets. The euro area banking sector has also benefited from the various financial system support measures and the macroeconomic policy stimulus.  The earnings and profitability of euro area major banks have recovered significantly, and across the board, in the first three quarters of 2009, after a dismal performance in the second half of 2008. Nevertheless, the dispersion of profitability across LCBGs continues to be wide (see the left side of Chart 10). The examination of individual revenue categories sheds more light on the factors explaining euro area LCBGs’ recent favourable performance (see the right side of Chart 10). Net interest income has been an important driver of the improved bank performance, on account of the steeper yield curve and wider operating margins. The tightening of credit standards, the gradual pass-through of lower policy rates to lending rates and declining competitive pressures in the credit market have all contributed to higher revenues from core banking business. Trading income has increased even more strongly as the financial markets 
BIS Review 168/2009 5 recovered after the first quarter of 2009 and has been the main contributor, on average, to the increase in revenues as a percentage of assets.  With regard to bank capital positions and loan-loss provisions, I would like to highlight the following points. The recovery in major banks’ earnings, the slowdown in the growth rate of both risk-weighted and total assets and increases in capital have contributed to a slight increase in the regulatory capital ratios of the median institutions. Even those institutions with the lowest regulatory capital ratios comfortably exceed at present the minimum requirements (see the left side of Chart 11).  Provisions on impaired assets had been a serious drag on euro area LCBGs’ incomes in 2007 and 2008. To a large extent these provisions still related to securitised loans, although the share of loan impairments had started to grow. Most institutions have reported sharply higher provisions for loan losses (see the right side of Chart 11). Moreover, expressed as a percentage of total loans, loan-loss provisions were the highest in the third quarter compared to the five preceding years. Funding liquidity problems continue to bring pressure on the major banks’ operations. While the conditions have improved substantially in most funding segments throughout 2009, including the money markets, some of these institutions and parts of the broader euro area banking system, remain reliant on temporary support measures extended by the Eurosystem and governments.  Box 11 summarises the government measures to support the banking sector and discusses their implications for fiscal balances. Regarding the implementation of the measures, several conclusions can be drawn: First, the take-up rate has been generally low across all measures, but there are substantial variations: the use of recapitalisation measures has been relatively widespread, while the take-up rate for the issuance of bank bonds with government guarantees has been considerably lower than expected. Second, the largest part of the financial support has been provided to a relatively small number of institutions (See Chart 12). Indeed, about half of the extended support has been absorbed by the largest three recipient institutions in each category of support. The various measures to support the financial sector amount to considerable actual and contingent liabilities for euro area governments. Although they are expected to have only a small direct impact on government deficits in the short to medium term, potential fiscal risks in the form of higher refinancing costs are sizeable for all countries that have provided significant financial system support, as these measures seem to have had a negative effect on market perceptions of the creditworthiness of the respective governments.  A closer look at LCBGs’ financial results in the first three quarters of 2009 shows that risks of future substantial write-downs, and related liquidity and solvency concerns, remained and might have increased somewhat. While the LCBGs seem to be gradually getting over the valuation losses they have suffered on their securities holdings, the sizeable provisions for loan losses seen lately underscore the significant challenges for banks in managing their distressed loan portfolios.  Using the same methodology as in the June 2009 Review, and benefiting from more detailed data on loan and securities exposures of euro area banks, Box 10 presents an update of the estimate and assesses the magnitude of potential write-downs that might be suffered by banks by the end of 2010. The results show that euro area banks could face cumulative total losses of EUR 198 billion on their exposures to securities and losses of EUR 355 billion on their loan book exposures over the period 2007–2010. The total potential write-downs on securities and loans is thus currently estimated at EUR 553 billion over the same period. This figure is EUR 65 billion higher than the June 2009 estimate. The increase is mainly be explained by a further deterioration in the commercial property market, which contributed to a higher estimate of potential write-downs on banks’ commercial property mortgages and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and also by the inclusion of an estimate of write-downs on securities originated in Central and Eastern Europe. Taking into account the write-
6 BIS Review 168/2009 downs on loans and securities recorded until end-October 2009 and the loan loss provisions until end-June 2009, the potential further write-downs of euro area banks until end-2010 could reach EUR 187 billion.   The euro area insurance sector Turning to the euro area insurance sector, it continues to be confronted with challenging conditions. The results for the second and third quarters of the year remained rather subdued, as premiums written declined on average. Reduced demand for life insurance products, in particular unit-linked products – where the investment risk was borne by the policyholder – have contributed to lower premiums written. Premiums written growth in the non-life segments has been hampered by the weak economic environment, which kept demand from households and firms muted. However, investment income, which has benefited from the improvements in the capital markets after mid-March 2009, was on average higher than in previous periods. The improvement in investment income has, however, not been enough to avoid a broad-based decline in profitability. Large euro area insurers have continued to increase their investment exposure to government and corporate bonds during the first half of 2009, as they have continued to shift their investment strategies away from equities in an attempt to de-risk their investment exposures At the end of the first half of 2009, a sample of large euro area insurers had about 70% of their investments in bonds, up from about 50% at the end of 2007 (See Chart 13).  Overall, looking forward, euro area insurers continue to face challenges mainly due to the subdued economic activity, which is reflected in the uncertainty of their earnings prospects (see Chart 14). At the same time, the disclosed solvency positions of euro area insurers indicate a reasonable amount of remaining shock-absorption capacity to weather the materialisation of the risks they currently face.  
BIS Review 168/2009 7 V. Overall assessment  Let me now conclude by providing an overall assessment of the identified risks to euro area financial system stability.  As mentioned at the beginning of my presentation, the extraordinary policy measures taken by central banks and governments since late last year have been successful in restoring confidence in, and improving the resilience of, financial systems around the world. A recovery of risk appetite, underpinned by lowered systemic risk, has contributed to the turnaround in financial markets since March 2009 and supported the trading income of large and complex banking groups. Many of these institutions also benefited from a considerable boost to net interest income on account of very steep yield curves. The significant strengthening of the profitability of many LCBGs enabled them to absorb considerable write-downs on securities and loans while still, on average, reporting profits. Some were even able to return the capital they had received from governments, thus exiting from financial support.  Despite the recovery in financial markets and improved financial performance of euro area LCBGs, there are several grounds for caution in assessing the outlook for financial stability in the euro area.  Let me be elaborate on these key risks and vulnerabilities: The main risks identified outside the euro area financial system include the possibility of:  • vulnerabilities being revealed in non-financial corporations’ balance sheets, because of high leverage, low profitability and tight financing conditions;  • greater-than-expected household sector credit losses if unemployment rises by more than expected;  • the surge of government indebtedness raising concerns about the sustainability of the public finances, as well as the crowding out of private investment; and  • an adverse feed-back between the financial sector and public finances as a result of government financial system support measures, fiscal stimuli and weak economic activity. Within the euro area financial system, important risks include the possibility of:  • renewed financial strains and that the recent recovery of bank profitability will not prove durable;  • vulnerabilities of financial institutions associated with concentrations of lending exposures to commercial property markets and to central and eastern European countries being unearthed; and  • a setback for the recent recovery of financial markets, if macroeconomic outcomes fail to live up to optimistic expectations. All in all, the challenges facing the euro area banking sector in the period ahead call for caution in avoiding timing errors in disengaging from public support. In particular, exit decisions by governments will need to carefully balance the risks of exiting too early against those of exiting too late. Exiting before the underlying strength of key financial institutions is sufficiently well established runs the risk of leaving some of them vulnerable to adverse disturbances, possibly even triggering renewed financial system stresses. Late exits, on the other hand, can entail the risk of distorting competition, creating moral hazard risks that come with downside protection – including the possibility of excessive risk-taking – as well as exacerbating risks for public finances. To cushion the risks that lie ahead, banks will need to be especially mindful in ensuring that they have adequate capital and liquidity buffers in place. If the circumstances require it, some banks may need to raise new and high-quality capital. In addition, some banks, especially those which have received state support, may need fundamental restructuring in order to 
8 BIS Review 168/2009 confirm their long-term viability when such support is no longer available. This could involve the shrinking of balance sheets through the shedding of unviable businesses with a view to enhancing their profit-generating capacities. At the same time, banks should take full advantage of the recent recovery in their profitability to strengthen their capital positions, so that the necessary restructuring of businesses and the enhancement of shock-absorbing capacities do not impinge materially on the provision of credit to the economy.  Thank you very much for your attention. I am now at your disposal for questions.

BIS Review 167/2009 1 Jean-Pierre Roth: Global and Swiss economic outlook Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 10 December 2009. *      *      * By and large, our assessment of the economic and monetary situation is the same as in September 2009, with economic and financial developments running according to expectations. Risks remain significant, and for this reason we are maintaining our expansionary monetary policy.  Global economic outlook  Before I address the outlook for the Swiss economy, allow me to briefly examine economic developments at the international level, since they affect the outlook for Switzerland.  Signs of a recovery in global economic activity gathered strength during the second half of 2009. The ongoing normalisation of conditions on the interbank and financial markets, together with the monetary and fiscal stimuli, supported a recovery in production, especially in the manufacturing industry.  However, the legacy of the crisis still weighs heavily. The economic rebound of the past few months is largely the result of public sector intervention, and is not yet anchored firmly enough. Except in emerging Asia, the rebound has only partly redressed the losses sustained in 2008 and early 2009. Capacity utilisation rates are still generally low, and access to bank lending remains difficult in some countries. Moreover, both the labour market situation and the need to restore savings levels are weighing on household consumer spending. Therefore, we still hold the view that the return to global equilibrium will be slower and more uncertain than is usually the case at the end of a recession.  Swiss economic outlook  The Swiss economy is also on the road to recovery: Swiss GDP growth turned positive in the third quarter. However, value added continued to contract in the manufacturing industry. Overall, demand for labour is still falling and unemployment numbers are on the rise.  We are projecting a moderate recovery for 2010. Private consumption growth will be held back by weak household income growth. Exports will benefit from a gradual return to strength of external demand. This should allow manufacturing production to recover, albeit unevenly across the different segments. In particular, new orders in the equipment goods segment will probably continue to suffer from the excess capacity at the international level. In Switzerland, too, the increase in manufacturing production will not be enough to allow excess production capacity to be reabsorbed. Consequently, equipment investment is unlikely to see any improvement for several quarters, and there could be a fall in the number of manufacturing jobs. In the construction industry, on the other hand, where the degree of resource utilisation is more than satisfactory, demand should stabilise.  For 2010 as a whole, the SNB expects real GDP growth of between 0.5% and 1%, following a decline of around 1.5% in 2009.  Changes in monetary and financial conditions  Overall, monetary conditions are a reflection of our expansionary policy, especially with respect to interest rates and the monetary aggregates.  
2 BIS Review 167/2009 The Libor is currently at the level targeted since March this year, i.e. 25 basis points, a level which can be regarded as a floor. The fact that it was impossible to bring the rate down any lower than this led us, in March, to introduce other instruments in order to make our monetary policy as expansionary as the circumstances demanded.  Monetary conditions have become more expansionary via the interest rate channel in particular. Indeed, credit premia on the capital markets have declined steadily since the beginning of the year. As yields on Confederation bonds have remained low, other long-term yields have also trended downwards. It has thus become cheaper for companies to raise funds by borrowing on the capital market. In addition, our figures show that financing in the form of bank loans has also become more attractive following the decline in the Libor. In real terms – i.e. after factoring in expected inflation – interest rates are even lower.  The Swiss franc has appreciated slightly in trade-weighted terms, as a result of the recent weakening of the dollar. However, it has remained stable against the euro, which shows that the monetary policy followed since March has been effective. An appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro would run counter to the relaxation in monetary conditions brought about through the interest rate channel. This is why the SNB will continue to act decisively to prevent any excessive appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro.  An assessment of monetary conditions can be misleading if it is based on prices, which, like currently the libor, have reached a bound. For this reason, an assessment based on quantities – money and credit – is particularly important in the current circumstances.  The monetary base has increased substantially since October 2008, when the financial crisis entered a new phase following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. We supplied the interbank market with sufficient liquidity to meet burgeoning demand in a climate of uncertainty, in order to prevent any increase in money market rates. Since then, precautionary base money demand has declined and we have reabsorbed liquidity accordingly. The monetary base has thus fallen by 28% compared to the peak recorded in April 2009. The level of sight deposits is, however, still almost ten times higher than before the crisis. There is thus a risk of excessive money creation once confidence is restored.  Monetary conditions should not be judged in terms of banking sector liquidity, but rather on the basis of the liquidity available to households and firms – i.e. the monetary aggregates. M3 growth, which had been modest for a long time, has accelerated. In October, it reached an annual rate of 7.7%. M1 and M2 have shown strong growth. The significance of these growth rates is limited because the uncertainty linked to the crisis reinforced the general public’s preference for liquidity, and because interest rates are at extremely low levels. It is therefore useful to analyse the transmission of monetary stimuli through the lending channel as well. Mortgage loans provide a particularly good reflection of the effects of monetary policy. Why? Essentially, mortgage loans are used to finance real estate projects. But the yields on these investments, which are by their very nature long-term, are heavily dependent on the level of interest rates. This relationship has been confirmed once again: no sooner did we cut interest rates than the growth rate of mortgage loans began to increase more strongly. Having hit a low of 3.2% in November 2008, the growth rate then began to accelerate steadily, reaching 5.1% in October 2009. In the same month, other lending in Swiss francs declined at a rate of –0.3%, which is normal during a period of weak economic activity. All in all, lending to households and firms, both large and small, has continued to grow over the past few months, as the growth in mortgage lending has largely offset the drop in other lending.  According to the latest SNB bank lending survey, the phase of tightening lending conditions could be coming to an end. The share of banks reporting a further slight tightening of conditions for corporate lending has fallen considerably, from 40% at the time of the previous quarterly survey to 3% for this quarter. Households appear to be benefiting from a similar trend, as no banks have announced a tightening of their lending conditions for households, 
BIS Review 167/2009 3 whereas in the previous quarter 50% of banks reported a further slight tightening of lending conditions for non-mortgage loans and 20% for mortgage loans to households.  The survey also suggests that demand for loans has stabilised. The share of banks experiencing increased household demand for mortgages has fallen from 40% at the beginning of this year to 10%.  The situation in Switzerland is thus very different to that observed in other economies. Not only is there no credit crunch, but we have also witnessed a substantial increase in the volume of mortgages. There are also signs of a relaxation in lending conditions for mortgage loans. We would like to sound a note of caution, both to banks and to firms and households, as regards the risks inherent in a relaxation of discipline in real estate financing.  Inflation outlook  Monetary policy influences the medium and long-term inflation outlook. By contrast, it has very little effect on short-term developments. The past two years have been a perfect illustration of this. Inflation peaked at 3.1% in July 2008, before plummeting to –1.2% in July this year. This reflects extreme movements in oil prices, which reached USD 145 a barrel in July 2008, only to fall to USD 35 in December of the same year. The temporary nature of fluctuations in inflation was correctly anticipated, as evidenced in our previous inflation forecasts. Since it takes time for the impact of monetary policy to feed through, it would have been futile to attempt to counter these movements.  The path of inflation in the near term will be largely dictated by recent movements in oil prices and the associated base effects. Inflation will already return to positive figures from the end of this year. This is mainly due to the base effect linked to the USD 35 low reached by oil prices in December 2008. Inflation will tend to decline thereafter, despite the recovery in growth. In fact, economic activity will remain subdued and will return only gradually to normal. Inflation will nevertheless remain positive throughout 2010. Assuming that our monetary policy remains unchanged, our new forecast shows that inflation will begin to increase again from the beginning of 2011, to reach 2% in the first half of 2012. Our expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained indefinitely without incurring inflation risks.  Considerable uncertainty remains attached to this inflation forecast. Global economic developments could be less favourable than I described in the first section of my remarks. The financial crisis could reappear.  Monetary policy decision  The inflation outlook has not changed since the September assessment. It confirms that the expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained for the next three years because price stability will be compromised in the long term. However, a swift correction in monetary policy would be precipitate since the inflation outlook is still associated with downside risks. If these risks materialised, we could again be faced with the threat of deflation. The uncertainties relate to the global economy and to the level of recovery within the financial industry. These factors have persuaded the SNB to opt for a cautious stance, and it is leaving its monetary policy course unchanged for the time being.  Strengthening the SNB’s equity capital  On 4 December, the SNB Bank Council decided to strengthen the SNB’s equity capital by doubling the allocation to provisions over the next five years. This decision was prompted by the growth in market and credit risks in the SNB’s balance sheet (creation of the SNB StabFund and the increase in currency reserves). Given the high level of the distribution 
4 BIS Review 167/2009 reserve and results expected for 2009, this decision should not pose problems in terms of the distribution of profits, in the amount of CHF 2.5 billion annually, up to the end of the period agreed with the Confederation and the cantons (2017). My colleague Thomas Jordan will address these aspects in more detail in his own introductory remarks.            
BIS Review 167/2009 1 Thomas Jordan: Swiss monetary policy and provisions Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 10 December 2009. *      *      * Introduction  Tension in the global financial markets began to abate this spring, and has continued to do so ever since – though despite all the talk of recovery, they are still far below their pre-crisis levels. Whereas initial price rises were mostly corrections of previous excessive falls, markets are currently being driven mainly by the improving economic outlook, by companies’ predominantly positive earnings reports and by expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. However, there is still considerable uncertainty in the financial markets.  In the course of the crisis the Swiss National Bank aggressively relaxed its monetary restraints, sometimes treading new paths in the implementation of monetary policy. I shall now briefly summarise the instruments that we used in connection with the financial crisis, highlighting their effects on the SNB’s balance sheet. The risks that exist in the SNB’s balance sheet or that the SNB could potentially be required to take onto the balance sheet demonstrate the importance of strengthening our equity capital. I shall therefore, as already indicated by the Chairman of the Governing Board, Jean-Pierre Roth, briefly explain to you the new regulations governing our policy on provisions. One of these monetary policy crisis measures is the SNB’s stabilisation fund (StabFund), which I shall deal with later. I shall conclude my remarks by commenting on a change in the terms of admission to the Swiss franc repo system.  Deployment of monetary policy instruments in the crisis and trends in the SNB balance sheet  From October 2008 to March 2009 we carried out a massive reduction in the Libor target range in several steps. The most important instruments for expanding liquidity during this phase were repo transactions and currency swaps. Since the reduction of the repo rate to 5 basis points in December 2008, we have been pursuing a de facto zero interest rate policy. Beginning in October 2008, the heavy foreign demand for Swiss francs was influencing the level of the Libor – and this made it necessary to conduct Swiss franc/euro currency swaps. Swap agreements with other central banks gave more foreign banks access to Swiss francs, thus bringing the Libor down faster.  As of March 2009, in order to loosen the monetary reins further when there was no more room for interest rate reductions, we adopted so-called unconventional measures. These took two forms: intervention in the foreign exchange market and purchases of bonds issued by domestic borrowers. In addition we concluded long-term repo transactions with terms of up to 12 months. So far the measures we have taken have achieved the objectives we set ourselves. The three-month Libor has been close to our target range of 25 basis points since the middle of September. Foreign currency purchases prevented the Swiss franc from rising against the euro, and in addition the exchange rate of the euro against the Swiss franc has been significantly less volatile. Chart 1 shows the substantial increase in our holdings of foreign exchange reserves as a result of the interventions. Positive conclusions can also be drawn with regard to the bond purchases, which helped to reduce risk premia in the Swiss capital market. To date, bond purchases have totalled around CHF 3 billion. However, we have hardly made any purchases since mid-September due to the substantial improvement on the Swiss franc bond market.  
2 BIS Review 167/2009 These measures were accompanied by a substantial expansion of the balance sheet (charts 1 and 2): from around CHF 110 billion before the crisis, the SNB’s total assets reached a peak of CHF 245 billion in April of this year. The figure then began to decline, reaching around CHF 210 billion in November. On the asset side of the balance sheet, the fall in foreign currency swaps was mainly responsible for this drop. On the liabilities side, the domestic banks’ sight deposits played the most important role. These have fallen from a weekly peak of CHF 81 billion at the end of April to CHF 47 billion at the end of November. However, liquidity in the banking system is still very high. Before the crisis, sight deposits amounted to an average of some CHF 5 billion only. The use of unconventional measures has also changed the nature of part of the liquidity created. Liquidity resulting from repos and currency swaps is temporary: it flows back automatically when the transactions are not renewed. Liquidity created by acquiring foreign exchange and Swiss franc bonds, conversely, is permanent. We expect to keep the foreign exchange and bonds we have purchased on the SNB’s balance sheet for an extended period. As part of the impending normalisation of monetary policy, SNB Bills – introduced a year ago – will therefore play a central role. Liquidity absorption will mainly be conducted through the issuance of SNB Bills. Consequently, part of the balance sheet will in future be funded with interest-bearing debt capital. Moreover, the expansion of the balance sheet will substantially increase the SNB’s credit and currency risks. Strengthening the SNB’s provisions The financial crisis has highlighted how important it is for the SNB to have a solid equity capital buffer. Without it, the SNB would be unable to carry the risks on its currency reserves internally – nor would it be in a position to take the measures to stabilise the financial system that proved essential in the financial crisis. Equity capital, furthermore, is central to the independence and credibility of the SNB.  In spite of the extensive crisis measures we have taken, the SNB’s balance sheet is as robust as ever – though its financial stress resistance is heavily dependent on the distribution reserve, which is high at present. Like the provisions, this forms part of the SNB’s equity capital. In the short term it helps to absorb any losses, while in the longer term it is transferred to the Confederation and the cantons as a distribution of profits. If it were not for the distribution reserve, the SNB’s resilience could only be guaranteed to a limited degree. There are two reasons for this: for one thing, a need for measures to safeguard the system could arise unexpectedly, greatly increasing the risks faced by the SNB suddenly; and for another, these risks are significantly higher because of the permanently expanded balance sheet. The SNB has therefore decided to additionally strengthen its equity capital, and thus its balance sheet. The SNB’s ability in the long term to respond to a crisis must not be dependent on the distribution reserve. This is only possible if the SNB increases its provisions from their current level. In the past, it increased its provisions each year at a rate equal to average nominal GDP growth for the previous five years. The SNB now intends to double this allocation in financial years 2009–2013: instead of approximately CHF 1.5 billion, some CHF 3.0 billion will now be allocated to provisions in 2009.  Strengthening provisions will reduce the potential for future profit distributions to the Confederation and the cantons. On a current view, however, the annual profit distribution of CHF 2.5 billion can be expected to be maintained until 2017, when the current agreement on profit distribution lapses. This view is substantiated, in particular, by the fact that the distribution reserve will increase considerably as a result of the profit expected for the year 2009. A collapse in the gold price or heavy currency losses by the SNB, however, would increase the risk that the profit distribution would have to be adjusted before 2017. The SNB has been pointing out this risk for some considerable time, regardless of the current plan to strengthen its provisions. 
BIS Review 167/2009 3 The SNB StabFund It is just over a year since the package of measures to support UBS was announced. Over that period, the risks in the SNB StabFund have been significantly reduced. Two key indicators are in the spotlight: the amount of the SNB’s loan to the StabFund, and the SNB’s overall risk exposure, including non-funded assets. The StabFund took over assets of USD 38.6 billion as of 30 September 2008. Of that total, USD 8.8 billion consisted of contingent liabilities that did not need to be funded at the time. The remainder was funded with the equity capital paid in by UBS (10% of total assets, i.e. USD 3.9 billion) and the debt capital advanced by the SNB, which thus initially amounted to USD 25.8 billion. Risk exposure for the SNB, i.e. the total portfolio less the equity capital, was thus equal to USD 34.7 billion as at end-September 2008. The SNB’s loan to the StabFund stood at USD 20.8 billion at end-October 2009, a reduction of USD 5 billion – almost one-fifth – on the initial figure. The funds to repay the loan came from repayments and earnings on the assets, and from proceeds of asset sales. The StabFund came to the market for the first time in June 2009. The market’s more positive performance made it possible for occasional sales to a total value of USD 1.5 billion to be conducted by the end of October 2009. Contingent liabilities declined by USD 4.7 billion, mainly as credit default swaps (CDS) expired or were prematurely terminated. At the end of November 2009, non-funded assets totalled USD 4.1 billion. Total risk exposure fell by USD 10.2 billion to USD 24.5 billion. Changes in the SNB’s risk exposure with respect to the StabFund are summarised in table 1. One effect of the recovery in the financial markets that began this spring was to trigger rises in the market values of most of the investment categories held in the StabFund. This development, together with the results of a comprehensive cash flow projection for the entire portfolio, confirm the SNB in its view that it has unimpaired prospects of receiving repayment of the loan in full. However, these calculations are bedevilled by great uncertainty – and the risk to the SNB remains substantial. As the StabFund values much of its portfolio at amortised cost, the recovery in the financial markets has only modest effects on its financial reporting. The cumulated loss at the end of the third quarter (since 1 October 2008) was USD 4.4 billion. Equity capital reported thus remains negative, though this loss was entirely covered at the time by the secondary loss protection – the warrant for the purchase of 100 million UBS shares at nominal value. By the end of the StabFund’s first financial year it will have largely completed the build-up of its operating activities. In the last few months, following the asset transfer phase between December 2008 and April 2009, the asset management process was set up, risk monitoring and financial reporting expanded, and an internal control system and operational risk management introduced. These processes will be further improved next year, with asset management taking on a key role. While the intrinsic values of the assets represent a key element in managing the portfolio, the process must not be merely mechanistic. Now that it has been possible to sell off some of the more liquid assets over the last few months, attention will focus more closely on two tasks: minimising the larger concentration risks, and ensuring that – as the portfolio is disposed of – the best possible equilibrium is maintained in various respects, including the degree of liquidity of its holdings. Broadening participation in the Swiss franc repo market The unsecured money market collapsed when the financial crisis broke out in August 2007 and it has not properly recovered to this day. The repo market, conversely, in which money is lent against securities, has emerged as a crisis-resistant mainstay of the financial system. The efficient Swiss repo system – through which the SNB conducts its normal monetary policy transactions – has proved to be especially robust.  
4 BIS Review 167/2009 The SNB depends on a liquid Swiss franc money market for the efficient implementation of its monetary policy. This is why, in addition to domestic banks, foreign banks were admitted to the Swiss franc repo market as long as ten years ago. From 2010, the SNB will open the repo market to financial market participants in Switzerland (including Liechtenstein) that do not enjoy the status of banks. However, these new participants will have to be supervised by FINMA (or the regulatory authorities in Liechtenstein), and they must be genuinely active in the Swiss franc money market. Furthermore, they will have to guarantee that business will be transacted in a professional manner. The initial candidates are likely to be insurance companies with significant treasury activities in Swiss francs, and possibly managers of Swiss franc money market funds. In expanding participation in the repo market, the SNB is seeking to further increase the liquidity of the Swiss franc repo market. In this way we plan to further promote the secured money market and increase the stability and crisis resistance of the financial system.

BIS Review 167/2009 1 Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj: Islamic finance and the financial crisis Keynote address by His Excellency Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj, Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain, at the AAOIFI-World Bank Annual Conference on Islamic Banking and Finance, Manama, 14 December 2009. *      *      * Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen: On behalf of the Central Bank of Bahrain, I would like to welcome you to the 11th Annual AAOIFI-World Bank Conference on Islamic Banking and Finance. I should especially like to thank the many distinguished speakers who will participate in this Conference, as well as the event organisers and sponsors. Particular thanks are due to Mr. James Adams, Vice President, East Asia and Pacific Region, World Bank who has travelled to Bahrain to be with us today. We are grateful to the World Bank for their continued support of this important event. Looking back on the 12 months that have passed since the last AAOIFI-World Bank Conference, it is striking how profound have been the changes in the financial landscape since then. The last time this Conference took place it was under the shadow of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. This had cast a dark cloud over the world financial system and the global economy. For a period of several weeks it had appeared that no institution was so strong, or so large, that the prospect of its failure was unthinkable. There was widespread risk aversion in financial markets and the reluctance of banks to lend to each other risked creating a vicious downwards spiral. The interbank markets were frozen. Banks that were unable to raise wholesale funding were forced to cut back on their lending. This reduced the availability of credit to otherwise sound borrowers. Rising default rates then in turn fed the perception that lending banks were at risk. And so the cycle took another downward turn. In response to this downward spiral many governments – especially in the advanced economies – took a series of extraordinary measures, including the provision of liquidity in unprecedented amounts, the provision of recapitalization support, and Government guarantees of deposits. These measures have been successful in breaking the psychology that led to the vicious downward spiral. Although the global economy has not yet fully recovered, the signs of recovery are there and the situation is immeasurably better than 12 months ago. There are many who might say that the events in the global financial system have little relevance to Islamic finance. Many in the Islamic finance industry point out that it has been sheltered from the impact of the crisis in part because the Shari’a prohibits the excess leverage and speculative financial activities that were at its root. They also take comfort from the fact that many participants in conventional finance, as well as regulators, and policy-makers have begun to ask whether there are lessons to be learned from the principles of Islamic finance which might help avoid future crises.  Recent events have certainly created a great opportunity for the Islamic financial industry. At the same time, however, there is no room for complacency and if the industry is to make the most of the opportunity that has now arisen it will need to ensure that the lessons of the crisis are fully learned. Some of these lessons are quite general and apply equally to conventional and to Islamic finance. Central bankers and regulators have learned that they must pay more attention to risks that are common throughout an entire sector of the industry. These risks might not be immediately apparent from reviewing the balance sheet or financial statements of an individual institution.  
2 BIS Review 167/2009 An example of such a risk is when all banks assume that they can exit their speculative positions at the same time. This requires them to assume that financial markets will always remain as liquid as they are in normal times. But if every financial institution is operating on the same assumption, then the point at which everyone tries to rush to the exit will be the point at which financial markets cease to function. There will be only sellers and no buyers. This is what happened in conventional finance when banks invested in structured financial instruments like CDOs and CLOs which they then found they couldn’t sell at any price. Now some people might believe that because Islamic financial institutions cannot invest in CDOs and CLOs, they must be immune to this problem. But think about the exposure of many Islamic banks to the real estate market. It might be a reasonable assumption for an individual institution that it could exit profitably a property development that it is funding. But when many other institutions are making similar assumptions about the projects they are funding, the industry as a whole may find it difficult to exit its investments without substantial losses or within a reasonable time-frame. A further lesson of the crisis is specific to the work of the accounting standard setters and thus to AAOIFI. This lesson relates to the importance of disclosure and transparency. Good disclosures ensure that risks can be clearly identified and that market counterparties are able to form a considered view of the value of financial instruments and investments. The financial crisis involved multiple failures of disclosure and transparency. For example, conventional banks moved assets to Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) or “conduits” which did not form part of their normal financial reporting or disclosures. Because these entities were regarded as off-balance sheet they were opaque both to regulators and to the counterparties of the banks that sponsored them.  Similarly, as we now know, the risk disclosures of various structured financial instruments were inadequate to permit purchasers of those instruments to perform a proper assessment of the risk/reward trade-off. Many investors purchased assets which they believed to have a very different risk profile than turned out to be the case. Again, there are parallels with Islamic finance. The use of off-balance sheet special purpose vehicles has been a feature of the financing model of many Islamic banks. We need to consider whether this gives rise to the same problem of a lack of transparency that arose with off-balance sheet SIVs. Similarly, accounting standards for Islamic finance need to keep pace with financial innovation. There is a lesson in the failure of the accounting of conventional instruments to keep pace with industry developments. As the G20 leaders recognised in their recent summit meeting, enhanced accounting and disclosure standards must be a key component of the response to the financial crisis. They have commissioned the international standard setting bodies, such as the International Financial Standards Board (IFSB) and from the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), to review the lessons of the crisis and to amend their accounting and disclosure frameworks accordingly. AAOIFI will have important work to do in ensuring that the framework of transparency and disclosure of Islamic financial institutions will match the enhanced standards that are likely to be forthcoming for conventional finance. I encourage AAOIFI to follow these developments closely and to work on producing revised and new accounting standards to match changes in the field of conventional finance. The changes that are likely to result from the global financial crisis, including in the accounting and auditing profession, will provide the background to the professional careers of the students whose success we have gathered to recognise today. I would like to offer my congratulations to these students who have successfully completed the “Certified Shari’a Adviser and Auditor”, and “Certified Islamic Professional Accountant” programmes. Both are challenging courses of study. To complete them successfully has required hard work and commitment. It is an achievement to be proud of, and one that I am sure will serve you in good stead as you further develop your professional careers. 
BIS Review 167/2009 3 Let me conclude by wishing the graduating students all the best in their future careers, and to wish all the participants in this Conference a very rewarding and stimulating two days. 
BIS Review 167/2009 1 Elizabeth A Duke: Envisioning a future for housing finance Speech by Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Mortgage Foreclosure Policy Conference, Chicago, 10 December 2009. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website. *      *      * Good afternoon. I want to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for this opportunity to offer my perspectives on the housing market – a topic of paramount importance to us all. The conference theme suggests that I take you on a retrospective journey about homeownership in the past, bring you into the present day with thoughts about the current challenging conditions, and leave you with insights on the future state of mortgage finance and housing policies. With the holiday season upon us, I must admit that I find this trip reminiscent of Ebenezer Scrooge’s journey in A Christmas Carol. The Ghost of Homeownership Past might, in retrospect, remind us of a seemingly idyllic time in our nation’s history, with high and rising homeownership rates, while the Ghost of Homeownership Present would likely describe one of the bleaker periods in our nation’s economy. But I hope that the Ghost of Homeownership Yet to Come would be much cheerier than Dickens’ spectral visitor and would show us a future with a housing and mortgage finance system that functions efficiently and provides adequate safeguards for consumers, lenders, and investors going forward. I’m afraid I cannot describe for you, as assuredly as Dickens might, just what that future market will look like, but I will share my thoughts on some general principles that, I would argue, we should look for in new market structures or practices that may emerge.  Responsible home ownership and housing finance Let me establish from the outset that I believe responsible homeownership has, for many years, proven to be good business and good public policy. The benefits derived from sustainable homeownership – including robust local investment and household financial stability – bring value to a community. Homeownership has been the principal means for many families to build wealth and financial stability over time, to use this wealth as a further investment in education and entrepreneurship, and to transfer this wealth to future generations. Lenders who engage in safe, sensible underwriting help to ensure that borrowers are matched with loan products that they can repay. In turn, borrowers can use debt to buy a productive asset that they could not otherwise purchase. Although leverage gained a bad name in the recent crisis, responsible and sustainable leverage can normally help more individuals become homeowners sooner.  The scarcity of available mortgage lending at present – especially the lack of relatively low-down-payment products beyond the Veterans Administration (VA) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) market – most hurts modest-income households who lack other assets. This makes it especially difficult for first-time and minority homebuyers to enter the market. Going forward, the challenge will be to encourage responsible, well-underwritten loan products for these segments of the market while banning lending activity that is unfair or deceptive.  Homeownership Past Depending on how far back you walk with the Ghost of Homeownership Past, you might reach a seemingly idyllic world where all mortgages were simple contracts made by local institutions lending for their own portfolios to consumers who could make a substantial down 
2 BIS Review 167/2009 payment and had excellent credit. But in that ostensibly happy place, many responsible consumers were excluded from the benefits of homeownership, funds for lending were limited, and lending institutions ultimately found themselves with unmanageable interest rate risk. In the 1990s and the earlier part of this decade, financial engineering in the secondary market for mortgages led to the development of more flexible products, efficient underwriting systems, and alternatives for new borrowers to enter the market – all good outcomes when done right. Experimentation, technological advances, and data modeling allowed for the development of niche mortgage products that could better meet the needs of particular subgroups of potential borrowers. These tools, when coupled with other risk mitigants, allowed greater numbers of Americans to buy, and stay in, homes they could afford.  But not all of this innovation proved to be positive, for either borrowers or investors. The market overheated. Mortgages became increasingly complex and opaque, as did the mortgage-backed securities that were then offered to investors. Risk innovation became risk layering. A speculative mentality took hold among investors and consumers who expected limitless house price appreciation. Borrowers overreached; risk mitigation peeled away as niche products were mass marketed; lenders made and purchased mortgage loans with lax underwriting standards; and investors relied too heavily on what turned out to be faulty ratings of poorly structured securities. All of this contributed to a housing price bubble that, as we are all too aware, eventually burst. In response, the surviving lenders severely curtailed credit availability.  Homeownership Present The lingering effects of this recent history continue to be felt in today’s housing market. We are now seeing high delinquency rates in every category of mortgages. While defaults in 2007 and 2008 were elevated by poor underwriting practices and the use of inappropriate mortgage products, the current deterioration reflects to a greater degree job losses and lower house prices. In addition, reduced home equity has impaired borrowers’ abilities to refinance their mortgages or sell their homes to cope with income loss, unexpected expenses, or adverse life events. Numerous public, private, and nonprofit efforts are underway to keep these delinquencies from becoming a wave of foreclosures. For example, the Federal Reserve’s program of purchasing government agency mortgage-backed securities has significantly reduced mortgage rates, which, in combination with the Administration’s Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), has enabled millions of families to reduce their mortgage payments this year. Hundreds of thousands of homeowners are making reduced payments through trial modifications under the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). While these numbers are encouraging, the real success will be in the number of foreclosures actually averted through successful permanent modifications. At the Board of Governors in Washington, and at the regional Federal Reserve Banks across the country, we are providing data and bringing together different parties from the private, public, and nonprofit sectors to encourage strategies for refinance, loan modifications, short sales, and other alternatives to preventable foreclosures.  The Federal Reserve System also supports local and regional initiatives to address the negative effects that large numbers of foreclosures can have on individual consumers and their surrounding communities. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago is probably one of the finest examples of such efforts. In the mid-1990s, NHS of Chicago identified predatory lending as a threat to the neighborhoods it served. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and many others including – I am proud to say – the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, NHS formed the Home Ownership Preservation Initiative (HOPI). As other communities across the country experienced similar problems, this initiative became a model for foreclosure prevention and neighborhood stabilization efforts elsewhere. This is important, tireless work and much remains to be done.  
BIS Review 167/2009 3 With respect to new lending, data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) for 2008 tell the story of a fractured market for housing finance as private mortgage lending came to a standstill and new lending depended heavily on government support. The number of active mortgage companies fell 25 percent from 2006 to 2008, in part because the warehouse lines of credit that mortgage companies depended on to fund their loans contracted significantly. In addition, overall demand for housing slowed appreciably. Indeed, the number of mortgage applications in 2008, 14.2 million, was about half the 2006 level and the lowest in more than a decade. Such a low level of applications suggests that potential borrowers were wary of entering the housing market or feared being turned down for a loan.  The 2008 HMDA data also show a dramatic increase in loans made by FHA and VA, whose share of total mortgage originations were higher than at any time in the 19-year history of HMDA reporting.1 These government-backed loans have been characterized as the alternative for borrowers with a weaker credit record in the absence of a subprime market. In addition, they are presumably attractive at the moment because they are among the few affordable options for buyers with stronger credit records but only modest savings available for a down payment.  In the recent past, such borrowers would have used a so-called “piggyback” mortgage – effectively borrowing part of the down payment – or secured private mortgage insurance to compensate for a higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. According to data from the National Association of Realtors, the typical first-time homebuyer over the past several years has had a down payment of less than 10 percent of the purchase price of the home.2 Securing even that much has historically been a barrier to home purchase, especially among lower-income, younger, or minority households.3 Yet higher LTV loans that help overcome this barrier also pose higher credit risk.  Striking the right balance in loan underwriting is critically important but has proven very difficult. The development of more flexible underwriting standards was originally hailed for the potential to help millions of families become homeowners. But at some point, a line was obviously crossed, standards were dangerously lowered, and loans were underwritten without any regard for a borrower’s ability to repay. When home prices fell and jobs were lost, borrowers who did not have other assets to tap were left exposed. So the question is: How can the market re-emerge with enough flexibility to allow more families to achieve homeownership in a responsible way, while avoiding the mistakes of the recent past?  Achieving credit quality and availability Some would argue that most of the really risky behavior is now out of the market. But, unfortunately, the backlash has restricted a lot of perfectly responsible lending as well. Banks are reluctant to put any but the lowest possible risk loans in their portfolios. And the market for new private mortgage loan securitizations is essentially closed. Thus, borrowers face tight underwriting requirements, even if their own risk profile looks relatively “safe” by historical standards. Moreover, even homebuyers with the requisite down payment realize that their home equity is much less liquid than in the past. Once, borrowers could count on cash-out refinancing or home equity lines of credit as a means of cheaply accessing their home equity;                                                  1  Robert B.

4 BIS Review 167/2009 these avenues are now much more restricted. A risk-averse renter might prefer to keep his assets readily available rather than lock them up in a house. On balance, even taking into account the excesses of the bubble period, it appears that lenders have now tightened underwriting terms so much that the lack of credit availability is at least partially an impediment to homeownership.  As we work to correct the problems of the recent past, we must keep in mind the importance of access to credit. If anything, the recent mortgage meltdown and sharp pullback in lending only demonstrates how critical it is for the economy to have a well-functioning housing finance market. With the old mortgage system in disarray, we are, one hopes, within sight of a new and stronger system. While there are many structural permutations that might characterize the new system, I would suggest we focus on four core principles for evaluating proposals:  Adequate consumer protection. First and foremost, any new system must contain adequate protections for consumers. In the aftermath of widespread abuses, consumers need to feel confident that they can satisfactorily negotiate a reasonable mortgage.  Transparency. Second, there must be transparency at all levels. Retail products should be as transparent as possible, so that consumers find it easy to understand the terms and risks of their mortgages. Lenders and servicers should also make as much information as is reasonably feasible available to investors. Indeed, adequate information for due diligence is likely a prerequisite to attract capital back to the mortgage market.  Simplicity. Third, the new system should encourage simplicity. Retail mortgage contracts ought to be as simple as possible. Too often, the complexity of mortgages has served to confuse borrowers and make it more difficult to make informed decisions.  Similarly, the complexity of the securitizations into which mortgages were packaged made analysis difficult for investors. These structures turned out to be especially fragile when stressed with high defaults and subsequent losses. After the crash, with delinquencies rising, investors found modeling the cash flows under alternative scenarios confusing and uncertain. While complexity may prove to be an inevitable byproduct of financial innovation, investors will likely demand much simpler instruments going forward.  Properly aligned incentives. Finally, the new system should feature clear roles and properly aligned incentives for all players. Too often in the recent turmoil, we saw examples of misaligned interests and competing objectives. For instance, there is evidence that some loan officers and mortgage brokers may have been as concerned about whether loans were profitable to them personally as they were about whether the borrower could actually repay.4 Servicers, too, turned out to have interests that were not always aligned with investors, and different tranches of investors themselves had competing interests that they tried to impose onto servicers. Certainly, greater clarity about roles and responsibilities, and the associated compensation of participants in the origination chain, will help all parties understand, and properly align, incentives.  Homeownership yet to come Under these guiding principles, what would a new mortgage market look like?                                                   4  See “Did Securitization Lead to Lax Screening? Evidence from Subprime Loans” Benjamin Keys, Tanmoy K. Mukherjee, Amit Seru, and Vikrant Vig, Quarterly Journal of Economics 125, (February 2010). 
BIS Review 167/2009 5 Lending practices  The Federal Reserve has already taken steps to implement and enforce safeguards to shield consumers from hazards in the market. In recent years, we have created a blanket of new protections for consumers under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, adding layers of defenses for borrowers as they participate in the economy.5 The new rules, most of which went into effect on October 1, target higher-priced loans, where borrowers are most vulnerable to abuse. Our new rules require that lenders verify borrowers’ abilities to repay these “riskier” mortgages, ban prepayment penalties if payments may increase in the loan’s early years, require escrows for taxes and insurance, and prohibit a range of misleading advertising practices.  Under Truth in Lending we also have recently proposed revised mortgage disclosure forms for all loans. These new forms were developed through consumer testing to ensure that they provide information that is useful and understandable to consumers. These disclosures are designed to focus consumer attention on mortgage features, such as variable rates, that might be appropriate for some consumers, but potentially risky for others. And we have proposed to ban compensation that gives originators incentives to steer borrowers to loans with higher rates or disadvantageous terms. We would encourage comments on these proposals; the public comment period is open until December 24.6  Despite efforts to improve disclosures and ban egregious practices, obtaining a mortgage and purchasing a home is still a significant and complex transaction. Evidence indicates that consumer counseling, whether for pre-purchase or foreclosure prevention, leads to better outcomes for consumers.7 This is likely to remain true even if we do a better job of providing much-needed financial education. So it would make sense to include strong incentives to obtain counseling and strong support for housing counselors in our toolkit of the future.  Secondary market  While these important consumer protections will help restore borrower confidence, restoration of investor confidence may not come as easily. Whether the ultimate vehicle is covered bonds, loan securitizations, or some other model, a mechanism for channeling investment funds into housing finance will be critical to meeting the demands of a normally functioning housing market. Restoration of the residential housing finance market will require more than liquidity. At a minimum, it is likely to require access to information, standardized contracts, and simplified structures.  In the past, potential investors found it difficult to access loan-level data on the deals they were investing in. At best, market participants had access to underwriting and performance information only after the deal had been issued. Even then, complete information on borrower leverage – such as through “silent seconds” or junior liens obtained after the origination of the first – was difficult, or expensive, to come by.  Some of the security structures that proliferated late in the credit boom contained features that, whatever their initial purpose have served to obfuscate the relationship between loan performance and security cash flow. Securities also differed markedly in the governing contracts, notably the pooling and servicing agreements, or PSAs. These crucial documents were hundreds of pages long, differed across deals, and the agreements themselves,                                                  5  See Regulation Z (12 CFR Part 226), which implements the Truth in Lending Act and the Home Ownership and Protection Act. 6  See Federal Register notices for Regulation Z – Closed-end Mortgages and Regulation Z – Home Equity Line of Credit. 7  See Neil S. Mayer, Peter A. Tatian, Kenneth Temkin, Charles A. Calhoun, “National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program Evaluation: Preliminary Analysis of Program Effects,” Urban Institute, November 2, 2009. 
6 BIS Review 167/2009 despite being obsessively detailed, failed to address a scenario of rapidly mounting credit losses.  Future securities will benefit from as much standardization as possible across contracts, and the contracts will have to spell out clearly how they can be amended to deal with unforeseeable circumstances. Recognizing that no contract will ever be able to specify rules for all possible contingencies, contracts should specify a governance structure for decision-making in extreme circumstances.  Servicers  Servicers have not always been the most visible part of the mortgage business. Responses to this current crisis, however, including attempts to make large-scale loan modifications, have pointed to the critical role that servicers play through their direct interaction with borrowers. Yet, there have been problems. Many servicers did not have – and some may still not have – adequate systems and personnel in place to deal with the sheer scale of the foreclosure crisis. Servicers are concerned about the competing interest of investors and the threat of litigation for pursuing alternatives to foreclosure. In turn, some investors have questioned servicers’ incentives.  In the future, servicer contracts will need to provide clear guidance and incentive structures that lead to transparency and certainty in loan modifications and other loss mitigation tools. Performance under such contracts will require servicers to make investments in staffing and information technology infrastructure. And finally, in the future, compensation for servicers likely will need to recognize the different resources required for loss mitigation as opposed to simple payment accounting and forwarding.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  It would be unrealistic to expect the private mortgage market to rebound without defining the ongoing role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) have continued to issue large quantities of securities even as private securitization faltered, apparently because investors have continued to believe that the government stands behind them. That experience suggests that, at least under the most stressed conditions, some form of government backstop may be necessary to ensure continued securitization of mortgages. However, restarting the GSEs in their old forms would do nothing but ask for a repeat of recent history. Without getting into specific proposals today, I’ll simply say that whatever is the ultimate future for Fannie and Freddie, market participants will need to see a clear roadmap for both the individual institutions and the role of government in housing finance before private markets can begin to map a course for themselves.  Conclusion Today I have attempted to outline a framework for a better-functioning mortgage market that protects consumers and provides transparency to lenders, investors, and all market participants. This is the housing finance market we need to create if responsible homeownership is to return as a safe and viable option for the majority of consumers. It is a market that would be attractive and profitable for lenders, servicers, and investors who are prepared to engage in prudent, responsible, and transparent business practices.  Lending, when done responsibly, is good for business. Homeownership, when sustainable, is good for consumers. Leverage, when used judiciously, is critical to a functioning market. It would be hard to overestimate the damage that has been done to the housing market in recent years, and especially to the millions of families that are suffering the devastating consequences of foreclosure. It would be equally difficult to overestimate the damage that would be done in the future if we must live with a chronically impaired mortgage market. We 
BIS Review 167/2009 7 absolutely need to change our systems so that they function properly, support the emergence of simpler, more transparent markets, ensure aligned incentives among all parties, and, above all, protect consumers. That, I would hope, is the market of Homeownership Yet to Come.  
BIS Review 166/2009 1 Jean-Claude Trichet: Macro-prudential supervision in Europe Text of The Economist’s 2nd City Lecture by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, London, 11 December 2009. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen,  I am very pleased to be in London today and would like to thank The Economist for the opportunity to deliver this City Lecture.  As regards the topic, I thought that this would be an opportunity to reflect on the future macro-prudential supervision in Europe. We are gradually beginning to see beyond the current crisis and consider ways to strengthen the resilience of the financial system. This is a project to which macro-prudential oversight can make an important contribution.  I will begin by saying a few words on the current condition of the euro area financial system. Then I will make the case for macro-prudential supervision in the single market of the European Union and discuss the issue of the conduct of macro-prudential supervision. I will conclude with some remarks on the issue from the point of view of the financial sector itself. 1. The current condition of the euro area financial system Let me start by saying a few words about how we at the European Central Bank regard the current situation in the financial system in the euro area. The ECB’s Vice President, Lucas Papademos, will present our comprehensive assessment very soon, based on the publication of the next edition of the ECB’s Financial Stability Review. As is the case in all significant financial systems, an overall assessment of the health and vulnerability of the euro area financial system calls for a very deep analysis. There is in particular a considerable degree of diversity in the financial performance of large financial institutions in the euro area. Some are still in the process of deleveraging, while others show a rising appetite for risk. It is also quite a challenge to disentangle what can be considered “self-sustainable” developments in the recent market recovery from those developments that might be highly dependent on the unprecedented programmes of official support to the financial system that are still in place. As a result of these support measures – in combination with the fiscal stimulus and the improving macroeconomic outlook – the strains on the euro area’s financial system have been clearly diminishing over the past few months, and a financial market recovery has begun, which, in some areas, looks very significant.  Since March this year, improvements in financial markets have been broad-based. Euro area money market spreads, especially at shorter maturities, have narrowed continuously and remain at low levels. There are also signs that unease about counterparty credit risk is abating. This is reflected in longer-term spreads between interbank deposits and repo interest rates, which have also steadily declined. Corporate bond and equity markets have continued to recover.  These developments improved in the financial performance of banks in the euro area. Yet the crisis in securitisation and structured products – and the consequences of an irresponsible originate-and-distribute model – are not yet behind us. And the next big challenge for banks is already being felt. That challenge stems from the consequences of the impact of the financial crisis on the real economy, notably the deterioration in the quality of loan portfolios. There has been a surge in 
2 BIS Review 166/2009 provisions for loan write-offs. In the third quarter of this year, the provisions of large euro area banks, measured as a percentage of total loans, were significantly higher than in previous periods. Depreciation of the loan portfolios has led to another wave of write-downs, initiated in the first half of the year, following the first wave of write-downs in the second half of 2008, which arose mostly from mark-to-market losses on structured products. Not surprisingly, given its nature, this second wave is affecting a wider range of institutions. It also emphasises the scale of the challenge that banks face when seeking to strengthen their profitability.  So even though regulatory capital ratios for large euro area banks now broadly stand at higher levels than before the crisis, the necessity to increase capital must be stressed in the case of a number of institutions. I urge banks to take full advantage of the recent recovery in their profitability to strengthen their capital positions, rather than to distribute a large part of their profits or to pay out unwarranted levels of compensation or bonuses.  Stronger balance sheets will help the banks to fulfil their essential function to the economy – that is, to lend. The ECB has provided exceptional measures, which we call ‘enhanced credit support’, not for the banks themselves but to enable them to finance the broader economy. They must take up and maintain this responsibility.  As I have indicated, the heart of the financial system is starting to beat at much more normal frequencies again, but nobody should overlook the many wires and tubes through which emergency medicine continues to be administered. A key question for us at the ECB, as for other central banks, concerns the timing of the withdrawal of the medicine to avoid the threat of addiction or dependency. We have made clear that we will unwind enhanced credit support in a timely and orderly fashion.  Last week we began to initiate, in a gradual fashion, the unwinding from some of these exceptional measures. We are helped by the fact that all our exceptional measures were designed with eventual phasing-out in mind.  2. The case for macro-prudential supervision in the EU Let me now move to the core topic of my lecture today. The three questions that I would like to address are: why is macro-prudential supervision desirable for the European Union; how should it be organised; and what are the implications for the financial sector?  Let me look at the question of desirability first.  The financial crisis has been revealing in many respects. It has revealed the scale of the potential fallout from the failure of large financial institutions. It has revealed the fragility of the financial system to features and trends that cut across institutions, markets and infrastructures. And it has illustrated the amplitude of the consequences of the adverse feedback loop between the financial system and the real economy. All three elements I have just described are key features of systemic risk: first, contagion; second, the build-up of financial imbalances and unsustainable trends within and across the financial system; and third, the close links with the real economy and the potential for strong feedback effects.  In short, the crisis has revealed the fundamental importance of systemic risk. The purpose of macro-prudential supervision is to identify sources of systemic risk and recommend remedial action.  Of the three elements I have mentioned, contagion and the link to the real economy are the least novel in this financial crisis. They have been observed in many previous crises. The element that had been more unexpected in the current crisis is the rigour with which systemic risk has been triggered by the collective behaviour of financial institutions and the 
BIS Review 166/2009 3 ways in which they interact in financial markets. The crisis has highlighted the importance of improving our understanding of interconnectedness in the financial system, both via the direct links between financial institutions and the indirect ones created in financial markets.  The crisis has taught us that major risks can emerge from within the financial system itself. It was not the real economy that threw the financial system into disarray, but the reverse.  Endogenous risks – risks that emerge from within the financial sector – can have many causes. They may arise, for example, because large parts of the system rely on the same sources of funding, or because they have similar exposures – to rising financial imbalances, to currency mismatches and to widespread mis-pricing of risk.  We have also seen that turbulence can arise from relatively modest initial shocks. The system is so interconnected that what looks stable can turn out to be “meta-stable”, which means potentially highly instable. Snow on mountain slopes can be meta-stable, looking pristine and tranquil yet turning into an avalanche after only a minor disturbance.  The meta-stability of a system is a complex concept, which calls for analysis of the interplay between diverse phenomena. In financial systems, these phenomena include herd behaviour, complex networks of relationships between counterparties, and contagion from common or correlated exposures to particular asset classes. They also include the undesirable pro-cyclical effects of prudential rules, of accounting rules, of credit rating agencies, and of compensation systems that put undue emphasis on short-term earnings.  On this last point, I will say that the so-called bonus culture is one of the many factors that can drive the financial system in the wrong direction – away from intermediation to self-referential speculation; away from medium-term stability to short-term orientation; and away from being a service sector to being a self-serving sector. I have outlined the key features of systemic risk that underlie the need to establish a new framework of macro-prudential supervision. In the case of Europe, there is still one more reason, and that is the existence of the single European market. The single market makes the financial system much more fully integrated than it would otherwise have been – in terms of how it is set up, in terms of how it is regulated and in terms of the linkages with the real economy that itself is structured by the single market of the EU.  Cross-border and cross-sectoral financial integration within the EU is fostered by competition, freedom of establishment and the free flow of capital. The extent of integration within the EU’s financial sector is a substantial achievement and it should be safeguarded in the aftermath of the crisis. About 40% of foreign claims by UK banks are in the euro area, and roughly the same share can be observed in the opposite direction.1  Therefore, we Europeans have all the reasons to create a framework for macro-prudential oversight at the level of the single market of the 27 member countries of the European Union. The single financial market is a crucial component of the overall single market project, and macro-prudential supervision should enhance the resilience of this market.  3. The conduct of macro-prudential supervision The desirability of macro-prudential supervision is clear. And from that naturally spring the objectives – to mitigate and prevent systemic risks to financial stability in the EU on the basis of identified vulnerabilities and systemic risk assessments. Now we must turn to my second question and ask how such supervision should be conducted.2                                                   1 BIS data on foreign claims by nationality of reporting bank (ultimate risk basis), 2009Q1. 2 See also L. Papademos, “Financial stability and macro-prudential supervision: objectives, instruments and the role of the ECB”, Speech of 4 September 2009. 
4 BIS Review 166/2009 Almost everywhere in the world, central banks are seen as playing, or called to play, an important role in macro-prudential supervision.  In my view there are very good reasons for that. On top of their key involvement in the financial sector, central banks possess three main features that are qualifying themselves for that function: they are, by their very nature, anchors of stability; they are medium-term oriented; and they are independent. Central banks have traditionally been active in financial stability analysis. Of course, from financial stability analysis to macro-prudential supervision is yet another step. Financial stability describes the overall resilience of the system, focusing on imbalances and stresses in the financial system in the aggregate. While macro-prudential supervision takes a similarly broad view, it must also focus on specific sources of instability or specific groups of financial institutions, adding the policy component to the oversight function.  Overall, the effectiveness of macro-prudential supervision depends on many inputs, including quantitative or qualitative information from supervisors, regulators, macroeconomists, market participants and other stakeholders in seeking to identify systemic risks and proposing policy responses. The analysis for systemic risk surveillance and assessment is indeed very demanding,3 and as much of the credibility of the entire framework depends on it. In my view, the most difficult pieces will be the analysis of the implications of interlinkages in complex systems and understanding how a potential risk might spread throughout the system.  Risk surveillance and risk detection call for early warning indicators and approaches capable of indicating when the financial system as a whole or parts of the system are approaching a “danger zone”. Risk identification calls for the monitoring of a comprehensive set of macro-financial variables and forward-looking indicators. This task will require a detailed understanding of the channels through which emerging risks are transmitted. I spoke yesterday in Cambridge about the analytical challenges underlying systemic risk and the various research avenues that are being pursued.  The other challenge for effective macro-prudential supervision concerns the quality of recommendations themselves. Here, the key lies in their specificity. The more specific recommendations are, the easier is their implementation in concrete actions. It is here where knowledge of supervisory and regulatory authorities has to enter the equation. It is an important component of macro-prudential assessments and, in particular, in the design of recommendations on the appropriate policy actions needed to contain the build-up of financial vulnerabilities or to mitigate material risks.  Specific warnings require close input from supervisors, regulators and from all public and private stakeholders. This is the reason why a credible framework of macro-prudential supervision should be set up very broadly, combining a variety of perspectives and closely coordinated with micro-prudential supervisors.  Macro-prudential recommendations will not be addressed to individual institutions. This remains the sole prerogative of micro-prudential supervisors. Instead, they will be addressed to regulators, supervisors or other authorities so as to foster regulatory and supervisory policies. These authorities have instruments which can steer variables such as maturity mismatches, excessive credit growth, leverage, or the risk appetite of market participants. While it might not be desirable or feasible to target these variables directly, prudential policy instruments – individually or in combination – can affect them indirectly.                                                   3 The Bank of England released an interesting analysis of the role of macro-prudential policies in November 2009, highlighting many of the analytical challenges as well. The ECB has undertaken a series of research in the field of systemic risk. 
BIS Review 166/2009 5 Macro-prudential supervision will not and should not be a substitute for micro-prudential supervision. Rather, it should complement micro-prudential supervision; it has been conceived because the deep integration of the financial system has made it too difficult to ensure systemic stability while focusing on financial institutions one at a time.  In providing specific warnings and recommendations, based on a comprehensive analysis of systemic risk, an effective framework of macro-prudential supervision can close the gap between the analysis of financial stability and micro-prudential supervision.  Setting up a formal framework for macro-prudential supervision will also help to coordinate macro-prudential policies more effectively at the international level. This will be particularly important for the EU, given the depth of its financial integration with the rest of the world.  4. Implications for the financial sector Let me turn to the last part of my lecture and reflect on the possible implications for the financial sector.  The financial sector has an important stake in a well-functioning macro-prudential supervision framework and will ultimately benefit from it. The industry should be closely involved in such a framework, as information and insights from market participants will be essential inputs.  Any well-functioning macro-supervisory framework needs the support of market participants, because a rigorous monitoring of systemic risks will require continuous market intelligence. Contact with market participants will be essential for detecting important trends, such as growing financial imbalances, convergence of business models, similarities in investment strategies and innovations in financial instruments – to name just a few.  It will be of immense value to establish a structured dialogue with the financial industry to this end. Anecdotal evidence will be of little relevance if there is no possibility to drill down to the sources of risk on the basis of well-founded information and a regular dialogue with market participants.  I understand that there may be concerns that this will impose an additional reporting burden on the industry. In my view, this should not happen. To the extent that macro-prudential oversight requires micro-prudential data, the latter should be available from supervisors, and full confidentiality will be ensured. Any additional reporting would be exceptional.  Macro-prudential supervision should also avoid leading to an excessive burden of regulation. The legal principle non bis in idem applies to regulation: the financial sector cannot be regulated twice. The aim of macro-prudential supervision is to provide better regulation – and if possible much better, not in quantity but in quality.  Indeed, I foresee several benefits for the financial industry from well-functioning macro-prudential oversight.  The first and main benefit is of course a more stable financial system, which is as much to the advantage of all players in the industry as it is to everyone in the wider economy.  The second benefit is, as I have just mentioned, better regulation, rather than more regulation. Better regulation combines micro-prudential and macro-prudential perspectives. Macro-prudential policy advice should allow market participants to internalise the potential effects of systemic risk in conducting their business. This should enable financial institutions to improve their forward-looking capacity in decision-making, taking corrective measures with sufficient lead time, and being more resilient to market tensions if and when they arise. The third set of benefits lies at the technical level. The analytical progress that will go hand in hand with a strengthening of macro-prudential oversight should benefit financial institutions’ in-house risk analysis. 
6 BIS Review 166/2009 This applies in particular to the large, complex and interconnected institutions, on which a substantial part of the macro-prudential analysis is likely to be centred, as these institutions tend to contribute significantly to the level of risk of the overall system. For example, there are likely to be benefits for the further enhancement of financial institutions’ internal models, including stress testing, notably by taking account of system-wide factors and macro-financial variables.  A better understanding of the concept and measurement of systemic risk will lead to more accurate indicators of aggregate leverage, correlation and concentration of exposures to specific asset classes and of a firm’s interconnectedness.  With a view to enabling better measurement of key elements in systemic risk analysis, it is the responsibility of financial institutions to continue to enhance the transparency and granularity of their individual reporting. This could improve, for example, individual firms’ assessment of counterparty risks. Better measurement will also allow for better management. Risk management decisions will be better informed. And financial institutions’ preparedness for specific risks will be enhanced.  5. Conclusion Let me draw to a close by referring to the concrete legislative proposal currently underway that will establish a macro-prudential framework for the EU. This is the planned establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) on the basis of the proposals of the High-level group chaired by Jacques de Larosière.  I am pleased to see that there has been broad support for the legislative proposals in the Ecofin council, and I would like to pay tribute to the European Commission and the Swedish Presidency for preparing and advancing these proposals. The European Parliament, which has always been very committed to advancing European supervision at the micro and the macro level, is currently examining these proposals and preparing its decision. In my hearing on Monday this week, I very much appreciated the opportunity to present to the Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs our perspective on this matter.  The ECB, as an institution of the European Union as a whole, as an institution of the 27 EU Member States, has been invited to provide support to the ESRB. The Ecofin concluded that the ECB should provide analytical, statistical, administrative and logistical support, in close cooperation with all the national central banks from the 27 states.  The ECB’s General Council, which, together with the three heads of the European Supervisory Authorities and the Commission, will be the nucleus of the ESRB, has been meeting at least four times a year since 1999. The General Council prepares and approves the Convergence Reports, contributes to the functioning of the exchange rate mechanism ERM II and is involved in a wide range of central banking tasks, including legal opinions, statistical issues and accounting, as well as a regular review of monetary policies in the EU.  As central bankers, we are aware of the challenge of jointly contributing to the stability of the EU financial system. As I have highlighted, the enhanced resilience of the financial system should stand out as the highest-order objective of the institutional and market reforms that are being implemented in the wake of the financial crisis.  Macro-prudential supervision in the EU will count on the active role of the 27 governors of the National Central Banks, including the very active involvement of Mervyn King as the governor of the Bank of England, and on the full participation of the heads of the European Supervisory authorities and the Commissioner. It will count also on the close link to the national supervisory authorities, particularly here the FSA and its chairman, Lord Turner. Set up in this way, it will provide a significant contribution to the resilience of the financial system.  We have to succeed. At stake is not only the stability of one of the world’s largest financial systems, but also the support from the over 490 million citizens in the European Union who 
BIS Review 166/2009 7 are watching our efforts very closely. We have counted very heavily on their support for the financial system, and they would not forgive us if we had to do so a second time.  Thank you for your attention. 
BIS Review 166/2009 1 Rasheed Mohammed Al-Maraj: Inaugural Plenary Session – “Regulatory perspectives” Speech by His Excellency Rasheed Mohammed Al-Maraj, Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain, at the 16th World Islamic Banking Conference – Session 1: Inaugural Plenary Session: “Regulatory perspectives”, Manama, 7 December 2009. *      *      * Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen: “Salaam Alaikum” It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to welcome you once more to the World Islamic Banking Conference. The 2009 Conference is the sixteenth to be held in Bahrain, and the WIBC has firmly established itself as a landmark event in the calendar. I would like to congratulate the organisers on having assembled such a strong list of speakers at this year’s event, which I am sure will be the best yet. Let me begin by thanking the many distinguished speakers who will be appearing during the Conference, as well as the event organisers and sponsors. Collectively, your contributions are the reason for the success of this event. It also gives me great pleasure to welcome back His Excellency Heng Swee Keat, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Your presence at the World Islamic Banking Conference for the second year in succession is an indication of the increasingly strong ties between Bahrain and Singapore, and of the important role that Singapore can play in helping to develop the international presence of the Islamic financial industry. I should also like to welcome the other speakers in this Session, His Excellency Aset Issekeshev, the Minister of Trade & Industry from the Republic of Kazakhstan, and His Excellency Khalid M. Al-Aboodi, the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager of the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector, part of the Islamic Development Bank Group. We are greatly pleased to have you with us today as well. When the World Islamic Banking Conference took place a year ago, it was overshadowed by the events that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers. For a time it seemed that no financial institution was so large or so strong that the threat of its failure was unthinkable. There was wide-spread risk aversion in the financial markets. Interbank markets froze and many banks found it difficult to fund their positions. For a time it seemed that the world financial system was teetering on the brink of total collapse. The nightmare scenario that seemed to be unfolding before our eyes was averted by the timely and effective intervention of governments around the world. Banks were recapitalized, blanket guarantees of deposits were issued, and central banks provided liquidity in unlimited amounts. These measures were sufficient to stave off catastrophe. Although in Bahrain we did not consider it necessary to resort to some of the extraordinary measures adopted elsewhere, the central bank took a number of policy actions to ensure the continued smooth functioning of our financial markets. Although Bahrain has not been as badly affected by the crisis as some other financial centres, there is no room for complacency. As 2009 has unfolded, the impact of the crisis on the level of real economic activity has become more apparent. This has fed through to rising credit losses and reduced profitability at many banks. Reduced investor appetite for risk has also had an impact on those banks that follow an “originate to distribute” model, especially those that have funded real estate developments through distributing shares to investors in Special Purpose Vehicles. More challenging economic conditions affect the Islamic financial industry just as much as the conventional one. As a result, it is essential that the Islamic financial industry recognizes 
2 BIS Review 166/2009 that the crisis has lessons which apply to them as well as to conventional financial institutions. The first lesson that the industry might usefully learn is the importance of avoiding what might be termed “straight line thinking”. This is the tendency to assume that what held true of recent years will hold true in future as well. For example, the fact that the economy has grown for the last five years at the rate of six or seven percent, leads to the conclusion that it will continue to grow at the same rate indefinitely in the future. As a result, banks and other financial institutions build their business plans and expansion strategies around the assumption of an indefinite period of strong economic growth. These business plans or strategies then tend to come unstuck when growth falls short of expectations as in the past year. “Straight line thinking” has resulted in poor decision-making throughout the financial industry. Later in this Conference we will hear from Professor Nassim Nicholas Taleb whose book, the Black Swan, has deservedly attracted wide attention for showing the fallacies behind this kind of reasoning. Nonetheless, because the Islamic financial industry is a relatively young one, with many institutions that have not yet experienced a full business cycle, “straight line thinking” seems to have been particularly prevalent in this sector of the industry. In future Islamic financial institutions will need to adopt more conservative assumptions in their business plans and strategies and to stress test them against outcomes which may not be as optimistic as those they originally assumed. Closely related to “straight line thinking” is the tendency to be carried away on a wave of euphoria. When markets are booming, when every day there seems to be an announcement of a major new project or deal, it is tempting to be carried along by this psychology. Bankers begin to fear that they are losing out on profit opportunities that are being exploited by their competitors. They see their rivals’ ambitious expansion plans and feel that they must jump on board the bandwagon. As a result the industry moves as a herd, all galloping in the same direction at once. Few bother to stop and to consider whether the direction in which they are heading is one that is leading to a cliff. While an important function of regulation is to work against the herding mentality which has been a feature of financial markets from their very beginning, the primary responsibility for questioning the direction of travel must be with the industry itself. It is the job of prudent bankers to raise awkward questions about the sustainability of their bank’s business model and their ability to generate profits in the long-run and not just in the short-term. It is also worth remembering the words of Warren Buffet that he is fearful when others are greedy, and greedy only when other are fearful. Thirdly, the crisis has also illustrated the importance of good liquidity risk management. Prior to the crisis, bank management paid too little attention to liquidity risks. They were reluctant to invest in safe, but low yielding liquid assets at a time when much better investment returns could be earned from other financial instruments. They also assumed that it would be possible for them to exit their positions at any time, without considering the possibility that all other financial institutions would be trying to do the same thing at the same time.  The regulators of conventional banks have now recognised the importance of liquidity adequacy in parallel to capital adequacy. New international standards are being developed on liquidity and several regulators, such as the UK’s FSA, have already put forward their own proposals for enhancing liquidity standards. As you are no doubt aware, the CBB recently published a draft Consultation Paper on liquidity standards for conventional banks and were are currently considering similar proposals for Islamic financial institutions. Liquidity management has, of course, been a long-standing issue for Islamic financial institutions. We recognise that there is a relative lack of Sharia-compliant high quality liquid instruments that could be used to meet a stock of liquid assets test. As you know, the CBB has undertaken a number of initiatives in recent years to assist the Islamic financial sector to overcome this difficulty. Nonetheless, although recognizing that the problem is a difficult one, 
BIS Review 166/2009 3 the management of Islamic financial institutions have a responsibility to ensure that they take appropriate steps to limit the risk of illiquidity to their institutions.  Prudent banking requires management to consider risk adjusted profitability. For example, putting a large proportion of the bank’s assets into potentially profitable, but also highly illiquid, real estate development projects may fail to achieve an appropriate risk reward trade-off. If a bank has put all of its assets into long-term illiquid assets, it may show high levels of profitability for a few quarters, but it is unlikely to remain in business for very long. Finally, let me turn to the role of the Boards of Directors and of senior management. The financial crisis involved failures of corporate governance at many different levels. There is a common pattern behind many of the failed financial institutions of the last 18 months. In many cases, the Chief Executive was a dominant figure who made sure that he alone took all important decisions. There was no culture of open debate and discussion within the institutions, with the result that members of the Board of Directors did not feel able to challenge the Chief Executive’s decisions. Many bank Boards lacked banking experts. Individuals were recruited to the Board of banks for their connections rather than for their knowledge of the banking industry and the ability to ask the right kind of questions. Boards of Directors also failed in their fiduciary duty to consider the interests not just of shareholders, but also of creditors and depositors. Banks are not like other corporations where directors need to consider only the interests of shareholders. Banks have a special position of trust in that they are charged with looking after other people’s money. This means the interests of creditors and depositors need to have equal weight with those of shareholders in the decisions taken by the board of directors. Recognition of the directors’ fiduciary responsibilities is, therefore, an essential element of corporate governance for banks.  This observation applies with special force to the Islamic financial industry. The fiduciary duty of the Board of Directors of an Islamic financial institution does not only relate to the interests of shareholders, depositors, and other creditors, but also to investment account holders who bear many of the same risks as shareholders, but who lack the same control rights. Boards of Directors and management therefore have a fiduciary duty to consider the interests of a wide range of stakeholders. It is essential that Sharia-compliant institutions reflect this requirement in their corporate governance arrangements. The four issues that I have mentioned today – avoiding “straight line thinking”, avoiding herding behaviour, managing liquidity risks, and high standards of corporate governance – are not the only lessons that can be learned from the financial crisis. However, I believe that these lessons are the ones of greatest relevance to the Islamic financial industry, and ones that it needs to give especially careful attention to in reforming its own practices. While the financial crisis will result in regulatory changes which will apply to conventional and Islamic banks alike, the primary responsibility for ensuring sound and prudent banking practices must reside with the owners and managers of the banks themselves. Post-crisis reform needs to begin with the industry examining carefully its own practices and considering whether they meet the standards that its various stakeholders have a right to expect. Only by doing so will it be able to sustain the public trust which is an essential component of a successful financial industry. As the financial crisis has shown, there is little point in pursuing short-term profitability if the long-run result is a loss of public trust in the industry itself. On that note I should like to thank you for your attention and to wish this Conference every success. 
BIS Review 166/2009 1 Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell: The way forward with monetary, fiscal and macroprudential policies Speech by Ms Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Conference “Europe after the crisis: resuming the long-term perspective”, organised by the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and the Centre for Global Studies, Stockholm, 11 December 2009. *      *      * Introduction Thank you for your invitation to speak here today.  In my short intervention, I will focus on the question how post-crisis monetary, fiscal and macroprudential policies in Europe should look like. Rapid and determined policy action have avoided that things turned worse at the peak of the crisis, but now that the worst seems to be behind us, it is time to look further ahead. Notably, we need to reverse what should only be temporary, and implement what needs to be changed structurally, so as to reduce chances of such a crisis from occurring again.  Monetary policy Let me start with monetary policy. After the crisis had intensified significantly, a bit more than one year ago, the ECB responded swiftly and vigorously. In particular, it lowered its main interest rates substantially by 325 basis points between October 2008 and May 2009. The current rate of 1% is the lowest since monetary union started in 1999. In addition, we have taken a number of non-standard liquidity and credit support measures to mitigate the adverse impact of dysfunctional money markets on the liquidity situation of solvent banks in the euro area and thereby avoid the emergence of a systemic liquidity crisis. To this end, for instance, we provided banks with unlimited liquidity against an expanded list of collateral, while prolonging the maturity of our refinancing operations up to 1 year.  From the very beginning, we have made clear that our enhanced credit support measures would be temporary in nature and remain in place only as long as needed. Now, taking into account the ongoing improvements in financial market conditions, we arrived at a situation where in fact not all our liquidity measures are needed to the same extent as in the past. Therefore, we announced last week some initial steps to gradually phasing out some of these measures. At the same time, we continue to provide liquidity support to the euro area banks for an extended period of time at favourable conditions, as – despite the start of the phasing out – the impact of previously taken measures reach well into the next year. While we are still in a period of high uncertainty, and we should not exclude setbacks on the road back to sustainable growth rates and stable financial market conditions, we also need to prepare ourselves for “normal” times. In this respect, in particular with a view to the recent experience, we need to ask ourselves whether the way monetary policy is conducted needs to be changed.  On that, let me first say that the primary objective of the ECB is and remains to maintain price stability over the medium term, and we have continued succeeding in that when looking at measures of inflation expectations which are well anchored in line with price stability. Secondly, in our comprehensive assessment of economic and monetary developments we already take into account a wide set of indicators, including for example also asset prices and credit developments. Thus, there is no need for changing our monetary policy framework 
2 BIS Review 166/2009 in a fundamental way. Nonetheless, the crisis has shown that a more detailed and refined analysis of financial market indicators is important for both, financial stability and monetary policy objectives. Here we need to further invest and become more wary of how financial market risks can effect the macroeconomic environment.  Fiscal policies As regards fiscal policies, I am concerned about the projected strong increase of government deficit and debt levels in euro area countries. According to the European Commission, the deficit ratio in the euro area would reach around 7% of GDP in 2010 compared to 2% in 2008; government debt as a ratio to GDP is expected to increase to 84% compared to 69% in 2008. 13 out of 16 euro area Member states are now facing an excessive deficit procedure due to budget deficits above the 3% of GDP deficit criterion of the Maastricht Treaty.  Certainly, the fiscal measures to stabilise the financial sector and the wider economy have helped to limit the adverse effects of the economic and financial crisis. However, it is now time to prepare ambitious and well-defined fiscal exit strategies. Otherwise, government debt in the euro area is set to quickly rise to levels above 100% of GDP, which might severely undermine the public’s trust in the sustainability of public finances. Moreover, unsustainable debt developments would, in the medium to long-term, put upward pressure on interest rates.  At the European level, the fiscal consolidation process should be guided by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. First, this implies to set realistic but also sufficiently ambitious deadlines to correct excessive deficits in euro area countries. The ECOFIN Council has adopted recommendations for country-specific deadlines and fiscal adjustment requirements this month. Second, national governments need to specify their fiscal consolidation strategy and underpin it by well-specified measures. Given the projected strong increase in public spending ratios in euro area countries, governments should focus on expenditure-based fiscal consolidation. In the past, this has also proven to me more effective than tax increases to achieve successful fiscal consolidation.  Macroprudential policies A formidable challenge for the central banking community in the period ahead is to respond in the best possible way to calls to enhance macro-prudential oversight. In the EU, a decision has been taken to establish a European Systemic Risk Board. This body will be responsible for carrying systemic risk surveillance and assessment at an EU-wide level and, where considered necessary, to translate these assessments into risk warnings and possibly policy recommendations.  The financial crisis has illustrated that a very large gap exists between, on the one hand, the risk surveillance and assessment tasks and, on the other, the advice on risk mitigation and possible policy follow-ups. The establishment of the ESRB along with its sister body, the European System of Financial Supervision, which will work in close co-operation, should represent a significant step in this direction. In the new setting, macro-prudential policy instruments should aim at influencing variables such as maturity mismatches, excessive credit growth, leverage, or the risk appetite of market participants.  The types of policy tools that might be activated to address systemic risks may include counter cyclical capital buffers, enhanced liquidity requirements, forward-looking loan-loss provisioning, leverage ratios, haircut and collateral requirements in secured lending, or setting maximum loan-to-value ratios on mortgages. In this sense, the use of these policy tools should take account of both macro-financial and contagion aspects, and most likely will require a continuous interaction between the ESRB and the relevant supervisory and regulatory authorities.  
BIS Review 166/2009 3 Progress has been made in laying out a framework for systemic risk surveillance and assessment. The ESRB – or, for that matter, any other body responsible macro-prudential oversight – will aim at reducing systemic risk. The establishment of the ESRB but also the new EU supervisory architecture mean that vulnerabilities and potential sources of risk for the financial system will be detected in a timelier manner. This will foster better awareness of these risks and their potential implications.  Regulation will make the system more resilient. In fact, to the extent that we can narrow the policy gap between systemic risk assessments and their translation into risk mitigating policy actions, this will ultimately enhance the financial system’s resilience to adverse disturbances. In this sense the political support for these reforms is absolutely essential.  Conclusion  Let me conclude. Monetary and fiscal policies, through vigorous and swift action at the peak of the financial crisis, have avoided a free fall in economic activity and a further drying up of financial markets. As we gradually seem to be leaving the extraordinary circumstances behind us, monetary and fiscal policies must return to their normal mode of operation.  Will that normal mode look different from the one before the crisis? As for monetary policy, you can be assured that the ECB will monitor all developments carefully and continue to gradually phase-out at the appropriate time its enhanced credit support measures, without hampering the functioning of financial markets. Let me also assure you that maintaining price stability remains our primary objective. At the same time, let me also emphasize that central banks must become more wary of financial market risks and their macroeconomic implications to the overall benefit of achieving the monetary policy objective. As regards fiscal policies, consolidation efforts need to be implemented timely and credibly, and as in the past with a particular focus on the expenditure side.  As to macroprudential policies, the recent crisis has strikingly illustrated the interconnectedness that characterizes the financial system. This has reaffirmed the need to strengthen macroprudential policies, i.e. the focus on the systemic nature of risks and their mitigation to reduce the chances on such a crisis from happening again need.  Finally, let us not forget the importance of self set standards and rules by the financial markets themselves. Importantly, the financial industry must be aware of their own responsibility and need to draw the right lessons from the crisis for future practises.  Thank you for your attention.

BIS Review 165/2009 1 Masaaki Shirakawa: Reforming the framework of financial regulation and supervision – an international and Asian perspective Speech by Mr Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Central Bank of Malaysia – Bank for International Settlements’ High Level Seminar, Kuala Lumpur, 11 December 2009. *      *      *  1. Introduction I am very much honored to have this opportunity to speak before such distinguished participants, including those from central banks, at this High Level Seminar co-organized by Bank Negara Malaysia and the Bank for International Settlements. Today, I would like to offer my reflections on the lessons from the current global financial crisis. However, under this theme, many issues have already been raised and numerous discussions held. I myself have participated in many such discussions at many international forums and, I have to confess, I have been wondering about some piece missing in these discussions. Thinking about why this has been the case, I came to realize one of the reasons I feel this way is that such discussions have been mostly conducted under the designation of “global financial crisis”, despite the fact that Asian financial systems, including that of Japan, have remained relatively stable. Sufficient consideration has not been extended to such aspects as regional diversity and differences in the structures of financial intermediation. In this regard, I would like to express my views on the lessons of the global financial crisis, from both an international and an Asian perspective, as the financial structure in Asia differs from those in the United States and Europe. I will first present some ideas as to why financial systems in the Asian region remained relatively stable under the current crisis, compared with those in the United States and Europe. Then, I would like to talk about how we should make use of the lessons we have learned from the current crisis, from such a perspective1. 2. Relative stability of financial systems in the Asian region during the current crisis To begin with, let us consider how we should assess the performance of the financial systems in the Asian region during the current crisis. A fair assessment, in my own view, would be as follows. First, Asian financial systems obviously could not be immune to the global financial turmoil, and have indeed been seriously impacted. Second, compared with what happened in the United States and Europe, financial systems in Asia remained relatively robust, and here I need to stress the word “relatively”. For example, between the collapse of the Lehman Brothers in September last year and early 2009, the share price of Asian financial institutions plummeted by 30 to 40 percent, depending on jurisdiction. In most Asian economies, the prices have now recovered to pre-Lehman levels, and in some economies have even exceeded that level by more than 30 percent. The performance of financial shares matches that of average indices covering all sectors. On the other hand, the rebound in the U.S. and European banking sectors is clearly                                                  1  See Masaaki Shirakawa, “Preventing the Next Crisis: The Nexus between Financial Markets, Financial Institutions and Central Banks”, speech at the London Stock Exchange (May 2009), and “International Policy Response to Financial Crisis”, remarks at the Symposium Sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming (August 2009), for discussions on reforming the framework of financial regulation and supervision based on the lessons from the current financial crisis. 
2 BIS Review 165/2009 weaker, recovering only to 70 to 80 percent of pre-Lehman levels, while indices of all sectors have recovered to roughly 90 percent. The difference of performances between Asian and U.S./European financial institutions is also reflected in their respective balance sheets. While the ratio of non-performing loans has recently shown a steep rise in the United States and Europe, it remains stable at a low level here in Asia. Bank lending growth has decelerated sharply in the United States and Europe and recently turned negative in some countries. In most Asian jurisdictions, it has also decelerated in recent periods but remained positive, and even accelerated in China. Likewise, Japan’s financial system has enjoyed relative robustness compared with the U.S. and European systems. Libor-OIS spread2, which directly reflects the stress in a funding market, widened in the aftermath of the Lehman shock until the end of last year, as it did in the United States and Europe. However, in yen funding market, the spread remained relatively narrow, and is currently back to August 2007 levels. Third, the impact of the current crisis in the Asian region has been smaller than that of the Asian financial crisis of 1997 to 1998. The Asian financial crisis led to sovereign debt crises, and some economies were compelled to seek financial support from the International Monetary Fund. The situation this time is not nearly as serious. 3. Backgrounds to the robustness of Asian financial system This begs the question: How could Asian financial systems remain relatively robust this time? In my view, the main reason is that the memory of the previous severe financial crisis was still fresh in our minds, and the lessons learned from that crisis were put to good use, even if not perfectly. There were a variety of factors behind the Asian financial crisis, and they were combined with each other in a complex way. The key factor that directly precipitated the crisis was the double mismatch of currency and maturity formation in the asset and liability structures of financial institutions, creating a downward feedback loop between currency risk and liquidity risk. With this bitter experience in mind, many Asian economies endeavored to increase the robustness of their financial systems. First, financial institutions themselves took measures to improve risk management. Mismatches were reduced, although further effort seems necessary. Moreover, most Asian financial institutions adopted a cautious approach towards the complex securitization products in their investment decisions, as memories of the Asian financial crisis were still fresh in their minds. This led to the comparatively lower credit costs this time. Second, the Asian regulatory and supervisory authorities made efforts to enhance the resilience of their financial systems. They used a variety of measures to enhance the robustness as well as the transparency of the financial systems, including attracting foreign capital and facilitating mergers. Moreover, with the enactment of laws and regulations concerning deposit insurance and prompt corrective action, the financial systems were provided with safety-nets to ensure stability in times of crisis. Third, following on from the previous point, liquidity backstops were put in place in preparation for turmoil in the financial and foreign exchange markets. Central banks have been equipped with market operation tools and standing facilities to ensure liquidity in domestic funding markets. A regional network of currency swap arrangements was expanded under the Chiang Mai initiatives to ensure liquidity in foreign currency markets.                                                  2  Libor-OIS spread is the difference between the Libor and the overnight index swap rate, which could be considered as an indicator of counterparty credit risk and liquidity premium. 
BIS Review 165/2009 3 Enhanced foreign reserves, flexible foreign exchange mechanisms, and stringent fiscal discipline also contributed to reducing concerns over sovereign risk. 4. Learning from past crisis experience And yet, even if we learn all the lessons past crises have to teach us, can we guarantee the resilience of the Asian financial system in the future as well? I must say, I refrain myself from being optimistic in this respect. I have my doubts because, first, it is difficult for any of us to truly learn from the experience of others. Since the bursting of the bubble and the subsequent financial crisis in Japan, there has been much discussion of the so-called “lost decade” by academics and policymakers abroad. However, I must say that the implications of our experience, such as the severity of liquidity crisis and balance sheet adjustments, have not been fully taken to heart3. Even if the lessons of a crisis are correctly understood by outside observers, it is often difficult for those to implement necessary measures in their jurisdictions without actually experiencing a crisis. For instance, it was only by facing so many failed financial institutions after the bursting of the bubble that Japan learned the importance of an infrastructure whereby failed institutions can be resolved in an orderly manner. We had to overcome so many difficulties before we finally introduced the resolution regimes we are equipped with today. After the outbreak of the current financial crisis, I was rather surprised to learn that resolution regimes were not yet fully introduced in many European countries. Thus, I realized again how difficult it is to learn from the experience of others and to translate that into one’s own action. The financial systems in Asian economies were relatively stable during the current crisis, but we need to recognize that by feeling less pain, we in the Asian region may have missed something that we were supposed to learn during this new experience. Second, memories fade with time and as generations pass. I mentioned earlier that Asian financial institutions, including Japan’s, were cautious in investing in complex securitization products, but there is no guarantee that they will remain prudent in the future. History provides us with so many examples of one success leading to complacency: the bubble economy of Japan in the late 1980s, the East Asian Miracle of the early 1990s, and the Great Moderation of the mid-2000s, to name just a few. Third, since crises emerge in different guises depending on the stage of development and the structure of the economy, the way we respond to a crisis should also evolve. In order to maintain financial stability, the mechanism of financial institutions’ governance and the safety-net of the economy, or indeed of society in general, are of crucial importance. However, there is no governance mechanism or safety-net arrangement that is appropriate for all societies at all times. The Asian crisis taught us the downside of free capital flows if a country is not equipped with the appropriate bank supervision and regulation. In the arguments over the so-called crony capitalism, the Asian financial system was once criticized for its opacity, which was considered to be the result of favoritism based on family and local ties. It is beyond my ability to judge whether such criticism was justified or not, but it is quite possible that at some stage of economic and social development, factors, such as long-term customer relationships and mutual assistance, do have a role to play in the governance mechanism. The exact form of governance mechanism still varies across societies even in the age of globalization. In reviewing policies and systems, including financial regulation and supervision, it is very important that each jurisdiction strives to find an answer that best fits its own financial and economic structures.                                                  3  See Masaaki Shirakawa, “Way Out of Economic and Financial Crisis: Lessons and Policy Actions”, speech at Japan Society in New York (April 2009) for discussion on the so-called “lost decade”. 
4 BIS Review 165/2009 5. Towards better financial regulation and supervision Vigorous discussions are currently being held in a variety of international forums, including the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee, with a view to reforming the framework of financial regulation and supervision. Although the Asian financial system remains relatively stable, it cannot be guaranteed immunity from global financial crises, and has actually been significantly impacted by the current crisis. A robust global financial system is a public good that benefits the whole world. This cannot be over-emphasized. In order to prevent another financial crisis, each country should be well aware of this common objective in the first place. Efforts should then be made to organize an internationally consistent regulatory and supervisory framework. In making such efforts, we must be very cautious that the reforming of the financial regulatory and supervisory framework is conducted in a well-balanced manner. When we talk about regulation and supervision, we should not confine the discussion within the sphere of regulation and supervision itself. We should rather keep our eyes on its wider context. When we embark on regulatory and supervisory reform, I believe, it is very important to strike the right balance in a number of dimensions as follows. Balance between macroeconomic policy and financial regulation and supervision First, balance is needed between macroeconomic policy, particularly monetary policy on the one hand, and financial regulation and supervision on the other. In recent years, there has been a growing tendency among academics and central bankers to draw a clear line between the role of monetary policy and that of supervision and regulation: namely, monetary policy should aim at price stability, and regulation and supervision should aim at financial system stability. However, what we actually witnessed during the credit booming period was an unwelcome combination of asset prices increase, rapid credit expansion, and subdued inflation. As a result, debate has been often framed in terms of a trade-off between price stability and financial system stability. However, the true trade-off is not between price stability and financial system stability, but it exists intertemporally between economic stability of the present and that in the future. Although ensuring the soundness of individual financial institutions through regulation and supervision is surely important, the sound management efforts at a micro level may not be sufficient to guarantee the financial system stability. From a macro-perspective, however, if we maintain a monetary policy that accommodates excessive leverage and maturity mismatches over the longer term, someone will eventually take excessive risk, and this will lead to an erosion of financial system stability. That is why monetary policy, too, should be conducted with a macro-prudential perspective, aiming at sustainable price stability in the longer term. At the same time, we must avoid strengthening regulatory framework becomes an impediment to macroeconomic stability. In this sense, we must carefully assess the condition of global economy to determine the timing for implementing the strengthened capital standards. For this, as declared in the Statement of the G20 Pittsburgh Summit in September, it is necessary for us to take an approach that strengthening of the capital standards should be implemented as economic recovery is assured. Balance between regulation and self-discipline Second, balance is needed between regulation applied to financial institutions on the one hand, and management and self-discipline by financial institutions themselves on the other. Financial markets are ever-changing and business models differ across institutions. Given the limited resources of supervisors and regulators, it is impossible to supervise or regulate every inch of the activities of financial institutions. Moreover, given the limited liability of shareholders, the myopic behavior of shareholders and managers cannot be restrained simply by enhancing minimum capital ratio standards or through other regulations. Before the emergence of the subprime loan problem, most financial institutions were well-capitalized in 
BIS Review 165/2009 5 terms of the regulatory definition of capital. Of course, we can say this is owing to the deficiency of the current capital regulation. That is, risks are not adequately captured in the calculation of the capital ratios. At the same time, however, this seems to suggest how intrinsically difficult it is to capture risk correctly in a timely manner. After all, the first line of defense of a financial institution is its managers whose task is to properly identify and manage risks to ensure the financial soundness of their institutions. On a related issue, the mechanism and factors that govern the self-discipline exercised by managers varies from country to country. A typical example is the compensation scheme for managers. If you check the disclosure journals of U.S. and Japanese financial institutions, you will notice a huge difference between the two countries in terms of the level of compensation for managers. In its recent report, the Financial Stability Board describes a number of attributes required of a desirable scheme and level of compensation. For my part, I would just like to emphasize that managers’ appropriate judgment on strategic issues is crucially important. Balance between regulation and supervision Third, balance is needed between regulation and supervision. There is a non-negligible difference among countries in terms of financial and economic structures, as well as in terms of the business models of financial institutions. A minimum set of common rules is needed to be applied to internationally active financial institutions. At the same time, however, it is also important to leave a certain amount of room for local regulators and supervisors to adapt to the local situation. For example, the appropriate method of liquidity management can differ according to the business model of a particular financial institution. When considering liquidity regulation, the first item that comes to many people’s mind as qualified liquid assets would be government bonds. However, in some Asian jurisdictions, outstanding amounts of government bonds issued are small, as a result of fiscal discipline. For such jurisdictions, a uniform liquidity regulation could even be harmful. In Japan, supervisory authorities are monitoring the liquidity positions of financial institutions in a more detailed manner on a routine basis. Thus, at the time of the Lehman shock, the Bank of Japan was in a position to know on a daily basis the funding activities of financial institutions, including foreign banks and securities firms. This type of information was particularly valuable when the Bank of Japan conducted open market operations in such a stressed situation. This is one of the reasons why Japan’s financial system was able to remain relatively stable at that time. Of course, not all countries can afford to conduct such monitoring on a regular basis. Thus, the best way of addressing these issues may be more or less different across jurisdictions, and it might be difficult to always establish an internationally uniform hard-wired standard. As I mentioned earlier, I strongly believe in the necessity of internationally common rules. That said, it is hard to draw a clear line between those areas where internationally common rules should be applied, and those where domestic rules should be applied. The same holds for determining whether supervision or regulation should play the main role in a particular area. I would like to emphasize the importance of both; that is, internationally common rules on the one hand, and due respect for the differences among countries and institutions on the other. Balance between preventing crisis and containing ripple effects Fourth, balance is needed between policies aimed at preventing crisis and those aimed at containing the ripple effects of a crisis that has already occurred. Even if all the efforts I have mentioned were made, including macroeconomic policies, regulation, supervision, and self-discipline, there will always remain the possibility of financial institution failure. Recognizing this harsh reality, we have to redouble our efforts to construct a financial infrastructure that is resilient to shocks. Challenges abound in this sphere, but I would like to stress the crucial 
6 BIS Review 165/2009 role of the smooth transfer of liquidity across currencies, time zones, and jurisdictional boundaries. It is the lack of liquidity, rather than the lack of capital, that directly causes failures of financial institutions. Therefore, we should endeavor to prevent the crisis contagion triggered by concerns over a lack of liquidity. In this regard, for example, currency swap arrangements and cross-border collateral arrangements could both be effective liquidity supplement tools. Enhancing the infrastructure of financial transactions, including the shortening of settlement periods, is also an important issue. 6. Concluding remarks As I have argued, striking the right balance in a variety of dimensions is important for realizing financial system stability. I would like to conclude my remarks with a few words mentioning that in order to attain the kinds of balance I have outlined, it is crucial for the relevant organizations and personnel themselves to have a balanced and broad perspective on the issues at hand. The Japanese financial crisis was a result of the bursting of the bubble that emerged in the late 1980s. During this bubble era, I was working in the monetary policy area. For several years after the bursting of the bubble, I was involved in the resolution of failing financial institutions and in developing the necessary framework to carry out such resolutions. In the late 1990s, I moved over to work on international financial markets, and in the several years just before and after the Asian financial crisis, I was involved in the work carried out by the Committee on Global Financial Systems hosted by the Bank for International Settlements. After that, I returned to the monetary policy area until the mid-2000s, covering a period identified with a number of keywords, including the bursting of the IT bubble, deflation, and the Yen carry trade. Looking back, I believe the knowledge and intuition that I gained through this experience has been extremely valuable in making policy decisions in the face of the recent crisis. Such personal experience has led me to emphasize the importance for people involved in the world of financial stability to have as broad a perspective as possible, rather than confining themselves in a silo, and for staff to experience a variety of jobs in rotation. It is also quite important for the management of central banks and regulators to foster such an institutional culture. International human networks are also a vital element in developing a broader perspective. The recent crisis has reminded us of the significance of international networks and cooperation. From such a viewpoint, I would like to express my gratitude once again to Bank Negara Malaysia and the Bank for International Settlements for organizing this fruitful event, which has made a most valuable contribution to widening our perspectives. Thank you very much for your attention. 
BIS Review 165/2009 1 Linah K Mohohlo: Global economic developments impacting Botswana Address by Mrs Linah K Mohohlo, Governor of the Bank of Botswana, at the Global Expo Botswana 2009, Gaborone, 4 November 2009. *      *      *  It is my honour and privilege to be a part of the festivities marking the 2009 Global Expo Botswana, which is the country’s premier international business-to-business exhibition. At the outset, let me extend a special welcome to exhibitors and visitors from overseas and those from sister countries in the region. Please feel at home in our midst. This year’s Expo comes at an opportune time when the state of the global economy is on a stabilization phase, and, therefore, calling for closer economic, trade and entrepreneurial interaction in order to sustain recovery. At this moment of optimism in the global recovery, this year’s Global Expo assumes greater importance more than ever before. The Expo presents an opportunity for exploring new avenues for investment and trade, so that we can continue to uplift and improve our collective standard of living. It is, therefore, my hope and desire that potential investors will seek opportunities for investment on their own or by partnering with their domestic counterparts. At the same time, domestic entrepreneurs should be able to widen their horizon and acquire new ways of doing business; they should learn from their foreign and domestic counterparts and develop market networks. It is also my desire that you will in, the end, develop life-long personal friendships that will enrich your experiences as individuals and families. I find it appropriate, therefore, that the theme for Global Expo Botswana 2009 is “Unlocking Opportunities in the Current Global Recession”. This theme calls on us to reflect on the current weak global economy, it call on us to reflect on the lessons learned as well as on emerging trends; it also affords us the opportunity to prevent history from repeating itself from an economic perspective, here at home and globally. As part of addressing the theme, I believe it is relevant that I highlight some global economic developments, as they impact on our economy. Since last year, the world economy has experienced the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Although the immediate cause of the economic recession was the 2007 collapse of the mortgage market in the United States of America, its depth and spread reflected deeper global economic and trade imbalances that had not been addressed. The recession was particularly severe in advanced economies which, as a group, are forecast to decline by an overall 3.4 percent this year. Fortunately, the emerging and developing economies are expected to register a growth rate of 1.7 percent in 2009; this is, nonetheless, a much slower rate of expansion compared to the 6 percent achieved the previous year. The global recession has severely affected international trade. According to the International Monetary Fund, the volume of trade will decline by a steep 11.9 percent this year. The reason for this is simple. Rapid economic growth in many countries, especially during the last two decades since the end of the cold war, depended on export performance. When the importing countries began to experience an economic downturn, their demand for exports declined at a faster rate than the slowdown on growth. That is why there is now a global consensus that at a time of economic recession, all efforts should be made to Bencourage, and not restrict, trade so that countries can bail each other out. Global Expo Botswana answers this call. 
2 BIS Review 165/2009 The good news is that, while it has been severe, the recession has been less deep and lasted a shorter period than many had initially feared. This fortunate outcome is due to the unprecedented coordination of fiscal and monetary policies that were put in place by all the major economies. It is now clear that these efforts have begun to bear fruit, to the extent that a 3.1 percent global economic expansion is forecast for next year. Such is the optimism for global recovery that policy makers are now discussing how best to wind-down the stimulus packages, as the international economy progressively returns to more normal performance. In fact, countries that were moderately in recession – Australia and Norway – have begun to tighten monetary policy. France and Germany have realised positive economic growth for almost two successive quarters. Similarly, the world’s largest economy, the United States of America, grew at an estimated annualised 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 2009, a significantly faster rate than expected, and it was the first economic expansion in two years. Thanks to China for continuing on its robust economic growth path. All these economic expansion statistics are encouraging, even for the domestic economy, as luxury sectors such as diamond mining and tourism should derive benefit. Unfortunately, the United Kingdom continues to experience constraints to economic recovery, but it is expected to be out of the woods in due course. With respect to developments in the domestic economy, you are aware that Botswana did not escape the effects of the global recession. However, the on-going global economic recovery has led to a rebound of economic activity, particularly in the third quarter, compared to the first half of the year, when there was no diamond production. In addition to the beneficial effect of the on-going recovery of the world economy, government spending and the easing of monetary policy contributed to a strong expansion of the non-mining sector, which enabled the overall economy to grow by 1.3 percent in the third quarter of this year. This suggests that the underlying trend in economic activity remains positive, partly because the Government was able to implement a fiscal stimulus by drawing on the savings that were accumulated when revenues were buoyant. As a result of the world economic upturn, diamond production has resumed in response to a steady revival of overseas demand for rough diamonds; and it is expected that this trend will continue in the second half of the year. The resumption of diamond exports has also led to surpluses in the current account of the balance of payments in recent months, so much so that the foreign exchange reserves are now increasing after months of consistent decline. As intimated earlier, the Bank of Botswana lent support to the domestic economic recovery by easing monetary policy. To this end, the Bank Rate was reduced from 15.5 percent in December 2008 to the current level of 11 percent. It is important to emphasise that the Bank remains vigilant in monitoring inflation trends, to ensure that the medium term inflation objective of 3–6 percent is adhered to, despite some transient spikes in prices, which pushed inflation to 7 percent in September. After all it is the Bank’s policy to stabilise inflation at a low and sustainable level in order to promote long-term economic growth and diversification. Needless to add, the world economy remains fragile. For a strong rebound in economic activity to be sustained, there is need to learn from the current crisis and to take corrective measures, if we are to avoid a recurrence of the recent economic and financial turmoil. At a global level, there is discussion of the need to create a new economic order. Towards this end, the G20 is no longer an obscure talking shop for finance ministers and central bank governors of advanced economies. Although there is practically no developing country participation, we should take comfort from the fact that it has now been transformed into a serious forum for world leaders to take collective global decisions. It is also expected to assume the responsibility for policy coordination, a role that has, until now, been played by the G8. After years of virtually fruitless discussions, there are now signs of progress in the long overdue reforms to the governance and functions of the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. 
BIS Review 165/2009 3 However, less progress has been made on reforms of the regulation and supervision of financial institutions. And yet, there is a need to curb the excessive risk-taking by these institutions. After all, it was their behaviour which threatened the collapse of the global financial system in 2008, that then triggered the recession. Similarly, there is little sign of reviving the global trading system under the Doha Round of trade talks. And yet it is clear that even-handed trade relations that could emerge through these negotiations could boost world trade and fulfill the G20 commitment to discourage countries from pursuing policies that restrict trading through protectionist measures. Here at home, one of the main lessons derived from the global financial turmoil and economic recession is that reliance on the one dominant sector is far from safe. Clearly a concerted effort towards diversifying the economy is even more urgent, and the Government needs to partner with the private sector in this endeavour. Many of the building blocks are already in place for diversified investment and development. We have macroeconomic stability; we have strong and robust structures for sound policy formulation; we have no exchange controls; and the banking system is stable, soundly managed and offers diverse products. These positive attributes have been consistently recognised by the sovereign credit rating agencies and other international organisations. At international level, the country scores highly in indicators of international competitiveness, such as The Heritage Foundation’s “economic freedom”, the World Bank’s “ease of doing business”, the World Economic Forum’s “global competitiveness“, and Transparency International’s “corruption perception index”. As you will readily agree, despite these impressive scores, there remain challenges in attracting foreign direct investment outside the mining sector. Therefore, the time has come to address the remaining constraints to broadbased investment. In particular, the cost of doing business in Botswana is high compared to other landlocked countries. Businesses should lobby for necessary changes that reduce production costs, but not seek generous subsidies or clamour for imposition of additional obstacles that favour a particular interest group. Equally important, businesses should not always look up to the Government for solutions to their problems, as such an approach tends to entrench a culture of dependency. All-in-all, business should embrace the benefits that accrue from increased productivity in a global economic environment. It is only this path that will sustain our country’s long-run broad-based economic and social prosperity. I had the pleasure of touring the exhibits earlier today, and was very impressed by the wide range of products on display. I am also encouraged that, despite the current difficult economic conditions, organisers are optimistic that transactions will surpass last year’s fifty million Pula mark by an estimated ten million Pula. This suggests a rebound of consumer confidence in the region. Of equal importance, the organisers have appropriately arranged an investment forum, buyer-seller meetings, and several workshops. These events will contribute significantly to the achievement of the objectives of Global Expo Botswana 2009. I would like to take this opportunity to encourage exhibitors and visitors to patronise and participate in the events. I also wish to encourage members of the public to patronise the exhibition especially on Saturday when, I am reliably informed, there will be cultural performances, various delicious cuisines and other complementary activities that will, no doubt, make Global Expo Botswana 2009 a memorable experience. Director of Ceremonies, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish to conclude by wishing all exhibitors and visitors fruitful business negotiations in the next four days of the Exposition. I also commend the organisers for a sterling job in putting together this event; you make the city of Gaborone and the country proud. 
4 BIS Review 165/2009 The Acting President, Honourable Ministers, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, it is now my honour and privilege to declare Global Expo Botswana 2009 officially open. I thank you for your attention. 
BIS Review 165/2009 1 José Manuel González-Páramo: New investment fund statistics for the euro area Introductory remarks by Mr José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, for the first statistical release, Frankfurt am Main, 11 December 2009. *      *      *  Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome to the ECB. Today it is my pleasure to introduce an important new set of statistics for the euro area as single economic entity. These statistics provide detailed harmonised information on the assets and liabilities of investment funds resident in the euro area. They are compiled by the ECB in close cooperation with the national central banks. Fruitful work has also been conducted in liaison with the European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA), a business association represented in this room. Since the inception of the ECB, major progress has been achieved in developing monetary and financial statistics for the euro area. This work, carried out in close cooperation with the Member States, has resulted in a full range of timely and high quality euro area statistics, which the ECB constantly monitors in performing its policy functions. The first major steps were the implementation of euro area statistics for monetary financial institutions (in particular to derive statistical information on monetary aggregates), lending and interest rates, as well as on the balance of payments. In recent years, efforts have focused on the development of statistics for other financial sectors. This also reflects the increasing links between the banking sector and other financial institutions. Moreover, our statistics have been integrated into the euro area accounts, which provide an overall picture of the euro area economy. The next milestone is the release of the new investment funds statistics, today. For some years, the ECB has already published un-harmonised and partly estimated euro area investment fund statistics, at a quarterly frequency. Today we will present, for the first time, harmonised investment fund statistics that cover all investment funds resident in the euro area. This includes data for the main fund types such as bond, equity or mixed funds, but also other types of funds, including hedge funds. Our new dataset contains much more detailed breakdowns both on the assets held and liabilities issued by investment funds. The data provide, for example, detailed information on the residency and sector of the issuers of securities and shares held by the funds. New information is available, as well, on the residency of the holders of the shares issued by euro area investment funds. In addition to the detailed quarterly information, the ECB now also publishes key monthly information on the outstanding amounts and net sales of shares issued by the funds. A further important improvement concerns the timeliness of the publication of these statistics: as from 2010, the statistics will become available after one-and-a-half months (compared to 3-and-a-half months in the past).  There are many reasons why high quality statistics on euro area investment funds are important for the ECB’s monetary and financial analysis. Let me just highlight two of them: First, since investment funds are large institutional investors, their portfolio choices may be indicative of more general trends in portfolio diversification. For that reason, these statistics are certainly also useful for explaining monetary developments. Second, changes in investment funds’ asset value are transmitted, through the valuation of their shares, to households and firms. In turn, these wealth effects, may have implications on aggregate demand. The structure of the financial assets held by investment funds also provides important information regarding the financial risks that are indirectly borne by households and firms through their portfolio of investment fund shares.  
2 BIS Review 165/2009 In addition to the new statistics on investment funds, separate data are now also published every quarter on euro area Money Market Fund balance sheets. As a consequence, one can now perform analyses for the whole sector of funds. These new data on Money Market Funds are also a useful addition to the ECB’s monetary analysis. Because of the close substitutability between their shares issued and bank deposits, money market funds form part of the Monetary Financial Institutions sector and are thereby contained in the M3 figures. From now on, the new investment fund and money market fund data will be published in regular monthly ECB statistical press releases. I am convinced that the new harmonised statistics yield novel insights into the structure and development of the financial sector of the euro area economy. The financial crisis clearly demonstrated that high quality and up-to-date statistics are indispensable to policy makers and market participants alike. Thank you very much for your attention. Now, the Director General Statistics, Mr. Steven Keuning, will present more detailed features and the first results of the new statistics. Following his presentation we stand ready to answer your questions. 
BIS Review 164/2009 1 Mario Draghi: The social market economy and the solutions to the global financial and economic crisis Remarks by Mr Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, for the European People’s Party high-level policy debate on "The social market economy and the solutions to the global financial and economic crisis", EPP Statutory Congress, Bonn, 9 December 2009. *      *      * I am very pleased to be here to talk about progress in finding and implementing solutions to the global financial crisis. You have decided to focus today and tomorrow on issues that are critically important to our economies and our citizens. And I am honoured to have this opportunity to speak about where we are in terms of financial regulatory reform, what has been achieved to date and the priorities ahead. One year after the climax of the financial crisis, market conditions have eased significantly and a degree of confidence in the financial system has returned. However, the market reaction to Dubai’s woes is a reminder that they remain unusually vulnerable to shocks.  The crisis has implied a massive transfer of debt from the private to the public sector. Fiscal positions have deteriorated across the board at an unprecedented pace. Public deficits in the G7 countries have surged from 2% of GDP in 2007 to 10% today. The limits set by the Stability and Growth Pact will be exceeded until 2014 at least for the euro area. Although necessary and unavoidable, those extraordinary borrowing needs, combined with long-term fiscal challenges on healthcare, pension systems and climate change, will lead to public debt in excess of 100% of GDP in OECD countries in 2010 (up from 74% in 2007).  It is no surprise therefore that markets have been recently more sensitive to accumulating debt burdens in government and quasi-government sectors. Sovereigns represent an increasing share of transactions in credit protection markets (CDS), as market participants challenge the assumption that they are risk-free. Government auctions have faced from time to time unsatisfactory demand, even for highly-rated issuers. Sovereign CDS premia remain volatile and elevated. Markets also show more discrimination across countries. While developed countries come under funding pressure, emerging countries with low debt levels are now able to issue long term, as shown by the recent 50-year bond of China, sometimes at fixed rate and in local currency, which was unimaginable just a few years ago. So there is a way out, but governments need to communicate credibly their medium-term plans to restore fiscal sustainability, in order to limit upward pressure on their funding costs and to retain their ready access to global markets. That is important not only to deliver fiscal prudence, but also to avoid adverse spill-over to the rest of the financial system given their pivotal benchmark status.  On the funding front, there are also heightened risks of crowding out. Global refinancing needs are firmly skewed towards shorter term maturities. Estimates differ, but bank and corporate bond redemptions hover around USD 3 to 4,000 billon annually from 2010 to 2012, double the annual amount of the mid-2000s. Roll-over of government debt will come on top of those needs. Leveraged borrowers such as high-yield companies also face refinancing pressure. And securitization markets are thawing only very slowly. Overall, markets will need to refinance higher debt levels with lower average quality and with a reduced tolerance towards leverage, in a time window when support schemes will progressively unwind. Such absorption pressure may well lead to higher and more volatile funding costs. Therefore, it is now time that financial institutions and corporates engage proactively in lengthening their debt profile and tapping global markets in an orderly fashion given the risk that they may otherwise be forced to raise funds under less attractive terms.  
2 BIS Review 164/2009 Amidst these challenges, restoring a well functioning market-based economy also requires exiting from the exceptional financial sector support measures introduced since 2007. Clearly, the timing, speed and modalities of exit involve important trade-offs, and judgment will need to be used. Implementing exit strategies will require striking an uneasy balance between exiting too early and too late. This underscores how important it is that we resolve the regulatory issues in front of us, which will be part and parcel of our ability to exit this crisis with confidence in the resilience of our financial system. Bolstering the resilience of the financial system is a broad project encompassing a considerable number of related measures. It involves multiple layers of policy authorities across countries and sectors. And it requires coordination and a joined-up international response, both for making our policies effective and for establishing a level playing field. Driving forward a coordinated global regulatory response has been the key role of the G20 Leaders and of the Financial Stability Board, which I have the honour to chair. Much policy development has been achieved – more than meets the eye – that when implemented, will result in a very different financial system than the one that brought us this crisis: a more resilient, disciplined, less procyclical and less leveraged system; one where the perverse incentives to excessive risk taking – with private gains and socialised losses – that characterised the recent past will have been removed. Substantial progress has been made on a very broad front, and we have now not only a consensus internationally on the objectives of the reform agenda, but a broad commitment to consistent implementation at the national levels. To name just a few of the significant changes that have already occurred: we have closed loopholes and corrected shortcomings in the bank capital and liquidity frameworks; we have addressed weaknesses in accounting standards; improved risk management and disclosure standards for financial institutions; introduced new standards and principles on sound compensation; and we have enhanced oversight of credit rating agencies and hedge funds.  But we are far from done. Work is underway in critical areas, and implementation of the full set of needed reforms will require political will and perseverance. We simply must take the steps that are needed to ensure we can exit this crisis confident that we have put in place a much stronger system for the future. A lot of what needs to be done requires international consistency because finance is global. It is therefore of critical importance that, as we set out a constructive path for reform in our respective constituencies, we work to ensure that this takes place with a view to preserving the advantages of integrated global financial markets and a level playing field across countries and sectors. The Financial Stability Board takes this very seriously. Completing and implementing financial reform thus remains a key imperative – both nationally and internationally. Let me now speak to some of the areas where critical decisions in the months ahead will determine whether credible reform is achieved. I will leave aside the issues of reform of national and regional oversight structures, and focus on bank capital and liquidity, compensation, accounting, derivatives, and addressing the moral hazard posed by institutions that are too big to fail.  • Improving bank capital is clearly the single most important project to build greater resilience into the system. Through the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, we have now agreed the key measures needed to strengthen the capital framework – raising the quality and quantity of capital; introducing a leverage ratio that will constrain bank leverage; and requiring banks to create countercyclical buffers that can be drawn down during bad times. Proposals on the first two will be developed by the end of this year and on the last by the middle of next year. A comprehensive impact study and the calibration of the overall capital level will be undertaken by end-2010, looking at the cumulative effect of all the reforms and how they interact. In other words, there will be no simplistic layering of the different elements. The 
BIS Review 164/2009 3 changes to Basel II will be substantial, and they will be phased in over an extended period so as avoid any adverse interaction with current conditions. • Regulation is being substantially enhanced on bank liquidity as well. The Basel Committee will issue for comment early next year a new minimum liquidity standard directed at ensuring global banks hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to withstand a stressed funding scenario specified by supervisors. This too will be subject to an impact assessment. • On compensation, countries are taking actions to implement the FSB standards issued in Pittsburgh and others will be following shortly. These standards address the structure and governance of compensation; they also call on firms – on public policy and prudential grounds – to restrict compensation levels so long as this is needed to retain and build the necessary level of capital. This is an area in which it is absolutely essential that authorities take robust collective steps if they are to dispel expectations that business can go on as usual. The FSB is now launching a review of the actions taken by authorities and firms, focusing on consistency and effectiveness at achieving the intended results, and will propose additional measures as needed.  • On accounting, we have seen progress in the revamping of financial instruments accounting. But we are quite some distance from achieving the objectives of improved, converged standards that are less complex and less prone to amplifying economic cycles. This is a difficult area that we are pursuing vigorously through dialogue between the accounting standards setters, prudential regulators and other stakeholders. But we must do so in way that respects the integrity and independence of the standards setting process.  • Last but not least, we must reduce the moral hazard posed by institutions that are too large, or too complex, or too interconnected to fail. The large-scale support we provided in this crisis to stave off systemic collapse has materially worsened moral hazard risks. Why should our financial firms now believe that authorities will not stand behind them if conditions were to turn again to the worse? Moreover, many of our banks have become larger, not smaller as a result of crisis-related mergers. Moral hazard risks pose a large prospective burden for taxpayers and are a serious threat to the maintenance of a market-based system. So what is to be done? • At the Pittsburgh Summit, the G20 Leaders called on the FSB to propose by end-October 2010 possible measures to reduce these problems. We are now evaluating approaches under three headings, while recognising that there will be no silver bullet or a one-size-fits all solution in this area:  – First, reducing the probability and impact of failure of a systemically important institution. The aim is to link capital and liquidity charges more closely to the externality or spill-over costs of failure. Here, we will be investigating a capital surcharge for systemic importance, as well as what role new capital instruments, such as contingent capital, or other insurance schemes could play. We will also consider options to incentivise structures and business models that support effective supervision. – Second, improving resolution capacity, by establishing credible resolution frameworks for large interconnected financial institutions – frameworks that have the ability and funding to preserve the continuity of a failing institution’s core functions, and the authority to impose losses on shareholders and unsecured creditors Work is also underway to improve ex ante crisis preparedness and resolution, including through the use of “living wills”. We must recognise, at the same time, that achieving effective resolution of cross-border entities will ultimately require addressing very difficult issues – such as 
4 BIS Review 164/2009 recognition and harmonisation of resolution regimes, and how to share across borders the costs of a resolution.  – Third, strengthening the core financial infrastructures and markets to reduce contagion risks, including by moving over-the-counter derivatives onto exchanges or central clearing platforms. Action in this latter area can shrink the risk exposures arising from interconnectedness that contribute to authorities having no choice but to bail out systemically important financial institutions.  Let me conclude with two general remarks.  First, effective work to strengthen the global financial system requires policies that are well designed and will be robust over the long run. This necessarily takes time. It is important, therefore, that governments send a strong message that they are determined to see these reforms through. Where international policy development is ongoing, it needs continued support; where such policy work has concluded, we need commitment to consistent national implementation.  Second, given the commitment G20 Leaders have made to coherent approaches as we improve financial regulation, we must strive to overcome inconsistencies in final rule-making and implementation at the national and regional level so as to achieve a level playing field. The FSB will monitor this by undertaking regular peer reviews among FSB members – both country-by-country, and by topic across the entire membership. The fundamental value of our peer reviews will be the dialogue and constructive engagement of our members towards the common objective of a well regulated, open, and market-based financial system.  In a global context, it is of course critically important that standards are raised everywhere. In the FSB, we have embarked on a process to identify the non-co-operative jurisdictions that fail to implement internationally agreed standards in the prudential and regulatory area. We are developing a toolbox of measures that will incentivise adherence to reforms in these jurisdictions. We are working closely with the IMF in these areas, which has a key role in surveillance of the global financial system, and, together with the World Bank, are well-established assessors of authorities’ implementation of key financial sector policies and standards. We will also collaborate closely with the new European Systemic Risk Board and the European financial supervisory structures that have now been put in place. Our shared goal is a stronger and more resilient international financial system in which threats to stability are engaged earlier, are better cushioned when they materialise, and where protections are adequate to give our citizens and countries confidence in an open and integrated financial system. 
BIS Review 164/2009 1 Ardian Fullani: The western Balkans – from regional cooperation to EU membership Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the conference “The western Balkans: overcoming the economic crisis – from regional cooperation to EU membership", Brussels, 9 December 2009. *      *      * During the last 20 years the region has undergone significant structural changes, which have fueled economic incentives and economic growth. In the early stages of transition a fast and significant transformation in the labor and later in the capital market reoriented all factors of production toward more productive sectors. This contributed to higher total factor productivity and consequently fast economic growth. The final stage of transition was dominated by a robust financial deepening process fueled among others from EU based capital inflows. This financial intermediation busted credit growth and consumption yielding to absorption led growth model in the region. In the aftermath of crises our policy choices are limited. From a broad prospective the region should chose a new philosophy, different from the boom-bust model of the last decade. I strongly believe this must be the focal point of the Regional Policies. The current crisis pointed out several problems in our growth models. The so called catching up process was a model of unsustainable consumption behavior rather than sustainable long run equilibrium. Despite the overall fiscal consolidation and relatively high rate of growths, it resulted in increasing macroeconomic imbalances mostly evidenced in the fast enlargement of current account deficits. From a micro analysis point of view that was reflected on unsustainable financial position of enterprises and households balance sheets, lead by persistent fighting for market share in products and services in the banking system.  It is for that reason that hard gained achievements attained during the last 15 years in eastern Europe, got reversed within one week.  Today, one year after the eruption of the financial crisis, I have to affirm that all the measures undertaken by central banks of countries in the region resemble one another. Generally speaking, in my opinion the measures adopted during this period are of an extreme nature; they are unusual and go against the “constitution” of the modern central bank with regard to liquidity, money market and monetary policy transmission channels. However, we have embraced the philosophy that “the end justifies the means”.  Nevertheless, I think the central bank has become more vulnerable in terms of independence and monetary policy efficiency. Providing liquidity in any case, in any quantity, with any maturity and accepting any kind of collateral would definitely damage the monetary policy, with potential second round effects on financial stability. If central banks in the short run shift their focus from the primary objective to supporting economic growth at any cost, it would indirectly create premises for long rung economic imbalances. The current polices pursued by both monetary and fiscal authorities should not be considered as a new normality. While the global economy is adjusting toward a new equilibrium, solid macro-prudential long run policies should replace current stimulating efforts. Therefore the challenge for our economies in the long run is to address current problems and the inherited ones based on a new model of growth, based on: (i) higher savings and investments, aiming toward a contained consumption matched by domestic production; (ii) persistent FDI inflows oriented toward tradable sectors; (iii) regional cooperation.  
2 BIS Review 164/2009 Let me briefly share with you some of my thoughts on the importance of this last remark, namely regional cooperation. Following arguments illustrate the benefits of cooperation, at several levels: • From a development point of view, increased cooperation and integration on a regional level creates a greater scope for economies of scale. This would increase incentives for local and foreign investors to undertake big investment project that would not be profitable otherwise. A related advantage would be increased specialization of our economies, leading to a higher economic performance. • On a policy level, coordinated macroeconomic policies, legal and prudential frameworks, would tend to improve the allocation of resources and to prevent beggar-thy-neighbor policies. This race to the bottom type of philosophy would not benefit the region as a whole. • From a strategic point of view, our region is in competition with several emerging regions on a global scale. It’s not sufficient any more to be the best guy in the village; especially when there are an increasing number of villages on a global scale, with an ever increasing number of clever guys. • From a convergence point of view, the sharing of experiences would avoid costly errors, while coordinated policies and steps would make a stronger case for a faster EU integration. We should demonstrate that the region is fit to enter the club, by firstly adopting the rules of the club among ourselves. In a more technical and concrete approach, the efforts of the public authorities in our region to achieve a real and meaningful cooperation should consider the followings: First, the mentality of the societies in our region should change. It is noted that this region has a history full of conflicts and many other disputes. It is now up to the young generations and to the people with an open-minded approach in our region, to find solutions and to promote behaviors that will build our future path toward Europe.  Second, the commitment to full integration with the European Union, should serve as a solid platform for cooperation, and as an anchor for pursuing sound policies and coordinated structural reforms.  Third, a very important precondition will be the strengthening of countries domestic anchors, specifically in the form of medium-term fiscal rules, fiscal councils, or embedding fiscal constraints in countries’ constitutions.  Fourth, the legal basis that supports such international cooperation should be fully in place. It is important that such cooperation be guided from a set of consolidated principles with regional relevance. Fifth, there is urgent need for policies that would encourage stronger inward FDI and other non-bank flows. The region’s growth model might need to be more self-reliant, emphasizing domestic savings, better mobilization of labor resources, and a much greater role for the traded good sector as an engine of growth. Dear participants, Let me conclude by pointing out that our region offers an interesting combination of countries, languages, culture and geographical composition. Analyzed individually, it is difficult to think that our economies generate substantial incentives for foreign investors, particularly for strategic and technologically advanced investors, able to use the advantages provided by the economies of scale. Moreover, the cost associating different strategic projects at a national level would be higher for our still lagging economies. I do believe that there is plenty of room to establish a joint regional market and our duty is to make utmost use of it. There are still a few gaps in the region with respect to infrastructure, energy, tourism, financial architecture, mining and agriculture. Out task is to jointly identify missed opportunities, to jointly incorporate those into realistic business plans and to jointly present 
BIS Review 164/2009 3 these regional projects in a contemporaneous way to private investors and supranational agencies, to benefit their political, financial and technological support and finally ensure a stable growth model. On a national level, there is still the need for deep structural reforms and all efforts should be made for them to operate in a concerted way across the SEE region. I believe that the European Union structures should closely orientate, monitor and assess this process. This is the only way to steadily convert our countries into highly productive economies, attractive to foreign investors against the backdrop of favourable labour cost. This all makes sense once we fully re-dimension our educational capacities, particularly in technology and other areas where we could discover and explore advantages compared to other economies. Instead of looking at each other merely as competitors, we should approach the regional cooperation as a non-zero-sum game, where each country has to gain in partnership. Summarizing, this process calls for risk adverse macro and development policies; well coordinated policy mix; stronger cross border co-operation, and concerted efforts – perhaps harmonized and motivated across the region – to deepen the quality of structural reforms. Structural reforms targeted to improving the business environment will help foster new capital inflows and strong and sustainable growth.  In this respect (and in the light of the last crisis lessons), countries can make better use of the EU fiscal surveillance process as explicit policy commitment devices. Candidate and potential candidate countries on one side and the EC on the other have the opportunity to transform this surveillance process (possibly enhancing it with an analytical input form IMF) into an efficient foreign anchor. 
BIS Review 164/2009 1 Jeanette R Semeleer: To dollarize or not to dollarize – the Central Bank of Aruba’s point of view  Speech by Ms Jeanette R Semeleer, President of the Central Bank of Aruba, at the conference “Opportunities and Risks of Dollarization for the Dutch Caribbean”, organized by the Minister of Finance of the Netherlands Antilles, Curaçao, at the Bank of the Netherlands Antilles, Willemstad, 24 August 2009.  *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, good morning!  1.  Introduction  I am truly honored to have been invited to speak to such a distinguished audience on a topic that touches everyone’s wallet, and that is dollarization. With dollarization in this context I refer to as the use of the US dollar as the exclusive legal tender in a country.  I must admit that at the Centrale Bank van Aruba (CBA), although we have regular bilateral meetings, we have been quite surprised with the recent consideration of the BNA to replace the Netherlands Antillean guilder for the US dollar as the legal tender for the island of Curaçao on a very short term.  In view of the far-reaching consequences of such a change, possibly for Aruba too, I highly applaud Mrs. De Lanooy’s initiative to organize a forum of experts, which could enlighten us further on a rather complicated issue. At the end, it is of crucial importance that the required political decision is based on a thorough assessment of the opportunities and risks associated with dollarization.  In the next few minutes I will first clarify my view regarding dollarization in general and, subsequently, I will briefly focus on the special case of small-island economies like Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles.  2.  Dollarized countries  Countries that have dollarized their economy can broadly be divided into two categories. The first group consists of countries, which are generally small and have strong political and/or economic ties with the country that issues the currency they use.  Various island states in the Caribbean (Virgin Islands) and in the Pacific (Guam, Micronesia) belong to this group, which are in economic size comparable with Aruba, Curaçao and St. Maarten.  Other examples include the mini states in Europe like Andorra and Monaco, which use the euro as legal tender. All in all, some thirty countries or territories can be classified in this category.  The second group of countries is much smaller. It consists of economies that are dollarized because of a former special political event or economic crisis.  Ecuador is a good example of this case. At the end of the 1990’s, this country experienced high inflation and depreciation of its local currency (the sucre) when the government suddenly decided to dollarize the economy, even without consulting the IMF.  Mr. Stanley Fischer, at that time Deputy Managing Director of the IMF, later stated that he would have advised against dollarization, as the banking sector in Ecuador was unhealthy and the fiscal position weak. However, in the end, the IMF decided to cooperate with 
2 BIS Review 164/2009 Ecuador in its move towards dollarization of the economy, the latter becoming a success as economic performance in Ecuador has been fairly stable since dollarization was introduced.  The Ecuadorian case proves that it is difficult to assess the merits and the costs of dollarization. In fact, a successfully executed dollarization is not enough to realize a stable economic environment: this process needs to be followed by sound economic and fiscal policies, otherwise the situation will go from bad to worse. In other words: dollarization is not a magic wand!  3.  Effects of dollarization  The case of Ecuador illustrates well how hard it is to formulate general conditions for a successful dollarization. It is not only difficult to assess the pros and cons of dollarization, it is also necessary to analyze the country’s starting position, assess the political and social willingness to abandon the local currency, and to execute a sound economic policy after dollarization, in order to be able to conclude what the effects of dollarization were or are.  In the last ten years there has been a steady discussion on the pros and cons of dollarization. Very distinguished economists like Stanley Fischer (who is currently governor of the Bank of Israel), Sebastian Edwards, Rudiger Dornbusch, Jeffrey Sachs and Paul Krugman all made valuable contributions, reaching however different conclusions on the merits of dollarization.  I will now briefly elaborate on the pros and cons of dollarization on a macro-economic level, thus not the operational implications. Whether an effect of dollarizing the economy is considered a positive or a negative, it could greatly differ between its advocates and its opponents.  I will now briefly refer to some effects of dollarization:  1. Dollarization could lower transaction costs, especially when most payments to nonresidents are in US dollars.  2. Depending on the capital restrictions in place and the depth of the domestic banking sector, it could lead to reduced interest rates, thereby making it less costly to borrow. This could also be the case when acquiring an international loan, as there will be no exchange devaluation premiums on rates charged to local companies and the government.  3. Because of the elimination of exchange rate risk, dollarization could be beneficial to international trade and foreign investment.  4. The import of the monetary policy of the U.S., being the issuing country of the adopted currency, is unavoidable. This means that local policymakers are no longer in the position to use the exchange rate to absorb external shocks or to finance budget deficits by printing money.  5. Some of the tasks of the central bank, especially the function of lender of last resort, which is the credit line for local banks when experiencing financial stress, will disappear. This is typically linked to the ability of the central bank to print its country’s currency.  6. In the process of dollarization, in which the central bank will have to buy back the local currency, a large portion of the current stock of international reserves is needed. Although the need for international reserves to support the exchange rate is eliminated, it is still crucial that the central bank retains an adequate level of reserves to help support economic shocks, as well as to finance its operations.  7. Dollarization will eliminate seigniorage earnings, which is the income of the central bank from issuing the local currency minus the cost of printing banknotes and coins. This could lead the reduced income to the government.  
BIS Review 164/2009 3 4.  View on dollarization  Particularly the reduction in banking costs and the perspective of low interest rates could make dollarization appear very attractive. However, it seems to me that in a stable economic environment with strong fundamentals, a reliable macroeconomic policy, and a credible central bank, the advantages of dollarization are marginal. The more so when there is a good track record of maintaining a fixed and stable exchange rate with the US dollar.  The goal of maintaining a fixed exchange rate is to be able to benefit from the trade advantages of being anchored to the currency of the country with which there exist strong economical ties, while maintaining some degree of independence in terms of monetary policy.  Furthermore, it cannot be denied that there is a political and social aspect to this. Having one’s own central bank and issuing one’s own currency not only gives political status, it is often an important element of national identity.  5.  The case of Aruba  Only a few months prior to Status Aparte in 1986, the Island Council of Aruba, after many studies and discussions, decided to institute its own central bank and issue its own currency, the Aruban florin, with the same nominal value as the Antillean guilder, and that is 1.79 florin to one US dollar. The prime reasons behind this decision were the perceived complexities within a monetary union with the Netherlands Antilles hen adopting the Antillean guilder and the loss of monetary independence in a fully dollarized economy.  For those who are not fully familiar with these issues, I must point out that the decision of the Aruban authorities to peg the Aruban florin to the US dollar is a unilateral one, and is anchored in the Central Bank Ordinance, the Ordinance governing foreign exchange transactions, and the State Decree value of the florin. In other words, it takes a political decision to change the exchange rate of the Aruban florin vis-à-vis the US dollar.  Just as the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba has been able to maintain this peg, meaning that we have experienced an unchanged rate of exchange with the US dollar since 1971.  Starting from 1986, our economy has had an average annual per capita real growth rate of 2.3 percent, a moderate inflation (on average 4.0 percent), a debt to GDP ratio of 44.1 percent, which is still manageable, and a level of international reserves that is more than adequate (currently at 8.7 months of import payments).  In the last two decades, Aruba has made great economic progress: we chose to invest in tourism and, currently, Aruba is one of the most popular tourism destinations in the Caribbean. Two out of three of our visitors are Americans, which does not make it strange to hear that the US dollar is a widely accepted means of payment in Aruba.  These economic and institutional developments demonstrate that it is possible to issue and manage a local currency successfully in a small open economy like ours.  6.  The case of the Netherlands Antilles  Now, I would like to turn to the case of the Netherlands Antilles. I know that dollarization of the Antillean economy has been discussed before. As early as 1986, de Boer and Kamps investigated the possibilities of dollarization in the Netherlands Antilles in a study initiated by the University of the Netherlands Antilles.1 The authors advocated prudence with respect to                                                  1  J. de Boer / J.A. Kamps – Dollarisatie op de Nederlandse Antillen. Een verkennende studie. UNA Cahier, No. 21, June 1986. 
4 BIS Review 164/2009 dollarization of the Antillean economy, as they thought it sensible to first investigate the situation of similar countries with an experience in dollarization. To my knowledge, no follow-up has been given to this study.  The discussion was again brought up in 2005 when it became clear that Curaçao and St. Maarten would become separate entities within the Kingdom, while the BES-islands (Bonaire, Saba and Statia) elected to become an integral part of the Netherlands. De Nederlandsche Bank (conditionally) advised to form a monetary union between the various islands instead of dollarizing the economy. This was in full conformity with the recommendation made in 2004 by the working group on governmental and financial relations headed by Mr. Jesurun).2 De Nederlandsche Bank also mentioned that a credible and independent central bank is important when forming a monetary union and that the BNA has proved to be well-equipped for this task.3  7.  Concluding remarks  In view of the forthcoming changes in the Kingdom’s Statutes, Curaçao and St. Maarten will have to decide on a very short term what to do with regard to their legal tender. Although these islands are deemed too small to justify the costs associated with maintaining a local currency, our experience in Aruba, which entails the existence of a local currency linked to the US dollar and a credible central bank, gives us strong arguments to continue with our dollar-linked florin. In choosing for such an option, Curaçao and St. Maarten could continue to benefit from the financial soundness of the dollar, while still maintaining a certain degree of monetary independence.  Last but not least, I would like to point out that the currency choice, whether at the end it would be a local currency or the US dollar, is purely a stage for an economic act. Depending on the actors, the outcome of the play would be a drama or a happy one. In the choice of a dollarization, the role of the central bank would be limited if not nihil, while that of the government would become even more prominent. There is a significant shift of responsibility.  While the starting fiscal position for both St. Maarten and Curaçao would be advantageous as autonomous countries, meaning a low debt stance, it is critical that fiscal rules and benchmarks are legally imbedded, and that accountability is a normal way of life. This would ensure that internal fiscal discipline is guaranteed, and it does not need to be forced upon by an external party. That is true independence.  I would even go a step further and recommend the creation of special reserves, which would be used to counteract any financial stress. This would provide the necessary confidence to promote financial and economic stability.  There is no doubt that these are exciting times in the Netherlands Antilles. I strongly advise you to learn from the experiences of Aruba, the good but also the bad ones.  I wish you success and thank you for your attention.                                                  2  Werkgroep Bestuurlijke en Financiële Verhoudingen Nederlandse Antillen – Nu kan het… nu moet het!, p. 11 (8 October 2004). 3  H.J.

BIS Review 164/2009 1 Hans-Helmut Kotz: Deutsche Bundesbank Financial Stability Review 2009 Speech by Prof Hans-Helmut Kotz, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the press conference of the presentation of the Deutsche Bundesbank Financial Stability Review 2009, Frankfurt am Main, 25 November 2009. *      *      * I German financial system stabilised In early autumn of 2008, the international financial system was on the verge of collapse. Activity in interbank money markets was severely impaired, with virtually no turnover at all in the longer maturities. Enormous uncertainty prevailed. Premiums for unsecured loans soared to 50 times above their pre-crisis levels. All indicators of risk – whether in the equity, bond, credit or derivatives markets – were standing at all-time highs. There was a danger that the international financial crisis, interacting with the severest slump in global growth in more than half a century, would lead to a more or less uncontrollable downward spiral. A perceptible stabilisation has been under way since the spring of 2009, however, even though this predominantly reflects the unprecedented measures taken by fiscal, monetary and financial market policymakers. A worse outcome was averted only thanks to these non-standard policy measures, which were applied throughout the world. The international and German financial systems were only stabilised when the public sector – in Germany as elsewhere – assumed the role of “risk-taker of last resort”. This is the backdrop against which we present this year’s Bundesbank Financial Stability Review. At the current juncture, domestic credit institutions are benefiting from a more benign global economic outlook. Prospects have improved markedly, and this applies especially to the strongly export-oriented German economy. This is having an immediate positive impact on the conditions in which the financial sector operates. Nevertheless, the road before us is strewn with obstacles. Major challenges for the German banking system still lie ahead. The purpose of our Financial Stability Review is therefore to assess possible risks going forward as well as the German financial system’s resilience in the light of potential, but not unrealistic adverse developments. Recent upward revisions of growth forecasts should not blind us to the fact that the more benign global economic climate is mainly the outcome of the large-scale fiscal stimulus programmes. Concurrently, extraordinary monetary policy measures were deployed to underwrite the financial system’s stability. The process of restructuring the financial sector, which was made possible by these unprecedented policy initiatives, remains vulnerable, however, to setbacks in the recovery of the real economy. The upturn is still far from being self-sustaining. The coming year will show how far fading public-sector stimuli can be replaced by endogenous private sector activity – in Germany’s case, this is typically generated by the interplay between net exports, capital expenditure and household consumption. It is still open to doubt, however, whether such a stylised or typical upswing will actually materialise this time round. Hence, it would be premature to regard the financial crisis, and the economic crisis directly linked to it, as having already run their course. Clearly, a protracted period of stagnation in the major economies would pose a substantial risk to financial stability. The detrimental, self-reinforcing feedback loop between an unprecedented and globally synchronous reduction in the level of real economic activity and an essentially dysfunctional financial system, which has been unravelling since the summer of this year, might then tighten again. It follows from this that exiting the broad-based stabilisation policies should be predicated on and calibrated to a sustained improvement in the underlying market conditions as well as in financial sector resilience.  
2 BIS Review 164/2009 At the same time, it is important to bear in mind the implications which the highly unorthodox measures taken to support and stimulate the economy inevitably entail. They inherently carry considerable risks over the medium and long term. A prime example of such risks is ballooning government debt in many industrial countries. In addition to already acknowledged, explicit public debt, the bank rescue packages obviously impose an additional, implicit potential burden on the public sector. Transparent and credible strategies are therefore crucial for unwinding and managing the fiscal – and, of course, monetary – policy support measures. Should the policy-making process lose its credibility, this would be reflected in rising risk premiums and interest rates. Higher interest rates, in turn, would tend to depress capital expenditure and, therefore, potential growth. In addition, they would further hamper the already onerous task of consolidating public finances, which is vital to ensure sustainable debt containment. It is therefore crucial to keep market participants’ expectations of a stability-focused monetary policy as well as a sound fiscal policy firmly anchored.  II Ongoing challenges The government and other public support measures have bought the financial system time to cope with losses and to prepare for potential financial strains lurking on the horizon. Moreover, public-sector intervention has had a decisively positive impact on the outlook for earnings. Short-term interest rates are at very low levels indeed. The yield curve, ie the spread between long-term and short-term rates, is exceptionally steep. This naturally allows substantial income to be generated from maturity transformation (see Chart 1). Income from commissions and fees has also soared recently, partly on the back of the large-scale issuance of government bonds which the public sector has been obliged to launch in response to the financial crisis. Income from commissions and fees is being further boosted by vigorous corporate issuance activity. This has also begun to boost equity and credit markets since the spring of 2009, thus improving banks’ earnings form brokering and proprietary trading. Nonetheless, this development is fragile. It is being buoyed by the non-standard public sector support packages which – being extra-ordinary – have to be phased out at some point. Quite clearly, the current conjuncture does not represent a new post-crisis normality. Yet this by no means implies that German banks have not recognised the seriousness of the situation. They have consolidated their balance sheets and also bolstered their capital buffers (see Chart 2). For instance, the average tier 1 capital ratio rose by 2.4 percentage points between mid-2007 and mid-2009. Another positive aspect is that, by international standards, Germany is in a comparatively favourable starting position for weathering the financial crisis. For one thing, domestic enterprises and households have relatively moderate levels of debt. Consequently, the percentage of non-performing loans is correspondingly low. For another, real estate prices in Germany have been flat for a long time, and have thus in no way decoupled from fundamentals. Obviously, this is limiting credit risk in property financing.  Nonetheless, even in case a lasting economic recovery is underway, German banks will have to tackle some sizeable problems. For instance, their balance sheets will have to accommodate substantial further value adjustments. Based on our empirical assessment, for the 17 banks mostly involved, with some €90 billion of impairments already recognised, the peak of write-downs on securitisations is behind them. Given current prospects, additional write-downs on structured products of some €10 billion to €15 billion are to be expected (see Charts 3 and 4). If, however, the price recovery in evidence since mid-2009 continues, losses in the overall portfolio will be lower. The outlook for the evolution of assets in the loan book is, however, quite different. Here, the well-established stylised fact is that write-downs lag the real economy’s cycle This also holds in the current situation. Loan losses will be a drag on banks’ earnings going forward. Using the information from a time series as well as a cross-section dimension for the whole German banking system, we conclude that further write-downs of between €50 billion and 
BIS Review 164/2009 3 €75 billion are to be expected. It goes without saying that, particularly at this juncture, these estimates (see Charts 5 and 6) are subject to significant uncertainty. Statistical relations are likely to be less robust than they have typically been in the past. We should add that our assumption for economic growth is significantly less benign than the current consensus. Therefore, if the economic recovery accelerates, as assumed in recent forecasts, banks’ re-valuation requirements would be correspondingly lower. Needless to add, the projected potential write-downs will not automatically translate into additional capital requirements. Current income as well as loan-loss provisions can obviously also be used to cover potential losses. Nevertheless, banks would be well advised to steel themselves against possible negative developments. They have won time to tackle their accumulated problems and prepare for future contingencies. They should use the capacity to adjust that has been created, first and foremost, to bolster their risk provisioning, shore up their capital and enhance their cost efficiency. Currently, the low level of lending largely reflects German enterprises’ weak demand for credit, hence access to credit is currently not impaired by capital scarcity. But looking ahead, fatter capital cushions would strengthen banks’ capacity to cater to the rising corporate borrowing demand which typically accompanies an upswing. At the same time, the pricing of this credit supply should be commensurate with the underlying risks.  III Macroprudential approach – a new focus for supervisors and regulators After having successfully stabilised the financial system, governments, central banks and prudential supervisory authorities around the world now face the challenge of drawing the appropriate conclusions to prevent a crisis of such a magnitude from recurring. By its nature, financial stability is a public good. It cannot therefore be ensured solely on a private basis. There is a significant difference between private and social rationality. Actions that are reasonable from an individual perspective may generate unintended externalities which produce adverse implications for systemic stability. Consequently, financial stability cannot be expected to arise spontaneously from the interactions of private players. At the same time, the absence of financial stability may well entail enormous costs to society – as we have just painfully experienced. Therefore, together with national and international institutions, we are working hard to draw the right lessons in order to contain potential vulnerabilities. As the reasons for the crisis are multifaceted and complex, there are no simple answers or quick fixes. What is needed, rather, is a set of specific changes and concrete amendments to the regulatory and supervisory framework. Thoroughness has to take priority over speed.  One key insight gained from – or perhaps it is more accurate to say reaffirmed by – the crisis is that the traditional microprudential perspective, focusing largely on individual institutions only, is no longer appropriate. To address financial stability issues appropriately the microprudential approach has to be supplemented by macroprudential supervision. Naturally, microeconomic supervision remains indispensable. It is, however, far from adequate for the effective prevention of crises which are the upshot of systemic stress. A failure to take a holistic, system-wide view logically implies a danger of ignoring systemic risks that emanate from the interaction of the financial market players. Systemic risk is created endogenously rather than having exogenous origins beyond the remit of financial markets. It can arise, for example, in the form of herding behaviour. Systemic stress may also result from excessive homogeneity, which generally renders systems vulnerable. Liquidity risk is a special and important case in point. Here, feedback effects – between difficult funding conditions and problematic market liquidity – may bring about a systemic downward spiral. In particular, repo markets will be affected most severely. The systemic perspective therefore has a particular relevance for market-oriented financial systems (as opposed to those characterised by a higher degree of bank intermediation). The design of macroprudential supervision and regulation hence raises a host of complex issues. Procyclical elements of regulation – whether they relate to capital requirements or 
4 BIS Review 164/2009 accounting principles – may, for instance, aggravate the inherent ups and downs of the financial system. If the impact of these regulations in an upturn is different from their impact in a downturn, this will have an immediate effect on the real economy. Such generators of procyclicality may, for example, favour a build-up of credit-financed imbalances in an upturn. In the same vein, these mechanisms might also potentially amplify feedback effects of negative market developments during a crisis. To contain these destabilising effects, greater importance should be attached in future to adequate and, in particular, counter-cyclical risk buffers. A second challenge arises from the interconnectedness of the financial system. This is obviously a necessary feature of any modern financial system. But this interdependence entails consequences – macroeconomic costs which cannot be accounted for at the microeconomic level. These systemic externalities increase as institutions become larger and more interconnected. The macroprudential perspective therefore provides arguments for treating financial intermediaries differently according to their position in the system as a whole. This functional view also justifies regulating market participants outside the traditional banking system identically insofar as they fulfil similar functions or roles. The appropriate regulation and supervision of big or highly interconnected institutions poses a particular difficulty as their collapse would jeopardise the financial system as a whole (“too big or too interconnected to fail” problem). A logical corollary of this is the need for a greater intensity of supervision. Moreover, additional capital requirements make sound analytical sense. Yet it should be noted that the practical implementation of these theoretically advisable ideas involves some difficulties as does, incidentally, formulating anticyclical capital requirements. However, this must not lead to the issue being ignored, as the potential opportunity costs to society would be too grave. It is clear from these brief comments that adding a macroprudential perspective to microprudential oversight poses major challenges for central banks and supervisory authorities. The Bundesbank is seeking to face these challenges by devoting particular attention to macroprudential analysis. Since May 2009, all work on these issues has been focused within our newly created Financial Stability Department. This department was also mandated to write this year’s Financial Stability Review. Getting macroprudential supervision right is indeed very much a work in progress. We are in the middle of a period of intense debate. Nevertheless, concrete progress has already been achieved in some areas. In this regard, the reform agenda which is being implemented through the G20 summit process, largely under the guidance of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), deserves special mention. Given significant mutual interdependence as well as substantial cross-border effects, there is good reason to establish rules at the international level. Inconsistencies encourage regulatory arbitrage and thus tend to heighten systemic vulnerability. Therefore, the Bundesbank is very much involved in the work of the FSB. I would like to restrict myself to highlighting just two aspects which enjoy a very broad consensus in the international debate.  First, there is consensus on one of the points mentioned earlier, namely the need to strengthen financial institutions’ resilience; the capital and liquidity buffers for weathering crises have to be increased. More robust capital and liquidity requirements as well as an improved measurement of exposures to risks are also necessary so that risks arising from excessive leverage can be better controlled in the future. Due account should be taken when devising and implementing rules of the particularities and peculiarities of national financial systems. This is especially important with regard to the aspired improvement in the quality of banks’ capital base. Here it is essential to focus on the targeted function – the ability to absorb losses – rather than on legal form. In view of the ongoing difficult economic environment, it is also evident that appropriate transition periods have to be granted. Overhasty implementation would pave the way for a likely capital-induced credit supply failure. 
BIS Review 164/2009 5 Second, we must ensure that the incentive structures of participants in the financial system are aligned with the objective of fostering a sustainable development. This will be facilitated by enhanced transparency, which strengthens market discipline, even though it is obviously not sufficient on its own. This applies especially to the securitisation process. Significantly improved standards of quality and integrity are a key precondition for reviving the securitisation market. Originators should have a direct interest in ensuring that all risks (including those of correlated defaults) are captured adequately – for instance by retaining a vertical slice of securitisations. Provided the instruments are designed in a way which makes microeconomic risk-taking compatible with sound macroeconomic outcomes, they can play an effective role as a source of funding for the banking sector. They will thereby also contribute to reliable and properly priced lending to enterprises – which is the most important aspect from an economic perspective. In a nutshell, the internationally coordinated reforms should substantially increase the stability of the financial system. On balance, they will probably imply more moderate earnings prospects in the financial sector. However, earnings are also likely to be less volatile and therefore more robust. Given the considerable negative externalities that may arise if financial institutions run into distress, that seems a price worth paying to safeguard financial stability. After all, in the long run banks themselves will also benefit from a more stable financial system.  Chart 1

BIS Review 163/2009 1 Duvvuri Subbarao: Financial inclusion – challenges and opportunities  Remarks by Dr Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Bankers’ Club, Kolkata, 9 December 2009. *      *      * 1. Being in Kolkata, this city of joy, is always a heart warming experience. Being here in the pre-Christmas season is a particular delight, and for me personally, a nostalgic memory. My special thanks to the Bankers’ Club for inviting me to speak here this evening. I recall our meeting at this Club last year when we were in the thick of the deepest financial crisis of our time, and all of us were anxious and uncertain about the immediate future. I believe the worst is behind us. Attention around the world and here in India too is shifting from managing the crisis to managing the recovery. As that happens, we are also returning to addressing our enduring challenges – of lifting nearly half a billion people out of poverty. There are many things we need to do to accomplish that gigantic task. One of them is financial inclusion. I would like to focus my comments this evening on the challenges and opportunities of financial inclusion.  Financial inclusion – a thousand flowers blooming 2. If you will, let me begin with a couple anecdotes. In rural Maharashtra, where people, like everywhere else in the country, face the daily challenges of water, sanitation, electricity and transportation, a number of women have improved their lives, and the lives of their families, by becoming entrepreneurs, all because they could take a bank loan. • Take Aruna Gaikwad. Aruna, a farm labourer, began selling excess produce at the local market. An astute observer of the laws of supply and demand when it came to pricing fruit and vegetables, she soon saw an uptick in business. To expand, she needed to borrow money so that she could build her own vegetable stand. The loan helped her establish a thriving vegetable vending business, allowing her to shift away from the back-breaking work tending other people’s fields. Her former hand-to-mouth existence had given way to a new reality, one which includes savings and checking accounts at the bank, and the credit needed to keep her kids in school – a good fortune she herself never had. • And then there is Lakshmi Shellar. Widowed at 17, Lakshmi helped form a local self-help group. She spoke up and spoke out at meetings, and inspired other women in the group to take their future into their own hands. Meanwhile, she brought banking services to them. And she provided evening literacy classes. The 177 women of Lakshmi’s self-help group have all borrowed and repaid their loans. 3. Aruna and Lakshmi are just two of the millions of women across the country who have demonstrated what is possible if only rural women can have access to basic financial services. This is what financial inclusion is all about – giving people an opportunity to build better lives for themselves and their children. That impulse, if given a chance, can contribute to sustained improvements in the quality of life at the community level and foster growth and poverty reduction at the national level.  4. But there remain tremendous barriers to unleashing this “fortune at the bottom of the pyramid.” Chief among them: financial exclusion. This is a confluence of multiple barriers: lack of access, lack of physical and social infrastructure, lack of understanding and knowledge, lack of technology; lack of support, lack of confidence, among others. Overcoming these barriers is, in a nutshell, the challenge of financial inclusion. 
2 163/2009 Why is financial inclusion important? 5. Why is financial inclusion important? It is important simply because it is a necessary condition for sustaining equitable growth. There are few, if any, instances of an economy transiting from an agrarian system to a post-industrial modern society without broad-based financial inclusion. As people having comfortable access to financial services, we all know from personal experience that economic opportunity is strongly intertwined with financial access. Such access is especially powerful for the poor as it provides them opportunities to build savings, make investments and avail credit. Importantly, access to financial services also helps the poor insure themselves against income shocks and equips them to meet emergencies such as illness, death in the family or loss of employment. Needless to add, financial inclusion protects the poor from the clutches of the usurious money lenders. 6. There is another benefit of financial inclusion which we have yet to fully appreciate let alone exploit. Financial inclusion will make it possible for governments to make payment such as social security transfers, National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (NREGA) wages into the bank accounts of beneficiaries through the “Electric Benefit Transfer” (EBT) method. This will minimize transaction costs including leakages. In parts of the country where such EBT has already taken off, the results are impressive and the experience of both payers and recipients extremely satisfying. 7. There are enormous benefits at the aggregate level too. The first and more obvious benefit is that financial inclusion provides an avenue for bringing the savings of the poor into the formal financial intermediation system and channel them into investment. Second, the large number of low cost deposits will offer banks an opportunity to reduce their dependence on bulk deposits and help them to better manage both liquidity risks and asset-liability mismatches. Financial exclusion – the big picture 8. Effort at financial inclusion is not new; both the Government and the Reserve Bank have been pursuing this goal over the last several decades through building the rural cooperative structure in the 1950s, the social contract with banks in the 1960s and the expansion of bank branch networks in the 1970s and 1980s. These initiatives have paid off in terms of a network of branches across the country. 9. Yet the extent of financial exclusion is staggering. Out of the 600,000 habitations in the country, only about 30,000 have a commercial bank branch. Just about 40 per cent of the population across the country have bank accounts, and this ratio is much lower in the north-east of the country. The proportion of people having any kind of life insurance cover is as low as 10 per cent and proportion having non-life insurance is an abysmally low 0.6 per cent. People having debit cards comprise only 13 per cent and those having credit cards only a marginal 2 per cent. 10. The National Sample Survey data reveals that, in 2003, out of the 89.3 million farmer households in the country, 51 percent did not seek credit from either institutional or non-institutional sources of any kind. 11. These statistics, staggering as they are, do not convey the true extent of financial exclusion. Even where bank accounts are claimed to have been opened, verification has shown that these account are dormant. Few conduct any banking transactions and even fewer receive any credit. Millions of people across the country are thereby denied the opportunity to harness their earning capacity and entrepreneurial talent, and are condemned to marginalization and poverty. 12. But there is a brighter side to the story. Remember that illustration they give in business strategy courses. A business executive of a shoe company was sent to a large developing country to assess the market potential there. What he saw was millions of people 
BIS Review 163/2009 3 going without shoes. He came back and reported to the management that there was no business potential there because no one wears shoes. A few months later, a strategist of a rival company went and saw the same picture. He came back and reported to his management that there is tremendous business potential in that country because of the number of shoes they can sell. Ultimately, it is a question of mindset. 13. Banks must see the picture like the second business strategist, look at the opportunity at the bottom of the pyramid and move into financial inclusion in a big way. RBI’s efforts 14. Let me briefly outline the efforts pursued by the Reserve Bank to further financial inclusion. Our approach to financial inclusion aims at “connecting people” with the banking system and not just opening accounts. This includes meeting the small credit needs of the people, giving them access to the payments system and providing remittance facilities. This has led to some notable developments: (i) No frills accounts: In November 2005, RBI asked banks to offer a basic banking “no-frills” account with low or zero minimum balances and minimum charges to expand the outreach of such accounts to the low income groups. (ii) Easier credit facility: Banks were asked to introduce a General Purpose Credit Card (GCC) facility up to Rs. 25,000. However, total number of GCCs issued by banks as at end-March, 2009 was only 0.15 million. (iii) Simpler KYC norms: In order to ensure that people belonging to the low income groups, both in urban and rural areas, do not encounter difficulties in opening bank accounts, the “Know Your Customer” (KYC) procedure for opening accounts was simplified for those accounts with balances not exceeding Rs 50,000 and credits thereto not exceeding Rs 100,000 in a year. (iv) Use of information technology: Banks have been urged to scale up IT initiatives for financial inclusion speedily while ensuring that solutions are highly secure, amenable to audit, and follow widely-accepted open standards to ensure eventual inter-operability among the different systems. Two of the important initiatives are:  • Smart cards for opening bank accounts with biometric identification. These help the customers get banking services near their doorstep. • Link to mobile hand held electronic devices for banking transactions. In October 2008, the RBI advised banks on issues relating to technology, security standards, and customer protection.  (v) EBT through banks: The Reserve Bank is in consultation with state governments to encourage them to adopt Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) by banks. (vi) 100% financial inclusion drive: The Reserve Bank launched a financial inclusion drive targeting one district in each state for 100% financial inclusion. In the light of the experience gained, coverage has been extended to other areas/districts. We carried out an external evaluation of the quality of 100% financial inclusion reported by banks. On that basis, in January 2009, we advised banks to: (i) ensure provision of banking services nearer to the location of the no-frills account holders through a variety of channels; (ii) provide GCC/small overdrafts along with no-frills accounts to encourage the account holders to actively operate the accounts; (iii) conduct awareness drives of the facilities offered to the no-frills account holders; (iv) review the extent of coverage in districts declared as 100 per cent financially included; and (v) efficiently leverage on the available technology enabled financial inclusion solutions. 
4 163/2009 Business correspondent model 15. Possibly the most important initiative of the Reserve Bank has been the Business Correspondent (BC) model. The BC model ensures a closer relationship between poor people and the organized financial system. Recognizing this, in 2006, we permitted banks to use the services of non-governmental organizations, micro-finance institutions, retired bank employees, ex-servicemen, retired government employees, Section 25 companies, and other civil society organisations as Business Correspondents in providing financial and banking services.  16. Even as the BC model has taken off, it needs to be fine tuned and monitored appropriately to improve its efficacy, including by better training BCs. Recently, we have further enlarged the scope of the BC model by permitting banks to appoint individual kirana/medical/fair price shop owners, individual Public Call Office (PCO) operators, agents of Small Savings schemes and insurance companies, individuals who own petrol pumps, retired teachers and self-help groups linked to banks as BCs. With a view to ensuring the viability of the BC model, banks have also been permitted to collect reasonable service charges from the customer in a transparent manner. Going forward, the Reserve Bank will endeavour to give complete flexibility to banks to appoint BCs with only a negative list of entities that would not be eligible. Bank branch and ATM expansion liberalized 17. Last year, the Reserve Bank totally freed location of ATMs from prior authorization. In the October 2009 Policy Review, the RBI took a further big step by freeing branch opening in towns and villages with population below 50,000. Domestic scheduled commercial banks (other than RRBs) are now free to open branches in towns and villages with less than 50,000 population and are enjoined to ensure that at least one-third of such branch expansion happens in the underbanked districts of underbanked states. This will be one of the criteria in the Reserve Bank’s consideration of proposals by banks to open branches in major city (tier 1 and tier 2) centres. Expansion of banks in the north-east 18. To improve banking penetration in the north-east, the Reserve Bank asked the State Governments and banks to identify centres where there is a need for setting up either full fledged branches or those offering forex facilities, handling government business or for meeting currency requirements. We have also offered to fund the capital and running costs for five years provided the State Government concerned is willing to make available the premises and put in place appropriate security arrangements. Meghalaya has been the first off the block, and eight centres have been allotted to three public sector banks, following a bidding process. The Reserve Bank is working with other states in the north-east to institute similar arrangements. Project financial literacy 19. Let me say a few words on the Reserve Bank’s drive for financial literacy. Financial literacy is a stepping-stone toward financial inclusion. Moreover, as financial markets are becoming increasingly complex with serious problems of information asymmetry, the need for financial literacy has become even more acute. The Reserve Bank has initiated a “Project Financial Literacy” with the objective of disseminating information regarding the central bank and general banking concepts to various target groups. Our website is also available in 13 languages. 20. Our “Financial Education” web site link offers basics of banking, finance and central banking for children of all ages. In a comic book format, we simplify the complexities of 
BIS Review 163/2009 5 banking, finance and central banking, with the goal of making the learning fun and interesting. Financial literacy and credit counselling 21. We have advised the convenor-bank of each State Level Bankers’ Committee to set up a financial literacy-cum-counselling centre in any one district on a pilot basis, and based on that experience, to extend the facility to other districts in due course. So far, 154 credit counselling centres have been set up in various states of the country. These centres are expected to provide free financial education to people in rural and urban areas on the various financial products and services, while maintaining an arm’s-length relationship with the parent bank. Financial curriculum in schools and colleges 22. The Reserve Bank is furthering the financial literacy drive by collaborating with state governments across the country to include financial literacy curriculum in the school syllabus. We have launched a pilot in Karnataka. We gave material on banking, personal finance as well as on the Reserve Bank to the State Government. The Karnataka Government has adapted, translated and included much of this material in the curriculum for high school classes and this is slated to go on stream next academic year starting June 2010. Based on this experience, we want to mainstream this initiative across the country. Financial inclusion – challenges and opportunities 23. Let me now turn to challenges to financial inclusion and the potential opportunities. The question we should ask ourselves is this: despite the rural policy-push, why are so many bankable people unbanked? There are barriers to access financial services emanating from both demand side and supply side factors. 24. From the demand side, the big barriers are the lack of awareness about financial services and products, limited literacy, especially financial literacy of the populace, and social exclusion. Many of the generic financial products are unsuitable for the poor and there is not much of an effort to design products suitable to their needs. The unfriendly and unempathetic attitude of the banks to the customers also plays an important role in undermining the demand for financial services. On top of that, exorbitant and oftentimes non-transparent fees, combined with burdensome terms and conditions attached to the financial products, also dampens the demand. 25. From the supply side, the main barrier is the transaction costs that the bankers perceive. Because of current low volumes, banks find that extending financial services is not cost effective. Furthermore, lack of communication, lack of infrastructure, language barriers and low literacy levels all raise the cost of providing services and inhibit bankers from taking initiative from the supply side. 26. A couple of weeks ago, the Reserve Bank, in collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group, organized a workshop on financial inclusion in our College of Agricultural Banking in Pune. The express purpose of the workshop was to listen to frontline managers operating in the field about the opportunities and challenges to financial inclusion. Accordingly, we invited to the workshop, bank branch managers, including from rural areas, and representatives of microfinance institutions and some NGOs. The chairmen of some large public sector and private banks were also present. 27. I must say that listening to the participants at the workshop was an enormously rich learning experience. The big take away from that workshop, for the Reserve Bank as an institution and for me personally, was that even as there are problems to extending financial 
6 163/2009 inclusion, these are not insurmountable. If the Reserve Bank and the commercial banks put their minds, and more importantly their hearts, together these problems can be resolved. 28. According to what we heard at the workshop, the three big challenges are: (i) cost; (ii) lack of robust technology; and (iii) lack of awareness. Some of these challenges are clearly being exaggerated and others can be easily redressed. 29. Cost, of course, is the main consideration. It is nobody’s case that each of the over 500,000 villages in the country can each be covered through a brick and mortar branch. That is clearly not a “bankable” proposition. We need to go through the low cost Business Correspondent model and leverage technology to deliver financial services. 30. The Reserve Bank has encouraged banks to use IT-enabled financial inclusion by leveraging on the smart cards/mobile technology. Business Correspondents of banks are making extensive use of hand held devices/mobile phones to reach banking services to remote villages, and especially for Electronic Benefits Transfer of NREGA wages and social security payments. This has been very successful in Andhra Pradesh, and a state-wide project has recently been kicked-off in Orissa. In addition, pilot projects are underway in most states of the country. 31. As a village-to-village robust electronic remittance system is presently not available in the country, it can be enabled by building suitable infrastructure to connect the systems of various banks which are presently involved in Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) through the medium of Business Correspondents. A robust switch similar to the National Financial Switch (NFS) located for the purpose in the National payments Corporation of India/Institute for Development Research in Banking Technology may fulfil a long felt requirement of a nationwide remittance system for the country. This will make the remittance system more efficient, and therefore, more attractive. 32. I also want to emphasize that there is tremendous opportunity on the way forward for reducing costs by increasing volumes. Let me elaborate a bit. First, there is the demographic profile – the labour force in the 15–64 age group is going to increase. As job opportunities grow and these people start earning, their incomes provide a large and growing source of deposits for banks. Banks that are ahead of the curve in establishing a presence in the vast hinterland of the country will have a first mover advantage in exploiting this potentially huge opportunity. Second, there is the opportunity of capturing remittances. Although there are no firm figures, I have been told that thousands of crores of rupees of remittances take place across the country today, predominantly from migrant labour, and over ninety per cent of this happens through non-formal channels. If banks can capture even half of this into their fold, they will not only reduce costs for the labour making remittances but they will also have the advantage of an enormous, permanent float. 33. Third, EBT, the electronic benefit transfer, is another big opportunity. I believe banks are inhibited about pushing this forward because of the fear of the unknown: they are not certain that the business can be cost-effective. Banks are clearly underestimating the potential. If indeed, all or even most government payments to rural people are captured through the EBT mode, this again can give banks a large float and make it an attractive business proposition. So far there has been a sharing of the costs between banks and state governments with regard to EBT. As EBT mode expands and becomes universal, banks will find that this is a viable business model even without any service charges. 34. It is also relevant here to acknowledge the potential of the Unique Identification Number (UID) that Nandan Nilekani and his team are working on. The UID will be a powerful instrumentality for helping poor people establish their identity to meet the banks’ KYC norms. I believe, this is going to reduce cash and non-cash transaction costs both to the banks and to the potential customers. The UID is another powerful illustration of harnessing technology to the benefit of the poor. 
BIS Review 163/2009 7 35. The Reserve Bank has made a commitment to bank-led model of financial inclusion and will support banks in their financial inclusion initiatives by way of information dissemination, sharing of best practices and also through regulatory incentives. However, I want to add that our commitment to a bank led model is not irrevocable. There are other models of financial inclusion that are being experimented elsewhere in the world. Should banks fail to come forward and exploit this opportunity of financial inclusion, the Reserve Bank will not hesitate to explore other models of furthering financial inclusion. 36. A word also to microfinance institutions (MFIs). Many banks have partnered with microfinance institutions that provide financial services to relatively high risk segments of the population. Microfinance has provided access to finance to an entire sector of people left behind by the formal financial sector – and micro finance has demonstrated how these low-income categories are indeed a “bankable” proposition. But cost remains an issue. Interest rate charges – at 24–30 percent – seem too high. Compared to the informal sector, perhaps the rates are lower, but there are questions about whether these rates are affordable. Ideally, the rate of interest charged should not be out of alignment with the cost of funds, transaction costs, risk costs and a certain margin, and in any case, there is a need for transparency in its determination and fairness in its application. Way forward 37. On the way forward, the Reserve Bank will push three targets. First, the lead bank in each district has been asked to draw a roadmap by March 2010 for ensuring that all villages with a population of over 2,000 will have access to financial services through a banking outlet, not necessarily a bank branch, by March 2011. As an aside, let me also tell you that many consumer goods companies have unveiled specific strategies that target villages with a population of less than 5,000 as micro-markets. It seems to me that as bankers, you can also follow your clients to their markets. Second, all commercial banks – public sector banks, private banks and foreign banks – are going to be asked to come up with their specific Board approved plans for financial inclusion by March 2010. These plans are intended to be rolled out over the next three years. We, in the Reserve Bank, have refrained from deliberately imposing a uniform model on the banks because we wanted each bank to build its own strategy in line with its business model and comparative advantage. This will hopefully ensure better ownership. The Reserve Bank is consulting the Indian Banks Association in this regard. Third, we learnt from the frontline managers in the Pune workshop that top managements of banks do not sufficiently emphasize, much less reward, efforts at financial inclusion. To remedy this, we are going to ask all banks to include criteria on financial inclusion in the performance evaluation of their field staff. 38. The Reserve Bank values two-way communication. By listening, we learn to appreciate people’s needs and aspirations. This pushes us to be more sensitive, innovative and responsive. One of our initiatives in our Platinum Jubilee year is reaching out to remote villages – with a focus on financial education – spreading awareness about the economy, emphasizing the role the Reserve Bank plays in everyday life and making the general public aware of the financial services that the banks offer and the benefits of using the banking services. The outreach programme is a simultaneous effort to educate low income groups to demand financial services and to encourage banks to supply financial services needed by the poor. I must say that experience to date from the outreach programme has been immensely rewarding and fulfilling. I want to thank the commercial banks which are actively cooperating with us in this outreach programme. 39. Last week, I visited Jalanga village in Orissa as part of the outreach programme. I was very impressed by the self-help groups – groups of usually women who get together, pool their savings and give loans to members – and how these groups have empowered the women by giving them financial independence and thereby confidence. More than just hope, 
8 163/2009 these women have the vision to imagine how they can take advantage of the slightest opportunities and to work hard to make it happen. Conclusion 40. Let me conclude by reiterating, even at the cost of being clichéd, that banking on the poor can actually be a rich banking proposition. Financial inclusion is a win-win opportunity for the poor, for the banks and for the nation. Because of growing incomes, and improving awareness levels, aspirations of the poor are on the rise. We will not be forgiven if we do not rise up to meet these aspirations if only because of poverty of imagination. It is for the banks to convert what they see as a dead-weight obligation into an exciting opportunity and move on aggressively on financial inclusion. 
BIS Review 163/2009 1 Jan F Qvigstad: Could the financial crisis have been avoided? Challenges to international cooperation and conflict Speech by Mr Jan F Qvigstad, Deputy Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at a seminar on the financial crisis arranged by Prio, Oslo, 8 December 2009. *      *      * What happened? Confidence between financial market participants collapsed in September last year following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The price of credit jumped up both in money and bond markets. Equity prices declined, increasing the cost of raising new equity capital.  The authorities worldwide responded by supplying substantial liquidity to banks and central bank key rates were reduced. In many countries, the authorities provided extraordinary loans or took over banks to maintain confidence in institutions and market activity. In some countries, the authorities have purchased securities to bring down long-term interest rates. Stimulus has also been provided through increased public sector demand and government budget deficits have grown to unprecedented levels in some countries.  The reaction of households and businesses was to increase saving and private sector demand declined. Credit standards were tightened and risk premiums soared. The drop in demand rapidly translated into a contraction in trade and output. In spring 2009, world trade was around 20 per cent below the level prevailing one year earlier. In many countries, the total value of goods and services production (GDP) declined over several consecutive quarters. Countries that were heavily reliant on exports of manufactured goods were particularly hard hit. Unemployment has increased sharply in countries not far from our own. Given the high levels of available resources, there are prospects of lower than normal interest rates among our main trading partners for some time ahead.  There are now signs that the stimulus measures are reviving growth, but production is still lower than it was prior to the crisis. The challenge going forward will be to address the problem of rising unemployment and high government debt in many countries.  Why did it happen? When the Queen of England visited the London School of Economics in November last year, she asked her host why no one had foreseen the financial crisis. In July this year, her question was answered by a panel of 33 prominent economists from British universities, government institutions and the business sector. The panel did not cite only a single cause, but a web of causation.  An important factor behind the crisis can be found in global macroeconomic developments in the years preceding the crisis. In the 2000s, China made its grand entry into global trade with an attendant surge in production and income. This led to higher demand for inputs, and the prices of oil and other raw materials increased. On the other hand, global consumer price growth was pulled down by exports of cheap goods from China and other countries with low production costs. Interest rates were lowered in many countries to prevent very low inflation or deflation. In China, a large share of income was saved, either in the form of investment in new production equipment or financial assets. The increased supply of financial savings pushed down global long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates encouraged consumers and businesses in other countries to borrow capital from China and other surplus countries. The foreign debt of countries such as the US and UK accumulated rapidly in the years leading up to the crisis.  
2 163/2009 Historically low interest rates prompted fund managers in Western countries to seek out new alternatives in their search for high yields. New financial savings products were developed and spread to investors around the world. It was often difficult, or even impossible, for investors to value the risk underlying the products.  Yield potentials can also be increased by leveraging securities purchases. As long as prices rise, the return on equity will increase with the degree of leveraging. On the other hand, the risk of being left with debt, and little or no equity capital, increases when prices fall. In the years ahead of the crisis, high debt leveraging still appeared to be an attractive proposition in an environment of low credit risk and a glut of cheap credit. The result was a surge in debt accumulation in the years preceding the crisis. Prices in securities and property markets soared. The build-up of macroeconomic imbalances in the years prior to the crisis increased vulnerabilities and the potential amplitude of a downswing. Many observers warned of the risks associated with these developments but no one foresaw how the crisis would unfold, when it would erupt, or its severity.  The global financial crisis has revealed weaknesses in the financial system. In retrospect, it is clear that financial sector regulation was not adequate. Regulation was primarily designed to ensure that individual banks had sufficient equity capital to protect lenders and depositors against losses, rather than ensuring stability in the system as a whole. For example, there were no requirements stipulating the size of liquid assets a bank must hold to weather periods of failure in market funding. Nor were there any minimum requirements as to funding stability. An example of the importance of these conditions is the collapse of the British bank Northern Rock in September 2007. The bank had a residential mortgage portfolio that was not particularly exposed to risk. The bank had, however, expanded rapidly over several years, an expansion that was partly based on short-term market funding. When funding markets failed, the bank promptly encountered liquidity problems and was compelled to turn to the Bank of England for support. When it became known that the bank had sought government support, depositors quickly lost confidence and the UK experienced its first bank run since 1866. Many other banks that were considered to be solid under the applicable regulation also encountered problems when financial market confidence evaporated.  Something worked: the IMF, G20 and WTO  The IMF is an organisation for international cooperation based on a system of mutual assistance among member countries. The IMF provides loans to countries experiencing balance of payments problems. The loans are financed by member countries. If the problems stem from economic policy mismanagement, the loan will be subject to specific requirements such as measures to correct policy.  When the crisis occurred, the IMF reacted swiftly to accommodate the increased need for IMF services. The IMF’s role as lender and interlocutor with the authorities in crisis-hit countries probably helped to limit the crisis. The IMF provided support and assistance to countries that were directly affected by the crisis and countries that were innocent bystanders. The sharp increase in IMF lending reduced the financial resources of the organization. Member countries have now increased their contributions to the IMF.  During the financial crisis, the G20 has played a prominent role in the international coordination of economic policy. The group launched several important initiatives during the crisis, which were subsequently placed under the responsibility of the IMF. All countries stand to benefit from the establishment of international meeting places that the major economies consider to be of interest. However, unlike the IMF, the G20 is not a representative body for all countries. Even if the G20 account for a large share of global output, most countries are not included, such as low-income countries and regions like most of Africa, the Middle East and the Nordic countries. One possibility is to develop the G20 based on the IMF model where countries are represented through constituencies. Small 
BIS Review 163/2009 3 countries like Norway, or at least the Nordic countries, could then be represented in a forum for discussion of the policies of major economies.  In the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s, protectionist measures were introduced in many countries. Customs duties were increased to shield domestic industry. As a result, world trade continued its decline over several years. So far, protectionist policies have been avoided in the wake of the latest crisis, which makes it possible to reverse the sharp contraction in world trade more rapidly and hence reinvigorate economic growth. One reason why the mistakes of the 1930s have not been repeated this time may be that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) was established in the interim. International trade agreements concluded under the auspices of the WTO contribute to binding national governments and prevent protectionist measures. By and large, this has worked well during the recent crisis.  Could the crisis have been avoided? The macroeconomic forces that were unleashed in the years leading up to the financial crisis were strong. It is unlikely that a single country could have stemmed the tide. China’s participation in international trade in goods added several hundred million persons to the global workforce over a few years. This increased the room for strong, non-inflationary global growth. China was not prepared, however, to liberalise its capital markets fully. The Chinese government was not willing to allow its currency to float freely and the exchange rate against the US dollar was managed. This disabled an important stabiliser and contributed increasing world trade imbalances. Long-term interest rates remained low in spite of substantial monetary policy tightening in the US between 2004 and 2006. International organisations such as the BIS, OECD, IMF and others noted on more than one occasion that growing imbalances in the world economy were a source of concern. But economic policy decisions are the prerogative of national governments. Given the policy pursued by China, there were probably limits to what monetary policy in Western countries could in reality achieve in terms of rolling back these forces. Increased private saving in the US and other deficit countries would probably have required monetary policy tightening sufficient to push up long-term interest rates. Alternatively, a substantial increase in public sector saving would have been necessary. Both alternatives would probably have led to an economic policy driven downturn. It is demanding to pursue such a policy based on the proposition that a crisis might occur in the future.  Improved financial regulation would probably have reduced the severity of the financial crisis. Regulation and insurance have similar features: in most cases an annual premium must be paid in the form of slightly lower growth. This occurs because capital is not allowed to flow entirely freely to the highest yielding vehicles. In return, regulation can counter the build-up of financial imbalances. This reduces the probability that a negative event will trigger a severe financial crisis.  It is not optimal to be fully insured against crises because the insurance premium would be too high. But the financial crisis demonstrated that the imbalances ahead of the crisis were unsustainable and that they could have been reduced through regulatory improvements. The reason that this did not occur may be that the risk had taken on the form of several interwoven imbalances that no single authority had the power to correct.  Banking and financial market regulation will be enhanced in Norway and abroad. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), as mandated by the G20, will soon issue recommendations for strengthening regulation of banks’ capital and liquidity management. In the UK, the regulatory authorities have already drawn up new banking regulation. A natural consequence of the financial crisis is that increased weight is given to ensuring system-wide stability and not only the stability of individual banks. Other important questions are whether systemically important banks should be subject to tighter regulation and how to reduce the procyclicality of bank behaviour.  
4 163/2009 Recommendations from the Basel Committee and the FSB will be examined by national authorities that will subsequently adopt new regulation. In a world with a global financial market, there are limits to how far a single country go it alone. International coordination is important for new regulations to have the intended effect. The crisis has opened a political window for tighter regulation of the financial system, but it is uncertain how long the window will remain open. 
BIS Review 162/2009 1 Ben S Bernanke: Frequently asked questions Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Economic Club of Washington DC, Washington DC, 7 December 2009.

Having faced the most serious financial crisis and the worst recession since the Great Depression, our economy has made important progress during the past year. Although the economic stress faced by many families and businesses remains intense, with job openings scarce and credit still hard to come by, the financial system and the economy have moved back from the brink of collapse, economic growth has returned, and the signs of recovery have become more widespread.  Understandably, in a situation as complicated as this one, people have many questions about the current situation and the path forward. Accordingly, taking inspiration from the ubiquitous frequently-asked-questions lists, or FAQs, on Internet websites, in my remarks today I’d like to address four important FAQs about the economy and the Federal Reserve. They are:  1. Where is the economy headed?  2. What has the Federal Reserve been doing to support the economy and the financial system?  3. Will the Federal Reserve’s actions lead to higher inflation down the road?  4. How can we avoid a similar crisis in the future?  Where is the economy headed? First, to understand where the economy might be headed, we should take a look at where it has been recently.1 A year ago, our economy – indeed, all of the world’s major economies – were reeling from the effects of a devastating financial crisis. Policymakers here and abroad had undertaken an extraordinary series of actions aimed at stabilizing the financial system and cushioning the economic impact of the crisis. Critically, these policy interventions succeeded in averting a global financial meltdown that could have plunged the world into a second Great Depression. But although a global economic cataclysm was avoided, the crisis nevertheless had widespread and severe economic consequences, including deep recessions in most of the world’s major economies. In the United States, the unemployment rate, which was as low as 4.4 percent in March 2007, currently stands at 10 percent.  Recently we have seen some pickup in economic activity, reflecting, in part, the waning of some forces that had been restraining the economy during the preceding several quarters. The collapse of final demand that accelerated in the latter part of 2008 left many firms with excessive inventories of unsold goods, which in turn led them to cut production and employment aggressively. This phenomenon was especially evident in the motor vehicle industry, where automakers, a number of whom were facing severe financial pressures, temporarily suspended production at many plants. By the middle of this year, however,                                                  1  For more discussion, see Ben S. Bernanke (2009), “On the Outlook for the Economy and Policy”, speech delivered at the Economic Club of New York, New York, N.Y., November 16.  
2 BIS Review 162/2009 inventories had been sufficiently reduced to encourage firms in a wide range of industries to begin increasing output again, contributing to the recent upturn in the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP).2  Although the working down of inventories has encouraged production, a sustainable recovery requires renewed growth in final sales. It is encouraging that we have begun to see some evidence of stronger demand for homes and consumer goods and services. In the housing sector, sales of new and existing homes have moved up appreciably over the course of this year, and prices have firmed a bit. Meanwhile, the inventory of unsold new homes has been shrinking. Reflecting these developments, homebuilders have somewhat increased the rate of new construction – a marked change from the steep declines that have characterized the past few years.  Consumer spending also has been rising since midyear. Part of this increase reflected a temporary surge in auto purchases that resulted from the “cash for clunkers” program, but spending in categories other than motor vehicles has increased as well. In the business sector, outlays for new equipment and software are showing tentative signs of stabilizing, and improving economic conditions abroad have buoyed the demand for U.S. exports.  Though we have begun to see some improvement in economic activity, we still have some way to go before we can be assured that the recovery will be self-sustaining. Also at issue is whether the recovery will be strong enough to create the large number of jobs that will be needed to materially bring down the unemployment rate. Economic forecasts are subject to great uncertainty, but my best guess at this point is that we will continue to see modest economic growth next year – sufficient to bring down the unemployment rate, but at a pace slower than we would like.  A number of factors support the view that the recovery will continue next year. Importantly, financial conditions continue to improve: Corporations are having relatively little difficulty raising funds in the bond and stock markets, stock prices and other asset values have recovered significantly from their lows, and a variety of indicators suggest that fears of systemic collapse have receded substantially. Monetary and fiscal policies are supportive. And I have already mentioned what appear to be improving conditions in housing, consumer expenditure, business investment, and global economic activity.  On the other hand, the economy confronts some formidable headwinds that seem likely to keep the pace of expansion moderate. Despite the general improvement in financial conditions, credit remains tight for many borrowers, particularly bank-dependent borrowers such as households and small businesses. And the job market, though no longer contracting at the pace we saw in 2008 and earlier this year, remains weak. Household spending is unlikely to grow rapidly when people remain worried about job security and have limited access to credit.  Inflation is affected by a number of crosscurrents. High rates of resource slack are contributing to a slowing in underlying wage and price trends, and longer-run inflation expectations are stable. Commodities prices have risen lately, likely reflecting the pickup in global economic activity and the depreciation of the dollar. Although we will continue to monitor inflation closely, on net it appears likely to remain subdued for some time.                                                   2  The three-month diffusion index for manufacturing – a measure of the breadth of production changes across industry categories – stood at 63.8 percent in September. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), Statistical Release G.17, “Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization”, Table 6: Diffusion Indexes of Industrial Production (November 17). 
BIS Review 162/2009 3 What has the Federal Reserve been doing to support the economy and the financial system? The discussion of where the economy is headed brings us to our second question: What has the Federal Reserve been doing to support the economy and the financial system?  The Federal Reserve has been, and still is, doing a great deal to foster financial stability and to spur recovery in jobs and economic activity.3 Notably, we began the process of easing monetary policy in September 2007, shortly after the crisis began. By mid-December 2008, our target rate was effectively as low as it could go – within a range of 0 to 1/4 percent, compared with 5-1/4 percent before the crisis – and we have maintained that very low rate for the past year.  Our efforts to support the economy have gone well beyond conventional monetary policy, however. I have already alluded to the Federal Reserve’s close cooperation with the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and other domestic and foreign authorities in a concerted and ultimately successful effort to stabilize the global banking system, which verged on collapse following the extraordinary events of September and October 2008. We subsequently took strong measures, independently or in conjunction with other agencies, to help normalize key financial institutions and credit markets disrupted by the crisis. Among these were the money market mutual fund industry, in which large numbers of American households, businesses, and municipalities make short-term investments; and the commercial paper market, which many firms tap to finance their day-to-day operations. We also established and subsequently expanded special arrangements with other central banks to provide dollars to global funding markets, as we found that disruptions in dollar-based markets abroad were spilling over to our own markets.  More recently, we have played an important part in helping to re-start the markets for asset-backed securities that finance auto loans, credit card loans, small business loans, student loans, loans to finance commercial real estate, and other types of credit. By working to revive these markets, which allow banks to tap the broader securities markets to finance their lending, we have helped banks make room on their balance sheets for new credit to households and businesses. In addition, we have supported the overall functioning of private credit markets and helped to lower interest rates on bonds, mortgages, and other loans by purchasing unprecedented volumes of mortgage-related securities and Treasury debt.  In all of these efforts, our objective has not been to support specific financial institutions or markets for their own sake. Rather, recognizing that a healthy economy requires well-functioning financial markets, we have moved always with the single aim of promoting economic recovery and economic opportunity. In that respect, our means and goals have been fully consistent with the traditional functions of a central bank and with the mandate given to the Federal Reserve by the Congress to promote price stability and maximum employment.  In addition to easing monetary policy and acting to stabilize financial markets, we have worked in our role as a bank supervisor to encourage bank lending. In November 2008 we joined with other banking regulators to urge banks to continue lending to creditworthy borrowers – to the benefit of both the economy and the banks – and we have recently provided guidelines to banks for working constructively with troubled commercial real estate loans.4 This spring, we led a coordinated, comprehensive examination of 19 of the country’s                                                  3  See Ben S. Bernanke (2009), “Reflections on a Year of Crisis”, speech delivered at ”Financial Stability and Macroeconomic Policy”, a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 20–22. 4  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift Supervision (2008), “Interagency Statement on Meeting the Needs of Creditworthy Borrowers”, joint press release, November 12, ; and Board of Governors of the Federal 
4 BIS Review 162/2009 largest banks, an exercise formally known as the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or SCAP, but more informally as the “stress test”. This assessment was designed to ensure that these banks, which collectively hold about two-thirds of the assets of the banking system, would remain well capitalized and able to lend to creditworthy borrowers even if economic conditions turned out to be even worse than expected. The release of the assessment results in May provided sorely needed clarity about the banks’ condition and marked a turning point in the restoration of confidence in our banking system.5 In the months since then, and with the strong encouragement of the federal banking supervisors, many of these largest institutions have raised billions of dollars in new capital, improving their ability to withstand possible future losses and to extend loans as demand for credit recovers. Meanwhile, we have also continued our efforts to ensure fair treatment for the customers of financial firms. During the past year and a half, we have comprehensively overhauled the regulations protecting mortgage borrowers, credit card holders, and users of overdraft protection plans, among others.  In navigating through the crisis, the Federal Reserve has been greatly aided by the regional structure established by the Congress when it created the Federal Reserve in 1913. The more than 270 business people, bankers, nonprofit executives, academics, and community, agricultural, and labor leaders who serve on the boards of the 12 Reserve Banks and their 24 Branches provide valuable insights into current economic and financial conditions that statistics alone cannot. Thus, the structure of the Federal Reserve ensures that our policymaking is informed not just by a Washington perspective, or a Wall Street perspective, but also a Main Street perspective. Indeed, our Reserve Banks and Branches have deep roots in the nation’s communities and do much good work there. They have, to give just a couple of examples, assisted organizations specializing in foreclosure mitigation and worked with nonprofit groups to help stabilize neighborhoods hit by high rates of foreclosure. They (as well as the Board) are also much involved in financial and economic education, helping people to make better financial decisions and to better understand how the economy works.  All told, the Federal Reserve’s actions – in combination with those of other policymakers here and abroad – have helped restore financial stability and pull the economy back from the brink. Because of our programs, auto buyers have obtained loans they would not have otherwise obtained, college students are financing their educations through credit they otherwise likely would not have received, and home buyers have secured mortgages on more affordable and sustainable terms than they would have otherwise. These improvements in credit conditions in turn are supporting a broader economic recovery.  Will the Federal Reserve’s actions lead to higher inflation down the road? The scope and scale of our actions, however, while necessary and helpful in my view, have left some uneasy. In all, our asset purchases and lending have caused the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to more than double, from less than $900 billion before the crisis began to about $2.2 trillion today. Unprecedented balance sheet expansion and near-zero overnight interest rates raise our third frequently asked question: Will the Federal Reserve’s actions to combat the crisis lead to higher inflation down the road?  The answer is no; the Federal Reserve is committed to keeping inflation low and will be able to do so. In the near term, elevated unemployment and stable inflation expectations should                                                                                                                                                       Reserve System (2009), “Federal Reserve Adopts Policy Statement Supporting Prudent Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Loan Workouts”, press release, October 30. 5  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC Release Results of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program”, press release, May 7; and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “Federal Reserve Board Makes Announcement Regarding the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP)”, press release, November 9. 
BIS Review 162/2009 5 keep inflation subdued, and indeed, inflation could move lower from here. However, as the recovery strengthens, the time will come when it is appropriate to begin withdrawing the unprecedented monetary stimulus that is helping to support economic activity. For that reason, we have been giving careful thought to our exit strategy. We are confident that we have all the tools necessary to withdraw monetary stimulus in a timely and effective way.6  Indeed, our balance sheet is already beginning to adjust, because improving financial conditions are leading to substantially reduced use of our lending facilities. The balance sheet will also shrink over time as the mortgage-backed securities and other assets we hold mature or are prepaid. However, even if our balance sheet stays large for a while, we will be able to raise our target short-term interest rate – which is the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight – and thus tighten financial conditions appropriately.  Operationally, an important tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy will be the authority, granted to us by the Congress last year, to pay banks interest on balances they hold at the Federal Reserve. When the time comes to raise short-term interest rates and thereby tighten policy, we can do so by raising the rate that we offer banks on their balances with us. Banks will be unwilling to make overnight loans to each other at a rate lower than the rate that they can earn risk-free from the Fed, and so the interest rate we pay on banks’ balances will tend to set a floor below our target overnight loan rate and other short-term interest rates.  Additional upward pressure on short-term interest rates can be achieved by measures to reduce the supply of funds that banks have available to lend to each other. We have a number of tools to accomplish this. For example, through the use of a short-term funding method known as reverse repurchase agreements, we can act directly to reduce the quantity of reserves held by the banking system. By paying a slightly higher rate of interest, we could induce banks to lock up their balances in longer-term accounts with us, making those balances unavailable for lending in the overnight market. And, if necessary, we always have the option of reducing the size of our balance sheet by selling some of our securities holdings on the open market.  As always, the most difficult challenge for the Federal Open Market Committee will not be devising the technical means of unwinding monetary stimulus. Rather, it will be the challenge that faces central banks in every economic recovery, which is correctly judging the best time to tighten policy. Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, we will need to base our decision on our best forecast of how the economy will develop. As I said a few moments ago, we currently expect inflation to remain subdued for some time. It is also reassuring that longer-term inflation expectations appear stable. Nevertheless, we will keep a close eye on inflation risks and will do whatever is necessary to meet our mandate to foster both price stability and maximum employment.  How can we avoid a similar crisis in the future? As we at the Federal Reserve and others work to build on the progress already made toward securing a sustained economic recovery with price stability, we must also continue to address the weaknesses that led to the current crisis. Thus, our final question this afternoon is: How can we avoid a similar crisis in the future?7                                                   6  See Ben S.

6 BIS Review 162/2009 Although the sources of the crisis were extraordinarily complex and numerous, a fundamental cause was that many financial firms simply did not appreciate the risks they were taking. Their risk-management systems were inadequate and their capital and liquidity buffers insufficient. Unfortunately, neither the firms nor the regulators identified and remedied many of the weaknesses soon enough. Thus, all financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, must undertake unsparing self-assessments. At the Federal Reserve, we have extensively reviewed our performance and moved to strengthen our oversight of banks. Working cooperatively with other agencies, we are toughening our banking regulations to help constrain excessive risk-taking and enhance the ability of banks to withstand financial stress. For example, we have been among the leaders of international efforts, through organizations such as the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision, to increase the quantities of capital and liquidity that banks must hold. At home, we are implementing standards that require banking organizations to adopt compensation policies that link pay to the institutions’ long-term performance and avoid encouraging excessive risk-taking.  I mentioned the SCAP, otherwise known as the stress tests. We are applying the lessons learned in that exercise to reorient our approach to the supervision of large, interconnected banking organizations that are critical to the stability of the financial system. In particular, we are taking a more “macroprudential” approach, one that goes beyond supervisors’ traditional focus on the health of individual institutions and scrutinizes the interrelationships among firms and markets to better anticipate sources of financial contagion. To do that, we are expanding our use of the kind of simultaneous and comparative cross-firm examinations that we used to such good effect in the SCAP. The Federal Reserve’s ability to draw on a range of disciplines – using economists, market experts, accountants, and lawyers, in addition to bank examiners – was essential to the success of the SCAP, and a multidisciplinary approach will be a central feature of our supervision in the future. For example, we are complementing our traditional onsite examinations with enhanced off-site surveillance programs, under which multidisciplinary teams will combine supervisory information, firm-specific data analysis, and market-based indicators to identify problems that may affect one or more banking institutions.  Although regulators can do a great deal on their own to improve financial oversight, the Congress also must act to fix gaps and weaknesses in the structure of the regulatory system and, in so doing, address the very serious problem posed by firms perceived as “too big to fail”. No firm, by virtue of its size and complexity, should be permitted to hold the financial system, the economy, or the American taxpayer hostage. To eliminate that possibility, a number of steps are required.  First, all systemically important financial institutions, not only banks, should be subject to strong and comprehensive supervision on a consolidated, or firmwide, basis. Such institutions should be subject to tougher capital, liquidity, and risk-management requirements than other firms – both to reduce their chance of failing and to remove their incentive to grow simply in order to be perceived as too big to fail. Neither AIG, an insurance company, nor Bear Stearns, an investment firm, was subject to strong consolidated supervision. The Federal Reserve, as the regulator of bank holding companies, already supervises many of the largest and most complex institutions in the world. That experience, together with our broad knowledge of the financial markets, makes us well suited to serve as the consolidated supervisor for systemically important nonbank institutions as well. In addition, our involvement in supervision is critical for ensuring that we have the necessary expertise, information, and authorities to carry out our essential functions of promoting financial stability and making monetary policy.  Second, when a systemically important institution does approach failure, government policymakers must have an option other than a bailout or a disorderly, confidence-shattering bankruptcy. The Congress should create a new resolution regime, analogous to the regime currently used by the FDIC for failing banks, that would permit the government to wind down a troubled systemically important firm in a way that protects financial stability but that also 
BIS Review 162/2009 7 imposes losses on shareholders and creditors of the failed firm, without costs to the taxpayer. Imposing losses on creditors of troubled, systemically critical firms would help address the too-big-to-fail problem by restoring market discipline and leveling the playing field for smaller firms, while minimizing the disruptive effects of a failure on the financial system and the economy.  Third, our regulatory structure requires a better mechanism for monitoring and addressing emerging risks to the financial system as a whole. Because of the size, diversity, and complexity of our financial system, that task may exceed the capacity of any individual agency. The Federal Reserve therefore supports the creation of a systemic oversight council, made up of the principal financial regulators, to identify developments that may pose systemic risks, recommend approaches for dealing with them, and coordinate the responses of its member agencies.  Conclusion In closing, I will again note that in the fall of last year, the United States, indeed the world, confronted a financial crisis of a magnitude unseen for generations. Concerted actions by the Federal Reserve and other policymakers here and abroad helped avoid the worst outcomes. Nevertheless, the turmoil dealt a severe blow to our economy from which we have only recently begun to recover. The improvement in financial conditions this year and the resumption of growth over the summer offer the hope and expectation of continued recovery in the new year. However, significant headwinds remain, including tight credit conditions and a weak job market.  The Federal Reserve has been aggressive in its efforts to stabilize our financial system and to support economic activity. At some point, however, we will need to unwind our accommodative policies in order to avoid higher inflation in the future. I am confident we have both the tools and the commitment to make that adjustment when it is needed and in a manner consistent with our mandate to foster employment and price stability.  In the meantime, financial firms must do a better job of managing the risks of their business, regulators – the Federal Reserve included – must complete a thoroughgoing overhaul of their approach to supervision, and the Congress should move forward in making needed changes to our system of financial regulation to avoid a similar crisis in the future. In particular, we must solve the problem of “too big to fail”.  In sum, we have come a long way from the darkest period of the crisis, but we have some distance yet to go. In the midst of some of the toughest days, in October 2008, I said in a speech that I was confident that the American economy, with its great intrinsic vitality, would emerge from that period with renewed vigor.8 I remain equally confident today.                                                   8  See Ben S. Bernanke (2008), “Stabilizing the Financial Markets and the Economy”, speech delivered at the Economic Club of New York, New York, N.Y., October 15.
